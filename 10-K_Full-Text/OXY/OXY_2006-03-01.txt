Competition
and Sales and Marketing

As
a producer of crude oil and natural gas, Occidental competes with numerous other domestic and foreign private and government
producers. Crude oil and natural gas are commodities that are sensitive to prevailing global and, in certain cases, local conditions
of supply and demand and are sold at "spot" or contract prices or on futures markets to refiners and other market participants.
Occidental competes by developing and producing its worldwide oil and gas reserves cost-effectively and acquiring rights to explore
in areas with known oil and gas deposits. Occidental also competes by increasing production through enhanced oil recovery projects
in mature and underdeveloped fields and making strategic acquisitions. Occidental focuses on operations in its core areas of the
United States, the Middle East and Latin America.

PERATIONS

General

Occidental
manufactures and markets basic chemicals, vinyls, chlorinated organics and performance chemicals through various affiliates
(collectively, OxyChem). For additional information regarding Occidental’s chemical segment, see the information under the
caption "Chemical Segment" in the MD&A section of this report.

Products
and Properties

OxyChem
owns and operates chemical manufacturing plants at 24 sites in the United States. OxyChem has a 50-percent equity investment in a
Brazilian corporation that owns a chlor-alkali plant, a 50-percent equity investment in a corporation that produces antimony oxide
in Mexico and a 50-percent interest in a general partnership that produces liquid and anhydrous potassium carbonate products in
Alabama. OxyChem’s chlorine facilities in Delaware City, Delaware and Deer Park, Texas and its ethylene dichloride (EDC)
facility in Ingleside, Texas were permanently shut down in the third quarter of 2005. In December 2005, OxyChem announced that it
would permanently close its Alberta, Canada PVC manufacturing facility in the first quarter of 2006.

In 2005,
OxyChem acquired two operating chemical assets in Louisiana and Kansas from Vulcan Materials Company (Vulcan).

The
following information regarding production capacity reflects estimated annual capacity at December 31, 2005.

Basic
Chemicals

OxyChem’s
basic chemicals consist of chlorine and caustic soda, chlorinated organics, potassium chemicals and their derivatives.

Chlorine
is used for chemical manufacturing in the chlorovinyl chain and for water treatment. OxyChem produces chlorine in Alabama, Kansas,
Louisiana, New York, Texas, Brazil and Chile. Annual capacity was 3.6 million tons in the United States (including the gross
0.6-million-ton total annual capacity of the OxyVinyls partnership, owned 76 percent by Occidental and 24 percent by PolyOne
Corporation) and 0.3 million tons in Brazil and Chile.  The United States amount includes 0.8 million tons of capacity from the
Vulcan chemical assets.

Caustic
soda is used for pulp and paper production, alumina production and other chemical manufacturing. OxyChem produces caustic soda in
Kansas, Louisiana, New York, Texas, Brazil and Chile. Annual capacity was 3.9 million tons in the United States (including the gross
0.7-million-ton total annual capacity of the OxyVinyls partnership) and 0.4 million tons in Brazil and Chile. The United States
amount includes 0.8 million tons of capacity from the Vulcan chemical assets.

Potassium
chemicals are used in glass, fertilizers, cleaning products and rubber. OxyChem produces potassium chemicals in Alabama where annual
capacity was 328,000 tons.

EDC,
a chlorine derivative, is a raw material for vinyl chloride monomer (VCM). OxyChem produces EDC in Louisiana and Brazil. Annual
capacity was 2.1 billion pounds in the United States and 0.3 billion pounds in Brazil. The United States amount includes 0.6 billion
pounds of capacity from the Vulcan chemical assets.

OxyChem’s
acquisition of Vulcan’s chemical assets included certain chlorinated organic products that are used in silicones, paint
stripping, pharmaceuticals and refrigerants.

Vinyls

OxyChem
produces vinyls through its 76-percent interest in the OxyVinyls partnership. OxyChem’s vinyls products include polyvinyl
chloride (PVC) and its precursors, VCM and EDC.

OxyChem
produces VCM in Texas. Annual capacity was 6.2 billion pounds (consisting of the 2.4 billion-pound total annual capacity of OxyMar,
which is 88-percent owned by OxyChem, and the 3.8 billion-pound total annual gross capacity of the OxyVinyls partnership).

PVC
resins are used in piping, electrical insulation, external construction materials, flooring, medical and automotive products and
packaging. OxyChem produces PVC resins in Kentucky, New Jersey, Texas and Canada. Gross annual PVC capacity of the OxyVinyls
partnership was 4.3 billion pounds.

Performance
Chemicals

OxyChem’s
performance chemicals include chlorinated isocyanurates (estimated capacity of 131 million pounds produced in Illinois and
Louisiana), resorcinol (estimated capacity of 50 million pounds produced in Pennsylvania), mercaptans (estimated capacity of 18
million pounds produced in Texas) and sodium silicates (estimated capacity of 722,000 tons produced in Georgia, Ohio, Illinois, New
Jersey, Texas and Alabama).


Raw
Materials, Intellectual Property, Marketing and Competition

Nearly
all raw materials used in OxyChem’s operations are readily available from a variety of sources. Operations have not been
curtailed due to any supply interruptions, except for limited supply interruptions along the Gulf Coast, which occurred in September
and October 2005, caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.

OxyChem
does not regard its business as being materially dependent on any single patent, trademark or process.

OxyChem
sells its products to industrial users or distributors located in the United States and in certain export markets where third party
agents are utilized.

Occidental’s
chemical business competes with numerous producers. Since most of OxyChem’s products are commodities, it competes primarily on
the basis of price.

ISKS

Volatile
global commodity pricing fluctuations beyond Occidental’s control strongly affect its revenues, profitability, operating cash
flow and future growth rate.

As
discussed in the section entitled "Derivative Activities and Market Risk — Commodity Price Risk — Production Hedges,"
Occidental’s financial results typically correlate closely to the price it obtains for its products in the global markets in
which they compete. Oil and gas price changes also impact production and reserves because production-sharing contracts (PSCs)
typically include terms that adjust Occidental’s share of production when prices change, and price changes also affect the
profitability of production and the economic recoverability of reserves. Historically, prices for Occidental’s products have
been volatile. A significant portion of the oil Occidental produces is sour crude, and the prices for sour crude tend to be lower.
In addition, the price differential between sweet and sour crude varies based on their respective supply and demand
dynamics.

Drilling
and exploration activity levels, inventory levels, production disruptions, the actions of OPEC (increasing prices or limiting
Occidental's production), price speculation and geophysical and technical limitations affect the global and, in some cases, local
short-term and long-term supply of oil and gas and interact to contribute to price volatility. Because of the long lead times
associated with drilling and exploration projects, Occidental may commit significant amounts of capital to oil and gas projects and
cannot be certain of the level of demand that will exist when it finishes a project. The health of the global economy, alternative
sources of energy, such as coal, and efforts at improving or implementing efficient consumption can also affect the demand for oil
and gas.

Demand
for Occidental’s chemical products correlates most strongly with the health of the global economy.  Occidental also depends on
feedstocks and energy to produce chemicals, both of which are commodities subject to significant price fluctuations.

Occidental’s
businesses operate in a highly competitive environment, which affects its profitability and its ability to grow production and
replace oil and gas reserves.

Occidental’s
future oil and gas production and its profitability depend, in part, on its ability to acquire or find additional reserves at costs
below the price at which it can sell the oil and gas it produces from them, after operating costs. Occidental can acquire reserves
by purchasing existing production assets or by acquiring exploration rights and successfully drilling wells that produce
hydrocarbons in commercial quantities. Industry competition for reserves may influence Occidental to:

Ø

shift toward
      higher risk exploration activity;


Ø

pay more for
      reinvestment opportunities;

Ø

purchase
      lesser quality properties; or

Ø

delay
      expected production activities.

Rising
exploration and development activity in the industry generally increases the demand and, therefore, the costs of oil and gas
services.

Participants
in the chemical industry compete primarily based on price and the industry consists of many domestic and foreign competitors. In
addition, the industry has historically experienced over-expansion when prices rise.

In
both industries, Occidental uses nonproprietary technology and business management techniques, which limits its ability to achieve
significant comparative production efficiencies.

Occidental’s
businesses may experience catastrophic occurrences.

Natural
disasters, such as hurricanes, occur regularly and may occasionally affect Occidental’s businesses. In addition, well blowouts
and oilfield fires, armed conflicts, civil unrest and industrial accidents may occur and may affect Occidental’s businesses.
Occidental maintains insurance against a number of these risks; however, it partially self-insures and insurance may not always
provide the coverage expected or desired due to contractual limitations, unavailability, cost of insurance and the insurers'
financial health.

Varied
governmental and political actions affect Occidental’s results of operations.

The
transnational character of Occidental’s oil and gas business subjects it to the decisions of many governments and political
interests. As a result, Occidental faces increased risks of:

Ø

changes in
      laws and regulations, including those related to taxes, royalty rates, permitted production rates, import, export and use of
      products, and environmental protection;

Ø

expropriation
      or reduction of entitlements to produce hydrocarbons; and

Ø

refusal to
      extend exploration, production or development contracts.

For
example, the Government of Ecuador has threatened to terminate Occidental’s Participation Contract for Block 15. See
”MD&A — Oil and Gas Segment — Business Review — Latin America — Ecuador.” When Occidental acquired
Vintage Petroleum, Inc. (Vintage) at the end of January 2006, it gained operations in Argentina and Bolivia. Beginning in 2001,
Argentina increased export taxes on oil and implemented stricter foreign exchange controls, mandatory export proceeds repatriation
laws, export limitations and domestic sales price caps, some of which have since expired. In 2005, Bolivia approved a hydrocarbons
bill that introduced a significant new production tax. Actions such as these may affect Occidental’s results of operations,
financial position or the quantity of its oil and gas reserves.

Occidental
operates some of its oil and gas business in countries that occasionally have experienced political instability, which increases
Occidental’s risk of loss or delayed production associated with armed conflict, civil unrest, security problems, restrictions
on production equipment imports and sanctions that prevent continued operations. Occidental may face the risk of increased costs if
it is perceived not to be respecting or advancing the economic and social progress of the communities in which it operates. Since
Occidental’s assets are long-lived, the magnitude of these risks can vary over the time it operates in a country.

Occidental
faces risks associated with its mergers, acquisitions and divestitures.

Occidental
periodically acquires and divests oil and gas reserves and chemical facilities. These activities carry risks that Occidental
may:

Additionally,
the assets Occidental acquires may not be as profitable as its current asset base.

Certain
of Occidental’s major chemical products are coproduced in a fixed ratio, which limits its ability to exploit pricing
opportunities.

Because
chlorine and caustic soda must be produced together in a fixed ratio, an imbalance in demand between the products ultimately
requires Occidental to reduce output or cut prices to restore demand balance. Either action limits Occidental’s profits on
these commodities.

Technological
developments may reduce the demand for oil and gas.

Rising
oil and gas prices create incentives to find alternative energy sources and energy conservation measures that could replace or
reduce oil and gas consumption over the long term.


I

NTERNAL

R

ISKS

Occidental
may incur significant costs in exploration or development efforts, which may prove unsuccessful or unprofitable.

Occidental
may misinterpret geologic or engineering data, which may result in significant losses on unsuccessful exploration or development
drilling efforts.

Occidental
bears the risks of project delays and cost overruns due to unexpected geologic conditions, equipment failures, equipment delivery
delays, accidents, adverse weather, government and joint venture partner approval delays, construction or start-up delays and other
associated risks. Such risks may delay expected production and/or increase the costs of production.

Inadequate
cost containment could reduce Occidental’s competitiveness.

Occidental
works to minimize the costs associated with its businesses but the impact of its efforts may not be sufficient to offset any
negative effects related to the main elements of cost, which consist of reserve acquisition costs for oil and gas and feedstock and
energy costs for chemicals.

The
OxyVinyls partnership is engaged in voluntary discussions with federal, state and local environmental agencies with jurisdiction
over four of its manufacturing facilities in an effort to reach an agreement to reduce VCM emissions and to resolve disputed
administrative claims and allegations of past or ongoing environmental violations at those facilities, some of which claims allege
penalties in excess of $100,000. OxyVinyls initiated discussions with the agencies following the successful conclusion of a similar
agreement relating to an affiliate's former PVC manufacturing facility in Pottstown, Pennsylvania. If any agreement to reduce
emissions and resolve the claims and allegations were reached, Occidental believes it would require the payment of penalties, or the
performance of supplemental environmental projects, exceeding a total cost of $100,000. Occidental does not expect the resolution of
this matter to have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations.

331,476 additional stockholders whose shares were held for them in street name or nominee accounts. The common stock is listed and
traded principally on the New York Stock Exchange.  The quarterly financial data, which are included in this report after the "Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements," set forth the range of trading prices for the common stock as reported on the composite
tape of the New York Stock Exchange and quarterly dividend information.

In
2005, the quarterly declared dividend rate for the common stock was $0.31 per share for the first three quarters of 2005 and $0.36
for the fourth quarter of 2005 ($1.29 for the year). On February 16, 2006, a quarterly dividend of $0.36 per share ($1.44 per year)
was declared on the common stock, payable on April 15, 2006 to stockholders of record on March 10, 2006. The declaration of future
cash dividends is a business decision made by the Board of Directors from time to time, and will depend on Occidental’s
financial condition and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.

Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) (Incorporating Item 7A)

In
this report, the term "Occidental" refers to Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OPC) and/or one or more entities in which it owns a
majority voting interest (subsidiaries). Occidental is divided into two segments: oil and gas and chemical.

S

TRATEGY

General

Occidental
aims to generate competitive total returns to stockholders using the following strategy:

Ø

Focus on
      large, long-lived oil and gas assets with long-term growth potential;

Ø

Maintain
      financial discipline and a strong balance sheet; and

Ø

Manage the
      chemical segment to provide cash in excess of normal capital expenditures.

Occidental
prefers to own large, long-lived "legacy" oil and gas assets, like those in California and the Permian Basin, that tend to have
moderate decline rates, enhanced secondary and tertiary recovery opportunities and economies of scale that lead to cost-effective
production. Management expects such assets to contribute substantial earnings and cash flow after invested capital.

At
Occidental, maintaining financial discipline means investing capital in projects that management expects will generate
above-cost-of-capital returns throughout the business cycle. During periods of high commodity prices, Occidental expects to use most
of its cash flow after capital expenditures and dividends to improve future earnings by making such investments.


The
chemical business is not managed with a growth strategy. Capital is expended to operate the chemical business in a safe and
environmentally sound way, to sustain production capacity and to focus on projects designed to lower manufacturing costs. Asset
acquisitions may be pursued when they are expected to enhance the existing core chlor-alkali and PVC businesses. Historically, the
chemical segment has generated cash flow exceeding its normal capital expenditure requirements. Occidental intends to invest this
cash mainly in strategically attractive assets. As part of Occidental's strategy to grow its oil and gas business, any excess cash
generated by the chemical segment may be used as part of the overall funding for oil and gas growth.

Oil
and Gas

Segment
Income

($
millions)

The
oil and gas business seeks to add new oil and natural gas reserves at a pace ahead of production while keeping costs incurred for
finding and development among the lowest in the industry. The oil and gas business implements this strategy within the limits of the
overall corporate strategy primarily by:

Ø

Continuing to
      add commercial reserves through a combination of focused exploration and development programs conducted in and around
      Occidental’s core areas, which are the United States, the Middle East/North Africa and Latin America;

Ø

Pursuing
      commercial opportunities in core areas to enhance the development of mature fields with large volumes of remaining oil by
      applying appropriate technology and advanced reservoir-management practices; and

Ø

Maintaining a
      disciplined approach in buying and selling assets at attractive prices.

Over
the past several years, Occidental has strengthened its asset base within each of the core areas. Occidental has invested in, and
disposed of, assets with the goal of raising the average performance and potential of its assets. See "Oil and Gas Segment —
Business Review" for a discussion of these changes.

In
addition, Occidental has made acquisitions and investments in the Dolphin Project in Qatar and the UAE, re-entered Libya and assumed
operations in the Mukhaizna field in Oman for future growth opportunities, not for current production.

Occidental’s
overall performance during the past several years reflects the successful implementation of its strategy to enhance the development
of mature fields, beginning with the acquisition of the Elk Hills oil and gas field in California followed by a series of purchases
in the Permian Basin in west Texas and New Mexico.

At
the end of 2005, the Elk Hills and Permian Basin assets made up 70 percent of Occidental’s consolidated proven oil reserves and
45 percent of its consolidated proven gas reserves. On a barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) basis, they accounted for 64 percent of
Occidental’s consolidated reserves. In 2005, the combined production from these assets averaged approximately 279,000 BOE per
day, which represents approximately 49 percent of Occidental’s total worldwide production. These assets also contributed
approximately 48 percent of oil and gas segment earnings.

Chemical

Segment
Income

($
millions)

OxyChem's
strategy is to be a low-cost producer so that it can maximize its cash flow generation. OxyChem concentrates on the chlorovinyls
chain where it begins with chlorine, which is coproduced with caustic soda, and then converts chlorine and ethylene, through a
series of intermediate products, into PVC. OxyChem's focus on chlorovinyls permits it to take advantage of economies of
scale.

Key
Performance Indicators

General

Occidental
seeks to ensure that it meets its strategic goals by continuously measuring its success in maintaining below average debt levels and
top quartile performance compared to its peers in:

Ø

Total return
      to stockholders;

Ø

Return on
      equity;

Ø

Return on
      capital employed; and


Ø

Other
      segment-specific measurements such as profit per unit produced, cost to produce each unit, cash flow per unit, cost to find
      and develop new reserves, reserve replacement percentage and other similar measures.

Debt

Occidental's
total debt and total debt-to-capitalization ratios are shown in the table below:

(a)

Includes
      trust preferred securities (redeemed January 20, 2004), natural gas delivery commitment (terminated in 2002), subsidiary
      preferred stock and capital lease obligations.

As
shown, Occidental’s year-end 2005 total debt-to-capitalization ratio declined to 17 percent from the 46-percent level that
existed at the end of 2001. The decrease in the total debt-to-capitalization ratio in 2005 compared with 2001 resulted from total
debt reductions of 38 percent combined with an increase in stockholders' equity of 167 percent over the same period.

Environment

Oil
and gas prices are the major variables that drive the industry’s financial performance. Oil prices strengthened in 2005 over
2004 levels. During the year, Occidental experienced an increase in its price differential between the average West Texas
Intermediate (WTI) price and Occidental's realized prices. However, Occidental’s realized price as a percentage of WTI was 85
percent for both years. Prices and differentials can vary significantly, even on a short-term basis, making forecasting realized
prices difficult. The average WTI market price for 2005 was $56.56 per barrel compared with $41.40 per barrel in 2004. Occidental's
average realized price for oil in 2005 was $48.20, compared with $35.09 in 2004.

Average
NYMEX domestic natural gas prices increased approximately 37 percent from 2004. For 2005, NYMEX gas prices averaged $8.11/Mcf
compared with $5.92/Mcf for 2004.

Business
Review

All
production and reserve figures are net to Occidental unless otherwise specified.

Worldwide
Production

(thousands
BOE/day)

Elk
Hills

Occidental
operates the Elk Hills oil and gas field in the southern portion of California’s San Joaquin Valley with an approximate
78-percent interest. The field was acquired in 1998 for $3.5 billion and is the largest producer of gas in California. Oil and gas
production in 2005 was approximately 90,000 BOE per day. During 2005, Occidental performed infill drilling, field extensions and
recompletions identified by advanced reservoir characterization techniques. A record 291 new wells were drilled and 548 wells were
worked over. In addition, a successful CO


pilot was completed during the year. As a result of these activities,
Occidental was able to maintain production at 2004 levels. Since its acquisition, total Elk Hills oil and gas production has been
approximately 268 million BOE. At the end of 2005, the property had an estimated 505 million BOE of proved reserves, compared to the
425 million BOE that were recorded at the time of the acquisition.

Permian
Basin

The
Permian Basin extends throughout southwest Texas and southeast New Mexico and is one of the largest and most active oil basins in
the United States, with the entire basin accounting for approximately 18 percent of total United States oil production. Occidental
is the largest producer in the Permian Basin with an approximately 16 percent net share of the total Permian Basin oil production.
Occidental also produces and processes natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) in the Permian Basin.

Most
of Occidental's Permian Basin interests were obtained through the acquisition of Altura in 2000 for approximately $3.6
billion.

In
2005, Occidental made several additional acquisitions of oil and gas producing property interests for approximately $1.7 billion.
This was partially offset by cash proceeds totaling $171 million from dispositions of a portion of the acquired
properties.


Occidental's
total share of Permian Basin oil, gas and NGL production averaged 189,000 BOE per day in 2005 compared to 175,000 BOE per day in
2004. At the end of 2005, Occidental's Permian Basin properties had 1.2 billion BOE in proved reserves. Occidental's Permian Basin
production is diversified across a large number of producing areas. The largest producing areas in 2005 included Wasson San Andres,
Slaughter, Levelland, North Cowden and Wasson Clearfork, which contributed 20 percent, 10 percent, 5 percent, 5 percent and 4
percent, respectively, to Occidental’s 2005 Permian BOE production.

Occidental’s
interests in the Permian Basin offer additional development and exploitation potential. During 2005, Occidental drilled
approximately 250 wells on its operated properties and participated in wells drilled on outside operated interests. Occidental
conducted significant development activity on five CO


projects during 2005, including implementation of new floods and
expansion of existing CO


floods. Occidental also focused on improving performance of existing wells. Occidental had an
average of 105 well service units working in the Permian area during 2005 performing well maintenance and workovers.

Approximately
60 percent of Occidental’s Permian Basin oil production is from fields that actively employ the application of carbon dioxide
(CO


) flood technology, an enhanced oil recovery technique. This involves injecting CO


into oil reservoirs
where it acts as a solvent, causing the oil to flow more freely into producing wells. The size of these CO


flood
operations makes Occidental a world leader in the application of this technology.

THUMS

Occidental
purchased THUMS, the field contractor for an oil production unit offshore Long Beach, California, in 2000. Occidental's share of
production from THUMS is subject to contractual arrangements similar to a PSC, whereby Occidental's share of production varies
inversely with oil prices. For 2005, production from THUMS averaged 18,000 barrels per day.

Gulf
of Mexico

Occidental
has a one-third interest in the deep-water Horn Mountain oil field, which is Occidental's only asset in the Gulf of Mexico. BP
p.l.c. (BP) is the operator. For 2005, Occidental's production at Horn Mountain averaged 14,000 BOE per day. In the second half of
2005, the Horn Mountain field was shut down for about 47 days due to the impact of the hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.

Hugoton
and Other

Occidental
owns other oil and gas interests including a large concentration of gas reserves, production interests and royalty interests in the
Hugoton area of Kansas and Oklahoma. The Hugoton field is the largest natural gas field discovered in North America.
Occidental’s Hugoton and other operations produced 133 MMcf of natural gas per day and 3,000 barrels of oil per day in
2005.

Occidental
has over 28,000 net acres in the Piceance Basin in western Colorado. During 2004 and 2005, Occidental drilled 30 development wells,
installed a 50 MMcf per day gas processing facility and the infrastructure required for future field development. Occidental has
acquired seismic data covering 34 square miles of the Cascade Creek field.

Acquisition
of Vintage Petroleum

In
January 2006, Occidental completed the merger of Vintage Petroleum, Inc. (Vintage) into a wholly-owned Occidental subsidiary.
Occidental acquired producing assets in Argentina, the United States, Yemen and Bolivia. The Argentine assets consist of 22
concessions, 19 of which Occidental will operate, located in the San Jorge Basin in Southern Argentina and the Cuyo Basin in western
Argentina. Occidental paid $1.4 billion to former Vintage shareholders for the cash portion of the merger consideration and issued
28 million shares for the stock portion, which was valued at $2.1 billion. The value of Occidental’s shares was determined by
the average share price for the five-day period beginning two days before the acquisition announcement. In addition, Occidental
assumed Vintage’s debt, which had an estimated fair market value of $585 million at closing. Occidental intends to divest a
portion of these assets.

Middle
East / North Africa

Dolphin Project

Occidental's
investment in the Dolphin Project, which was acquired in 2002, consists of two separate economic interests held through two separate
legal entities. One entity, OXY Dolphin E&P, LLC, owns a 24.5-percent undivided interest in the assets and liabilities
associated with a Development and Production Sharing Agreement (DPSA) with the Government of Qatar to develop and produce natural
gas and condensate in Qatar’s North Field for 25 years from the start of production, with a provision to request a 5-year
extension. The purchase price of the undivided working interest in the DPSA was approximately $60 million and was recorded in
Property, Plant & Equipment. This undivided interest is proportionately consolidated in Occidental's financial
statements.

A
second entity, OXY Dolphin Pipeline, LLC, owns 24.5 percent of the stock of Dolphin Energy Limited (Dolphin Energy). The purchase
price of Dolphin Energy stock totaled approximately $250 million and was recorded as an equity investment.

Dolphin
Energy is the operator under the DPSA on behalf of the three DPSA contractors, including Occidental. Dolphin Energy also has the
rights to build, own and operate a 260-mile-long, 48-inch natural gas pipeline, which will transport dry natural gas from Qatar to
the UAE.

The
Dolphin Project is expected to cost approximately $4.0 billion in total. Occidental expects to invest approximately $1 billion of
this total. The project will be financed by a combination of participant investment and project financing. During 2006, Occidental
expects to spend a combined total of approximately $430 million for the gas exploration and


development
activity and the investment in Dolphin Energy, compared to $380 million in 2005.

In
2003, the Government of Qatar approved the final field development plan for the Dolphin Project. Construction of a gas processing
and compression plant at Ras Laffan in Qatar, as well as two offshore gas production platforms, commenced in 2004 and is continuing.
The projected start-up date for production is late 2006.

Based
on existing supply contracts, the Dolphin Project is expected to export approximately 2 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas per
day (plus associated liquids and byproducts). However, the pipeline is expected to have capacity to transport up to 3.2 Bcf of
natural gas per day. Demand for natural gas in the UAE and Oman continues to grow and Dolphin Energy’s customers have requested
additional gas supplies. To help fulfill this growing demand, Dolphin Energy will pursue an agreement to secure an additional supply
of gas from Qatar.

To
date, Occidental has recorded 250 million BOE of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves for the Dolphin Project DPSA activity. No
revenue or production costs were recorded in 2005 for the Dolphin Project gas exploration and development activity.

Qatar

In
addition to the Dolphin Project, Occidental participates in two production projects in Qatar: Idd El Shargi North Dome (ISND) and
Idd El Shargi South Dome (ISSD). Occidental is nearing completion of Phase II of full field development of ISND and is in the
process of developing the ISSD field.

Occidental
expects to continue increasing production and recoverable reserves under its existing agreement in the ISND field. Phase II is
targeting the development and recovery of additional reserves by applying advanced drilling systems and improved reservoir
characterization techniques. Capital expenditures in Qatar for the ISSD and ISND projects were $343 million in 2005 and are expected
to be $268 million in 2006.

Occidental’s
net share of combined production from the two fields averaged 42,000 barrels per day in 2005.

Yemen

In
Yemen, Occidental owns a 38 percent direct-working interest in the Masila field in Block 14 and a 40.4-percent interest in the East
Shabwa field, comprising a 28.6-percent direct-working interest and an 11.8-percent equity interest in an unconsolidated entity.
Occidental’s production averaged 28,000 barrels of oil per day in 2005, with 24,000 coming from the Masila field and the
remainder from East Shabwa. In addition, Occidental is the operator of Block 20, where it owns an 80-percent working
interest.

In
July 2005, Occidental was the successful bidder for Block 75 in Yemen’s exploration bid round and has been invited to finalize
a PSC for the block.

Oman

Occidental's
Oman business includes Block 9 and Block 27, where it holds a 65-percent working interest in each, and Block 53, where it holds a
45-percent working interest. Occidental is the operator of all three blocks where production averaged 24,000 BOE per day in 2005,
with 23,000 BOE coming from Block 9 and the remainder from Block 53. The Block 9 agreement provides for two ten-year extensions and
Occidental has agreed with the Government of Oman to the first ten-year extension through December 7, 2015.

In
March 2004, Occidental began selling gas to the Government of Oman under a gas sales agreement, thereby allowing Occidental to
produce previously stranded gas and condensates from Block 9. Under the agreement, Occidental (and its Block 9 partner) must supply
approximately 114 MMcf per day of natural gas until December 31, 2007. Thereafter, Occidental will nominate quantities that it has
available for delivery. In 2005, Occidental (and its partner) supplied an average of approximately 116 MMcf per day of natural gas
to the Government under the gas sales agreement. The minimum gross quantities to be delivered under the gas sales agreement through
December 31, 2007 represent approximately 93 percent of the expected average gross production of gas from Block 9 during that
period. As of December 31, 2005, the gross proved gas reserves from Block 9 are approximately 373 percent of the total minimum of
gas that remains to be delivered under the gas sales agreement.

In
October 2005, Occidental received approval for development of the Khamilah field in Block 27. The exploitation term of the agreement
is 30 years beginning in September 2005. Occidental plans to develop the reserves and commence production in Block 27 through
capital-efficient investment and exploration.

Occidental
(and its Block 53 partners) signed a new PSC for the Mukhaizna field with the Government of the Sultanate of Oman in July 2005. On
September 1, 2005, Occidental assumed operations of the Mukhaizna field, where it holds a 45-percent working interest. The Mukhaizna
field, located in Oman’s south central interior, was discovered in 1975 and was brought into production in 2000. Primary
production peaked in the same year at 15,000 barrels of oil per day and by September 2005, had declined to 8,500 barrels of oil per
day. Occidental plans to use horizontal well steamflood technology to steadily increase production.

Libya

Occidental
suspended all activities in Libya in 1986 as a result of economic sanctions imposed by the United States government. During the
imposition of sanctions, Occidental derived no economic benefit from its Libyan interests. In 2004, the United States government
lifted all of the principal economic sanctions against Libya. However, Libya continues to be designated as a country supporting
international terrorism under section 6(j) of the United States Export Administration Act and, as such, continues to be subject to
certain limited sanctions.


On
August 11, 2005, the Libyan authorities approved the terms of Occidental’s participation in the assets that it left in 1986,
effective as of July 1, 2005. The agreement allows Occidental to return to its Libyan operations on generally the same terms in
effect when activities were suspended. Those assets consist of three producing contracts in the Sirte Basin and four exploration
blocks. Occidental paid approximately $133 million in re-entry bonuses, capital adjustment and work-in-progress payments and is
required to pay $10 million per year while it continues to operate in Libya, as reimbursements for past development costs associated
with the historical assets. In addition, Occidental committed to spend $90 million over the next five years in the four exploration
blocks. Currently, Occidental’s rights in the producing fields extend through 2009 and early 2010. Occidental had its first
lifting from its Libyan operations in late September and production during the fourth quarter of 2005 averaged 24,000 BOE per
day.

Separately,
in early 2005, Occidental participated in the EPSA IV exploration bid round in Libya. Occidental successfully bid on nine of the 15
areas available. Occidental is the operator for five onshore areas and has a 90-percent exploration working interest. In addition,
Occidental holds a 35-percent exploration working interest in four offshore areas. Woodside Petroleum Ltd. is the operator for the
offshore areas. Occidental paid approximately $90 million in exploration lease bonuses for these nine new areas and committed to
spend an additional $125 million over the next five years.

Other
Eastern Hemisphere

Pakistan

Occidental
holds oil and gas working interests, that vary from 25 to 50 percent, in four Badin Blocks in Pakistan. BP is the operator.
Occidental’s share of production was approximately 18,000 BOE per day in 2005.

Russia

In
Russia, Occidental owns 50 percent of a joint venture company, Vanyoganneft, that operates in the western Siberian oil basin.
Production for 2005 was approximately 28,000 BOE per day.

Latin
America

Colombia

Occidental
is the operator of the Caño Limón field with a 35-percent share of production, declining to 33.6 percent by mid-2006 and
31.5 percent by 2009. In mid-2006, if WTI exceeds $30 per barrel, Occidental’s share of production will decline an additional
amount based on a sliding scale. Occidental's share of 2005 production averaged 32,000 barrels of oil per day. Colombia's national
oil company, Ecopetrol, operates the Caño Limón-Coveñas oil pipeline and marine-export terminal. The pipeline
transports oil produced from the Caño Limón field for export to international markets.

In
September 2005, Occidental signed a new agreement with Ecopetrol for an enhanced oil recovery project in the La Cira-Infantas field,
located in central Colombia. If conditions warrant, upon completion of the two pilot phases, Occidental will earn a 48 percent net
share of production upon further development.

In
November 2005, Ecopetrol approved development of the Caricare field, an exploration discovery under the Rondon Association Contract,
adjacent to Caño Limón. Production from this field, where Occidental holds a 35-percent working interest, is expected to
commence in May 2006.

Occidental
holds various working interests in two additional exploration blocks.

Ecuador

Occidental
operates Block 15 in Ecuador in which it holds a 60-percent economic interest. Although Occidental holds legal title to 100 percent
of the Block 15 Participation Contract, it farmed out 40 percent of its economic interest related to Block 15 in 2000. Occidental's
share of production averaged approximately 42,000 barrels of oil per day in 2005. In addition, Occidental has a 14-percent interest
in the Oleoducto de Crudos Pesados Ltd. (OCP) oil export pipeline.

Development
of existing fields, primarily Eden-Yuturi and the Indillana Complex, continued through 2005. Drilling and the installation of new
wells nearly offset the natural decline of existing wells.

Foreign
oil companies, including Occidental, have been paying a Value Added Tax (VAT), generally calculated on the basis of 10 to 12 percent
of expenditures for goods and services used in the production of oil for export. Until 2001, oil companies, like other companies
producing products for export, filed for and received reimbursement of VAT. In 2001, the Ecuador tax authority announced that the
oil companies’ VAT payments did not qualify for reimbursement. In 2002, Occidental initiated an international arbitration
proceeding against the Ecuadorian Government under the United States-Ecuador bilateral investment treaty based on Occidental’s
belief that the Ecuadorian Government is arbitrarily and discriminatorily refusing to refund the VAT to Occidental. In July 2004, a
tribunal of international arbitrators awarded Occidental compensation for VAT refunds from Occidental's Block 15 operations that
were withheld by the Ecuadorian Government and indicated that similar VAT refunds should be paid going forward. The Ecuadorian
Government has appealed the tribunal's decision and the appeals proceedings continue at present. In the event of an unfavorable
outcome, the potential effect on Occidental's financial statements would not be material.

In
September 2004, Occidental received formal notification that Petroecuador, the state oil company of Ecuador, was initiating
proceedings to determine if Occidental had violated either its Participation Contract for Block 15 or the Ecuadorian Hydrocarbons
Law and whether the alleged violations constitute grounds for terminating the Participation Contract. Block 15 operations represent
approximately 7 percent of Occidental's 2005 consolidated production, 4 percent of its proved consolidated reserves, and 2 percent
of its total property, plant and equipment (PP&E), net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A). In
August 2005, Petroecuador issued a report


recommending
that the Minister of Energy declare the termination of Occidental’s Participation Contract for Block 15. The principal
allegation stated in the notice and the Petroecuador report is an assertion that Occidental should have obtained government approval
for the farmout agreement entered into in 2000. In November 2005, the Minister of Energy, following the procedure set forth in the
Ecuadorian Hydrocarbons Law, requested that Occidental respond to the allegations against it. In February 2006, Occidental submitted
its response to the Minister of Energy, in which Occidental confirmed its belief that it has complied with all material obligations
under the Participation Contract and Ecuadorian law, and that any termination of the contract based upon the stated allegations
would be unfounded and would constitute an unlawful expropriation. Occidental has been cooperating with the Ecuadorian authorities
in these proceedings, and will continue to strive for an amicable resolution. Occidental currently is unable to determine the
outcome of these proceedings, but if there were to be a negotiated settlement, it is probable that the terms would effectively
reduce the future profitability of Block 15 operations. See also "Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements — Ecuador" for
further information about the OCP pipeline.

Production-Sharing
Contracts

Occidental
conducts its operations in Qatar, Oman and Yemen under PSCs and, under such contracts, receives a share of production to recover its
costs and an additional share for profit. In addition, Occidental's share of production from THUMS is subject to contractual
arrangements similar to a PSC. Occidental’s share of production from these contracts decreases when oil prices rise and
increases when oil prices decline. Overall, Occidental’s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher oil
prices.

Proved
Reserves - Evaluation and Review Process

A
senior corporate officer of Occidental is responsible for the internal audit and review of its oil and gas reserves data. In
addition, a Corporate Reserves Review Committee (Reserves Committee) has been established, consisting of senior corporate officers,
to monitor and review Occidental's oil and gas reserves. The Reserves Committee reports to the Audit Committee of Occidental's Board
of Directors periodically throughout the year. Occidental retained Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (Ryder Scott), independent petroleum
engineering consultants, to review its oil and gas reserve estimation processes in 2004 and 2005.

Ryder
Scott compared Occidental’s methods and procedures for estimating oil and gas reserves to generally accepted industry standards
and reviewed certain data, methods and procedures used in estimating reserve volumes, the economic evaluations and reserve
classifications. Ryder Scott reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for a selection of oil and gas fields
considered to be a valid representation of Occidental’s total reserves portfolio.

Based
on this review, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Occidental, Ryder Scott concluded that the
methodologies used by Occidental in preparing the relevant estimates generally comply with current Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) standards. Ryder Scott was not engaged to render an opinion as to the reserves volumes presented by
Occidental.

Proved
Reserve Additions

Occidental
consolidated subsidiaries had proved reserves at year-end 2005 of 2,662 million BOE, as compared with the year-end 2004 amount of
2,489 million BOE. Additionally, Occidental’s investments in other interests had proved reserves of 45 million and 43 million
BOE at year-end 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the consolidated subsidiaries’ reserves from all sources was 380
million BOE, of which 232 million BOE were from proved developed reserves and 148 million BOE were from proved undeveloped
reserves.

Proved
developed reserves represent approximately 74 percent of Occidental’s total proved reserves.

Proved
Reserve Additions - Consolidated Subsidiaries - 2005

Proved
reserves are 78 percent crude oil and condensate and 22 percent natural gas.

Revisions
of Previous Estimates

In
2005, Occidental had net negative revisions of its proved reserves of 26 million BOE due to changes in price. The decrease was
mainly due to negative revisions of 52 million BOE from the Dolphin Project, Qatar, Oman and Yemen where reserve amounts decrease
when prices rise. These revisions were partially offset by positive revisions at domestic operations in Elk Hills and the Permian
Basin. If oil prices increased by $5 per barrel, less oil volume is required to recover costs, and PSCs would reduce Occidental's
share of proved reserves by approximately 7 million BOE. Conversely, if oil prices dropped by $5 per barrel, Occidental's share of
proved reserves would increase by a similar amount. Oil price changes would also tend to affect the economic lives of proved
reserves from other contracts, in a manner partially offsetting the PSC reserve volume changes. Apart from the effects of product
prices, Occidental's approach to interpreting technical data regarding oil and gas reserves makes it more likely future reserve
revisions will be positive rather than negative.

Improved
Recovery

In
2005, Occidental added reserves of 139 million BOE through improved recovery, mainly in the Permian Basin, Elk Hills, and THUMS in
the United States and also in Qatar. In an effort to partially mitigate the decline in oil and gas production from the Elk Hills
field,


Occidental has
successfully implemented an infill drilling program. The Elk Hills operations employ both gas flood and water flood techniques. In
the Permian Basin, the increased reserves were primarily attributable to enhanced recovery techniques, such as drilling additional
CO


flood and water flood wells.

Extensions
and Discoveries

Occidental
obtains reserve additions from extensions which are dependent on successful exploitation programs. In 2005, Occidental added
reserves of 123 million BOE, with 23 million BOE in the United States and 91 million BOE in the Middle East. In western Colorado,
Occidental added approximately 9 million BOE from the extension of gas reserves to proved locations, most of which will require
additional development capital.

The
success of improved recovery, extension and discovery projects depends on reservoir characteristics and technology improvements, as
well as oil and gas prices, capital costs and operating costs. Many of these factors are outside of management's control, and will
affect whether or not these historical sources of reserve additions continue at similar levels.

Purchases of
Proved Reserves

In
2005, Occidental purchased reserves of 139 million BOE, of which 135 million BOE are in the United States. The reserve additions in
the United States were from various acquisitions, primarily in the Permian Basin, of which 71 percent were proved developed
reserves. Occidental continues to add reserves through acquisitions when properties are available at reasonable prices. Acquisitions
are dependent on successful bidding and negotiating of oil and gas contracts at attractive terms. As market conditions change, the
available supply of properties may increase or decrease accordingly.

Proved
Undeveloped Reserves

In
2005, Occidental's proved undeveloped reserves increased by 148 million BOE. This net increase resulted from improved recovery,
extensions, discoveries and purchases, primarily in the Elk Hills field, in the Permian Basin, in western Colorado and in the
Dolphin Project. The Dolphin Project accounted for 63 percent of the 2005 increase, and the projected start-up for Dolphin
production is late 2006. These proved undeveloped additions were partially offset by reserve transfers to the proved developed
category as a result of 2005 development programs.

For
details of proved reserve activity by geographic areas, see the "Supplemental Oil and Gas Information (Unaudited)" section in Item
8.

Industry
Outlook

The
petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant volatility due to numerous market forces. Crude oil and natural
gas prices are affected by market fundamentals such as weather, inventory levels, competing fuel prices, overall demand and the
availability of supply.

Worldwide
oil prices in 2005 remained at or near historical highs. Continued economic growth, resulting in increased demand and concerns about
supply availability, could result in continued high prices. A lower demand growth rate could result in lower crude oil
prices.

Historically,
sustained high or low oil prices have significantly affected profitability and returns for Occidental and other upstream producers.
Oil prices cannot be predicted with any certainty. The WTI price has averaged approximately $28.78 per barrel over the past ten
years. However, the industry has historically experienced wide fluctuations in prices. During 2005, Occidental experienced an
increase in its price differential of the average WTI price over Occidental's realized prices. See the "Oil and Gas Segment —
Business Environment" section above for further information.

While
local supply/demand fundamentals are a decisive factor affecting domestic natural gas prices over the long term, day-to-day prices
may be more volatile in the futures markets, such as on the NYMEX and other exchanges, making it difficult to forecast prices with
any degree of confidence. Over the last ten years, the NYMEX gas price has averaged $4.04 per Mcf.

Business Environment

The
chemical segment experienced improved results in 2005 due to sustained demand coupled with improved margins despite sharply higher
feedstock costs. The widespread impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in the third quarter caused several disruptions among
chlor-alkali producers and their customers. This resulted in a moderate softening of product demand.

Business
Review

Chlor-alkali

Demand
for chlor-alkali products began the year quite strong, which enabled OxyChem to realize robust margins despite escalating energy and
raw material costs. While chlorine and caustic prices continued to rise throughout the year, the combination of softening demand,
partly due to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and the rapid rise in energy and feedstock costs caused operating rates and profitability
to fall in the latter part of the year. Key sectors, such as vinyls and pulp and paper, were operating at full capacity in the first
half, resulting in a tight supply/demand balance for chlorine and caustic soda. Although demand remained relatively strong in the
second half of the year, margins came under pressure as product became more available and industrial customers reduced purchases to
control inventories and bolster cash flow.

Domestic
chlorine demand fell 7 percent compared to 2004, as several sectors experienced slowdowns late in the year, which resulted in
de-stocking of inventory amid the expectation of lower prices. Despite starting the year operating at near capacity, 2005
chlor-alkali industry operating rates fell to 90 percent for the year, down from 99 percent in 2004. OxyChem’s chlor-alkali
operating rate for 2005 was 92 percent, slightly above the industry operating rate of 90 percent.

In
September 2005, OxyChem decided to permanently close its Deer Park, Texas and Delaware City, Delaware chlor-alkali production
facilities, and its


EDC facility in
Ingleside, Texas. These sites were closed because they were not expected to regain an economically viable operating position in the
future.

Vinyls

Increasing
ethylene and natural gas prices led to a continuation of industry PVC price increases in 2005. Industry PVC prices increased 24
percent compared to 2004. These increases led to record high price levels in the fourth quarter of 2005.

Industry-wide
total 2005 demand was 3 percent lower compared with 2004.

OxyChem
operated its PVC facilities at an average operating rate of 88 percent for 2005, compared to the North American industry average of
89 percent.

In
December 2005, OxyChem announced that it would permanently close its Alberta, Canada PVC manufacturing facility in the first quarter
of 2006.

Acquisition
of Vulcan Assets

In
June 2005, Occidental completed the purchase of three chlor-alkali chemical manufacturing facilities from Vulcan for $214 million in
cash, plus contingent payments based upon the future performance of these facilities and the assumption of certain liabilities. In
order to facilitate receipt of regulatory approval for this acquisition, Occidental divested one of the facilities.

Exit
of Vinyl Specialty Resins Business

At
the end of 2004, Occidental decided to exit the vinyl specialty resins business for strategic and economic reasons. This resulted in
the immediate closure of the Pottstown, Pennsylvania manufacturing facility. Occidental recorded an after-tax charge of $32 million
in 2004 and classified this business as a discontinued operation.

Industry
Outlook

Occidental's
chemical business experienced improved profitability in 2005, 47 percent higher than 2004’s earnings. The major factors that
contributed to this improved performance were the continued strong United States economy, higher margins and the acquisition of
certain Vulcan chemical operating assets.

Continued
strong performance will depend on global economic activity, the competitiveness of the United States in the world economy and the
direction of the unprecedented high levels of feedstock and energy prices and their impact on margins. Reduced demand due to
softening in the United States economy and continuation of the historically high levels of feedstock and energy prices could affect
operating margins and reduce future profitability.

Construction
of LNG terminals on the United States Gulf Coast could stabilize natural gas prices at a lower-than-current level and thereby help
improve the competitive position of efficient Gulf Coast chemical facilities. However, this construction may not occur in the
immediate future.

Chlor-alkali

Industry
operating rates ended 2005 at 90 percent of capacity, which is a considerable decline from 2004’s performance of 99 percent.
Demand growth is expected to be moderate despite the potential positive effect of Gulf Coast rebuilding efforts. However, due to the
currently high level of energy and other key raw material costs, margins are expected to remain under pressure. Moreover, a
significant portion of 2005 results were due to sharply higher caustic soda prices versus 2004. This price increase has led to
additional United States imports and intense competition among producers for market share.

Vinyls

Industry-wide
PVC operating rates are expected to be slightly lower in 2006 as a result of the restart of some idled capacity coupled with lower
housing starts and reduced exports. VCM rates are expected to improve as Dow Chemical Company completes the announced shutdown of
two production facilities.

The
growing cost disparity in the vinyls chain between the United States Gulf Coast and southeast Asia, as well as the growth of
acetylene-based PVC capacity in China, have resulted in a dramatic shift in trade flows and imports of PVC into the United States
and Latin America.

Corporate
and Other includes the investments in Lyondell Chemical Company (Lyondell) and Premcor, Inc., (Premcor), and a leased cogeneration
facility in Taft, Louisiana. The Premcor investment was sold in 2005. Beginning in 2004, Corporate and Other also included the
results of a 1,300-mile oil pipeline and gathering system located in the Permian Basin, which was acquired in January 2004, and is
used in corporate-directed oil and gas marketing and trading operations.

Lyondell

In
November 2004, Lyondell acquired Millennium Chemicals Inc. (Millennium) by issuing additional shares of Lyondell common stock. Under
SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 51, Occidental was required to record its share of the increase in Lyondell's net equity resulting
from this issuance. The effect of this was an increase in the carrying value of Occidental's investment in Lyondell and a pre-tax
gain of $121 million. As a result of the stock issuance, Occidental's ownership percentage of Lyondell decreased from approximately
22 percent to 17 percent.


In
2005, Occidental sold 11 million shares of Lyondell common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $300 million. This sale
resulted in a 2005 pre-tax gain of $140 million. At December 31, 2005, Occidental still owned 30.3 million shares of Lyondell common
stock (12 percent ownership), with a carrying value of $468 million and a fair market value of $722 million, and warrants to
purchase an additional five million shares of Lyondell common stock. Occidental has no current plans to divest the remaining
Lyondell shares. However, Occidental regularly reviews and analyzes its investments and other operations in order to determine how
its stockholders’ interests are best served. Occidental continues to account for this investment on the equity method since it
has the ability to exercise significant influence over Lyondell.

Premcor

In
2005, Valero Energy Corp. (Valero) and Premcor executed a merger agreement for Valero to acquire Premcor. Occidental tendered its 9
million shares of Premcor common stock for cash and shares of Valero common stock pursuant to the Premcor-Valero agreement.
Valero’s acquisition of Premcor resulted in a $704 million pre-tax gain and the subsequent sale of all of the Valero shares
received resulted in an additional $22 million pre-tax gain.

The
following discussion of Occidental’s two operating segments and corporate items should be read in conjunction with Note 15 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Segment
earnings generally exclude interest income, interest expense, unallocated corporate expenses, discontinued operations and the
cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, but include gains and losses from dispositions of segment assets and results
from the segments' equity investments.

As
of January 1, 2005, Occidental revised its reporting of segment earnings to show segment earnings before income taxes. All domestic
and foreign income tax expense is now reflected in the “Corporate and Other” column. This change has been retrospectively
applied to prior period results.

The
following table sets forth the sales and earnings of each operating segment and corporate items:


Core
earnings in 2005 were $6.3 billion, compared with $4.3 billion in 2004. The increase in core earnings is primarily due to higher
prices and volumes for crude oil and natural gas, partially offset by higher operating expenses, higher exploration expense and
increased DD&A rates.

Core
earnings in 2004 were $4.3 billion, compared with $3.2 billion in 2003. The increase in core earnings primarily reflects the effect
of higher crude oil and natural gas prices and higher crude oil volumes, partially offset by higher operating expenses, higher
exploration expense and increased DD&A rates.

Average
consolidated production costs for 2005 were $8.71 per BOE, compared to the average 2004 production cost of $6.95 per BOE. At least
62 percent of the increase was a result of higher energy prices, which increased utility, gas plant and CO


costs and ad
valorem taxes, and the impact of higher crude oil prices on PSCs. The remaining cost increases were the result of workover,
maintenance and other costs.

Occidental
expects the first quarter 2006 production to be higher than the fourth quarter 2005 production.

Also,
see "Production-Sharing Contracts" above.


Core
earnings in 2005 were $777 million, compared with $414 million in 2004. The increase in core earnings is primarily due to higher
margins resulting from higher prices for chlorine, caustic soda and PVC resins, partially offset by higher energy and feedstock
costs.

Core
earnings were $414 million in 2004, compared with $223 million in 2003. The increase in core earnings reflects the impact of higher
prices for most major products (PVC resins, EDC, chlorine and VCM), partially offset by higher energy and ethylene costs.

ARNINGS

Occidental’s
results of operations often include the effects of significant transactions and events affecting earnings that vary widely and
unpredictably in nature, timing and amount. Therefore, management uses a measure called "core earnings," which excludes those items.
This non-GAAP measure is not meant to disassociate those items from management’s performance, but rather is meant to provide
useful information to investors interested in comparing Occidental’s earnings performance between periods. Reported earnings
are considered representative of management’s performance over the long term. Core earnings is not considered to be an
alternative to operating income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

(a)

Includes
      interest expense, income taxes, general and administrative and other expense, and certain non-core items.

T

AXES

Deferred
tax liabilities, net of deferred tax assets of $1.1 billion, were $0.8 billion at December 31, 2005. The current portion of the
deferred tax assets of $200 million is included in prepaid expenses and other. The net deferred tax assets are expected to be
realized through future operating income and reversal of taxable temporary differences.


Worldwide
Effective Tax Rate

The
following table sets forth the calculation of the worldwide effective tax rate for reported income from continuing operations and
core earnings:

(a)

Revenues and
      income tax expense include taxes owed by Occidental but paid by governmental entities on its behalf. Oil and gas pre-tax
      income includes revenue amounts for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, of $887 million, $525 million and $397
      million, respectively.

Occidental's
2005 worldwide effective tax rate was 28 percent for reported income and 41 percent for core income. The decrease in the United
States income tax rate for reported income in 2005, compared to 2004, resulted from a $335 million tax benefit due to the reversal
of tax reserves no longer required as United States corporate returns for tax years 1998-2000 became closed due to the lapsing of
statutes of limitations and a $619 million tax benefit resulting from a closing agreement with the IRS resolving certain foreign tax
credit issues. The lower United States income tax rate in 2005 and 2004, compared to 2003, resulted from the crediting of foreign
income taxes. Previously, Occidental deducted foreign income taxes in determining United States taxable income. An annual tax
election permits a taxpayer to claim either a credit or a deduction for foreign income taxes, whichever is more beneficial.
Occidental expects to continue its election to credit foreign income taxes in future years.

Cost
of sales increased in 2004, compared to 2003, due primarily to higher oil and gas production volumes and other operating costs,
higher energy and feedstock costs and higher crude oil volumes.

Selling,
general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2005, compared to 2004, due to the chemical plant write-offs
and writedowns in 2005, higher costs in oil and gas, including higher production-related taxes, and increases in share-based
compensation expense.

Selling,
general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in 2004, compared to 2003, mainly due to higher general and
administrative costs for corporate infrastructure and general support areas and higher oil and gas costs, including higher
production-related taxes and other operating costs.


DD&A
increased in 2005, compared to 2004, due to higher costs of new reserve additions resulting in a higher DD&A rate.

The
increase in DD&A in 2004, compared to 2003, was due to the increase in oil and gas production from the prior year and a higher
DD&A rate.

The
increase in exploration expense in 2005, compared to 2004, was due mostly to higher dry hole write-offs and impairment costs and
higher seismic and geological and geophysical costs.

The
increase in exploration expense in 2004, compared to 2003, was due mostly to higher dry hole write-offs and impairment costs in
California and the Other Eastern Hemisphere region.

Interest
and debt expense in 2005, 2004 and 2003 included pre-tax debt purchase charges of $42 million, $17 million and $61 million,
respectively. Excluding the effects of these debt repayment charges, interest expense increased in 2005, compared to 2004, due to
higher interest rates which were partially offset by lower debt levels. Interest and debt expense decreased in 2004, compared to
2003, due primarily to lower average debt levels.

The
increase in the provision for income taxes in 2005, compared to 2004, was primarily due to an increase in income before taxes,
partially offset by a $335 million tax benefit due to the reversal of tax reserves no longer required as United States corporate
returns for tax years 1998-2000 became closed due to the lapsing of statutes of limitations and a $619 million tax benefit related
to the resolution of certain IRS tax issues.

The
increase in the provision for income taxes in 2004, compared to 2003, was primarily due to an increase in income before taxes,

OSITION

The
changes in the following components of Occidental’s balance sheet are discussed below:

The
following analysis discusses increases and decreases in balance sheet items by comparing the balance at December 31, 2005, to the
balance at December 31, 2004, unless otherwise indicated.

Assets

See
“Cash Flow Analysis” for discussion about the increase in cash and cash equivalents. The increase in trade receivables is
due to higher product prices and oil and gas sales volumes during the fourth quarter 2005 versus 2004. The increase in receivables
from joint ventures, partnerships and other was due to higher mark-to-market adjustments on derivative financial instruments and
higher account balances related to the oil and gas marketing and trading operations. The higher balance in inventories is due to
higher oil and gas marketing and trading inventory due to higher prices and volumes during the fourth quarter 2005 versus 2004. The
higher inventory balance is also due to an increase in chemical inventories.

The
increase in long-term receivables reflects higher mark-to-market adjustments on long-term derivative financial instruments. The
decrease in investment in unconsolidated subsidiaries is due to the sale of all of the shares of Premcor common stock and a partial
sale of the Lyondell stock during the year. The increase in property, plant and equipment reflects capital expenditures and
acquisitions, partially offset by DD&A expense.


Liabilities
and Stockholders' Equity

Debt
to Capitalization

(a)

This ratio
      is computed by dividing year-end Total Debt, as shown in the “MD&A-Strategy-Key Performance Indicators-Debt
      Structure,” by the sum of year-end Total Debt plus year-end Stockholders’ Equity.

The
decrease in current maturities of long-term debt and capital lease liabilities reflects the 2005 payment of the 7.65-percent senior
notes that were classified as current in 2004. The higher balance in accounts payable is due to higher prices and volumes for
purchased oil and gas in Occidental’s marketing and trading operations. The increase in accrued liabilities is primarily due to
higher mark-to-market adjustments on derivative financial instruments and higher accruals mainly related to the Vulcan
acquisition.

The
higher balance in domestic and foreign income taxes-current reflects additional taxes payable due to higher income. The lower
balance for long-term debt is due to various debt redemptions and repurchases throughout the year. The decrease in deferred credits
and other liabilities – income taxes reflects the reduction in deferred taxes resulting from derivative activity in other
comprehensive income (OCI) related to the production hedges and the sale of all of the shares of Valero common stock. The higher
balance in deferred credits and other liabilities – other is due to an increase in long-term derivative liabilities related to
crude oil production hedges, accruals related to the Permian Basin and Vulcan acquisitions and additional stock-based compensation
liabilities, partially offset by the reduction in liabilities related to the IRS settlement and the reversal of tax  reserves no
longer required due to the lapsing of the statute of limitations.

The
increase in stockholders’ equity reflects higher net income, partially offset by dividends paid and the impact of the crude oil
production hedges in OCI.

ESOURCES

At
December 31, 2005, Occidental had approximately $2.4 billion in cash and short-term investments on hand, an increase of almost $1
billion from 2004. Although income and cash flows are largely dependent on oil and gas prices and production, Occidental believes
that cash and short-term investments on hand and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund its operating needs,
capital expenditure requirements, dividend payments, potential acquisitions and its announced common stock repurchase program. If
needed, Occidental could access its existing credit facilities.

Available
but unused lines of committed bank credit totaled approximately $1.5 billion at December 31, 2005. Occidental's $1.5 billion bank
credit matures on June 18, 2009. None of Occidental's committed bank credits contain material adverse change (MAC) clauses or debt
rating triggers that could restrict Occidental's ability to borrow under these lines. Occidental's credit facilities and debt
agreements do not contain rating triggers that could terminate bank commitments or accelerate debt in the event of a ratings
downgrade.

At
December 31, 2005, under the most restrictive covenants of certain financing agreements, Occidental's capacity for additional
unsecured borrowing was approximately $34.6 billion, and the capacity for the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on,
and for acquisitions of, Occidental's capital stock was approximately $13.0 billion, assuming that such dividends, distributions and
acquisitions were made without incurring additional borrowing.

In
2005, Occidental redeemed all of its 5.875-percent senior notes due 2007, all of its 4.101-percent medium-term senior notes due
2007, all of its 7.65-percent senior notes due 2006 and three of its unsecured subsidiary notes due 2028 through 2030. In addition,
Occidental purchased and retired a total of $213 million of its 6.75-percent senior notes due 2012, its 10.125-percent senior notes
due 2009, its 4-percent medium-term senior notes due 2007 and its 4.25-percent medium-term senior notes due 2010.

In
January 2004, Occidental redeemed all of its outstanding 8.16 percent Trust Preferred Redeemable Securities (trust preferred
securities) at par plus accrued interest, resulting in a decrease in current liabilities of $453 million. In the third quarter of
2004, Occidental redeemed all of its 6.5-percent senior notes, which reduced long-term debt by approximately $157
million.

In
July 2004, Dolphin Energy, the operator of the Dolphin Project, entered into an agreement with banks to provide a $1.36 billion
bridge loan for the Dolphin Project. Occidental guaranteed 24.5 percent of the obligations of Dolphin Energy under the bridge loan.
In July 2005, Dolphin Energy entered into an agreement with banks to refinance the $1.36 billion bridge loan with a new bridge loan
in an amount of $2.45 billion. The proceeds of the new bridge loan were used to pay off amounts outstanding on the $1.36 billion
bridge loan and will be used to fund the construction of the Dolphin Project. The new bridge loan has a term of four years and is a
revolving credit facility, which may be converted to a term loan. In September 2005, Dolphin Energy entered into an agreement with
banks to provide a $1.0 billion Islamic-law-compliant facility to fund the construction of a certain portion of the Dolphin
Project.


This four-year
financing facility is structured as a transaction in which Dolphin Energy constructs part of the midstream portion of the Dolphin
Project on behalf of a group of Islamic investors and enters into a lease to use such assets upon construction completion.
Occidental guarantees 24.5 percent of both of these obligations of Dolphin Energy. At December 31, 2005, Occidental’s portion
of the bridge loan drawdown was approximately $400 million, of which $299 million is recorded on the balance sheet. The remaining
amount is discussed in “Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements — Guarantees” below. There were no draw downs on the
Islamic-law-compliant facility at December 31, 2005.

In
the first quarter of 2005, Occidental filed a shelf registration statement for up to $1.5 billion of various securities. As of
December 31, 2005, no securities had been issued under this shelf.

In
January 2006, Occidental completed the Vintage acquisition and paid $1.4 billion to former Vintage shareholders for the cash portion
of the merger consideration and issued 28 million shares for the stock portion, which was valued at $2.1 billion. The value of
Occidental’s shares was determined by the average share price for the five-day period beginning two days before the acquisition
announcement. In addition, Occidental assumed Vintage’s debt, which had an estimated fair market value of $585 million at
closing. Occidental intends to divest a portion of these assets.

The
significant increase in operating cash flow in 2005, compared to 2004, resulted from several factors. The most important drivers
were the significantly higher oil and natural gas prices and, to a much lesser extent, chemical prices. Although the changes in
realized prices varied among the regions in which Occidental operates, in 2005, Occidental's realized oil prices were higher overall
by 37 percent. Occidental’s realized natural gas price increased over 33 percent in the United States, where approximately 80
percent of Occidental’s natural gas was produced in 2005.

Increases
in the costs of producing oil and gas, such as purchased goods and services, and higher utility, gas plant and production taxes,
partially offset oil and gas sales price increases, but such cost increases had a much lower effect on cash flow than the realized
price increases. Other cost elements, such as labor costs and overheads, are not significant drivers of cash flow because they are
mainly fixed within a narrow range over the short to intermediate term.

Most
major chemical prices increased in 2005 at a higher rate than the energy-driven increase in feedstock and power costs, thereby
improving profits and cash flow. The overall impact of the chemical price changes on cash flow was much less than for oil and gas
price changes, not only because the chemical segment earnings and cash flow are significantly smaller than those for the oil and gas
segment, but also because of increases in energy price-driven feedstock and electric power costs, which are major elements of
manufacturing cost for the chemical segment's products. Sales volumes for chemical products generally were higher in 2005, but this
did not have a significant effect on Occidental's earnings and cash flow.

The
significant increase in operating cash flow in 2004, compared to 2003, resulted from the significantly higher oil and natural gas
prices and, to a much lesser extent, chemical prices. In 2004, Occidental's realized oil prices were higher overall by 29 percent
and the realized United States natural gas price increased over 11 percent. Oil and gas worldwide production, on a BOE basis,
increased for 2004 overall by over 3 percent on a daily basis, as compared with 2003, which also contributed to increased cash
flow.

Increases
in sales prices realized for Occidental's major chemical product lines ranged from zero to 34 percent, compared to 2003. Chemical
prices increased in 2004 at a higher rate than the energy-driven increase in feedstock and power costs, thereby improving profits
and cash flow. The overall impact of the chemical price changes on cash flow was much less than for oil and gas price changes. Sales
volumes for chemical products generally were higher in 2004, but this did not have a significant effect on Occidental's earnings and
cash flow.

Increases
in the costs of production partially offset sales price increases, but such cost increases had a much lower effect on cash flow than
the realized price increases.

Other
non-cash charges to income in 2005 include chemical asset write-downs, deferred compensation, stock incentive plan amortization and
environmental remediation accruals. Other non-cash charges in 2004 include deferred compensation, stock incentive plan amortization,
environmental remediation accruals and a chemical asset writedown. Other non-cash charges in 2003 include deferred compensation,
stock incentive plan amortization and environmental remediation accruals.

RRANGEMENTS

In
the course of its business activities, Occidental pursues a number of projects and transactions to meet its core business
objectives. The accounting and financial statement treatment of these transactions is a result of the varying methods of funding
employed. Occidental also makes commitments on behalf of unconsolidated entities. These transactions, or groups of transactions, are
recorded in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles and, unless otherwise noted, are not reflected on
Occidental’s balance sheets. The following is a description of the business purpose and nature of these
transactions.

Ecuador

In
Ecuador, Occidental has a 14-percent interest in the OCP oil export pipeline. As of December 31, 2005, Occidental’s net
investment and advances to the project totaled $73 million. Occidental reports this investment in its consolidated statements using
the equity method of accounting. The project was funded in part by senior project debt. The senior project debt is to be repaid with
the proceeds of ship-or-pay tariffs of certain upstream producers in Ecuador, including Occidental. Under their ship-or-pay
commitments, Occidental and the other upstream producers have each assumed their respective share of project-specific risks,
including operating risk, political risk and force-majeure risk. Occidental would be required to make an advance tariff payment in
the event of prolonged force majeure, upstream expropriation events, bankruptcy of the pipeline company or its parent company,
abandonment of the project, termination of an investment guarantee agreement with Ecuador, or certain defaults by Occidental. This
advance tariff would be used by the pipeline company to service or prepay project debt. At December 31, 2005, Occidental’s
obligation relating to the pipeline company’s senior project debt totaled $100 million, and Occidental's obligations relating
to performance bonds totaled $14 million. Occidental's overall obligations will decrease with the reduction of the pipeline
company’s senior project debt.

Leases

Occidental
has entered into various operating-lease agreements, mainly for railcars, power plants, manufacturing facilities and office space.
Occidental leases assets when it offers greater operating flexibility.  Lease payments are expensed mainly as cost of sales. See the
Contractual Obligations table below.

Guarantees

Occidental
has entered into various guarantees including performance bonds, letters of credit, indemnities, commitments and other forms of
guarantees provided by Occidental to third parties, mainly to provide assurance that OPC and/or its subsidiaries and affiliates will
meet their various obligations (guarantees).

At
December 31, 2005, the notional amount of the guarantees was approximately $575 million. Of this amount, approximately $475 million
relates to Occidental’s guarantee of equity investees’ debt and other commitments. The debt guarantees and other
commitments primarily relate to the Dolphin Energy equity investment and the investment in the Ecuador OCP pipeline, which are
discussed above. The remaining $100 million relates to various indemnities and guarantees provided to third parties.

OPC
and certain of its subsidiaries have been named in a substantial number of lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings. These
actions seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, property damage, punitive damages,
civil penalties or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. OPC and certain of its subsidiaries also have been named in
proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and similar federal, state,
local and foreign environmental laws. These environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases,
compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages and civil penalties; however, Occidental is usually one of many companies
in these proceedings and has to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies. With respect
to all such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, including environmental proceedings, Occidental accrues reserves when it is probable a
liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.

Since
April 2004, OxyChem has been served with eight lawsuits filed in Nicaragua by approximately 2,200 individual plaintiffs. These
individuals allege that they have sustained several billion dollars of personal injury damages as a result of their alleged exposure
to a pesticide. OxyChem is aware of, but has not been served in, 20 additional cases in Nicaragua, which Occidental understands make
similar allegations. OxyChem has no assets in Nicaragua and, in the opinion of management, these claims are without merit because,
among other things, OxyChem believes that none of the pesticide it manufactured was ever sold or used in Nicaragua. Under the
applicable Nicaraguan statute, defendants are required to pay pre-trial deposits so large as to effectively prohibit defendants from
participating fully in their defense. In previous situations, involving other defendants, Nicaraguan courts have proceeded to enter
significant judgments against the defendants under that statute. OxyChem has filed a response to the complaints contesting
jurisdiction without posting such pre-trial deposit. In December 2004, the judge in one of the cases (the "Osorio Case"), ruled the
court had jurisdiction over the defendants, including OxyChem, and that the plaintiffs had waived the requirement of the pre-trial
deposit. OxyChem has appealed that portion of the ruling relating to the jurisdiction of the Nicaraguan courts. Thereafter, the
trial court ordered defendants, including OxyChem, to file an answer. In order to preserve its jurisdictional defense, OxyChem
elected not to make a substantive appearance in the case. In August 2005, the judge in the Osorio case entered judgment against
several defendants, including OxyChem, for damages totaling approximately $97 million. In the opinion of management, any judgment
rendered under the statute, including in the Osorio case, would be unenforceable in the United States.

In
September 2004, Occidental received formal notification that Petroecuador, the state oil company of Ecuador, was initiating
proceedings to determine if Occidental had violated either its Participation Contract for Block 15 or the Ecuadorian Hydrocarbons
Law and whether the alleged violations constitute grounds for terminating the Participation Contract. Block 15 operations represent
approximately 7 percent of Occidental's 2005 consolidated production, 4 percent of its proved consolidated reserves, and 2 percent
of its total PP&E, net of accumulated DD&A. In August 2005, Petroecuador issued a report recommending that the Minister of
Energy declare the termination of Occidental’s Participation Contract for Block 15. The principal allegation stated in the
notice and the Petroecuador report is an assertion that Occidental should have obtained government approval for the farmout
agreement entered into in 2000. In November 2005, the Minister of Energy, following the procedure set forth in the Ecuadorian
Hydrocarbons Law, requested that Occidental respond to the allegations against it. In February 2006, Occidental submitted its
response to the Minister of Energy, in which Occidental confirmed its belief that it has complied with all material obligations
under the Participation Contract and Ecuadorian law, and that any termination of the contract based upon the stated allegations
would be unfounded and would constitute an unlawful expropriation. Occidental has been cooperating with the Ecuadorian authorities
in these proceedings, and will continue to strive for an


amicable
resolution. Occidental currently is unable to determine the outcome of these proceedings, but if there were to be a negotiated
settlement, it is probable that the terms would effectively reduce the future profitability of Block 15 operations. See also
"Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements — Ecuador" for information about the OCP pipeline.

During
the course of its operations, Occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal, state, local
and foreign tax jurisdictions. Disputes may arise during the course of such audits as to facts and matters of law. In May 2005,
Occidental entered into a closing agreement with the IRS resolving certain foreign tax credit issues as part of the IRS audit of tax
years 1997-2000. The closing agreement was completed after an extensive IRS review of various complex tax issues and negotiations
between Occidental and the IRS. As a result of the closing agreement, Occidental recorded a tax benefit of $619 million in 2005 for
the reversal of tax reserves that were previously established for those foreign tax credit issues. In addition, Occidental recorded
a tax benefit of $335 million in 2005 due to the reversal of tax reserves no longer required as United States corporate returns for
tax years 1998-2000 became closed due to the lapsing of the statute of limitations. These tax benefits did not have a significant
current cash effect.

Occidental
has entered into agreements providing for future payments to secure terminal and pipeline capacity, drilling services, electrical
power, steam and certain chemical raw materials. See Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. See
“Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements — Contractual Obligations” for further information.

Occidental
has certain other commitments under contracts, guarantees and joint ventures, including purchase commitments for goods and services
at market-related prices and certain other contingent liabilities. See “Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements” for further
information. Some of these commitments, although not fixed or determinable, involve capital expenditures and are part of the $3.0
billion capital expenditures estimated for 2006.

Occidental
has indemnified various parties against specified liabilities that those parties might incur in the future in connection with
purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with Occidental. These indemnities usually are contingent upon the
other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds. As of December 31, 2005, Occidental is not aware of circumstances
that would lead to future indemnity claims against it for material amounts in connection with these transactions.

It
is impossible at this time to determine the ultimate liabilities that OPC and its subsidiaries may incur resulting from any
lawsuits, claims and proceedings, audits, commitments, contingencies and related matters. If these matters were to be ultimately
resolved unfavorably at amounts substantially exceeding Occidental’s reserves, an outcome not currently anticipated, it is
possible that such outcome could have a material adverse effect upon Occidental’s consolidated financial position or results of
operations. However, after taking into account reserves, management does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of these matters
to have a material adverse effect upon Occidental’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

IABILITIES AND

E

XPENDITURES

Occidental’s
operations in the United States are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to improving or
maintaining environmental quality. Foreign operations also are subject to environmental protection laws. Costs associated with
environmental compliance have increased over time and are expected to rise in the future. Environmental expenditures related to
current operations are factored into the overall business planning process and are considered an integral part of production in
manufacturing quality products responsive to market demand.

Environmental Remediation

The
laws that require or address environmental remediation may apply retroactively to past waste disposal practices and releases. In
many cases, the laws apply regardless of fault, legality of the original activities or current ownership or control of sites. OPC or
certain of its subsidiaries are currently participating in environmental assessments and cleanups under these laws at federal
Superfund sites, comparable state sites and other domestic and foreign remediation sites, including Occidental facilities and
previously owned sites. Also, OPC and certain of its subsidiaries have been involved in a substantial number of governmental and
private proceedings involving historical practices at various sites including, in some instances, having been named in proceedings
under CERCLA and similar federal, state and local environmental laws. These proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation
and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages and civil penalties.

Occidental
manages its environmental remediation efforts through a wholly owned subsidiary, Glenn Springs Holdings, Inc., which reports its
results directly to Occidental’s corporate management.

The
following table presents Occidental’s environmental remediation reserves at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 grouped by three
categories of environmental remediation sites:


The
following table shows environmental reserve activity for the past three years:

Occidental
expects to expend funds equivalent to about half of the current environmental reserve over the next three years and the balance over
the next ten or more years. Occidental believes it is reasonably possible that it will continue to incur additional liabilities
beyond those recorded for environmental remediation at these and other sites. The range of reasonably possible loss for existing
environmental remediation matters could be up to $420 million beyond the amount accrued.

For
management’s opinion, refer to the "Lawsuits, Claims, Commitments, Contingencies and Related Matters" section above.

CERCLA
and Equivalent Sites

At
December 31, 2005, OPC or certain of its subsidiaries have been named in 128 CERCLA or state equivalent proceedings, as
shown below.

(a)

Includes 28
      sites for which Maxus Energy Corporation has retained the liability and indemnified Occidental, 7 sites where Occidental has
      denied liability without challenge, 57 sites where Occidental’s reserves are less than $50,000 each, and 13 sites where
      reserves are between $50,000 and $1 million each.

The
eight sites with individual reserves over $10 million in 2005 include a former copper mining and smelting operation in Tennessee,
two closed landfills in western New York, groundwater treatment facilities at four closed chemical plants (Montague, Michigan,
Hicksville, New York, western New York and Tacoma, Washington) and replacement of a municipal drinking water treatment plant in
western New York.

Active
Facilities

Certain
subsidiaries of OPC are currently addressing releases of substances from past operations at 18 active facilities. Five facilities
— a chemical plant in Louisiana, a phosphorus recovery operation in Tennessee, a chemical plant in Texas, a chemical plant in
Kansas and certain oil and gas properties in the southwestern United States — account for 76 percent of the reserves associated
with these facilities.

Closed
or Sold Facilities

There
are 39 sites formerly owned or operated by certain subsidiaries of OPC that have ongoing environmental remediation requirements in
which Occidental or its subsidiaries are involved. Four sites account for 63 percent of the reserves associated with this group. The
four sites are:  an active refinery in Louisiana where Occidental indemnifies the current owner and operator for certain remedial
actions, a water treatment facility at a former coal mine in Pennsylvania, a closed OxyChem chemical plant in Pennsylvania and a
water treatment facility at a former OxyChem chemical plant in North Carolina.

Environmental
Costs

Occidental’s
costs, some of which may include estimates, relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations, are shown below for each
segment:

Operating
expenses are incurred on a continual basis. Capital expenditures relate to longer-lived improvements in currently operating
facilities. Remediation expenses relate to existing conditions caused by past operations and do not contribute to current or future
revenue generation. Although total costs may vary in any one year, over the long term, segment operating and capital expenditures
for environmental compliance generally are expected to increase.

Occidental
presently estimates that capital expenditures for environmental compliance will be approximately $79 million for 2006 and $77
million for 2007.

Portions
of Occidental’s assets outside North America are exposed to political and economic risks. Occidental conducts its financial
affairs so as to mitigate its exposure against those risks. At December 31, 2005, the carrying value of Occidental’s assets in
countries outside North America aggregated approximately $5.2 billion, or approximately 20 percent of Occidental’s total assets
at that date. Of such assets, approximately $3.9 billion are located in the Middle East/North Africa, approximately $1.0 billion are
located in Latin America, and substantially all of the remainder are located in the Other Eastern Hemisphere region. For the year
ended December 31, 2005, net sales outside North America totaled $4.4 billion, or approximately 29 percent of total net
sales.

CCOUNTING

P

OLICIES AND

E

STIMATES

The
process of preparing financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the management of Occidental to make estimates and
judgments regarding certain items and transactions. It is possible that materially different amounts could be recorded if these
estimates and judgments change or if the actual results differ from these estimates and judgments. Occidental considers the
following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve the judgment of Occidental’s management. There
has been no material change to these policies over the past three years. The selection and development of these critical accounting
policies and estimates have been discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

Oil
and Gas Properties

Occidental
uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties. Under this method, costs of acquiring properties,
costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs are capitalized. The costs of exploratory wells are initially
capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found. At the completion of drilling activities, the costs
of exploratory wells remain capitalized if a determination is made that proved reserves have been found. If no proved reserves have
been found, the costs of each of the related exploratory wells are charged to expense. In some cases, a determination of proved
reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling, requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells. Occidental's
practice is to expense the costs of such exploratory wells if a determination of proved reserves has not been made within a
twelve-month period after drilling is complete. Occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of
commercial viability is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures. Annual lease rentals and exploration,
geological, geophysical and seismic costs are expensed as incurred.

Proved
oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs that geological and engineering data
demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, can be recovered in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating
conditions considering future production and development costs.

Several
factors could change Occidental’s recorded oil and gas reserves. Occidental receives a share of production from PSCs to recover
its costs and an additional share for profit. Occidental’s share of production from these contracts decreases when oil prices
rise and increases when oil prices decline. Overall, Occidental’s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at
higher oil prices. In other contractual arrangements, sustained lower product prices may lead to a situation where production of
proved reserves becomes uneconomical. Estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due
to factors beyond Occidental's control, such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs. These factors,
in turn, could lead to a reduction in the quantity of recorded proved reserves. PSCs also affect reserves. As prices increase,
Occidental's share of proved recorded reserves decreases while a decrease in price causes recorded proved reserves to increase. An
additional factor that could result in a change of proved reserves is the reservoir decline rates being different from those assumed
when the reserves were initially recorded. Occidental’s revisions to proved reserves were negative for 2005 and amounted to
less than 2 percent of the total reserves for the year. The negative revisions in 2005 were primarily a result of PSC price effects.
In 2004 and 2003, revisions to proved reserves were positive and amounted to less than 2 percent of the total reserves for each
year. Additionally, Occidental is required to perform impairment tests pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 144 generally when prices decline and/or reserve estimates change significantly. There have been no impairments of
reserves over the past three years.

If
Occidental’s consolidated oil and gas reserves were to change based on the factors mentioned above, the most significant impact
would be on the depreciation and depletion rate. For example, a 5-percent increase in the amount of consolidated oil and gas
reserves would change the rate from $6.13 per barrel to $5.82 per barrel, which would increase pre-tax income by $61 million
annually. A 5-percent decrease in the oil and gas reserves would change the rate from $6.13 per barrel to $6.43 per barrel and would
result in a decrease in pre-tax income of $61 million annually.

DD&A
of oil and gas producing properties is determined by the unit-of-production method and could change with revisions to estimated
proved reserves. The change in the DD&A rate over the past three years due to revisions of previous proved reserve estimates has
been immaterial.

A
portion of the carrying value of Occidental’s oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties. At December 31,
2005, the capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties, net of accumulated valuation allowance, were $788 million. These
costs are not currently being depreciated or depleted. As exploration and development work progresses and the reserves on these
properties are proven, capitalized costs attributable to the properties will be subject to depreciation and depletion. If the
exploration and development work were to be unsuccessful, the capitalized costs of the properties related to this unsuccessful work
would be expensed in the year in which the determination was made. The timing of any writedowns of these unproven properties, if
warranted, depends upon the nature, timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results. Occidental
believes its exploration and development efforts will allow it to realize the unproved property balance.


Chemical
Assets

The
most critical accounting policy affecting Occidental’s chemical assets is the determination of the estimated useful lives of
its PP&E. Occidental's chemical plants are depreciated using either the unit-of-production or straight-line method based upon
the estimated useful life of the facilities. The estimated useful lives of Occidental’s chemical assets, which range from 3
years to 50 years, are used to compute depreciation expense and are also used for impairment tests. The estimated useful lives used
for the chemical facilities are based on the assumption that Occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to
ensure productive capacity is sustained. Without these continued expenditures, the useful lives of these plants could significantly
decrease. Other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of Occidental’s chemical plants include sustained higher
or lower product prices, which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition, feedstock costs, energy prices,
environmental regulations, competition and technological changes. Over the prior three years, the change in the depreciation rate
due to changes in estimated useful lives has been immaterial.

Occidental
performs impairment tests on its assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful
lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when management’s
plans change with respect to those assets. Occidental compares the undiscounted future cash flows of an asset to its carrying value.
The key factors that could significantly affect future cash flows are future product prices, which are particularly affected by both
domestic and foreign competition, feedstock costs, energy costs, significantly increased regulation and remaining estimated useful
life.

Due
to a temporary decrease in demand for some of its products, Occidental temporarily idled an EDC plant in June 2001 and a
chlor-alkali plant in December 2001. Subsequent to the purchase of the Vulcan chemical assets, Occidental reviewed all of its
chemical assets and decided to close its least competitive plants and upgrade the remaining operations. As a result of this review,
Occidental recorded a $139 million pre-tax charge for the write-off of these two previously idled chemical plants and one currently
operated plant and a pre-tax additional charge of $20 million for the writedown of another chemical plant in 2005.

Occidental's
net PP&E for chemicals is approximately $2.6 billion and its depreciation expense for 2006 is expected to be approximately $240
million. If the estimated useful lives of Occidental’s chemical plants were to decrease based on the factors mentioned above,
the most significant impact would be on depreciation expense. For example, a reduction in the remaining useful lives of one year
would increase depreciation and reduce pre-tax earnings by approximately $21 million per year.

Environmental
Liabilities and Expenditures

Environmental
expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Reserves for estimated costs that relate
to existing conditions caused by past operations and that do not contribute to current or future revenue generation are recorded
when environmental remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. In determining the reserves and the
reasonably possible range of loss, Occidental refers to currently available information, including relevant past experience,
available technology, regulations in effect, the timing of remediation and cost-sharing arrangements. The environmental reserves are
based on management’s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred and are reviewed periodically and adjusted as additional
or new information becomes available. Environmental reserves are recorded on a discounted basis only when a reserve is initially
established and the aggregate amount of the estimated costs for a specific site and the timing of cash payments are reliably
determinable. The reserve methodology for a specific site is not modified once it has been established. Recoveries and
reimbursements are recorded in income when receipt is probable. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, Occidental has not
accrued any reimbursements or indemnification recoveries for environmental remediation matters as assets.

Many
factors could result in changes to Occidental’s environmental reserves and reasonably possible range of loss. The most
significant are:


Additionally,
other events might occur that could affect Occidental’s future remediation costs, such as:

Ø

The discovery
      of more extensive contamination than had been originally anticipated. For some sites with impacted groundwater, accurate
      definition of contaminant plumes requires years of monitoring data and computer modeling. Migration of contaminants may follow
      unexpected pathways along geologic anomalies that could initially go undetected. Additionally, the size of the area requiring
      remediation may change based upon risk assessment results following site characterization or interim remedial
      measures.

      remediation technology might decrease the cost of remediation. In particular, for groundwater remediation sites with projected
      long-term operation and maintenance, the development of more effective treatment technology, or acceptance of alternative and
      more cost-effective treatment methodologies such as bioremediation, could significantly affect remediation costs.

Ø

Laws and
      regulations might change to impose more or less stringent remediation requirements.

At
sites involving multiple parties, Occidental provides environmental reserves based upon its expected share of liability. When other
parties are jointly liable, the financial viability of the parties, the degree of their commitment to participate and the
consequences to Occidental of their failure to participate are evaluated when estimating Occidental's ultimate share of liability.
Based on these factors, Occidental believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of other potentially
responsible parties, with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable, in an amount that would have a material effect on
Occidental’s consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

Most
cost sharing arrangements with other parties fall into one of the following three categories:

Category  1:

CERCLA
or state-equivalent sites wherein Occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties share the cost of remediation in
accordance with negotiated or prescribed allocations;

Category  2:

Oil
and gas joint ventures wherein each joint venture partner pays its proportionate share of remedial cost; and

Category  3:

Contractual
arrangements typically relating to purchases and sales of property wherein the parties to the transaction agree to methods of
allocating the costs of environmental remediation.

In
all three of these categories, Occidental records as a reserve its expected net cost of remedial activities, as adjusted by
recognition for any nonperforming parties.

In
addition to the costs of investigating and implementing remedial measures, which often take in excess of ten years at CERCLA sites,
Occidental’s reserves include management’s estimates of the cost of operation and maintenance of remedial systems. To the
extent that the remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in site-specific data, laws, regulations,
technologies or engineering estimates, Occidental reviews and changes the reserves accordingly on a site-specific basis.

If
the environmental reserve balance were to either increase or decrease based on the factors mentioned above, the amount of the
increase or decrease would be immediately recognized in earnings. For example, if the reserve balance were to decrease by 10
percent, Occidental would record a pre-tax gain of $42 million. If the reserve balance were to increase by 10 percent, Occidental
would record an additional remediation expense of $42 million.

Other
Loss Contingencies

Occidental
is involved with numerous lawsuits, claims, proceedings and audits in the normal course of its operations. Occidental records a loss
contingency for these matters when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of
the loss can be reasonably estimated. In addition, Occidental discloses, in aggregate, its exposure to loss in excess of the amount
recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred.
Occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an ongoing basis so that they are adequately reserved on the balance sheet.

These
reserves are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as
appropriate. Management’s judgments could change based on new information, changes in laws or regulations, changes in
management’s plans or intentions, the outcome of legal proceedings, settlements or other factors.

HANGES

Listed
below are significant changes in accounting principles.

EITF
Issue No. 04-13

In
September 2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) finalized the provisions of EITF Issue No. 04-13, “Accounting for
Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty”, which provides accounting guidance about whether buy/sell
arrangements should be accounted for at historical cost and whether these arrangements should be reported on a gross or net basis.
Buy/sell arrangements typically are contractual arrangements where the buy and sell agreements are entered into in contemplation of
one another with the same counterparty. Occidental reports all buy/sell arrangements on a net basis and at historical cost. This
EITF is effective in the first interim period beginning after March 15, 2006, and Occidental will prospectively adopt this statement
in the second quarter of 2006. Occidental is currently assessing the effect of EITF Issue No. 04-13, but does not expect it to have
a material effect on its financial statements.


FIN
No. 47

In
March 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 47, “Accounting for
Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations.”  FIN 47 specifies the accounting treatment for conditional asset retirement
obligations under the provisions of SFAS No. 143. FIN 47 is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after December
15, 2005. Occidental has identified conditional asset retirement obligations at a certain number of its facilities that are mainly
related to plant decommissioning. Under FIN 47, which Occidental adopted on December 31, 2005, Occidental is required to record the
fair value of these conditional liabilities if they can be reasonably estimated. However, Occidental believes that there is an
indeterminate settlement date for these asset retirement obligations because the range of time over which Occidental may settle
these obligations is unknown or cannot be estimated. Therefore, Occidental cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of these
liabilities. Occidental will recognize these conditional asset retirement obligations in the periods in which sufficient information
becomes available to reasonably estimate their fair values.

SFAS
No. 123R

On
July 1, 2005, Occidental early adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R (SFAS 123R), “Share-Based
Payments”, under the modified prospective transition method. Since most of Occidental’s existing stock-based compensation
was already being recorded in the income statement, Occidental decided to early adopt SFAS 123R, so that the remaining awards would
be accounted for in a similar manner. Prior to July 1, 2005, Occidental applied the Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25
intrinsic value accounting method for its stock incentive plans. Under the modified prospective transition method, the fair value
recognition provisions apply only to new awards or awards modified after July 1, 2005. Additionally, the fair value of existing
unvested awards at the date of adoption is recorded in compensation expense over the remaining requisite service period. Results
from prior periods have not been restated. As a result of adopting this statement in the third quarter of 2005, Occidental recorded
a $3 million after-tax credit as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for more information.

FASB
Staff Position No. (FSP) FAS 19-1

In
April 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. (FSP) FAS 19-1, “Accounting for Suspended Well Costs.”  FSP FAS 19-1
provides new accounting guidance that specifies when successful efforts companies can capitalize exploratory well costs. The
guidance also requires new disclosures related to these costs. FSP FAS 19-1 is effective in the first reporting period beginning
after April 4, 2005, and will be applied prospectively to existing and new exploratory well costs. Occidental adopted this statement
effective July 1, 2005, and there was no material effect on the financial statements upon adoption. See Note 1 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for the new disclosures.

SFAS
No. 153

In
December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, "Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29."  SFAS No. 153
specifies the criteria required to record a nonmonetary asset exchange using carryover basis. SFAS No. 153 is effective for
nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring after July 1, 2005. Occidental adopted this statement in the third quarter of 2005 and there
was no material effect on the financial statements upon adoption.

SFAS
No. 151

In
November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costs, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4."
SFAS No. 151 clarifies the accounting treatment for various inventory costs and overhead allocations. SFAS No. 151 is effective for
inventory costs incurred after July 1, 2005. Occidental adopted this statement in the third quarter of 2005 and it did not have a
material effect on the financial statements when adopted.

FSP
FAS 106-2

In
May 2004, the FASB issued FSP FAS 106-2, "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003," which specifies the accounting and disclosure requirements for the prescription drug
benefits that are available under this new plan. Occidental adopted the disclosure provisions of this pronouncement in the second
quarter of 2004. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

FIN
46-R (Revised)

In
December 2003, the FASB revised FIN 46 to exempt certain entities from its requirements and to clarify certain issues arising during
the initial implementation of FIN 46. Occidental adopted the revised interpretation in the first quarter of 2004 and it did not have
a material impact on the financial statements when adopted.

SFAS
No. 143

Effective
January 1, 2003 Occidental adopted SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." SFAS No. 143 addresses financial
accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset
retirement costs. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

The
initial adoption of SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003 resulted in an after-tax charge of $50 million, which was recorded as a
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles. The adoption increased net PP&E by $73 million, increased asset
retirement obligations by $151 million and decreased deferred tax liabilities by $28 million.


EITF
Issue No. 02-3

In
October 2002, Occidental adopted certain provisions of EITF Issue No. 02-3, "Issues involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts
Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities." As a result of adopting EITF
Issue No. 02-3, there were no changes to gross margins, net income, cash flow, or earnings per share for any period; however, net
sales and cost of sales were reduced by equal and offsetting amounts to reflect the adoption of this requirement.

From
1999 to 2002, Occidental accounted for certain energy-trading contracts in accordance with EITF Issue No. 98-10, "Accounting for
Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities."  EITF Issue No. 98-10 required that all energy-trading
contracts must be marked to fair value with gains and losses included in earnings, whether the contracts were derivatives or not.
In October 2002, the EITF rescinded EITF Issue No. 98-10 thus precluding mark-to-market accounting for all energy-trading contracts
that are not derivatives and fair value accounting for inventories purchased from third parties. Also, the rescission requires
derivative gains and losses to be presented net on the income statement, whether or not they are physically settled, if the
derivative instruments are held for trading purposes. Occidental adopted this accounting change in the first quarter of 2003 and
recorded an $18 million after-tax charge as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles.

D

ERIVATIVE

A

CTIVITIES AND

M

ARKET

R

ISK

General

Occidental's
market risk exposures relate primarily to commodity prices and, to a lesser extent, interest rates and foreign currency exchange
rates. Occidental periodically enters into derivative instrument transactions to reduce these price and rate fluctuations. A
derivative is an instrument that, among other characteristics, derives its value from changes in another instrument or
variable.

In
general, the fair value recorded for derivative instruments is based on quoted market prices, dealer quotes and the Black Scholes or
similar valuation models.

Commodity
Price Risk

General

Occidental’s
results are sensitive to fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices. Based on current levels of production, if oil prices vary
overall by $1 per barrel, it would have an estimated annual effect on pre-tax income of approximately $150 million. If natural gas
prices vary by $0.25 per Mcf, it would have an estimated annual effect on pre-tax income of approximately $42 million. If production
levels change in the future, the sensitivity of Occidental’s results to oil and gas prices also would change.

Occidental’s
results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices; however, changes in cost usually offset part of the effect of price
changes on margins. If chlorine and caustic soda prices vary by $10/ton, it would have approximately a $15 million and $30 million,
respectively, pre-tax annual effect on income. If PVC prices vary by $.01/lb, it would have approximately a $25 million pre-tax
annual effect on income. If EDC prices vary by $10/ton, it would have approximately a $5 million pre-tax annual effect on income.
Historically, price changes either precede or follow raw material and feedstock price changes; therefore, the margin improvement of
price changes can be mitigated. According to Chemical Market Associates, Inc., December 2005 average contract prices were:
chlorine—$358/ton, caustic soda—$455/ton, PVC—$0.645/lb and EDC—$250/ton.

Marketing
and Trading Operations

Occidental
periodically uses different types of derivative instruments to achieve the best prices for oil and gas. Derivatives are also used by
Occidental to reduce its exposure to price volatility and to mitigate fluctuations in commodity-related cash flows. Occidental
enters into low-risk marketing and trading activities through its separate marketing organization, which operates under established
policy controls and procedures. With respect to derivatives used in its oil and gas marketing operations, Occidental utilizes a
combination of futures, forwards, options and swaps to offset various physical transactions. Occidental's use of derivatives in
marketing and trading activities relates primarily to managing cash flows from third-party purchases, which includes
Occidental’s periodic gas storage activities.

Risk
Management

Occidental
conducts its risk management activities for energy commodities (which include buying, selling, marketing, trading, and hedging
activities) under the controls and governance of its Risk Control Policy. The Chief Financial Officer and the Risk Management
Committee, comprising members of Occidental's management, oversee these controls, which are implemented and enforced by the Trading
Control Officer. The Trading Control Officer provides an independent and separate check on results of marketing and trading
activities. Controls for energy commodities include limits on credit, limits on trading, segregation of duties, delegation of
authority and a number of other policy and procedural controls.

Fair
Value of Marketing and Trading Derivative Contracts

The
following tables reconcile the changes in the net fair value of Occidental’s marketing and trading contracts, a portion of
which are hedges, during 2005 and 2004 and segregate the open contracts at December 31, 2005 by maturity periods.

(a)

Primarily
      relates to production hedges.


(a)

The
      underlying prices utilized for the 2006 and 2007 fair value calculation of the options are based on monthly NYMEX published
      prices. The underlying prices for years 2008 through 2011 are based on the year-end NYMEX published prices, as published
      monthly prices are not available. These prices are input into an industry standard options pricing model to determine fair
      value.

Production
Hedges

During
the first quarter of 2005, Occidental entered into a series of fixed price swaps and costless collar agreements that qualify as
cash-flow hedges for the sale of its crude oil production. These hedges, which began in July 2005 and continue to the end of 2011,
hedge less than 4 percent of Occidental’s 2005 crude oil production. Information about these cash-flow hedges, which are
included in the total fair value of ($457) million in the table above, is presented in a tabular presentation below.

Quantitative
Information

Occidental
uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes in fair values of commodity-based derivatives and commodity
contracts used in marketing and trading activities. This method determines the maximum potential negative short-term change in fair
value with a 95-percent level of confidence. The marketing and trading value at risk was immaterial during all of 2005.

Interest
Rate Risk

General

Occidental's
exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to its long-term debt obligations. In 2005, Occidental terminated all of its
interest-rate swaps that were accounted for as fair-value hedges. These hedges had effectively converted approximately $1.7 billion
of fixed-rate debt to variable-rate debt. The fair value of the swaps at termination resulted in a gain of approximately $20
million, which is being amortized into income over the remaining life of the previously hedged debt. The amount of interest expense
recorded in the income statement was lower, as a result of the swaps and amortization of the deferred gain, by approximately $21
million, $56 million and $58 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Occidental
was a party to a series of forward interest-rate locks, which qualified as cash-flow hedges. The hedges were related to the
construction of a cogeneration plant leased by Occidental that was completed in December 2002. The unamortized loss on the hedges at
December 31, 2005 was approximately $19 million after-tax, which is recorded in accumulated OCI and is being recognized in earnings
over the lease term of 26 years on a straight-line basis.

Certain
of Occidental's equity investees have entered into additional derivative instruments that qualify as cash-flow hedges. Occidental
reflects its proportionate share of these cash-flow hedges in OCI.

Presentation of Interest Rate Risk

In millions of U.S.
dollars, except rates

The
table below provides information about Occidental's debt obligations which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Debt amounts
represent principal payments by maturity date.

(a)

Excludes $4
      million of unamortized debt discounts and $13 million of net unamortized gains related to the settled interest-rate
      swaps.


Credit
Risk

Occidental’s
energy contracts are spread among several counterparties. Creditworthiness is reviewed before doing business with a new counterparty
and on an ongoing basis. Occidental monitors aggregated counterparty exposure relative to credit limits, and manages
credit-enhancement issues. Credit exposure for each customer is monitored for outstanding balances, current month activity, and
forward mark-to-market exposure and losses associated with credit risk have been immaterial.

Foreign
Currency Risk

A
few of Occidental’s foreign operations have currency risk. Occidental manages its exposure primarily by balancing monetary
assets and liabilities and maintaining cash positions only at levels necessary for operating purposes. Most international crude oil
sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Additionally, all of Occidental’s oil and gas consolidated foreign entities have the
U.S. dollar as the functional currency. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, Occidental had not entered into any foreign currency
derivative instruments. The effect of exchange-rate transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income and is
immaterial.

The
management of Occidental Petroleum  Corporation  (Occidental) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting. Occidental’s system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Occidental’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of Occidental’s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that Occidental’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
Occidental’s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Occidental’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management
has assessed the effectiveness of Occidental’s internal control system as of December 31, 2005 based on the criteria for
effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of
December 31, 2005, Occidental’s system of internal control over financial reporting is effective.

Occidental’s
independent auditors, KPMG LLP, have issued an attestation report on management’s assessment of Occidental’s internal
control over financial reporting.

Occidental
Petroleum Corporation:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Occidental Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, comprehensive income and
cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2005. In connection with our audits of the consolidated
financial statements, we also have audited the accompanying financial statement schedule. These consolidated financial statements
and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Occidental Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the
basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein.

As
explained in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, effective July 1, 2005, the Company changed its method of accounting
for share-based payments.  Effective January 1, 2003, the Company changed its method of accounting for inventories purchased from
third parties and its method of accounting for asset retirement obligations. Effective April 1, 2003, the Company changed its method
of accounting for the consolidation of variable interest entities. Effective July 1, 2003, the Company changed its method of
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of Occidental Petroleum Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on
criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 28, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s
assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control over financial reporting.

Occidental
Petroleum Corporation:

We
have audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Assessment of and Report on
Occidental’s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Occidental Petroleum Corporation and its subsidiaries (the
Company) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in
Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management's assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, management's assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established
in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO).

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of Occidental Petroleum Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2005, and our report dated February 28, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
consolidated financial statements.

NTITIES

Investments
in unconsolidated entities include both equity method and available-for-sale investments. Amounts representing Occidental’s
percentage interest in the underlying net assets of affiliates (excluding undivided interests in oil and gas exploration and
production ventures) in which it does not have a majority voting interest but as to which it exercises significant influence, are
accounted for under the equity method.  Occidental records its share of gains or losses that arise from equity-method investee stock
issuances in the income statement.  Occidental reviews equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred.  The amount of impairment, if any, is based on
quoted market prices, where available, or other valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows.

Investments
in which Occidental does not exercise significant influence are accounted for as available-for-sale investments and are carried at
fair value, based on quoted market prices, with unrealized gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income (OCI), net of
taxes, until such investment is realized.  In disposal, the accumulated unrealized gain or loss included in OCI is transferred to
income.

ECOGNITION

Revenue
is recognized from oil and gas production when title has passed to the customer, which occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue
from marketing and trading activities is recognized on settled transactions, upon completion of contract terms and for physical
deliveries upon title transfer.  For unsettled transactions, contracts that meet specified accounting criteria are marked to market.
Revenue from all marketing and trading activities, including revenue from buy/sell arrangements with the same counterparty, is
reported on a net basis.

Revenue
from chemical product sales is recognized when the product is shipped and title has passed to the customer. Prices are fixed at the
time of shipment. Customer incentive programs provide for payments or credits to be made to customers based on the volume of product
purchased over a defined period. Total customer incentive payments over a given period are estimated and recorded as a reduction to
revenue ratably over the contract period.  Such estimates are evaluated and revised as warranted.

NCERTAINTIES

The
process of preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles
requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding certain types of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Such estimates
primarily relate to unsettled transactions and events as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, upon
settlement, actual results may differ from estimated amounts, generally not by material amounts.  Management believes that these
estimates and assumptions provide a reasonable basis for the fair presentation of Occidental’s financial position and results
of operations.

Included
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet are deferred tax assets of $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2005, the noncurrent
portion of which is netted against deferred income tax liabilities. Realization of these assets is dependent upon Occidental
generating sufficient future taxable income.  Occidental expects to realize the recorded deferred tax assets through future
operating income and reversal of taxable temporary differences.


The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include assets of approximately $5.2 billion as of December 31, 2005, and net sales
of approximately $4.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005, relating to Occidental’s operations in countries outside
North America.  Some of these countries may be considered politically and economically unstable. These assets and the related
operations are subject to the risk of actions by governmental authorities and insurgent groups. Occidental attempts to conduct its
financial affairs so as to mitigate its exposure against such risks and would seek compensation in the event of
nationalization.

Since
Occidental’s major products are commodities, significant changes in the prices of oil and gas and chemical products may have a
significant impact on Occidental’s results of operations for any particular year.

NVESTMENTS

In
2005, Occidental reclassified its auction rate security investments from cash and cash equivalents to short-term investments on its
consolidated balance sheets.  These investments contain a short-term repricing feature. As a result, their carrying values
approximate their fair values.  There have been no realized gains or losses on these investments during 2005 or 2004. Prior period
financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. This reclassification resulted in no change to
Occidental’s results of operations or cash flow from operations for any period.

NVENTORIES

For
the oil and gas segment, materials and supplies are valued at the lower of average cost or market. Inventories are reviewed
periodically for obsolescence. Oil and natural gas liquids (NGLs) inventories and natural gas trading and storage inventory are
valued at the lower of cost or market.

For
the chemical segment, Occidental generally values its inventories using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method as it better matches
current costs and current revenue. Accordingly, Occidental accounts for most of its domestic inventories in its chemical business,
other than materials and supplies, on the LIFO method. For other countries, Occidental uses the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method
(if the costs of goods are specifically identifiable) or the average-cost method (if the costs of goods are not specifically
identifiable). Occidental accounts for materials and supplies using a weighted average cost method.

QUIPMENT

Oil
and Gas

Property
additions and major renewals and improvements are capitalized at cost. Interest costs incurred in connection with major capital
expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the lives of the related assets (see Note 16).

Occidental
uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties. Under this method, costs of acquiring properties,
costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs are capitalized. The costs of exploratory wells are initially
capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found. At the completion of drilling activities, the costs
of exploratory wells remain capitalized if a determination is made that proved reserves have been found. If no proved reserves have
been found, the costs of each of the related exploratory wells are charged to expense. In some cases, a determination of proved
reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling, requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells. Occidental's
practice is to expense the costs of such exploratory wells if a determination of proved reserves has not been made within a
twelve-month period after drilling is complete. Occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of
commercial viability is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures. Annual lease rentals and exploration,
geological, geophysical and seismic costs are expensed as incurred.

The
following table summarizes the activity of capitalized exploratory well costs for the past three years:

The
cost related to exploratory wells that have been capitalized longer than a twelve-month period was immaterial for 2005, 2004 and
2003.


Proved
oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs that geological and engineering data
demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, can be recovered in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating
conditions considering future production and development costs. Depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties is
determined by the unit-of-production method.

The
carrying value of Occidental’s property, plant and equipment (PP&E) is based on the cost incurred to acquire the PP&E,
net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) and net of any impairment charges. For acquisitions of a
business, PP&E is determined by an allocation of total purchase price to the components on a relative fair-value basis.
Occidental is required to perform impairment tests on its assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in
the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or
when management’s plans change with respect to those assets.  Occidental assesses assets for impairment by comparing
undiscounted future cash flows of an asset to its carrying value.  Impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair values,
generally their estimated discounted future net pre-tax cash flows.

A
portion of the carrying value of Occidental’s oil and gas properties are attributable to unproved properties. At December 31,
2005, the capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties, net of accumulated valuation allowance, were $788 million. These
costs are not currently being depreciated or depleted. As exploration and development work progresses and the reserves on these
properties are proven, capitalized costs attributable to the properties will be subject to depreciation and depletion. If the
exploration and development work were to be unsuccessful, the capitalized costs of the properties related to this unsuccessful work
would be expensed in the year in which the determination was made. The timing of any writedowns of these unproven properties, if
warranted, depends upon the nature, timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results. Occidental
believes its exploration and development efforts will allow it to realize the unproved property balance.

Chemical

Occidental’s
chemical plants are depreciated using either the unit-of-production or straight-line method based upon the estimated useful life of
the facilities.

The
estimated useful lives of Occidental’s chemical assets, which range from 3 years to 50 years, are used to compute depreciation
expense and are also used for impairment tests. The estimated useful lives used for the chemical facilities are based on the
assumption that Occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to ensure productive capacity is sustained.
Without these continued expenditures, the useful lives of these plants could significantly decrease. Other factors which could
change the estimated useful lives of Occidental’s chemical plants include sustained higher or lower product prices, which are
particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition, feedstock costs, energy prices, environmental regulations,
competition and technological changes.

Occidental
performs impairment tests on its chemical assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated
useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or when
management’s plans change with respect to those assets. Occidental compares the undiscounted future cash flows of an asset to
its carrying value. The key factors that could significantly affect future cash flows are future product prices, which are
particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition, feedstock costs, energy costs, significantly increased regulation
and remaining estimated useful life.  Impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair values.

Due
to a temporary decrease in demand for some of its products, Occidental temporarily idled an ethylene dichloride (EDC) plant in June
2001 and a chlor-alkali plant in December 2001. Subsequent to the purchase of the Vulcan Materials Company (Vulcan) chemical assets,
Occidental reviewed all of its chemical assets and decided to close its least competitive plants and upgrade the remaining
operations. As a result of this review, Occidental recorded a $139 million pre-tax charge for the write-off of these two previously
idled chemical plants and one currently operated plant and an additional pre-tax charge of $20 million for the writedown of another
chemical plant in 2005.

XPENDITURES

Environmental
expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Reserves for estimated costs that relate
to existing conditions caused by past operations and that do not contribute to current or future revenue generation are recorded
when environmental remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. In determining the reserves and the
reasonably possible range of loss, Occidental refers to currently available information, including relevant past experience,
available technology, regulations in effect, the timing of remediation and cost-sharing arrangements. The environmental reserves are
based on management’s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred and are reviewed periodically and adjusted as additional
or new information becomes available. Environmental reserves are recorded on a discounted basis only when a reserve is initially
established and the aggregate amount of the estimated costs for a specific site and the timing of cash payments are reliably
determinable. The reserve methodology for a specific site is not modified once it has been established. Recoveries and
reimbursements are recorded in income when receipt is probable. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, Occidental has not
accrued any reimbursements or indemnification recoveries for environmental remediation matters as assets.


Many
factors could result in changes to Occidental’s environmental reserves and reasonably possible range of loss. The most
significant are:

Additionally,
other events might occur that could affect Occidental’s future remediation costs, such as:

Ø

The discovery
      of more extensive contamination than had been originally anticipated. For some sites with impacted groundwater, accurate
      definition of contaminant plumes requires years of monitoring data and computer modeling. Migration of contaminants may follow
      unexpected pathways along geologic anomalies that could initially go undetected. Additionally, the size of the area requiring
      remediation may change based upon risk assessment results following site characterization or interim remedial
      measures.

Ø

Improved
      remediation technology might decrease the cost of remediation. In particular, for groundwater remediation sites with projected
      long-term operation and maintenance, the development of more effective treatment technology, or acceptance of alternative and
      more cost-effective treatment methodologies such as bioremediation, could significantly affect remediation costs.

Ø

Laws
      and regulations might change to impose more or less stringent remediation requirements.

At
sites involving multiple parties, Occidental provides environmental reserves based upon its expected share of liability. When other
parties are jointly liable, the financial viability of the parties, the degree of their commitment to participate and the
consequences to Occidental of their failure to participate are evaluated when estimating Occidental's ultimate share of liability.
Based on these factors, Occidental believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of other potentially
responsible parties, with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable, in an amount that would have a material effect on
Occidental’s consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

Most
cost sharing arrangements with other parties fall into one of the following three categories:

Category

: Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) or state-equivalent sites wherein Occidental
and other alleged potentially responsible parties share the cost of remediation in accordance with negotiated or prescribed
allocations;

Category

: Oil and gas joint ventures wherein each joint venture partner pays its proportionate share of remedial cost; and

Category

: Contractual arrangements typically relating to purchases and sales of property wherein the parties to the transaction agree
to methods of allocating the costs of environmental remediation.

In
all three of these categories, Occidental records as a reserve its expected net cost of remedial activities, as adjusted by
recognition for any nonperforming parties.

In
addition to the costs of investigating and implementing remedial measures, which often take in excess of ten years at CERCLA sites,
Occidental’s reserves include management’s estimates of the cost of operation and maintenance of remedial systems. To the
extent that the remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in site-specific data, laws, regulations,
technologies or engineering estimates, Occidental reviews and changes the reserves accordingly on a site-specific basis.

Occidental
recognizes the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which the liability is incurred or
becomes reasonably estimable and if there is a legal obligation to dismantle the asset and reclaim or remediate the property at the
end of its useful life. The liability amounts are based on future retirement cost estimates and incorporate many assumptions such as
expected economic recoveries of oil and gas, time to abandonment, future inflation rates and the adjusted risk free rate of
interest. When the liability is initially recorded, Occidental capitalizes the cost by increasing the related PP&E balances.
Over time, the liability is increased and expense is recognized for the change in its present value, and the initial capitalized
cost is depreciated over the useful life of the asset. No market risk premium has been included in Occidental’s liability since
no reliable estimate can be made at this time. See Note 4.


The
following table summarizes the activity of the asset retirement obligation, of which $228 million and $199 million is included in

NSTRUMENTS

All
derivative instruments required to be marked-to-market under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, as amended,
are carried at fair value. The related assets are included in receivables from joint ventures, partnerships and other and long-term
receivables. The related liabilities are included in accrued liabilities and deferred credits and other liabilities — other.
Occidental classifies its fair value swap interest receipts as reductions of interest expense. Cash flow hedge realized gains and
losses, and any ineffectiveness, are classified within the net sales line item. Gains and losses are netted in the income statement
and are netted on the balance sheets when a right of offset exists.

Occidental
applies either fair value or cash flow hedge accounting when transactions meet specified criteria for hedge accounting treatment.
If the derivative does not qualify as a hedge or is not designated as a hedge, the gain or loss is immediately recognized in
earnings. If the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting, the gain or loss on the derivative is either recognized in income with
an offsetting adjustment to the basis of the item being hedged for fair value hedges, or deferred in OCI to the extent the hedge is
effective for cash flow hedges.

A
hedge is regarded as highly effective and qualifies for hedge accounting if, at inception and throughout its life, it is expected
that changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item are almost fully offset by the changes in the fair value or changes
in cash flows of the hedging instrument and actual effectiveness is within a range of 80 percent to 125 percent. In the case of
hedging a forecasted transaction, the transaction must be highly probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows
that could ultimately affect reported net income or loss.  Occidental discontinues hedge accounting when it is determined that a
derivative has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge; when the derivative expires, or is sold, terminated, or exercised; when the
hedged item matures or is sold or repaid; when a forecasted transaction is no longer deemed highly probable; or when the derivative
is no longer designated as a hedge.

Occidental
has established several shareholder-approved stock-based incentive plans for certain employees (Plans) that are more fully described
in Note 12. Beginning July 1, 2005, Occidental accounted for those Plans under SFAS No. 123R, “Share Based Payments.”
Prior to July 1, 2005, Occidental applied the APB Opinion No. 25 intrinsic value accounting method for its stock-based incentive
plans. A summary of Occidental’s accounting policy under each method follows below.

SFAS
No. 123R

For
restricted stock units (RSUs), compensation expense is measured on the grant date using the quoted market price of Occidental’s
common stock. For stock options (Options) and performance stock awards (PSAs), compensation expense is measured on the grant date
using valuation models. Compensation expense for RSUs, Options and PSAs, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite
service periods, which is generally over the awards’ respective vesting periods. For the PSAs, every quarter until vesting, the
cash settled portion is revalued using valuation models and the stock settled portion is adjusted for any change in the number of
shares expected to be issued based on the performance criteria.  Any change in fair value is recognized as compensation expense. For
stock appreciation rights (SARs), compensation expense is initially measured on the grant date using a valuation model. For cash
settled SARs, compensation expense is recorded on the accelerated amortization method over the vesting period and changes in the
fair value between the date of grant and through when the cash-settled SARs are exercised are recognized as compensation
expense.


APB
Opinion No. 25

Through
June 30, 2005, compensation expense for Options and RSUs, if any, was measured as the difference between the quoted market price of
Occidental's stock at the grant date, less the amount that the employee must pay to acquire the stock. Any compensation expense for
these awards was recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting periods of the respective awards. For PSAs, compensation
expense was measured for each period based on the number of shares expected to vest and the changes in the quoted market value of
Occidental's stock during the vesting period. PSAs compensation expense or benefit, as applicable, was recognized on a straight-line
basis over the vesting periods of the awards. Compensation expense for SARs, which was recorded on the accelerated amortization
method over the vesting period, was measured as the amount by which the quoted market value of Occidental's stock exceeded the SAR
exercise price. The effect of changes in Occidental's share price between the date of grant and the date when the SARs were
exercised or expired was recognized as compensation expense in each period.

Occidental
periodically uses different types of derivative instruments to achieve the best prices for oil and gas. Derivatives are also used by
Occidental to reduce its exposure to price volatility and mitigate fluctuations in commodity-related cash flows. Occidental enters
into low-risk marketing and trading activities through its separate marketing organization, which operates under established policy
controls and procedures.  With respect to derivatives used in its oil and gas marketing operations, Occidental utilizes a
combination of futures, forwards, options and swaps to offset various physical transactions. Occidental's use of derivatives in
marketing and trading activities primarily relates to managing cash flows from third-party purchases, which includes
Occidental’s periodic gas storage activities.

Production
Hedges

During
the first quarter of 2005, Occidental entered into a series of fixed price swaps and costless collar agreements that qualify as
cash-flow hedges for the sale of its crude oil production. These hedges, which began in July 2005 and continue to the end of 2011,
hedge less than 4 percent of Occidental’s 2005 crude oil production.

Occidental
is exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates and it enters into various derivative financial instruments to manage
interest-rate exposure. Interest-rate swaps, forward locks and futures contracts are entered into periodically as part of
Occidental’s overall strategy to manage its interest rate risk exposures.

Hedging
Activities

In
2005, Occidental terminated all of its interest-rate swaps that were accounted for as fair-value hedges. These hedges had
effectively converted approximately $1.7 billion of fixed-rate debt to variable-rate debt. The fair value of the swaps at
termination resulted in a gain of approximately $20 million, which is being amortized into income over the remaining life of the
previously hedged debt. The amount of interest expense recorded in the income statement was lower, as a result of the swaps and
amortization of the deferred gain, by approximately $21 million, $56 million and $58 million for the years ended December 31, 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively.

Occidental
was a party to a series of forward interest-rate locks, which qualified as cash-flow hedges. The hedges were related to the
construction of a cogeneration plant leased by Occidental that was completed in December 2002. The unamortized loss on the hedges at
December 31, 2005 was approximately $19 million after-tax, which is recorded in accumulated OCI and is being recognized in earnings
over the lease term of 26 years on a straight-line basis.

In
2005, Occidental announced the acquisition of Vintage Petroleum, Inc. (Vintage). In January 2006, Occidental completed the Vintage
acquisition and paid $1.4 billion to former Vintage shareholders for the cash portion of the merger consideration and issued 28
million shares for the stock portion, which was valued at $2.1 billion. The value of Occidental’s shares was determined by the
average share price for the five-day period beginning two days before the acquisition announcement. In addition, Occidental assumed
Vintage’s debt, which had an estimated fair market value of $585 million at closing. Occidental intends to divest a portion of
these assets.

In
2005, Occidental made several oil and gas producing property acquisitions in the Permian Basin for approximately $1.7 billion in
cash. This was partially offset by cash proceeds totaling $171 million from dispositions of a portion of the acquired properties. No
gain or loss was recorded for these dispositions.

Occidental
suspended all activities in Libya in 1986 as a result of economic sanctions imposed by the United States government. During the
imposition of sanctions, Occidental derived no economic benefit from its Libyan interests. In 2004, the United States government
lifted all of the principal economic sanctions against Libya. However, Libya continues to be designated as a country supporting
international terrorism under section 6(j) of the United States Export Administration Act and, as such, continues to be subject to
certain limited sanctions.

On
August 11, 2005, the Libyan authorities approved the terms of Occidental’s participation in the assets that it left in 1986,
effective as of July 1, 2005. The agreement allows Occidental to return to its Libyan operations on generally the same terms in
effect when activities were suspended. Those assets consist of three producing contracts in the Sirte Basin and four exploration
blocks. Occidental paid approximately $133 million in re-entry bonuses and capital adjustment and work-in-progress payments and is
required to pay $10 million per year while it continues to operate in Libya, as reimbursements for past development costs associated
with the historical assets. In addition, Occidental has committed to spend $90 million over the next five years in the four
exploration blocks.  Currently, Occidental’s rights in the producing fields extend through 2009 and early 2010.

Separately,
in early 2005, Occidental participated in the EPSA IV exploration bid round in Libya. Occidental successfully bid on nine of the 15
areas available. Occidental is the operator of five onshore areas and has a 90-percent exploration working interest. In addition,
Occidental holds a 35-percent exploration working interest in four offshore areas. Woodside Petroleum Ltd. is the operator for the
offshore areas. Occidental paid approximately $90 million in exploration lease bonuses for these nine new areas and committed to
spend an additional $125 million over the next five years.

In
July 2005, Occidental signed a new production-sharing contract (PSC) for the Mukhaizna oil field with the Government of the
Sultanate of Oman. Under the terms of the new PSC, Occidental took over field operations on September 1, 2005, for a cost of $137
million. Occidental holds a 45-percent working interest.


In
June 2005, Occidental completed the purchase of three chlor-alkali chemical manufacturing facilities from Vulcan for $214 million in
cash, plus contingent payments based upon the future performance of these facilities and the assumption of certain liabilities. In
order to facilitate receipt of regulatory approval for this acquisition, Occidental divested one of the facilities.


In
January 2004, Occidental acquired a 1,300-mile oil pipeline and gathering system located in the Permian Basin for approximately $143

For
strategic and economic reasons, Occidental exited the vinyl specialty resins business by closing the Pottstown, Pennsylvania
manufacturing facility (Specialty Resins) effective January 5, 2005, and recorded an after-tax charge of $32 million as of December
31, 2004. Occidental's assets and liabilities related to Specialty Resins are classified as held for sale and as discontinued
operations in the income statements for all periods presented. Specialty Resins' net sales included in discontinued operations were
$27 million, $98 million and $86 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and net gains (losses) from discontinued operations
were $6 million, $(38) million and $(6) million, respectively.


In
2003, Occidental made several oil and gas acquisitions in the Permian Basin for approximately $317 million in cash and sold
approximately $34 million of these assets shortly thereafter. No gain or loss was recorded on these sales.

EITF
Issue No. 04-13

In
September 2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) finalized the provisions of EITF Issue No. 04-13, “Accounting for
Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty”, which provides accounting guidance about whether buy/sell
arrangements should be accounted for at historical cost and whether these arrangements should be reported on a gross or net basis.
Buy/sell arrangements typically are contractual arrangements where the buy and sell agreements are entered into in contemplation of
one another with the same counterparty.  Occidental reports all buy/sell arrangements on a net basis and at historical cost. This
EITF is effective in the first interim period beginning after March 15, 2006, and Occidental will prospectively adopt this statement
in the second quarter of 2006. Occidental is currently assessing the effect of EITF Issue No. 04-13, but does not expect it to have
a material effect on its financial statements.

FIN
No. 47

In
March 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 47, “Accounting for
Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations.” FIN 47 specifies the accounting treatment for conditional asset retirement
obligations under the provisions of SFAS No. 143. FIN 47 is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after December
15, 2005. Occidental has identified conditional asset retirement obligations at a certain number of its facilities that are mainly
related to plant decommissioning. Under FIN 47, which Occidental adopted on December 31, 2005, Occidental is required to record the
fair value of these conditional liabilities if they can be reasonably estimated. However, Occidental believes that there is an
indeterminate settlement date for these asset retirement obligations because the range of time over which Occidental may settle
these obligations is unknown or cannot be estimated. Therefore, Occidental cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of these
liabilities. Occidental will recognize these conditional asset retirement obligations in the periods in which sufficient information
becomes available to reasonably estimate their fair values.

SFAS
No. 123R

On
July 1, 2005, Occidental early adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based Payments”,
under the modified prospective transition method. Since most of Occidental’s existing stock-based compensation was already
being recorded in the income statement, Occidental decided to early adopt SFAS 123R, so that the remaining awards would be accounted
for in a similar manner. Prior to July 1, 2005, Occidental applied the Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25 intrinsic
value accounting method for its stock incentive plans. Under the modified prospective transition method, the fair value recognition
provisions apply only to new awards or awards modified after July 1, 2005. Additionally, the fair value of existing unvested awards
at the date of adoption is recorded in compensation expense over the remaining requisite service period. Results from prior periods
have not been restated. As a result of adopting this statement in the third quarter of 2005, Occidental recorded a $3 million
after-tax credit as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles. See Note 12 for more information.


FASB
Staff Position No. (FSP) FAS 19-1

In
April 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. (FSP) FAS 19-1, “Accounting for Suspended Well Costs.” FSP FAS 19-1
provides new accounting guidance that specifies when successful efforts companies can capitalize exploratory well costs. The
guidance also requires new disclosures related to these costs. FSP FAS 19-1 is effective in the first reporting period beginning
after April 4, 2005, and will be applied prospectively to existing and new exploratory well costs. Occidental adopted this statement
effective July 1, 2005, and there was no material effect on the financial statements upon adoption. See Note 1 for the new
disclosures.

SFAS
No. 153

In
December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, "Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29." SFAS No. 153
specifies the criteria required to record a nonmonetary asset exchange using carryover basis. SFAS No. 153 is effective for
nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring after July 1, 2005. Occidental adopted this statement in the third quarter of 2005 and there
was no material effect on the financial statements upon adoption.

SFAS
No. 151

In
November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costs, an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Chapter 4." SFAS
No. 151 clarifies the accounting treatment for various inventory costs and overhead allocations. SFAS No. 151 is effective for
inventory costs incurred after July 1, 2005. Occidental adopted this statement in the third quarter of 2005 and it did not have a
material effect on the financial statements when adopted.

FSP
FAS 106-2

In
May 2004, the FASB issued FSP FAS 106-2, "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003," which specifies the accounting and disclosure requirements for the prescription drug
benefits that are available under this new plan. Occidental adopted the disclosure provisions of this pronouncement in the second
quarter of 2004. See Note 13 for more information.

FIN
46-R (Revised)

In
December 2003, the FASB revised FIN 46 to exempt certain entities from its requirements and to clarify certain issues arising during
the initial implementation of FIN 46. Occidental adopted the revised interpretation in the first quarter of 2004 and it did not have
a material impact on the financial statements when adopted.

SFAS
No. 143

Effective
January 1, 2003 Occidental adopted SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." SFAS No. 143 addresses financial
accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset
retirement costs. See Note 1 for more information.

The
initial adoption of SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003 resulted in an after-tax charge of $50 million, which was recorded as a
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles. The adoption increased net PP&E by $73 million, increased asset
retirement obligations by $151 million and decreased deferred tax liabilities by $28 million.

EITF
Issue No. 02-3

In
October 2002, Occidental adopted certain provisions of EITF Issue No. 02-3, "Issues involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts
Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities." As a result of adopting EITF
Issue No. 02-3, there were no changes to gross margins, net income, cash flow, or earnings per share for any period; however, net
sales and cost of sales were reduced by equal and offsetting amounts to reflect the adoption of this requirement.

From
1999 to 2002, Occidental accounted for certain energy-trading contracts in accordance with EITF Issue No. 98-10, "Accounting for
Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities." EITF Issue No. 98-10 required that all energy-trading
contracts must be marked to fair value with gains and losses included in earnings, whether the contracts were derivatives or not. In
October 2002, the EITF rescinded EITF Issue No. 98-10 thus precluding mark-to-market accounting for all energy-trading contracts
that are not derivatives and fair value accounting for inventories purchased from third parties. Also, the rescission requires
derivative gains and losses to be presented net on the income statement, whether or not they are physically settled, if the
derivative instruments are held for trading purposes. Occidental adopted this accounting change in the first quarter of 2003 and
recorded an $18 million after-tax charge as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles.

Long-term
debt consisted of the following:

At December
      31, 2005, long-term debt includes unamortized interest rate swap settlement net gains of $13 million. At December 31, 2004,
      long-term debt includes mark-to-market adjustments due to fair value hedges of $44 million.

On
June 18, 2004, Occidental entered into a $1.5 billion five-year revolving bank credit facility (Credit Facility). Up to $200 million
of the Credit Facility is available in the form of letters of credit. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at various
benchmark rates, including LIBOR, plus a margin based on Occidental's senior debt ratings. Additionally, Occidental pays an annual
facility fee (ranging from 0.08 percent to 0.11 percent in 2005) on the total commitment amount, which is based on Occidental's
senior debt ratings. The Credit Facility provides for the termination of the loan commitments and requires immediate repayment of
any outstanding amounts if certain events of default occur or if Occidental files for bankruptcy. Occidental had not drawn down any
amounts on the Credit Facility at December 31, 2005.

In
2005, Occidental recorded $42 million of pre-tax interest charges to redeem all of the outstanding 5.875-percent senior notes,
4.101-percent medium-term senior notes and 7.65-percent senior notes and to purchase in the open market and retire various amounts
of Occidental senior notes and unsecured subsidiary notes.

In
2004, Occidental recorded a $3 million pre-tax interest charge related to the open market purchase and retirement of $51 million of
its senior notes, and a $3 million pre-tax interest charge, net of a $2 million gain related to the settlement of an interest-rate
swap, to redeem all of its $157 million outstanding 6.5-percent senior notes which were due in 2005.


At
December 31, 2005, minimum principal payments on long-term debt subsequent to December 31, 2005 aggregated $2,910 million, of which
$46 million is due in 2006, $157 million in 2007, $405 million in 2008, $520 million in 2009, $265 million in 2010, $68 million in
2011 and $1,449 million thereafter. These amounts do not include the unamortized discount of $4 million and interest rate swap
settlement net gains of $13 million. The unamortized discount is generally being amortized to interest expense on the effective
interest method over the lives of the related issuances. The net gains relating to the interest swap settlements are being amortized
into income over the remaining lives of the previously hedged debt issues.

At
December 31, 2005, under the most restrictive covenants of certain financing agreements, Occidental's capacity for additional
unsecured borrowing was approximately $34.6 billion and the capacity for the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on,
and for acquisitions of, Occidental’s capital stock was approximately $13.0 billion, assuming that such dividends,
distributions and acquisitions were made without incurring additional borrowings.

Occidental
estimates the fair value of its long-term debt based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the yields
offered to Occidental for debt of similar rating and similar remaining maturities. The estimated fair values of Occidental’s
debt, at December 31, 2005 and 2004, were approximately $3.4 billion and approximately $4.3 billion, respectively, compared with a
carrying value of approximately $2.9 billion, and approximately $3.8 billion, respectively.

include renewal and/or purchase options and require Occidental to pay for utilities, taxes, insurance and maintenance
expense.

At
December 31, 2005, future net minimum lease payments for capital and operating leases (excluding oil and gas and other mineral

XPENDITURES

Occidental’s
operations in the United States are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to improving or
maintaining environmental quality.  Foreign operations also are subject to environmental-protection laws. Costs associated with
environmental compliance have increased over time and are expected to rise in the future. Environmental expenditures related to
current operations are factored into the overall business planning process and are considered an integral part of production in
manufacturing quality products responsive to market demand.

EMEDIATION

The
laws that require or address environmental remediation may apply retroactively to past waste disposal practices and releases. In
many cases, the laws apply regardless of fault, legality of the original activities or current ownership or control of sites. OPC or
certain of its subsidiaries are currently participating in environmental assessments and cleanups under these laws at federal
Superfund sites, comparable state sites and other domestic and foreign remediation sites, including Occidental facilities and
previously owned sites. Also, OPC and certain of its subsidiaries have been involved in a substantial number of governmental and
private proceedings involving historical practices at various sites including, in some instances, having been named in proceedings
under CERCLA and similar federal, state and local environmental laws. These proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation
and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages and civil penalties.

Occidental
manages its environmental remediation efforts through a wholly owned subsidiary, Glenn Springs Holdings, Inc., which reports its
results directly to Occidental’s corporate management. The following table presents Occidental's environmental remediation
reserves, the current portion of which is included in accrued liabilities ($83 million in 2005, $76 million in 2004 and $76 million
in 2003) and the remainder in deferred credits and other liabilities — other ($335 million in 2005, $299 million in 2004 and
$296 million in 2003). The reserves are grouped by three categories of environmental remediation sites:

The
following table shows environmental reserve activity for the past three years:

Occidental
expects to expend funds equivalent to about half of the current environmental reserve over the next three years and the balance over
the next ten or more years. Occidental believes it is reasonably possible that it will continue to incur additional liabilities
beyond those recorded for environmental remediation at these and other sites. The range of reasonably possible loss for existing
environmental remediation matters could be up to $420 million beyond the amount accrued.  For management’s opinion, refer to
Note 9.

CERCLA
and Equivalent Sites

At
December 31, 2005, OPC or certain of its subsidiaries have been named in 128 CERCLA or state equivalent proceedings, as shown
below.

(a)

Includes 28
      sites for which Maxus Energy Corporation has retained the liability and indemnified Occidental, 7 sites where Occidental has
      denied liability without challenge, 57 sites where Occidental’s reserves are less than $50,000 each, and 13 sites where
      reserves are between $50,000 and $1 million each.

The
eight sites with individual reserves over $10 million in 2005 include a former copper mining and smelting operation in Tennessee,
two closed landfills in western New York, groundwater treatment facilities at four closed chemical plants (Montague, Michigan,
Hicksville, New York, western New York and Tacoma, Washington) and replacement of a municipal drinking water treatment plant in
western New York.


Active
Facilities

Certain
subsidiaries of OPC are currently addressing releases of substances from past operations at 18 active facilities. Five facilities
— a chemical plant in Louisiana, a phosphorous recovery operation in Tennessee, a chemical plant in Texas, a chemical plant in
Kansas and certain oil and gas properties in the southwestern United States — account for 76 percent of the reserves associated
with these facilities.

Closed
or Sold Facilities

There
are 39 sites formerly owned or operated by certain subsidiaries of OPC that have ongoing environmental remediation requirements in
which OPC or its subsidiaries are involved.  Four sites account for 63 percent of the reserves associated with this group. The four
sites are: an active refinery in Louisiana where Occidental indemnifies the current owner and operator for certain remedial actions,
a water treatment facility at a former coal mine in Pennsylvania, a closed OxyChem chemical plant in Pennsylvania and a
water-treatment facility at a former OxyChem chemical plant in North Carolina.

revenue generation. Although total costs may vary in any one year, over the long term, segment operating and capital expenditures
for environmental compliance generally are expected to increase.

OPC
and certain of its subsidiaries have been named in a substantial number of lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings. These
actions seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, breach of contract, property damage, punitive damages,
civil penalties or other losses; or injunctive or declaratory relief. OPC and certain of its subsidiaries also have been named in
proceedings under CERCLA and similar federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws. These environmental proceedings seek
funding or performance of remediation and, in some cases, compensation for alleged property damage, punitive damages and civil
penalties; however, Occidental is usually one of many companies in these proceedings and has to date been successful in sharing
response costs with other financially sound companies.  With respect to all such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, including
environmental proceedings, Occidental accrues reserves when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can
be reasonably estimated.

Since
April 2004, OxyChem, has been served with eight lawsuits filed in Nicaragua by approximately 2,200 individual plaintiffs. These
individuals allege that they have sustained several billion dollars of personal injury damages as a result of their alleged exposure
to a pesticide. OxyChem is aware of, but has not been served in, 20 additional cases in Nicaragua, which Occidental understands make
similar allegations. In the opinion of management, these claims are without merit because, among other things, OxyChem believes that
none of the pesticide it manufactured was ever sold or used in Nicaragua.  Under the applicable Nicaraguan statute, defendants are
required to pay pre-trial deposits so large as to effectively prohibit defendants from participating fully in their defense. In
previous situations, involving other defendants, Nicaraguan courts have proceeded to enter significant judgments against the
defendants under that statute. OxyChem has filed a response to the complaints contesting jurisdiction without posting such pre-trial
deposit. In December 2004, the judge in one of the cases (the "Osorio Case"), ruled the court had jurisdiction over the defendants,
including OxyChem, and that the plaintiffs had waived the requirement of the pre-trial deposit. OxyChem has appealed that portion of
the ruling relating to the jurisdiction of the Nicaraguan courts. Thereafter, the trial court ordered defendants, including OxyChem,
to file an answer. In order to preserve its jurisdictional defense, OxyChem elected not


to
make a substantive appearance in the case. In August 2005, the judge in the Osorio case entered judgment against several defendants,
including OxyChem, for damages totaling approximately $97 million. OxyChem has no assets in Nicaragua and, in the opinion of
management, any judgment rendered under the statute, including in the Osorio case, would be unenforceable in the United
States.

In
September 2004, Occidental received formal notification that Petroecuador, the state oil company of Ecuador, was initiating
proceedings to determine if Occidental had violated either its Participation Contract for Block 15 or the Ecuadorian Hydrocarbons
Law and whether the alleged violations constitute grounds for terminating the Participation Contract. Block 15 operations represent
approximately 7 percent of Occidental's 2005 consolidated production, 4 percent of its proved consolidated reserves, and 2 percent
of its total PP&E, net of accumulated DD&A.  In August 2005, Petroecuador issued a report recommending that the Minister of
Energy declare the termination of Occidental’s Participation Contract for Block 15. The principal allegation stated in the
notice and the Petroecuador report is an assertion that Occidental should have obtained government approval for the farmout
agreement entered into in 2000. In November 2005, the Minister of Energy, following the procedure set forth in the Ecuadorian
Hydrocarbons Law, requested that Occidental respond to the allegations against it. In February 2006, Occidental submitted its
response to the Minister of Energy, in which Occidental confirmed its belief that it has complied with all material obligations
under the Participation Contract and Ecuadorian law, and that any termination of the contract based upon the stated allegations
would be unfounded and would constitute an unlawful expropriation. Occidental has been cooperating with the Ecuadorian authorities
in these proceedings, and will continue to strive for an amicable resolution. Occidental currently is unable to determine the
outcome of these proceedings, but if there were to be a negotiated settlement, it is probable that the terms would effectively
reduce the future profitability of Block 15 operations.

During
the course of its operations, Occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal, state, local
and foreign tax jurisdictions. Disputes may arise during the course of such audits as to facts and matters of law. In May 2005,
Occidental entered into a closing agreement with the IRS resolving certain foreign tax credit issues as part of the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) audit of tax years 1997-2000. The closing agreement was completed after an extensive IRS review of various complex tax
issues and negotiations between Occidental and the IRS. As a result of the closing agreement, Occidental recorded a tax benefit of
$619 million in 2005 for the reversal of tax reserves that were previously established for those foreign tax credit issues. In
addition, Occidental recorded a tax benefit of $335 million in 2005 due to the reversal of tax reserves no longer required as United
States corporate returns for tax years 1998-2000 became closed due to the lapsing of the statute of limitations. These tax benefits
did not have a significant current cash effect.

At
December 31, 2005, commitments for major capital expenditures during 2006 and thereafter were approximately $804 million.

Occidental
has entered into agreements providing for future payments to secure terminal and pipeline capacity, drilling services, electrical
power, steam and certain chemical raw materials. At December 31, 2005, the net present value of the fixed and determinable portion
of the obligations under these agreements, which were used to collateralize financings of the respective suppliers, aggregated $27
million, which was payable as follows (in millions): 2006—$12, 2007—$11 and 2008—$4. Fixed payments under these
agreements were $17 million in 2005 $19 million in 2004 and $16 million in 2003.

Occidental
has certain other commitments under contracts, guarantees and joint ventures, including purchase commitments for goods and services
at market-related prices and certain other contingent liabilities. Some of these commitments, although not fixed or determinable,
involve capital expenditures and are part of the $3.0 billion capital expenditures estimated for 2006.

Occidental
has entered into various guarantees including performance bonds, letters of credit, indemnities, commitments and other forms of
guarantees provided by Occidental to third parties, mainly to provide assurance that OPC and/or its subsidiaries and affiliates will
meet their various obligations (guarantees).

At
December 31, 2005, the notional amount of the guarantees was approximately $575 million.  Of this amount, approximately $475 million
relates to Occidental’s guarantee of equity investees’ debt and other commitments. The debt guarantees and other
commitments primarily relate to the Dolphin Energy equity investment and the investment in the Ecuador Oleoducto de Crudos Pesados
Ltd. (OCP) pipeline. The remaining $100 million relates to various indemnities and guarantees provided to third parties.

Occidental
has indemnified various parties against specified liabilities that those parties might incur in the future in connection with
purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with Occidental. These indemnities usually are contingent upon the
other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds. As of December 31, 2005, Occidental is not aware of circumstances
that would lead to future indemnity claims against it for material amounts in connection with these transactions.

It
is impossible at this time to determine the ultimate liabilities that OPC and its subsidiaries may incur resulting from any
lawsuits, claims and proceedings, audits, commitments, contingencies and related matters. If these matters were to be ultimately
resolved unfavorably at amounts substantially exceeding Occidental’s reserves, an outcome not currently anticipated, it is
possible that such outcome could have a material adverse effect upon Occidental’s consolidated financial position or results of
operations.  However, after taking into account reserves, management does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of these matters
to have a material adverse effect upon Occidental’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

The
domestic and foreign components of income from continuing operations before domestic and foreign income and other taxes were as
follows:

The
provisions(credits) for domestic and foreign income and other taxes from continuing operations consisted of the
following:

The
2005 federal income tax provision includes a $619 million tax benefit related to the resolution of foreign tax credit issues with
the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and a $335 million tax benefit due to the reversal of tax reserves no longer required as United
States corporate returns for the tax years 1998 – 2000 became closed due to the lapsing of the statute of limitations. The 2005
income tax provision also includes a net $10 million charge related to a state tax issue. The 2004 federal income tax provision
includes tax benefits of $47 million resulting from the reversal of tax contingency reserves no longer required due to the
settlement of issues with the Internal Revenue Service.

The
following is a reconciliation, stated as a percentage of pre-tax income, of the United States statutory federal income tax rate to
Occidental’s effective tax rate on income from continuing operations:

(a)

Included in
      these figures is the impact of not providing United States taxes on the unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries.
      The effect on 2005 and 2004 was insignificant after considering the benefit of foreign tax credits in the United States on
      such remittances. The effect of this treatment was to reduce the United States federal tax rate by approximately 5 percent in
      2003.


The
tax effects of temporary differences resulting in deferred income taxes at December 31, 2005 and 2004 were as follows:

Included
in total deferred tax assets was a current portion aggregating $200 million and $115 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively, that was reported in prepaid expenses and other.

Occidental
has, as of December 31, 2005, foreign tax credit carryforwards of $132 million which expire in varying amounts through 2015 and
various state net operating loss carryforwards which have varying carryforward periods through 2025. Occidental established a
valuation allowance against these foreign tax credit carryforwards and state net operating losses as the Company believes these
assets will not be utilized in the statutory carryforward periods. In addition, Occidental establishes a valuation allowance against
deferred tax assets resulting from deductible temporary differences when it believes future benefit is unlikely to be
realized.

A
deferred tax liability has not been recognized for temporary differences related to Occidental’s investment in certain foreign
subsidiaries primarily as a result of unremitted earnings of consolidated subsidiaries aggregating approximately $4.0 billion at
December 31, 2005, as it is Occidental’s intention, generally, to reinvest such earnings permanently. If the earnings of these
foreign subsidiaries were not indefinitely reinvested, an additional deferred tax liability of approximately $255 million would be
required, assuming utilization of available foreign tax credits.

The
discontinued operations include an income tax charge of $3 million in 2005, and a benefit of $23 million in 2004 and $4 million in
2003.

The
cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles was reduced by an income tax charge of $2 million in 2005 and a benefit of $38
million in 2003.

Additional
paid-in capital was credited $74 million in 2005, $75 million in 2004 and $30 million in 2003 for a tax benefit from the exercise of
certain stock based compensation awards.

Occidental
has established several Plans that provide for stock-based awards in the form of Options, restricted stock, RSUs, stock bonuses,
SARs, PSAs and dividend equivalents. These awards are granted under the 1995 Incentive Stock Plan (1995 ISP), 2001 Incentive
Compensation Plan (2001 ICP) and the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plans (2005 LTIP). No further awards will be granted under the 1995
ISP and 2001 ICP plans; however, certain 1995 ISP and 2001 ICP award grants were outstanding at December 31, 2005. An aggregate of
17 million shares of Occidental common stock are reserved for issuance under the 2005 LTIP and at December 31, 2005, approximately
14 million shares of Occidental common stock were available for future awards.  Occidental also has a 1996 Restricted Stock Plan for
Non-Employee Directors (1996 DRSP), under which non-employee directors received awards of restricted stock as additional
compensation for their services as members of the Board of Directors. No further awards will be granted under the 1996 DRSP;
however, certain 1996 award grants were outstanding at December 31, 2005. All future non-employee director awards will be granted
under the 2005 LTIP.

Adoption
of SFAS No. 123R

As
discussed in Note 1, on July 1, 2005, Occidental changed its method of accounting for stock-based compensation from the APB Opinion
No. 25 intrinsic value accounting method to the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R. Prior to July 1, 2005,
Occidental had already been expensing its SARs, RSUs and PSAs. On July 1, 2005, Occidental began expensing its Options and recording
compensation expense for all its other stock-based incentive awards using fair value amounts in accordance with SFAS No.
123R.

incentive award grants.  This expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.3 years.

Certain
employees are granted Options that are settled in physical stock and SARs that are settled either only in stock or only in cash.
Exercise prices of the Options and SARs are equal to the quoted market value of Occidental’s stock on the grant date.
Generally, the Options and SARs vest ratably over three years with a maximum term of ten years. These Options and SARs may be
forfeited or accelerated under certain circumstances.

The
fair value of each Option or stock settled SAR is estimated on the grant date using the Black Scholes option valuation model. The
expected life is estimated based on the actual weighted average life of historical exercise activity of the grantee population at
the grant date. The volatility factors are based on the historical volatilities of Occidental common stock over the expected lives
as estimated on the grant date. The risk-free interest rate is the implied yield available on zero coupon (US Treasury Strip)
T-bills at the grant date with a remaining term equal to the expected life. The dividend yield is the expected annual dividend yield
over the expected life, expressed as a percentage of the stock price on the grant date. Estimates of fair value are not intended to
predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by employees who receive stock-based incentive awards, and subsequent
events may not be indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by Occidental.

The
grant date assumptions used in the Black Scholes valuation for Options and stock settled SARs are as follows:

The
grant date fair value of each stock settled SAR granted in 2005 was $21.52 and the grant date fair value of each Option granted in
2004 was $8.03. The fair value of the cash-settled SARs is also estimated using the Black Scholes model and is recalculated using
updated assumptions each quarter until they are exercised. Changes to the estimated cash-settled SARs fair value are recorded to
compensation expense.

Certain
executives are awarded PSAs that vest at the end of the four-year period following the grant date if performance targets are
certified as being met, with payouts that range from zero to 200 percent of the target award. In June 2005, the holders of
substantially all of Occidental’s unvested PSAs agreed to modify the settlement provisions to provide that the first 100
percent payout will be settled only in physical stock and any payout in excess of 100 percent will be settled only in cash. There
was no incremental compensation expense resulting from this modification.

The
fair values of the stock settled portion of PSAs are estimated on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model that uses the
assumptions noted in the following table. The expected life is based on the vesting period (Term). The volatility factors are based
on the historical volatilities of Occidental stock over the Term. The risk-free interest rate is the implied yield available on zero
coupon (US Treasury Strip) T-bills at the time of grant with a remaining term equal to the Term. The dividend yield is the expected
annual dividend yield over the Term, expressed as a percentage of the stock price on the grant date. Estimates of fair value are not
intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by certain employees who receive stock incentive awards,
and subsequent events may not be indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by
Occidental.

The
grant-date assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation model for stock settled PSAs are as follows:

NFORMATION

As
a result of adopting SFAS No. 123R on July 1, 2005, Occidental’s income before income taxes and net income for the year ended
December 31, 2005 were approximately $12 million and $8 million lower, respectively, than if it had continued to account for stock
incentive compensation under the intrinsic value method. Had Occidental continued to use the intrinsic value method, the effect on
Basic and Diluted earnings per share would have been an increase of approximately $.02 per share.

Prior
to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, Occidental presented all tax benefits of deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options
as operating cash flows in the Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS No. 123R requires the cash flows resulting from tax deductions in
excess of the compensation cost recognized for those stock incentive awards (excess tax benefits) to be classified as financing cash
flows. The $36 million excess tax benefit classified as a financing cash inflow for the year ended December 31, 2005, would have
been classified as an operating cash inflow if Occidental had not adopted SFAS No. 123R.

The
following table shows the pro forma net income and earnings per share that Occidental would have recorded if compensation expense
was determined using SFAS No. 123R for these periods. The 2005 pro forma information is provided because Occidental did not adopt
SFAS No. 123R until July 1, 2005 (amounts in millions, except per share amounts).

Occidental
has various benefit plans for its salaried, domestic union and nonunion hourly, and certain foreign national employees.

Defined
Contribution Plans

All
domestic employees and certain foreign national employees are eligible to participate in one or more of the defined contribution
retirement or savings plans that provide for periodic contributions by Occidental based on plan-specific criteria, such as base pay,
age level, and/or employee contributions. Certain salaried employees participate in a supplemental retirement plan that provides
restoration of benefits lost due to governmental limitations on qualified retirement benefits. The accrued liabilities for the
supplemental retirement plan were $61 million, $60 million and $55 million as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and
Occidental expensed $66 million in 2005, $59 million in 2004 and $59 million in 2003 under the provisions of these defined
contribution and supplemental retirement plans.

Defined
Benefit Plans

Participation
in the defined benefit plans is limited and approximately 1,500 domestic and 800 foreign national employees, mainly union, nonunion
hourly and certain employees that joined Occidental from acquired operations with grandfathered benefits, are currently accruing
benefits under these plans.

Pension
costs for Occidental’s defined benefit pension plans, determined by independent actuarial valuations, are generally funded by
payments to trust funds, which are administered by independent trustees.

Other
Postretirement Benefit Plans

Occidental
provides medical and dental benefits and life insurance coverage for certain active, retired and disabled employees and their
eligible dependents. The benefits generally are funded by Occidental as the benefits are paid during the year. The cost of providing
these benefits is based on claims filed and insurance premiums paid for the period. The total benefit costs including the
postretirement costs were approximately $104 million in 2005, $98 million in 2004, and $94 million in 2003.


On
December 8, 2003, President Bush signed into law a bill that expands Medicare, primarily adding a prescription drug benefit for
Medicare-eligible retirees starting in 2006. Regulations governing the Medical Prescription drug benefit and other key elements of
the Medicare Modernization Act were released by the Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services on January 21, 2005. As of December 31, 2005, Occidental has determined that its retiree health care plans will qualify
Occidental for a federal subsidy available on benefits provided to plan participants which meet certain actuarial equivalence
requirements. The $32 million reduction in the Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation due to the expected future subsidy has
been treated as an actuarial experience gain which will be amortized to expense in future years through a decrease in the
amortization of the unrecognized net loss, in accordance with FSP No. FAS 106-2. The annual reduction in Occidental’s other
postretirement benefits expense due to the subsidy is expected to be approximately $4 million.

Obligations
and Funded Status

The
projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for defined benefit pension plans with
accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets were $94 million, $91 million and $4 million, respectively, as of December
31, 2005 and $111 million, $99 million and $20 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2004. The projected benefit obligation,
accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for defined benefit pension plans with plan assets in excess of
accumulated benefit obligation were $398 million, $377 million, and $420 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2005 and $337
million, $326 million, and $378 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2004.

In
2002, a 401(h) account was established within one of Occidental's defined benefit pension  plans. This plan allows Occidental to
fund postretirement medical benefits for employees at one of its operations. Contributions to this 401(h) account are made at
Occidental's discretion. All of Occidental's other postretirement benefit plans are unfunded.


Amounts
recognized in the consolidated balance sheets consist of:

Occidental
recorded a credit to AOCI of $13 million in 2003, to reflect the net-of-tax difference between the additional liability required
under pension accounting provisions and the corresponding intangible asset. No amount was recorded to AOCI in 2005 and
2004.

Additional
Information

Occidental’s
defined benefit pension and postretirement defined benefit plan obligations are determined based on various assumptions and discount
rates. Occidental uses the fair value of assets to determine expected return on plan assets in calculating pension expense.
Occidental funds and expenses negotiated pension increases for domestic union employees over the term of their collective bargaining
agreement.

The
following table sets forth the weighted average assumptions used to determine Occidental's benefit obligation and net periodic
benefit cost for domestic plans:

For
domestic pension plans, Occidental bases the discount rate on the average yield provided by the Moody’s Aaa Corporate Bond
Index. The weighted average rate of increase in future compensation levels is consistent with Occidental’s past and anticipated
future compensation increases for employees participating in retirement plans that determine benefits using compensation. The
long-term rate of return on assets assumption is established with regard to current market factors but within the context of
historical returns. Historical returns and correlation of equities and fixed income securities are studied. Current market factors
such as inflation and interest rates are also evaluated.

For
pension plans outside of the United States, the assumptions used in determining the benefit obligation vary by country. For
countries in hyperinflationary environments, real discount rates were used. The real discount rates used in these countries ranged
from a low of 4.8 percent to a high of 5.5 percent at both December 31, 2005 and 2004. For countries under a more stable
inflationary environment, the nominal discount rates were used in determining the benefit


obligation. The
nominal discount rates used ranged from a low of 3 percent to a high of 6.8 percent at December 31, 2005 and a low of 4 percent to a
high of 8 percent at December 31, 2004. Occidental bases its discount rate for foreign pension plans on rates indicative of
government and/or investment grade corporate debt in the applicable country. The average rate of increase in future compensation
levels ranged from a low of 2 percent to a high of 6 percent in 2005 and from a low of 3 percent to a high of 7 percent in 2004,
dependent on local economic conditions and salary budgets. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was 5.5 percent in
excess of local inflation in both 2005 and 2004.

The
postretirement benefit obligation was determined by application of the terms of medical and dental benefits and life insurance
coverage, including the effect of established maximums on covered costs, together with relevant actuarial assumptions and health
care cost trend rates projected at a Consumer Price Index (CPI) increase of 3 percent as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 (beginning in
1993, participants other than certain union employees have paid for all medical cost increases in excess of increases in the CPI).
For certain union employees, the health care cost trend rates were projected at annual rates ranging ratably from 12 percent in 2005
to 6 percent through the year 2010 and level thereafter. A 1-percent increase or a 1-percent decrease in these assumed health care
cost trend rates would result in an increase of $19 million or a reduction of $18 million, respectively, in the postretirement
benefit obligation as of December 31, 2005, and an increase or reduction of $1 million in interest cost in 2005. The annual service
costs would not be materially affected by these changes.

The
actuarial assumptions used could change in the near term as a result of changes in expected future trends and other factors that,
depending on the nature of the changes, could cause increases or decreases in the plan liabilities accrued.

Asset
allocations of Occidental’s defined benefit pension and funded postretirement benefit plans at December 31, 2005 and 2004 are
as follows:

Occidental
employs a total return investment approach that uses a mix of equity and fixed income investments to maximize the long-term return
of plan assets at a prudent level of risk. The investments are monitored by Occidental’s Investment Committee in its role as
fiduciary. The Investment Committee, consisting of senior Occidental executives, selects and employs various external professional
investment management firms to manage specific assignments across the spectrum of asset classes. The resulting aggregate investment
portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed-income investments. Furthermore, equity investments are diversified
across United States and non-United States stocks, as well as differing styles and market capitalizations. Other asset classes such
as private equity and real estate may be used to enhance long-term returns while improving portfolio diversification. Investment
performance is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment and manager guideline compliance reviews,
annual liability measurements, and periodic studies.

Occidental
expects to contribute $3 million to its defined benefit pension plans during 2006. All of the contributions are expected to be in
the form of cash.

Estimated
future benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows:

At
December 31, 2005, Occidental’s equity investments consist mainly of a 12-percent interest in Lyondell Chemical Company
(Lyondell) acquired in August 2002, a 24.5-percent interest in the stock of Dolphin Energy Limited (Dolphin Energy), and other
various partnerships and joint ventures, discussed below. Equity investments paid dividends of $161 million, $91 million and $81
million to Occidental in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. At December 31, 2005, cumulative undistributed earnings of equity-method
investees since acquisition were $72 million. At December 31, 2005, Occidental’s investments in equity investees exceeded the
underlying equity in net assets by $375 million, of which $260 million represents goodwill that will not be amortized and $115
million represents intangible assets, which will be amortized over the life of the underlying assets, when placed into
service.

In
November 2004, Lyondell acquired Millennium Chemicals Inc. (Millennium) by issuing additional shares of Lyondell common stock. Under
SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 51, Occidental was required to record its share of the increase in Lyondell's net equity resulting
from this issuance. The effect of this was an increase in the carrying value of Occidental's investment in Lyondell and a pre-tax
gain of $121 million. As a result of the stock issuance, Occidental's ownership percentage of Lyondell decreased from approximately
22 percent to 17 percent.

In
2005, Occidental sold 11 million shares of Lyondell stock for gross proceeds of approximately $300 million. This sale resulted in a
2005 pre-tax gain of $140 million. At December 31, 2005, Occidental still owned 30.3 million Lyondell shares of common stock (12
percent ownership), with a carrying value of $468 million and a fair market value of $722 million, and warrants to purchase an
additional five million shares of Lyondell common stock. Occidental has no current plans to divest the remaining Lyondell shares.
However, Occidental regularly reviews and analyzes its investments and other operations in order to determine how its
stockholders’ interests are best served. Occidental continues to account for this investment on the equity method since it has
the ability to exercise significant influence over Lyondell.

The
following table presents Occidental’s percentage interest in the summarized financial information of its equity method
investments:

Occidental’s
investment in the Dolphin Project consists of two separate economic interests: a 24.5 percent undivided interest in a Development
and Production Sharing Agreement, which is proportionately consolidated in the financial statements, and a 24.5 percent ownership
interest in the stock of Dolphin Energy, which is accounted for as an equity investment. In July 2005, Dolphin Energy entered into a
bridge loan in an amount of $2.45 billion. The proceeds of the new bridge loan were used to pay off amounts outstanding on a
previous bridge loan and will be used to fund the construction of the Dolphin Project. The new bridge loan has a term of four years
and is a revolving credit facility, which may be converted to a term loan. In September 2005, Dolphin Energy entered into an
agreement with banks to provide a $1.0 billion Islamic-law-compliant facility to fund the construction of a certain portion of the
Dolphin Project. This four-year financing facility is structured as a transaction in which Dolphin Energy constructs part of the
midstream portion of the Dolphin Project on behalf of a group of Islamic investors and enters into a lease to use such assets upon
construction completion. Occidental guarantees 24.5 percent of both of these obligations of Dolphin Energy. At December 31, 2005,
Occidental’s portion of the bridge loan drawdown was approximately $400 million, of which $299 million is recorded on the
balance sheet. The remaining amount is included in the guarantee amounts discussed in Note 9. There were no draw downs on the
Islamic-law-compliant facility at December 31, 2005.

In
Ecuador, Occidental has a 14-percent interest in the OCP oil export pipeline. As of December 31, 2005, Occidental had contributed
and advanced a total of $73 million to the project. Occidental reports this investment in its consolidated statements using the
equity method of accounting. The project was funded in part by senior project debt.


The senior
project debt is to be repaid with the proceeds of ship-or-pay tariffs of certain upstream producers in Ecuador, including
Occidental. Under their ship-or-pay commitments, Occidental and the other upstream producers have each assumed their respective
share of project-specific risks, including operating risk, political risk and force-majeure risk. Occidental would be required to
make an advance tariff payment in the event of prolonged force majeure, upstream expropriation events, bankruptcy of the pipeline
company or its parent company, abandonment of the project, termination of an investment guarantee agreement with Ecuador, or certain
defaults by Occidental. This advance tariff would be used by the pipeline company to service or prepay project debt. At December 31,
2005, Occidental’s obligation relating to the pipeline company’s senior project debt totaled $100 million, and
Occidental's obligations relating to performance bonds totaled $14 million. Occidental's overall obligations will decrease with the
reduction of the pipeline company’s senior project debt.

Occidental
has a 50-percent interest in Elk Hills Power LLC (EHP), a limited liability company that operates a gas-fired, power-generation
plant in California. OCP and EHP are VIEs under the provisions of FIN 46. Occidental has concluded it is not the primary
beneficiary of OCP or EHP and, therefore, accounts for these investments using the equity method.

REAS

Occidental
has identified two reportable segments through which it conducts its continuing operations: oil and gas and chemical. The factors
for determining the reportable segments were based on the distinct nature of their operations. They are managed as separate business
units because each requires and is responsible for executing a unique business strategy. The oil and gas segment explores for,
develops, produces and markets crude oil and natural gas domestically and internationally. The chemical segment manufactures and
markets, domestically and internationally, basic chemicals, vinyls, chlorinated organics and performance chemicals.

Earnings
of industry segments and geographic areas generally exclude interest income, interest expense, environmental remediation expenses,
unallocated corporate expenses, discontinued operations and cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, but include
income from equity investments (except as noted below) and gains and losses from dispositions of segment and geographic area
assets.

As
of January 1, 2005, Occidental revised its reporting of segment earnings to show segment earnings before income taxes. All domestic
and foreign income tax expense is now reflected in the “Corporate and Other” column. This change has been applied to all
periods presented.

Identifiable
assets are those assets used in the operations of the segments. Corporate and other assets consist of cash, short-term investments,
certain corporate receivables, a 12-percent equity investment in Lyondell, 12-percent ownership interest in Premcor (sold in 2005),
a leased cogeneration facility in Taft, Louisiana and a common carrier oil pipeline company.

Supplemental
Oil and Gas Information

(Unaudited)

The
following tables set forth Occidental’s net interests in quantities of proved developed and undeveloped reserves of crude oil,
condensate and natural gas and changes in such quantities. Crude oil reserves (in millions of barrels) include condensate. The
reserves are stated after applicable royalties. These estimates include reserves in which Occidental holds an economic interest
under PSCs and other economic arrangements.

The
reserve estimation process involves reservoir engineers, geoscientists, planning engineers and financial analysts. As part of this
process, all reserve volumes are estimated by a forecast of production rates, operating costs and capital expenditures. Price
differentials between benchmark prices and prices realized and specifics of each operating agreement are then used to estimate the
net reserves. Production rate forecasts are derived by a number of methods, including estimates from decline curve analyses,
material balance calculations that take into account the volume of substances replacing the volumes produced and associated
reservoir pressure changes, or computer simulation of the reservoir performance. Operating costs and capital costs are forecast
based on past experience combined with expectations of future cost for the specific reservoirs. In many cases, activity-based cost
models for a reservoir are utilized to project operating costs as production rates and the number of wells for production and
injection vary.

A
senior corporate officer of Occidental is responsible for the internal audit and review of its oil and gas reserves data. In
addition, a Corporate Reserves Review Committee (the Reserves Committee) has been established, consisting of senior corporate
officers, to monitor and review Occidental's oil and gas reserves. The Reserves Committee reports to the Audit Committee of
Occidental's Board of Directors periodically throughout the year. Occidental retained Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (Ryder Scott),
independent petroleum engineering consultants, to review its oil and gas estimation processes for 2004 and 2005.

Ryder
Scott has compared Occidental’s methods and procedures for estimating oil and gas reserves to generally accepted industry
standards and has reviewed certain data, methods and procedures used in estimating reserve volumes, economic evaluations and reserve
classifications. Ryder Scott then reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for a selection of oil and gas
fields considered to be a valid representation of Occidental’s total reserves portfolio.

on this review, including the data, technical processes and interpretations presented by Occidental, Ryder Scott has concluded that
the methodologies used by Occidental in preparing the relevant estimates generally comply with current Securities and Exchange
Commission standards. Ryder Scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reserves volumes presented by
Occidental.

Estimates
of proven reserves are collected in a database and changes in this database are reviewed by engineering personnel to ensure
accuracy. Finally, reserve volumes and changes are reviewed and approved by Occidental's senior management.

For
purposes of the following disclosures, estimates were made of quantities of proved reserves and the periods during which they are
expected to be produced. Future cash flows were computed by applying year-end prices to Occidental’s share of estimated annual
future production from proved oil and gas reserves, net of royalties. Future development and production costs were computed by
applying year-end costs to be incurred in producing and further developing the proved reserves. Future income tax expenses were
computed by applying, generally, year-end statutory tax rates (adjusted for permanent differences, tax credits, allowances and
foreign income repatriation considerations) to the estimated net future pre-tax cash flows. The discount was computed by application
of a 10 percent discount factor. The calculations assumed the continuation of existing economic, operating and contractual
conditions at each of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. However, such arbitrary assumptions have not necessarily proven to be the
case in the past. Other assumptions of equal validity would give rise to substantially different results.

The
year-end prices used to calculate future cash flows vary by producing area and market conditions. For the 2005, 2004 and 2003
disclosures, the West Texas Intermediate oil prices used were $61.04 per barrel, $43.45 per barrel and $32.52 per barrel,
respectively. The Henry Hub gas prices used for the 2005, 2004 and 2003 disclosures were $10.08/MMBtu, $6.03/MMBtu and $5.79/MMBtu,
respectively.

Standardized
Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows
