Business.

Whirlpool Corporation, a leading global manufacturer and marketer of major home appliances, was incorporated in 1955 under the laws of Delaware as the successor
to a business that traces its origin to 1898. The Company manufactures in 12 countries under nine principal brand names and markets products to distributors and retailers in more than 170 countries.
As of December 31, 2005, the Company had approximately 66,000 employees.

As
used herein, and except where the context otherwise requires, the terms "Company" and "Whirlpool" include Whirlpool Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Products and Markets

The Company manufactures and markets a full line of major appliances and related products, primarily for home use. The Company's principal products are laundry
appliances, refrigerators and freezers, cooking appliances, dishwashers, room air-conditioning equipment, and mixers and other small household appliances. The Company also produces
hermetic compressors for refrigeration systems.

The
following table sets forth information regarding the total net sales contributed by each class of similar products which accounted for 10% or more of the Company's consolidated net
sales in 2005, 2004, and 2003.

The
Company is a major supplier to Sears of laundry, refrigerator, dishwasher, and trash compactor home appliances. Some of the products that the Company supplies to Sears are marketed
by Sears under Sears'

Kenmore

brand name. Sears is also a major outlet for the Company's

Whirlpool

and

KitchenAid

brand products. In 2005, approximately 16% of the Company's consolidated net sales were attributable to sales to Sears.

In
Whirlpool's European region, the Company markets and distributes its major home appliances under the

Whirlpool

,

Bauknecht

,

Ignis

,

Laden

, and

Polar

brand names and its portable appliances under the

KitchenAid

brand name. In addition to its
extensive operations in Western Europe, the Company has sales


subsidiaries
in Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Croatia, and Morocco, and representative offices in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan,
and Slovenia. The Company markets a full line of products under the

Whirlpool

,

KIC

, and

Ignis

brand names in
South Africa. Whirlpool's European operations also sell products carrying the

Whirlpool

,

Bauknecht

, and

Ignis

brand names to
distributors and dealers in Africa and the Middle East. The Company has manufacturing facilities in France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Slovakia, South Africa, and Sweden.

In
Latin America, the Company markets and distributes its major home appliances through regional networks under the

Appliance sales and distribution in Brazil, Argentina, and Chile are managed by the Company's Brazilian subsidiary, and in Bolivia, Peru, Paraguay, and Uruguay through distributors. Appliance sales
and distribution in Central American countries, the Caribbean, Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador are managed by Whirlpool's North America region and through distributors. In Latin America, the Company
has manufacturing facilities in Brazil.

In
Asia, the Company has organized the marketing and distribution of its major home appliances into four operating groups: (1) Greater China, which includes mainland China, Hong
Kong, and Taiwan; (2) South Asia, which includes India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Nepal; (3) Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, and Pacific Islands; and
(4) Southeast Asia, which includes Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Korea, and Japan. The Company markets and sells its products in Asia under the

Whirlpool

,

KitchenAid

,

Bauknecht

, and

Ignis

brand names by a combination of direct sales to appliance retailers and chain stores, and through full-service distributors to a large
network of retail stores. In Asia, the Company has manufacturing facilities in China and India.

Competition

Competition in the home appliance industry is intense. In addition to traditional competitors such as Electrolux, GE, Kenmore, and Maytag, there are new and
expanding foreign competitors such as LG, Bosch, Samsung, Fisher & Paykel, and Haier. Moreover, the U.S. customer base is characterized by large, sophisticated trade customers who have many
choices and demand competitive products, services and prices. In most major markets throughout the world, 2005 was a challenging year for the industry with continued unprecedented rising costs in the
areas of steel and other metals, oil based materials such as resins, and transportation. Competition in the Company's markets is based upon a wide variety of factors, including, principally, cost,
selling price, distribution and other financial incentives (such as cooperative advertising, co-marketing funds, sales person incentives, volume rebates, and terms), performance,
innovation, product features, and quality. The Company believes that it can best compete in the current environment by increasing productivity, lowering costs, introducing innovative new products,
enhancing trade customer and consumer value with its product offerings, continuing to expand its global footprint, expanding trade distribution channels and, where appropriate, taking other
efficiency-enhancing measures.

In
addition, on August 22, 2005, as discussed below, Whirlpool entered into an agreement to acquire Maytag Corporation ("Maytag"), for which regulatory approval is pending.
Whirlpool believes that its combination with Maytag will enhance its ability to respond to these competitive conditions, and will benefit trade customers and consumers of the combined company by
generating significant cost savings that will enable it to continue to offer competitive prices across a wide array of products as well as increased quality and innovation.

Other Information

The Company is generally not dependent upon any one source for raw materials or purchased components essential to its business. In those areas where a single
supplier is used, alternative sources are generally available and can be developed within the normal manufacturing environment, although some unanticipated costs may be incurred in transitioning to a
new supplier where a prior single supplier is


abruptly
terminated. While there have been continued significant cost pressures in some areas, such as metals and oil based materials, and significant demand for certain components, the Company
believes such raw materials and components will be available in adequate quantities to meet anticipated production schedules.

Patents
presently owned by the Company are considered, in the aggregate, to be valuable to the Company. The Company is the owner of a number of trademarks in the U.S. and foreign
countries.
The most important trademarks owned by the Company in North America are

Whirlpool

,

KitchenAid

,

Estate

,

Roper

, and

Acros.

The most important trademarks
owned by the Company in Europe are

Whirlpool

,

Bauknecht,

and

Ignis

. In Latin America, the most important
trademarks owned by the Company are

Whirlpool

,

Brastemp,

and

Consul

. The most important trademark owned by
the Company in Asia is

Whirlpool

. The Company also receives royalties from licensing its trademarks to third parties to sell and service certain products bearing the

Whirlpool

and

KitchenAid

brand names.

Expenditures
for Company-sponsored research and development relating to new products and the improvement of existing products were approximately $339 million in 2005,
$315 million in 2004, and $285 million in 2003.

The
Company's manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect or enhance the environment, many of which require federal, state, or other
governmental licenses and permits with regard to wastewater discharges, air emissions, and hazardous waste management. The Company's policy is to comply with all such laws and regulations. Where laws
and regulations are less restrictive, the Company has established and is following its own standards consistent with its commitment to environmental responsibility.

The
Company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with all presently applicable federal, state, local, and other governmental provisions relating to environmental
protection in the countries in which it has manufacturing operations. Compliance with these environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings, or the
Company's competitive position. Capital expenditures and expenses for manufacturing operations directly attributable to compliance with these environmental provisions worldwide amounted to
approximately $28 million in 2005, $28 million in 2004, and $26 million in 2003. It is estimated that in 2006, environmental capital expenditures and expenses for manufacturing
operations will be approximately $27 million. Capital expenditures and expenses for product related environmental activities were not material in any of the past three years and are not
expected to be material in 2006.

Globally,
the entire major home appliance industry, including the Company, must contend with the adoption of stricter governmental energy and environmental standards to be phased in over
the next several years. These include the general phase-out of ozone depleting chemicals used in refrigeration and energy standards rulemakings for other selected major appliances produced
by the Company. Compliance with these various standards, as they become effective, will require some product redesign. However, the Company believes, based on its understanding of the current state of
proposed regulations, that it should be able to develop, manufacture, and market products that comply with these regulations. Additionally, on February 13, 2003, the Waste Electrical and
Electronic Equipment Directive ("WEEE") was published in Europe. Among other provisions, WEEE stipulates that "producers" be responsible for the cost of collection, disposal, and recycling of waste
for many electrical and electronic products as of August 13, 2005. For more information on WEEE, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the Financial Supplement
to this report.

The
Company has been notified by state and federal environmental protection agencies of its possible involvement in a number of "Superfund" sites in the United States. However, based
upon evaluation of the facts and circumstances relating to these sites by the Company and its technical consultants, the Company does not presently anticipate any material adverse effect upon the
Company's earnings, financial condition,


or
competitive position arising out of the resolution of these matters or the resolution of any other known governmental proceeding regarding environmental protection matters.

For
information about the challenges and risks associated with the Company's foreign operations, see "Risks Relating to our Business" under Item 1A below.

For
certain other financial information concerning the Company's business segments and foreign and domestic operations, see Notes 1 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
contained in the Financial Supplement to this report.

Pending Maytag Acquisition

On August 22, 2005, Whirlpool entered into a definitive merger agreement with Maytag to acquire all outstanding shares of Maytag common stock. The
aggregate transaction value, including the payment to Maytag stockholders of approximately $850 million in cash and between 9.2 million and 11.3 million shares of Whirlpool common
stock and assumption of approximately $972 million of Maytag debt (based on Maytag stock, exercisable stock options, and debt reported outstanding as of December 31, 2005), is
approximately $2.7 billion. The number of shares of Whirlpool common stock to be issued will depend on the volume weighted average trading prices of Whirlpool common stock during a twenty
trading day period ending shortly before completion of the merger. The transaction was approved by Maytag shareholders on December 22, 2005 and is pending regulatory clearance as discussed
below.

Whirlpool
has sufficient resources to finance the acquisition. The acquisition and upcoming debt maturities of the combined company are expected to be financed initially through
commercial paper supported by existing bank agreements and with new committed bank facilities as discussed in "Management's Discussion and Analysis" contained in the Financial Supplement to this
report. The Company expects to eventually refinance a portion of its commercial paper in the capital markets.

Whirlpool
currently expects the merger with Maytag to generate approximately $300 million to $400 million of annual pre-tax cost savings by the third year
following completion of the merger. Efficiencies are expected to come from all areas across the value chain, including product manufacturing and marketing, global procurement, logistics,
infrastructure and support areas. Achieving these efficiencies will require one-time costs and capital investments currently estimated to be in the range of $350 million to
$500 million, a majority of which currently are anticipated to be capitalized or accrued in purchase accounting. Whirlpool currently anticipates incurring these costs during the first two years
following completion of the merger.

The
merger is subject to clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, and other customary closing conditions. On December 1, 2005, Whirlpool and
Maytag announced that they had certified substantial compliance with the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice in response to a request for additional information ("second request") and had
agreed not to close the proposed merger before February 27, 2006, without the Antitrust Division's concurrence, recognizing that the Antitrust Division could request additional time for review.
On February 13, 2006, Whirlpool and Maytag announced that they agreed with the Antitrust Division to a limited extension of time to complete the review of the proposed merger. The companies
have agreed not to close the transaction before March 30, 2006 without the Antitrust Division's concurrence.

Whirlpool
and Maytag are working closely with the Department of Justice and continue to cooperate fully with its investigation and respond promptly to its inquiries.

On
August 22, 2005, Whirlpool paid Maytag $40 million to reimburse Maytag for its payment of a fee to terminate its prior merger agreement with Triton Acquisition Holding
Co. Whirlpool has agreed to pay up to $15 million to assist Maytag in retaining key employees while the merger is pending. Whirlpool also has agreed to pay Maytag a "reverse
break-up fee" of $120 million under certain circumstances if the transaction cannot be closed due to an inability to obtain regulatory clearance.

Risk Factors.

This report contains statements referring to Whirlpool that are not historical facts and are considered "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements, which are intended to take advantage of the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, are
based on current projections about operations, industry conditions, financial condition, liquidity, and the impact of the pending merger with Maytag. Words such as "may," "will," "should," "plan,"
"predict," "potential," "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "believe," "may impact," "on track," and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of
future operating or financial performance, the merger, or our businesses, identify forward-looking statements. In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections, or other
characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. Those statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks, uncertainties,
and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual results could differ materially and adversely from these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not
limited to, the following:

Risks Relating to Our Business

We face intense competition in the home appliance industry and failure to successfully compete may negatively affect our business and
financial performance.

Each of our business segments operates in a highly competitive business environment and faces intense competition from a growing number of competitors,
including an increasing number of foreign-based competitors, which have strong consumer brand equity. Several, such as LG, Samsung, and Bosch, are large well-established companies that
rank among the Global Fortune 150 and have demonstrated a commitment to North America through competitive imports and North American production. The elements of competition include cost, selling
price, distribution and other financial incentives (such as cooperative advertising, co-marketing funds, sales person incentives, volume rebates, and terms), performance, innovation,
product features, and quality. In particular, in the past, our competitors, especially global competitors with low-cost sources of supply outside the United States, have aggressively
priced their products and/or introduced new products in order to increase market share. If we are unable to successfully compete in this highly competitive environment, our business and financial
performance could be negatively affected.

The loss of or decline in sales to any of our key trade customers, including Sears, Lowe's, and Best Buy, could adversely affect our financial
performance.

We sell to a customer base characterized by
sophisticated and powerful trade customers that have significant leverage as buyers over their suppliers. Most of our products are sold through purchase orders and not through long-term
contracts, which facilitates the trade customers' ability to change volume among suppliers to obtain competitive terms. As the trade customers continue to consolidate and become larger, our trade
customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability, including through improved efficiency, lower pricing and increased promotional programs. If we are unable to respond by meeting
their requirements, our profitability or volume growth could be negatively affected. We have been a principal supplier of home appliances to Sears for many years. In 2005, approximately 16% of
Whirlpool's consolidated net sales of $14 billion were attributable to Sears. Although no other customer accounted for greater than 10% of consolidated net sales in 2005, other customers may
account for more than 10% of our consolidated net sales in future periods. It should also be noted Maytag has reported that in 2005, approximately 10% of Maytag's consolidated net sales were
attributable to Sears and approximately 14% to Home Depot. The loss of, or decline in volume of, sales to Sears, Lowe's, Best Buy or any other trade customers to which we sell a significant amount of
products could adversely affect our financial performance. Additionally, any loss of market share by any such trade customers could have a negative impact on our financial performance.

Our business could be adversely affected by changes in economic conditions.

Demand for our products is generally affected by a number of
economic factors, including, but not limited to, gross domestic product,


consumer
interest rates, consumer confidence, retail trends, housing starts, sales of existing homes, and the level of mortgage refinancing. A decline in economic activity in the United States and any
other markets in which we operate could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.

Our financial performance could be adversely affected by an inability to effectively execute and manage our business objectives.

The
highly competitive nature of our industry requires that we effectively execute and manage our business including our global operating platform initiative, which aims to reduce costs, drive
productivity and quality improvements and accelerate our rate of innovation. Our inability to effectively control costs and drive productivity improvements could affect our profits. In addition, our
failure to provide high-quality, innovative products could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our sales, which could negatively affect our revenues and overall financial
performance. Additionally, our success is dependent on anticipating changes in customer preferences and on successful new product and process development and product relaunches in response to such
changes. Our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key markets and upon our ability to successfully
and timely identify, develop, manufacture, market and sell new or improved products in these changing markets.

Fluctuations and volatility in the cost of raw materials and purchased components could adversely affect our profits

. The primary
materials used to produce and manufacture our products are steel, oil, plastic resins, and base metals such as copper and zinc. On a global and regional basis, the sources and prices of those
materials and components are susceptible to significant price fluctuations due to supply/demand trends, transportation costs, government regulations and tariffs, changes in currency
exchange rates, price controls, the economic climate, and other unforeseen circumstances. During 2005, our business incurred approximately $530 million of higher material and
oil-related costs. Continued significant increases in these and other costs in the future could materially affect our profits.

Our global business performance could be affected by the ability of suppliers to deliver parts, components and manufacturing equipment to our manufacturing
facilities.

We use a wide range of materials and components in the global production of our products and use numerous suppliers to provide materials and components. We
generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers and some key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. Operations at suppliers'
facilities are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to work stoppages, fire, earthquake, flooding, or other natural disasters. Such disruption could interrupt our
ability to manufacture certain products. Any significant disruption could negatively impact our revenue and earnings performance.

Our financial results could be adversely affected by significant differences between actual results and estimates of the amount of future funding for our pension
plans and post-retirement health care benefit programs, significant changes in funding assumptions, or significant increases in funding obligations if pending U.S. pension reform
legislation is adopted.

We have both funded and unfunded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all of our North American employees and certain
foreign employees. We also have unfunded post-retirement health care benefit plans for eligible retired employees. The funding obligations for our U.S. pension plans, which are our
principal pension plans, are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).

As
of December 31, 2005, our projected benefit obligations under our pension plans and post-retirement health care benefit programs exceeded the fair value of plan
assets by an aggregate of approximately $1.28 billion ($576 million of which was attributable to pension plans and $701 million to post-retirement health care
benefits). Estimates for the amount and timing of the future funding obligations of these pension plans and post-retirement health care benefit plans are based on various assumptions.
These include, among others, the discount rates, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates. These assumptions are subject to change based on
interest rates on high quality bonds, stock and bond market returns, and medical assets and health care cost trend rates.


Significant
differences in results or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect our post-retirement obligations and related future expense.

Pension
reform legislation is pending in Congress including, among other things, proposals for new funding targets, changes to Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation premiums, and
restrictions on nonqualified benefit payments to certain employees in situations where the plan fails to meet certain minimum funding thresholds. If any of these legislative proposals are enacted into
law, our funding
obligations to the U.S. pension plans could be increased, which could adversely affect our financial results.

It
should be noted that as of December 31, 2005, Maytag's reported projected benefit obligations under its pension plans and post-retirement health care benefit
programs exceeded the fair value of plan assets by an aggregate of approximately $1.33 billion ($580 million of which was attributable to pension plans and $751 million to
post-retirement health care programs).

We may be adversely affected by environmental, and health and safety laws and regulations.

We are subject to various laws and regulations
relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety. We incur and will continue to incur capital and other expenditures to comply with these regulations. Complying with recently
passed and enacted regulations in Europe such as the WEEE directive may increase our costs and adversely affect our ability to sell certain products in Europe, which could negatively affect our
financial performance. Additionally, we could be subjected to future liabilities, fines, or penalties, or the suspension of product production for failing to comply with environmental regulations. If
cleanup obligations arise at any of our manufacturing sites or if more stringent environmental laws are imposed in the future, we could be adversely affected.

We may be adversely affected by product liability claims.

We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the
event that the use of any of our products results in personal injury or property damage. In the event that any of our products proves to be defective, we may be required to recall or redesign such
products. There can be no assurance that our insurance coverage against certain product liability claims will continue to be available on acceptable terms or that such coverage will be adequate for
liabilities actually incurred. We also face certain class action litigation regarding allegedly defective products that are not covered by insurance. A successful claim in excess of, or outside of,
our available insurance coverage may have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. In addition, any claim or product recall that results in significant adverse publicity may also
negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Lastly,
we are currently investigating a supplier-related quality and potential product safety problem that may affect up to 3.5 million appliances manufactured between 2000 and
2002. We currently estimate that the potential cost from this matter could be in the range of $0 to $235 million, depending on numerous factors, such as whether some or all of the appliances
must be repaired or replaced, whether the supplier will bear the cost of any corrective action, whether we will initially bear the cost of any corrective action, and if we initially bear the cost of
any corrective action, whether we will be successful in recovering those costs from the supplier at a later date. In addition, we could incur other costs arising out of this matter, which cannot
currently be estimated but could be material.

Our global business could be negatively impacted by a deterioration in labor relations.

As of December 31, 2005, we had
approximately 66,000 employees. Of those employees, approximately 60% are represented by various labor unions with separate collective bargaining agreements. Our current collective bargaining
agreements generally have three year terms. Due to the large number of collective bargaining agreements, we are periodically in negotiations with certain of the unions representing our employees. We
cannot be assured that at some point we will not be subject to work stoppages by some of our employees and, if such events were to occur, that there would not be a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition or results of operations. Further, we cannot be assured that we will be able to renew the various collective bargaining agreements on the same or similar terms, or at
all, which could affect our business, financial condition or results of operation.


Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services, and
brands.

We consider our intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks and licensing agreements, to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business. We
attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements and third party nondisclosure and
assignment agreements. Our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks, products, new features of our products, or our processes may diminish our competitiveness.

We
have applied for patent protection in the United States and other jurisdictions with respect to certain innovative and new products, product features, and processes. We cannot be
assured that any of our patent applications will be approved by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or any other jurisdiction. Additionally, the patents we own could be challenged, invalidated or
designed around by others and may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage. Further, the laws of certain foreign countries in which
we do business or contemplate doing business in the future do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. As a result, our
competitive advantage with respect to our products, services, and brands could be reduced in foreign jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our financial performance.

Moreover,
while we do not believe that any of our products infringe the valid intellectual property rights of third parties, we may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others
that may cover some of our technology, brands, products or services. Any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and could divert the
attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. Claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements. We also may be
subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products.

Foreign currency fluctuations may affect our financial performance.

We generate a significant portion of our revenue and incur a
significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The value of our revenue, earnings and cash flows from our foreign operations are affected by changes
in the functional currencies of those operations. We use currency forwards and options to manage our foreign currency transaction exposures but do not directly hedge our exposure on translation of
reported earnings. As a result, we cannot completely eliminate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, which may adversely affect our financial performance. In addition, because our
consolidated financial results are reported in dollars, if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies the translation of those results into dollars can result in a significant increase or
decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings.

If we cannot manage the additional challenges presented by our international operations, our financial performance may suffer.

For the
year ended December 31, 2005, we derived approximately 40% of our net sales from outside of North America, including 14% in Latin America, 3% in Asia, and 22% in Europe. We expect that
international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of our net sales in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, we face numerous risks associated with conducting international
operations, any of which could negatively affect our financial performance. These risks include the following:

•

Changes
in foreign country regulatory requirements;

•

Various
import/export restrictions and the availability of required import/export licenses;

•

Imposition
of foreign tariffs and other trade barriers;

•

Political,
legal and economic instability;

•

Foreign
currency exchange rate fluctuations;

•

Inflation;


•

Work
stoppages and disruptions in the shipping of imported and exported products;

•

Government
price controls;

•

Extended
payment terms and the ability to collect accounts receivable; and

•

The
ability to repatriate cash.

Additionally,
we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act which may place us at a competitive disadvantage to foreign companies that are not subject to similar regulations.

Terrorist
attacks, armed conflicts, natural disasters and epidemics could affect our domestic and international sales, disrupt our supply chain and impair our ability to produce and
deliver our products. Such events could directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers, both in the United States and elsewhere.

Risks Relating to the Pending Maytag Acquisition

Our inability to complete the merger for regulatory or other reasons, or our inability to close the transaction in a timely manner, could
adversely affect our financial performance.

The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice is reviewing the proposed merger and we cannot be assured that the proposed
merger will obtain regulatory clearance or that the other conditions to closing will be satisfied. We currently expect the merger with Maytag will enhance our ability to compete by generating
approximately $300 to $400 million of annual pre-tax savings by the third year following completion of the merger. Failure to close the merger would prevent us from realizing the
expected synergies and would also subject us to substantial additional costs. In connection with the transaction, Whirlpool has paid $40 million to reimburse Maytag for its payment of a fee to
terminate its prior agreement with Triton Acquisition Holding Co. and has agreed to pay Maytag up to $15 million to assist Maytag in retaining key employees while the merger is pending
(irrespective of whether the merger occurs), as well as a "reverse break-up fee" of $120 million under certain circumstances if the transaction cannot be closed due to an inability
to obtain regulatory clearance. In addition, Whirlpool has and will incur other significant transaction-related costs.

Maytag is subject to business uncertainties while the merger is pending which may subsequently adversely affect our business after the merger is
completed.

Uncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on Maytag and consequently on us once the transaction is completed.
These uncertainties may impair Maytag's ability to retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is completed, and could cause customers and others that deal with Maytag to defer purchases or
other decisions concerning Maytag, or to seek to change existing business relationships with Maytag. If key employees depart because of uncertainty about their future roles and the potential
complexities of integration, we could be harmed following completion of the merger.

Whirlpool may be unable to successfully integrate the businesses of Maytag in a timely manner which may affect our ability to realize the full anticipated
benefits of the merger.

The merger involves the integration of two companies that have previously operated independently. As with every merger, there are potential difficulties
of combining the companies' businesses. These may include the integration of Maytag's sales and marketing, distribution, manufacturing, engineering, finance, and administrative operations, both
domestic and international, with and into our operations. Our process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of one or more of the combined
company's businesses and the loss of key personnel. The diversion of management's attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the merger and the integration of the two
companies' operations of these businesses could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects after the merger.


We
expect certain efficiencies to arise from the merger, generating certain cost savings, and expect that achieving these efficiencies will require one-time costs and capital
investment currently estimated to be in the range of $350 million to $500 million. Achievement of these benefits will depend in part upon how and when our business is integrated with
Maytag and whether there are any additional costs incurred in connection with the integration. If the anticipated benefits are not realized fully or in a timely manner, or if there are significant
additional costs, our financial results could be adversely affected.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EXECUTIVE LEVEL OVERVIEW

Whirlpool
Corporation is a global manufacturer of major home appliances with 2005 revenues of $14.3 billion and net earnings of $422 million. The Company's four reportable segments are
based on geography and consist of North America (61% of revenue), Europe (22% of revenue), Latin America (14% of revenue), and Asia (3% of revenue). The Company is a leading producer of major home
appliances in North America and Latin America and has a significant presence in markets throughout Europe, India and China. Whirlpool received worldwide recognition for accomplishments in a variety of
business and social efforts, including leadership, diversity, innovative product design, business ethics, social responsibility and community involvement.

The
Company's growth strategy over the past several years has been to introduce innovative new products, enhance customer recognition of its brands, continue to expand its global footprint, expand
distribution channels and, where appropriate, make strategic acquisitions which enhance the Company's cost competitiveness, innovative global product offering and efficiency.

Competition
in the home appliance industry is intense worldwide. In the U.S., in addition to traditional competitors such as Electrolux, GE, Kenmore and Maytag, there are new and expanding foreign
competitors such as LG, Bosch, Samsung, Fisher & Paykel, and Haier. Moreover, the U.S. customer base is characterized by large, sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand
competitive products, services and prices. On August 22, 2005, Whirlpool entered into an agreement to acquire Maytag, for which regulatory approval is pending. The transaction is subject to
certain conditions. Whirlpool believes that its' combination with Maytag will enhance its ability to respond to these competitive conditions, and will benefit trade customers and consumers of the
combined company by generating significant cost savings that will enable it to continue to offer competitive prices across a wide array of products as well as increased product quality and innovation.

The
Company monitors country-specific economic factors such as gross domestic product, consumer interest rates, consumer confidence, housing starts, sales of existing homes and mortgage refinancing as
key indicators of industry demand. Management also focuses on country, brand, product and channel sales, average sales values, and profitability when assessing and forecasting financial results. The
Company intends to utilize its global manufacturing, procurement and technology footprint to enhance Whirlpool's position in the global appliance industry.

Management's
Discussion and Analysis discusses, among other things, the results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and liquidity, contractual obligations and forward-looking cash
requirements, critical accounting policies and estimates, new accounting pronouncements, market risk and the nature of, and risk associated with forward-looking statements contained herein. In
addition, the Company has included comments regarding regional business unit performance, where appropriate.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The Consolidated Statements of Operations present the Company's operating results for the last three years. This section of Management's Discussion and Analysis
highlights the main factors affecting changes in the Company's financial condition and results of operations and should be read along with the Consolidated Financial Statements.

NET SALES

The total number of units, which includes primarily major and small appliances, sold in 2005 increased 1.3% over 2004. Consolidated net sales increased 8.3% over
2004. Excluding currency fluctuations, net sales increased approximately 6%. Total number of units sold in 2004 increased 4.9% over 2003. Consolidated 2004 net sales increased 8.6% over 2003.
Excluding currency fluctuations, net sales increased approximately 6%. The tables below present units sold and net sales by region.

Significant
regional trends were as follows:

•

In
2005, North America unit volumes increased approximately 1% as compared to the 2004 period reaching record levels. Volume increases, driven by continued consumer demand
for the Company's new product innovations, were partially offset by lower OEM shipments. Net sales increased 8% during 2005, or approximately 7% excluding currency fluctuations, to a record
$8.9 billion. The higher net sales were driven by the combination of cost-based price adjustments and volume increases in the

Whirlpool

and

KitchenAid

brands during 2005. In 2004, North America unit volumes increased 4.6% as
compared to 2003, due to higher sales growth in

Whirlpool

and

KitchenAid

branded products combined with
strong Canadian performance. Net sales increased 4.8% as compared to 2003, to $8.3 billion. Currency fluctuations did not materially impact net sales comparisons.

•

In
2005, Europe unit volumes increased 2.1%, reaching record levels and outpacing industry growth. Solid demand for

Whirlpool

branded products and continued strong performance within the Company's built-in appliance business drove the increase. Net sales increased 3.2%, to a record $3.2 billion in 2005.
Currency did not have a material impact on sales during the year. In 2004, Europe unit volumes

F-3

increased
4.4%, ahead of industry growth, as compared to 2003, driven largely by strong

Whirlpool

brand performance and expansion of the Company's
built-in appliance business. Europe's net sales increased 13.8%, or approximately 3% excluding currency fluctuations. Overall market share improved due to

Whirlpool

brand performance and new product
introductions.

•

In
2005, Latin America unit volumes increased 1.5% versus 2004, due mainly to increases in the Brazilian appliance market. Net sales increased 17.2% as compared to 2004, or
approximately 6% excluding currency fluctuations, to $2.0 billion, due primarily to increased unit volumes and cost-based price adjustments on compressors and appliances. Strong
demand for home appliances in Latin America during 2004 resulted in a 14.9% increase in unit volumes versus 2003. Economic conditions within Brazil were strong during 2004 driven by GDP expansion,
lower unemployment and positive real wage growth. Net sales increased 24% in the region during 2004, and were approximately 20% higher excluding currency fluctuations, due to market share gains,
strong volume, cost-based price adjustments and favorable product mix.

•

In
2005, Asia unit volumes increased 3.1% as compared to 2004, driven mainly by industry growth and new product introductions. Net sales improved 10.5%, or approximately 8%
excluding currency fluctuations, due largely to an improved product mix and cost-based price adjustments implemented in 2005. In 2004, Asia unit volumes declined 8.6% versus 2003 with a
corresponding decline in net sales of 8.2%. Excluding currency fluctuations, net sales declined approximately 12%. Management's decision to implement a trade inventory reduction strategy in India
negatively impacted 2004 volume and sales. The strategy change improves the speed, flexibility and overall efficiency within sales and distribution processes, and enables the Company to launch new
product introductions more frequently and faster to the market.

GROSS MARGIN

The consolidated gross margin percentage in 2005 decreased 40 basis points versus 2004. Consolidated results in 2005 were significantly impacted by higher
material and oil-related cost increases which were mitigated by the combination of cost-based price adjustments and productivity improvements. Consolidated gross margin also
benefited from the Brazilian government's
export incentive program ("Befiex") tax credits (See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates to this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) and was
negatively impacted by higher incentive compensation.

The
consolidated gross margin percentage in 2004 decreased 90 basis points versus 2003 due primarily to second half material cost increases and global pricing pressures. These increases were partly
mitigated by higher volume and record levels of controllable productivity.

Restructuring
charges included in Consolidated, excluded from regions.

Significant
regional trends were as follows:

•

The
2005 North America gross margin decreased 80 basis points as compared to 2004, largely due to higher material and oil-related costs. Results also reflect the
impact of cost-based price adjustments, productivity improvements and higher incentive compensation. The 2004 gross margin decreased 70 basis points compared to 2003, due primarily to
higher material costs for steel and resins. In addition, the market continued to experience increased pricing pressures during 2004. Margin declines were partially offset by higher volume,
productivity improvements and some cost-based price adjustments.

•

The
2005 Europe gross margin decreased 70 basis points as compared to 2004, largely driven by higher material and oil-related costs, partially offset by
increased productivity, an improved product mix and, to a lesser extent, a gain on the sale of assets. In 2004, Europe gross margin improved slightly versus 2003 as productivity improvements and sales
volume more than offset pricing pressure. European operations continue to realize savings from ongoing restructuring efforts in Europe.

•

The
2005 Latin America gross margin increased 250 basis points as compared to 2004, as the combination of cost-based price adjustments, increased productivity
and Befiex tax credits more than offset higher material and oil-related costs, unfavorable currency and increased incentive compensation. In 2004, Latin America gross margin declined 260
basis points versus 2003, due primarily to higher material costs for steel and resins. Higher costs were partially offset by increased volume and cost-based price adjustments on both
appliances and compressors and favorable product mix.

•

The
2005 Asia gross margin increased 40 basis points as compared to 2004, due to improved product mix, productivity improvements and cost-based price adjustments
partially offset by higher material and oil-related costs. Asia gross margin declined 380 basis points versus 2003 due primarily to the trade inventory reduction strategy in India and
regional pricing pressures.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

In
2005, consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percent of consolidated net sales, declined 50 basis points as compared to 2004, as administrative cost reductions and scale
efficiencies offset higher freight and warehousing costs and incentive compensation in North America and Latin America. Europe results primarily reflect the positive impact from administrative
productivity improvements and business scale. The Asia region also benefited from scale efficiencies. The consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses in 2004, as a percent of
consolidated net sales, remained relatively unchanged versus 2003. Higher freight rates in North and Latin America in 2004 were partially offset by productivity in other non-logistic
areas. Europe results reflect the positive impact from administrative productivity improvements and business scale. The increase in Asia's selling, general and administrative expenses as a

F-5

percent
of sales in 2004 was due primarily to lower overall sales and higher administrative support costs. In 2003, higher pension and freight costs in North America were partially offset by cost
controls on discretionary spending. The European increase in 2003 was a result of expense reclassification into selling, general and administrative expenses while Latin America's improvement was
primarily driven by lower bad debt expense in 2003. Asia's higher selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales in 2003 were due to higher operating reserves. The table below
outlines the selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by region.

Restructuring-related
charges included in Consolidated, excluded from regions.

RESTRUCTURING

Restructuring
initiatives resulted in charges of $57 million, $15 million and $3 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These amounts have been identified as a separate
component of operating profit. The Company expects to expense up to $100 million for restructuring during 2006.

At
December 31, 2005, a liability of $6 million remains for actions yet to be completed under the global restructuring plan that was originally announced in December of 2000. The
remaining liability pertains to lease exit costs. The restructuring plan included the elimination of over 7,100 positions worldwide, of which substantially all had left the Company through
December 31, 2005. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more detailed description of these charges and the Company's restructuring program.

INTEREST AND SUNDRY INCOME/EXPENSE

Interest and sundry expense increased by $51 million versus 2004. The primary drivers of this increase were an increase in legal reserves of approximately
$21 million, higher foreign currency losses on balance sheet positions, the absence of prior year interest received on foreign tax audit settlements in Latin America and a $9 million
gain on the sale of a partial interest in an equity investment during 2004. Interest and sundry expense for 2004 decreased $27 million compared to 2003. The improvement was primarily
attributable to lower losses of $17 million on foreign currency balance sheet positions,
primarily in Europe, and a $9 million gain on the sale of a partial interest in an equity investment in Latin America.

F-6

INTEREST EXPENSE

Interest expense in 2005 increased $2 million as compared to 2004. The increase was due primarily to higher interest rates and a shift in global borrowing
positions. The primary impact was in Brazil, which experienced both increased borrowing levels and higher interest rates on a year over year basis. The interest expense reduction during 2004 of
$9 million was attributable to a lower overall U.S. interest rate environment, a decrease in borrowings in countries with higher interest rates, primarily Europe, and maturity of the
$200 million 9% Debentures in March 2003, which was replaced with lower rate debt.

INCOME TAXES

The effective income tax rate was 28.6% in 2005, 33.9% in 2004 and 35.0% in 2003. A primary driver of the effective tax rate reduction during 2005 was the
realization of foreign tax credits associated with a comprehensive plan that simplified the Company's legal structure, thereby permitting the tax-efficient repatriation of offshore cash
via foreign tax credits. Additional items impacting the effective tax rate during all periods presented included the settlement of global tax audits and the overall dispersion of global income. (See
the income tax rate reconciliation included in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the significant items impacting the consolidated effective income tax rate.)

EQUITY IN EARNINGS (LOSS) OF AFFILIATED COMPANIES AND MINORITY INTERESTS

Changes in equity in earnings (loss) of affiliated companies and minority interests reflect higher earnings in Latin America and India in 2005 and lower earnings
in Latin America and India during 2004.

NET EARNINGS

Net earnings were $422 million in 2005 versus $406 million and $414 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. 2005 earnings were impacted by
cost-based price adjustments, productivity improvements, administrative cost controls and a reduction in the effective tax rate. These items were partially offset by significantly higher
material costs (particularly steel and resins), unfavorable currency fluctuations, increased incentive compensation expense, higher restructuring spending and increased legal reserves. 2004 earnings
were significantly impacted by increases in material and logistics costs, particularly in the second half of the year. The higher costs in 2004 were partially offset by productivity improvements,
lower foreign currency losses on balance sheet positions, an effective tax rate reduction, lower financing costs, and reduced minority interest earnings.

FORWARD-LOOKING PERSPECTIVE

During 2005, the Company incurred approximately $530 million of higher material and oil-related costs. In response to these increases, the
Company introduced new innovative products, improved productivity, reduced discretionary costs and implemented global cost-based price adjustments in key regions around the world. The
combination of these actions contributed to the ability of the Company to deliver a record year of results.

F-7

The
Company expects positive earnings momentum to continue during 2006. New product introductions, productivity improvements, continued expansion of the Company's global operating platform and strong
cost controls are expected to more than offset continued increases in material and oil-related costs.

In
2006, the Company will launch the largest number of new products to market in its history. The Company's innovation product pipeline continues to grow, consumer and trade response to its new
offerings has been positive, and the Company continues to consistently execute its strategy of delivering consumer-relevant innovation to markets worldwide.

North
America and Europe, the Company's two largest segments, expect 2006 industry growth of approximately 2 to 3% and 1 to 2%, respectively.

Macro-economic
conditions in Latin America are expected to remain positive during 2006 and the Company expects industry shipments to increase 6 to 8%.

The
Company expects industry shipments within Asia to increase 5 to 7% in 2006.

In
December 1996, Multibras and Empresa Brasileira de Compressores S.A. ("Embraco"), Brazilian subsidiaries, were granted additional export incentives in connection with Befiex. These
incentives allowed the use of credits as an offset against current Brazilian federal excise tax on domestic sales. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company recognized $23 million in
export credits. The Company recognized no credits in 2004 and credits of $5 million in 2003. The credits are treated as a reduction of current excise taxes payable and, therefore, as an
increase in net sales. At December 31, 2005, the Company's remaining credits are approximately $600 million after adjusting for currency fluctuations
and a monetary adjustment. Currently, the Company is unable to recognize these credits but is exploring possible strategies which may permit future recognition of these credits.

CASH FLOWS

The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows reflect the changes in cash and equivalents for the last three years by classifying transactions into three major
categories: operating, investing and financing activities.

Operating Activities

Whirlpool's
main source of liquidity is cash generated from operating activities, consisting of net earnings adjusted for non-cash operating items, such as depreciation, and
changes in operating assets and liabilities such as receivables, inventories and payables.

The
Company's cash provided by operating activities in 2005 increased $87 million over 2004. Cash provided by operating activities benefited from lower inventories, reduced pension
contributions and higher accrued expenses for payroll, incentive compensation, restructuring and promotional spending. Results were partially offset by higher accounts receivable balances due mainly
to higher sales and lower payables primarily a result of lower inventory levels. Cash flow was also negatively impacted by a decrease in net taxes payable of $105 million, due, in part, to a
reduction in tax expense. In 2004, cash provided by operating activities benefited from lower after-tax pension contributions of approximately $62 million and lower restructuring
spending of approximately $56 million. In 2004, cash flow was negatively impacted by higher working capital requirements of about $70 million, driven largely by material cost increases
and higher inventory levels to support higher volumes and increased trans-regional shipments. In 2003, cash provided by operating activities benefited from higher earnings, primarily within our
European and North American business segments, as well as continued improvement in working capital management. Cash flow was negatively impacted by a voluntary after-tax pension
contribution to the Company's U.S. pension plans

F-8

of
$97 million. The 2003 cash flow was also negatively impacted by restructuring spending, primarily related to 2002 projects, as well as the timing of promotional payments.

The
Company's free cash flow was $412 million versus $241 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The
table below reconciles cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP") to free cash flow, a non-GAAP
measure. Management believes that free cash flow provides both management and shareholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing the Company's ability to fund its
activities and obligations. There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures, including the difficulty associated with comparing companies that use similarly named
non-GAAP measures but whose calculations may differ from the Company's calculations. As defined by the Company, free cash flow is cash provided by operating activities after capital
expenditures, proceeds from the sale of business/assets and dividends paid. The following is a reconciliation of cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow.

Investing Activities

The
principal recurring investing activities are property additions, which were $494 million, $511 million and $423 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
These expenditures are primarily for equipment and tooling, driven by product innovation initiatives, more efficient production methods, and replacement for normal wear and tear. Expenditures are also
made to support the Company's global operating platform footprint moves to lower cost locations as well as replacement, regulatory and infrastructure changes.

In
each of 2005, 2004 and 2003, Whirlpool entered into separate sale-leaseback transactions whereby the Company sold and leased back certain of its owned properties. Proceeds related to
the sale-leaseback of four properties in 2005, net of related fees, were approximately $67 million. In 2004, proceeds related to sale-leasebacks of six properties, net
of related fees, were approximately $66 million. In 2003, proceeds related to the sale-leaseback of four properties, net of related fees, were approximately $65 million.

Cash
proceeds of $48 million resulted from the sale of a non-core business in Latin America during 2005. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information.

Cash
paid in 2005 in connection with the proposed Maytag acquisition totaled $77 million, primarily consisting of $40 million to reimburse Maytag for its payment of a fee to terminate
its prior merger agreement with Triton Acquisition Holding Co. and $37 million of professional fees incurred in connection with the proposed acquisition. These costs have been capitalized and
are recognized in the other assets line within the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. If consummation of the transaction does not occur, the costs will be reclassified to expense.

F-9

On
November 18, 2002, the Company acquired the remaining 20% interest in Whirlpool Narcissus Shanghai Company Limited ("Narcissus") for $9 million. Subsequent to the purchase, Narcissus
was renamed Whirlpool Home Appliance (Shanghai) Co. Ltd. In accordance with the purchase agreement, 40% of the purchase price was paid during 2002, 40% was paid during 2003 and the remaining
20% was paid during 2004.

Financing Activities

Total
repayments of short-term and long-term debt, net of new borrowings, were $131 million, $58 million and $208 million in 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively.

During
March 2003, the Company redeemed its $200 million 9% Debentures using short-term notes payable.

Dividends
paid to stockholders totaled $116 million, $116 million and $94 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Under
its stock repurchase programs, Whirlpool used $34 million, $251 million, and $65 million to purchase approximately 0.5 million, 3.7 million and
1 million shares of common stock in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail on the Company's stock repurchase
program.

The
Company also redeemed $33 million in preferred stock of its discontinued finance company, Whirlpool Financial Corporation, in 2003. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional detail on the Whirlpool Financial Corporation preferred stock.

Whirlpool
received proceeds of $102 million in 2005, $64 million in 2004 and $65 million in 2003 related to the exercise of Company stock options. The Company's stock option
program is discussed in Notes 1 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

The Company's objective is to finance its business through an appropriate mix of long-term and short-term debt. By diversifying its
maturity structure, the Company avoids concentrations of debt, reducing liquidity risk. Whirlpool has varying needs for short-term working capital financing as a result of the nature of
its business. The volume and timing of refrigeration and air conditioning production impact the Company's cash flows, with increased production in the first half of the year to meet increased demand
in the summer months. The Company finances its working capital needs primarily through the commercial paper markets in the U.S., Europe and Canada. These commercial paper programs are supported by
committed bank lines. In addition, outside the U.S., short-term funding is also provided by bank borrowings on
uncommitted lines. The Company has access to long-term funding in the U.S., European and other public bond markets.

The
Company's financial position remains strong. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, Whirlpool's total assets were $8.2 billion. Stockholders' equity increased from $1.6 billion at the
end of 2004 to $1.7 billion at the end of 2005. The increase in equity is primarily attributed to net earnings retention and proceeds received from the exercise of stock options. These
increases were offset by decreases in equity due to minimum pension liability adjustments and share repurchases.

The
Company's overall debt levels have decreased since 2004. Cash flows from operations and proceeds from sales of assets/businesses have been used to repay debt, fund capital expenditures and pay
dividends.

F-10

On December 2, 2005, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Long Term Five-Year Credit Agreement (the "Amended and Restated Credit Agreement") by and among the Company,
certain other borrowers, the lenders referred to therein, Citibank N.A., as administrative agent and fronting agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as syndication agent, and ABN Amro Bank N.V., Royal Bank
of Scotland and Bank of America, as documentation agents, which amends and restates the Amended and Restated Long Term Credit Agreement dated as of May 28, 2004. On December 2, 2005, the
parties to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also entered into a 364-Day Credit Agreement (the "364-Day Credit Agreement" and together with the Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement, the "Credit Facilities").

The
Credit Facilities provide for an aggregate of $2.7 billion in committed unsecured revolving credit facilities. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement consists of a $2.2 billion
5-year credit facility, which includes a $200 million letter of credit subfacility. The 364-Day Credit Agreement consists of a $500 million 364-day
credit facility, which may be converted into a term loan. Borrowing capacity of $1.2 billion under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement became available on December 2, 2005.
Borrowing capacity of $500 million under the 364-Day Credit Agreement and the remaining $1.0 billion under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement will become available
upon the Department of Justice's final clearance of the acquisition of Maytag. Borrowings under the Credit Facilities will be available to the Company and designated subsidiaries for general corporate
purposes, including commercial paper support. Subsidiary borrowings under the facilities, if any, will be guaranteed by the Company. Interest under the Credit Facilities accrues at a variable annual
rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin dependent on the Company's credit rating at that time.

The
Credit Facilities require the Company to meet certain financial tests, including a leverage ratio of not more than 3.0 to 1.0 and an interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.0 to 1.0. The Credit
Facilities also contain covenants which, among other things, require the Company to deliver to the lenders specified financial information, including annual and quarterly financial information, and
limit the Company's ability to (or to permit any subsidiaries to), subject to various exceptions and limitations, (i) merge with other companies, (ii) create liens on its property;
(iii) incur debt or off-balance sheet obligations at subsidiary level; (iv) enter into transactions with affiliates, except on an arms-length basis;
(v) enter into agreements restricting the payment of subsidiary dividends or restricting the making of loans or repayment of debt by subsidiaries to the Company or other subsidiaries; and
(vi) enter into agreements restricting the creation of liens on its assets.

On
February 7, 2006, the Company filed a shelf registration statement with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") relating to an indeterminate amount of Debt Securities.

In
August 2005, in connection with its proposed acquisition of Maytag, Whirlpool was placed on credit watch with negative implications by Standard & Poor's, Moody's Investors Service and
Fitch Ratings. No action has been taken by any of the rating agencies concerning the Company's rating, and action, if any, would be taken after the acquisition of Maytag. The Company does not
anticipate that any future adjustments to these ratings would have a material impact on its liquidity. The Company's short-term credit rating has been confirmed, and accordingly,
availability of the commercial paper markets remains unchanged.

The
Company's Eurobonds of EUR 300 million principal amount will mature in June 2006. The Eurobonds U.S. dollar value at December 31, 2005 was $357 million. The Company
anticipates replacing the Eurobonds with a domestic bond offering and commercial paper.

On
September 9, 2005, the Company entered into an agreement with Harbor Shores Community Redevelopment Inc. ("Harbor Shores"), a not-for-profit entity, whereby
Whirlpool Corporation agreed to

F-11

loan
up to $12 million to Harbor Shores, secured by a mortgage on real estate owned by Harbor Shores. As of December 31, 2005, $4.5 million had been loaned under this agreement.
Membership interests in Harbor Shores are held by three U.S. not-for-profit entities, including Whirlpool Foundation. Certain current and former members of the Whirlpool
Corporation management team are involved in the Harbor Shores project, including Whirlpool's current CFO and its former CEO, both of whom are trustees and officers of Harbor Shores. None of these
individuals receives any compensation from the Company or the Whirlpool Foundation for their services to Harbor Shores. The purpose of the Harbor Shores project is to transform approximately 530 acres
in Benton Harbor and St. Joseph, Michigan, into a residential and commercial community with a goal of spurring economic development and further increasing the attractiveness of employment in southwest
Michigan.

On
December 12, 2005, the Company announced that it invested $250 million in its North American manufacturing base during 2005. In the last 12 months, the Company has made
improvements to its washer and dryer facilities in Ohio, began production of formed door refrigerators in Fort Smith, Arkansas and begun production of a new clothes washer in Monterrey, Mexico. In
addition, the Company has completed the construction of a refrigerator plant in Ramos Arizpe, Mexico that will begin producing refrigerators later in 2006. These investments continue the Company's
ongoing effort to expand its innovation capability and optimize its global operating platform.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

The Company has guarantee arrangements in place in a Brazilian subsidiary. As a standard business practice in Brazil, the subsidiary guarantees customer lines of
credit at commercial banks, supporting purchases from the Company, following its normal credit policies. If a customer were to default on its line of credit with the bank, the subsidiary would be
required to satisfy the obligation with the bank, and the receivable would revert back to the subsidiary. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, these amounts totaled $236 million and
$184 million, respectively. The only recourse the Company has related to these agreements would be legal or administrative collection efforts directed against the customer.

The
amounts in long-term liabilities include the Company's expected 2006 voluntary U.S. pension and foreign pension fund contributions, and expected benefit
payments under the postretirement health care benefit plans. Required contributions for future years depend on certain factors that cannot be determined at this time.

F-12

The
goal of the Company's global operating platform is to enhance the Company's competitive position in the global home appliance industry. The Company plans to continue its
comprehensive worldwide effort to optimize its regional manufacturing facilities, supply base, product platforms and technology resources to better support its global products, brands and customers.
The Company intends to make additional investments to improve its competitiveness in fiscal 2006. Capital spending is expected to be between $500 million and $525 million in 2006 in
support of the Company's investment in innovative product technologies and its global operating platform initiatives. The Company expects that higher cash flow from operations will more than offset
increased capital spending.

During
2004, Whirlpool's Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend from 34 cents per share to 43 cents per share.

The
Company believes that its capital resources and liquidity position at December 31, 2005, coupled with its planned cash flow generated from operations in 2006, are adequate to support higher
capital spending, continued dividend payments, repayment of debt and to meet anticipated business needs to fund future growth opportunities, including the cash portion of the consideration for the
proposed acquisition of Maytag and assumption of Maytag debt. Currently, the Company has access to capital markets in the U.S. and internationally.

PENDING MAYTAG ACQUISITION

On August 22, 2005, Whirlpool entered into a definitive merger agreement with Maytag to acquire all outstanding shares of Maytag common stock. The
aggregate transaction value, including the payment to Maytag stockholders of approximately $850 million in cash and between 9.2 million and 11.3 million shares of Whirlpool common
stock and assumption of approximately $972 million of Maytag debt (based on Maytag stock, exercisable stock options and debt reported outstanding as of December 31, 2005), is
approximately $2.7 billion. The number of shares of Whirlpool common stock to be issued will depend on the volume weighted average trading prices of Whirlpool common stock during a twenty
trading day period ending shortly before completion of the merger. The transaction was approved by Maytag shareholders on December 22, 2005 and is pending regulatory clearance as discussed
below.

Whirlpool
has sufficient resources to finance the acquisition. The acquisition and upcoming debt maturities of the combined company are expected to be financed initially through commercial paper
supported by existing bank agreements and with new committed bank facilities. The Company expects to eventually refinance a portion of its commercial paper in the capital markets.

Whirlpool
currently expects the merger with Maytag to generate approximately $300 million to $400 million of annual pre-tax cost savings by the third year following
completion of the merger. Efficiencies are expected to come from all areas across the value chain, including product manufacturing and marketing, global procurement, logistics, infrastructure and
support areas. Achieving these efficiencies will require one-time costs and capital investments currently estimated to be in the range of $350 million to $500 million, a
majority of which currently are anticipated to be capitalized or accrued in purchase accounting. Whirlpool currently anticipates incurring these costs during the first two years following completion
of the merger.

The
merger is subject to clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, and other customary closing conditions. On December 1, 2005, Whirlpool and Maytag
announced that they had certified substantial compliance with the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice in response to a request for additional information ("second request") and had agreed
not to close the proposed merger before February 27, 2006, without the Antitrust Division's concurrence, recognizing that the Antitrust Division could request additional time for review. On
February 13, 2006, Whirlpool and Maytag

F-13

announced
that they agreed with the Antitrust Division to a limited extension of time to complete the review of the proposed merger. The companies have agreed not to close the transaction before
March 30, 2006 without the Antitrust Division's concurrence.

Whirlpool
and Maytag are working closely with the Department of Justice and continue to cooperate fully with its investigation and respond promptly to its inquiries.

On
August 22, 2005, Whirlpool paid Maytag $40 million to reimburse Maytag for its payment of a fee to terminate its prior merger agreement with Triton Acquisition Holding Co. Whirlpool
has agreed to pay up to $15 million to assist Maytag in retaining key employees while the merger is pending. Whirlpool also has agreed to pay Maytag a "reverse break-up fee" of
$120 million under certain circumstances if the transaction cannot be closed due to an inability to obtain regulatory clearance.

OTHER MATTERS

On February 25, 2005, the Company announced the recall of approximately 162,000 under-the-counter plastic tall tub dishwashers due
to a potential safety issue. There have been no reports of personal injury or property damage associated with these dishwashers. The Company also is undertaking the repair of up to an additional
223,000 of these dishwashers for a separate quality issue. The Company accrued $17.1 million related to the quality issues within cost of products sold during the fourth quarter of 2004. During
2005, the estimated cost to recall and repair these units was reduced to $13.7 million primarily due to the recovery of certain costs from a parts supplier. The remaining accrual amount for
cost and a receivable from the supplier were not material at December 31, 2005.

Two
purported class action lawsuits have been filed against the Company, one in a Missouri state court and one in an Illinois state court, each alleging breach of warranty, fraud, and violation of
state consumer protection acts in selling tall tub dishwashers. There are no allegations of any personal injury or property damage and the complaints seek unspecified compensatory damages. The Company
believes these suits are without merit, intends to vigorously defend these actions, and at this point cannot reasonably estimate a possible range of loss, if any.

Whirlpool
is currently monitoring a supplier-related quality and potential product safety problem that may affect up to 3.5 million appliances manufactured between 2000 and 2002. Whirlpool
currently estimates that its potential cost from this matter ranges from zero to $235 million, depending on whether the cost of any such corrective action is borne initially by Whirlpool or the
supplier, and, if initially borne by Whirlpool, whether Whirlpool will be successful in recovering its costs from the supplier. In addition, Whirlpool could incur other costs arising out of this
matter, which cannot currently be estimated but could be material. No amounts have been recognized as of December 31, 2005.

In
2003, the Company recognized pre-tax charges of $16 million primarily for final expenses related to the 2001 recall of microwave oven hood units.

also contributed approximately $15 million to its U.S. pension plans during 2005, of which $13 million was a voluntary contribution to its funded plans and
$2 million was required. The Company also contributed $25 million to its foreign pension plans during 2005. At December 31, 2005, the Company's defined benefit pension plans still
remain underfunded on a combined basis. For the obligations and funded status of the U.S. and foreign plans, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

F-14

The
Company recognized consolidated pre-tax pension cost of $94 million, $91 million and $78 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Consolidated pension cost in
2006 is anticipated to be approximately $95 million, relatively unchanged from 2005. The Company currently expects that U.S. pension costs for 2006 will be approximately $72 million,
using an expected rate of return on assets assumption of 8.5% and a discount rate of 5.6%. The $72 million compares to pension cost of $66 million in 2005.

U.S.
pension plans comprise 86% of the Company's projected benefit obligation. The discount rate and expected return on asset assumptions used in determining the Company's U.S. pension benefit
obligations and costs are as follows:

The
Company's expected return on assets assumption of 8.5% was based on historical asset returns for publicly traded equity and fixed income securities tracked between 1926 and 2005 and the historical
returns for private equity. The historical equity returns were adjusted downward to reflect future expectations. This adjustment was based on published academic research. The expected returns are
weighted by the targeted asset allocations. The resulting weighted average return was rounded to the nearest quarter of one percent. The Company uses a measurement date of December 31.

On
November 14, 2005, the Company amended the Whirlpool Employees Pension Plan (the "WEPP"). The amendment will be reflected in the Company's 2006 pension cost and did not affect the
accumulated benefit obligation (the "ABO") or projected benefit obligation (the "PBO") at December 31, 2005.

In
January 2005, the Company amended the WEPP. The Company remeasured the net periodic cost and funded status of the plan at January 1, 2005 to reflect the amendment. The amendment
reduced the PBO by approximately $80 million. The ABO was not affected by the amendment since the accrued benefits as of December 31, 2005 were not affected by this change. See
Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

In
addition to pension plans, the Company sponsors plans to provide postretirement health care benefits for eligible retired U.S. employees. Eligible retirees are those who were full-time
employees with 10 years of service who attained age 55 while in service with the Company. The postretirement health care plans are generally contributory with participants' contributions
adjusted annually and include cost-sharing provisions that limit the Company's exposure for recent and future retirees. The plans are unfunded. The Company has reserved the right to modify
the benefits. In June 2003, the Company announced a modification to its U.S. retiree health care plans that affects certain future and current retirees and is based on a Retiree Healthcare
Savings Account ("RHSA"), where notional accounts are established for eligible active U.S. paid employees. The accounts reflect each year of service beginning at age 40 and is designed to provide
employees who retire after December 31, 2003 from Whirlpool with credits to apply towards health care premiums. In June 2003, the Company recorded a one-time curtailment gain
of $13.5 million, net of tax, related to the modification of its retiree health care plan. The Company provides no significant postretirement medical benefits to non-U.S. employees.

F-15

At
December 31, 2004 and 2005, discount rates were determined individually for each of its pension plans and the post-retirement plan based on the yield of AA rated
non-callable (or callable with make whole provisions) bonds.

In
December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the "Act") was enacted. The Act established a prescription drug benefit program under Medicare,
known as Part D, and a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Part D. In 2004, the Company
measured the effects of the Act following the guidance in FASB Staff Position ("FSP") 106-2, "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement
and Modernization Act of 2003." For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company reflected the estimated federal subsidy under the Act as an actuarial gain as required by FSP
106-2, which caused the accumulated other postretirement benefit obligation to decrease by $104 million, and reduced the cost recognized by approximately $15 million.

F-16

Legal Proceedings

The
Company is currently a defendant in 11 purported class action lawsuits in 11 states related to its Calypso clothes washing machine. Two of the original purported class actions have been
dismissed. The complaints in these lawsuits generally allege violations of state consumer fraud acts, unjust enrichment, and breach of warranty based on the allegations that the washing machines have
various defects. There are no allegations of any personal injury, catastrophic property damage, or safety risk. The complaints generally seek unspecified compensatory, consequential, and punitive
damages. The Company believes these suits are without merit and intends to vigorously defend these actions. At this point, the Company cannot reasonably estimate a possible range of loss, if any.

In
early 2004, Maytag filed a lawsuit against the Company for patent infringement. The suit seeks unspecified damages and an injunction against the continued production or sale of the alleged
infringed patented product. The Company believes this suit is without merit, and at this point cannot reasonably estimate a possible range of loss, if any. The suit has been stayed pending the outcome
of the pending Maytag acquisition.

In
1989, a Brazilian affiliate (now a subsidiary) of the Company brought an action against a financial institution in Brazil seeking a "Declaration of Non-Enforceability of Obligations"
relating to loan documentation entered into without authority by a senior officer of the affiliate. In September 2000, a decision in the declaratory action adverse to the Company became final.
In 2001, the financial institution began a collection action, and the Company responded with a counterclaim. The lower court dismissed the counterclaim in 2002 and the Superior Court confirmed the
lower court decision in December 2005. The Company provided for the potential exposure resulting from this litigation during 2005.

The
Company is involved in various other legal actions arising in the normal course of business. Management, after taking into consideration legal counsel's evaluation of such actions, is of the
opinion that the outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

Other

The
Brazilian Constitution provides the basis for tax credits on purchases of raw materials used in production. The credit applies to purchases of raw materials that are tax exempt or have a zero tax
rate. Several court decisions supported that tax credit and, during 2003 and 2004, the Company
calculated tax credits under this provision. The original amount recorded as tax credits is approximately $22 million. The recorded tax credits are currently being challenged in Brazilian
courts. At this point, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the potential impact, if any, to its consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. No tax credits were recorded
in 2005.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes and believes
those policies to be reasonable and appropriate. The Company's accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these accounting policies require
the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree
of uncertainty. The Company's critical accounting policies include the following:

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

— Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the costs of
future benefits and attributing the cost over the employee's expected period of employment with the Company. The determination of the Company's obligation and expense for

F-17

these
costs requires the use of certain assumptions. Those assumptions are included in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and include, among others, the discount rate, expected
long-term rate of return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates. These assumptions are subject to change based on, interest rates on high quality bonds, stock and bond markets and
medical cost inflation, respectively. As permitted by GAAP, actual results that differ from the Company's assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore, generally affect
its recognized expense and accrued liability in such future periods. While the Company believes that its assumptions are appropriate given current economic conditions and its actual experience,
significant differences in results or significant changes in the Company's assumptions may materially affect its pension and other postretirement obligations and related future expense. As required by
Statements of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 87, SFAS No. 132 (revised 2003) and SFAS No. 106, Whirlpool's pension and other postretirement benefit obligations as of
December 31, 2005 and preliminary retirement benefit costs for the 2006 fiscal year were prepared using the assumptions that were determined at December 31, 2005. The following table
highlights the sensitivity of Whirlpool's December 31, 2005 retirement obligations and 2006 retirement benefit costs of its U.S. plans to changes in the key assumptions used to determine those
results:

The analysis is an estimate only. These sensitivities may not be appropriate to use for other years' financial results. Furthermore, the impact of assumption
changes outside of the ranges shown above may not be approximated by using the above results.

Income Taxes

— As part of the process of preparing its Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company estimates its income taxes in each of
the taxing jurisdictions in which it operates. This process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of
certain items, such as the timing for recognizing expenses, for tax and accounting purposes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." These differences may result in
deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company is required to assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets, which include net
operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences that are expected to be deductible in future years, will be recoverable. Realization of the Company's net operating loss deferred tax assets is
supported by specific

F-18

tax
strategies and consider planned projections of future profitability. If recovery is not likely, the Company provides a valuation allowance based on its estimates of future taxable income in the
various taxing jurisdictions, and the amount of deferred taxes that are ultimately realizable. If future taxable income was lower than expected or if tax-planning strategies were not
available as anticipated, the Company may record additional valuation allowances through income tax expense in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if the Company determines that it would
be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amounts, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination is
made. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had total deferred tax assets of $923 million and $885 million, respectively, net of valuation allowances of
$114 million and $105 million, respectively (see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company's effective tax rate has ranged from 28.6% to 46.2% over the past
five years and has been influenced by audit settlements, tax planning strategies, enacted legislation, and dispersion of global income. A 1% increase in the Company's effective tax rate would have
decreased 2005 earnings by approximately $6 million. Future changes in the effective tax rate will be subject to several factors, including enacted laws, tax planning strategies, and business
profitability.

In
addition, the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of
time to
resolve. In the opinion of management, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years.

Product Recall

— The establishment of a liability for product recall expenses is occasionally required and is impacted by several factors
such as customer response rate, consumer options, field repair costs, inventory repair costs, extended warranty costs, communication structure and other miscellaneous costs such as legal, logistics
and consulting. The customer response rate, which represents an estimate of the total number of units to be serviced as a percentage of the total number of units affected by the recall, is the most
significant factor in estimating the total cost of each recall. This rate reflects several factors, including the type of product, the year manufactured, age of the product sold and current and past
experience factors. Significant differences between the Company's assumptions and its actual experience or significant changes in its assumptions could have a material impact on the Company's product
recall reserves.

Befiex Credits

— As discussed above, prior to 2005, the Company's Brazilian operations had recognized tax credits under Befiex, which
reduces Brazilian federal excise taxes on domestic sales, resulting in an increase in the operations' recorded net sales. Based on a recalculation of available credits and a favorable court decision
in the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company recognized approximately $23 million of export credits in December 2005 that is expected to be monetized by the end of the first quarter of
2006.

Warranty Obligations

— The estimation of warranty obligations is determined in the same period that revenue from the sale of the related
products is recognized. The warranty obligation is based on historical experience and reflects management's best estimate of expected costs at the time products are sold. Warranty accruals are
adjusted for known or anticipated warranty claims as new information becomes available. Future events and circumstances could materially change the Company's estimates and require adjustments to the
warranty obligation. New product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for a summary of the activity in the Company's product warranty accounts for 2005 and 2004.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 123 (R), "Share-Based Payments." SFAS No. 123
(R) requires the Company to measure all employee stock-based compensation awards using a fair-value method and record such expense in its consolidated financial

F-19

statements.
SFAS No. 123 (R) was originally effective for periods beginning after June 15, 2005; however, in April 2005, the SEC changed the effective date of SFAS
No. 123 (R) to fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005 for non-small business issuers. SFAS No. 123 (R) provides alternative methods of adoption,
which include a modified prospective application and a modified retroactive application. On January 1, 2006, the Company will adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 123 (R) and will
apply the modified prospective method that requires entities to recognize compensation costs in financial statements issued after the date of adoption for all share-based payments granted, modified or
settled after the date of adoption as well as for any awards that were granted and unvested prior to the adoption date. The adoption of FAS 123 (R) is expected to result in additional
pre-tax expense of approximately $7 million in 2006.

In
November 2004, FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costs, an Amendment of ARB No. 43 Chapter 4." SFAS No. 151 requires that items such as idle facility expense,
excessive spoilage, double freight, and rehandling be recognized as current-period charges rather than being included in inventory, regardless of whether the costs meet the criterion of abnormal as
defined in ARB 43. SFAS No. 151 is applicable for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company will adopt this standard beginning the first
quarter of fiscal year 2006 and does not believe the adoption will have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial position as such costs have historically been expensed as
incurred.

In
December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, "Exchanges of Non-Monetary Assets — an Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29," which addresses the measurement of
exchanges of non-monetary assets. SFAS No. 153 eliminates the exception to fair value for exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for
exchange transactions that do not have commercial substance. SFAS No. 153 specifies that a non-monetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of an entity are
expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. SFAS No. 153 is effective for fiscal periods after June 15, 2005. The implementation of SFAS No. 153 did not have a
material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial position.

In
March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. ("FIN") 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations — an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143." FIN 47
clarifies that SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," requires that an entity recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when
incurred if the liability's fair value can be reasonably estimated. FIN 47 is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after
December 15, 2005. The implementation of FIN 47 did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial position.

In
June 2005, the FASB issued FSP No. 143-1, "Accounting for Electronic Equipment Waste Obligations." The FSP addresses accounting by commercial users and producers of
electrical and electronic equipment, in connection with WEEE issued by the EU on February 13, 2003. This Directive requires EU-member states to adopt legislation to regulate the
collection, treatment, recovery, and environmentally sound disposal of electrical and electronic waste equipment, and sets forth certain obligations relating to covering the cost of disposal of such
equipment by commercial users. Producers will also be required to cover the cost of disposal of such equipment under the WEEE legislation if they are participating in the market as of
August 13, 2005. As of December 31, 2005, while many EU-member states had enacted legislation, several major EU-member states were still in the drafting process.
As a result, final estimates regarding the financial impact from WEEE legislation on the Company cannot be made at this time. The Company continues to evaluate the impact of the WEEE legislation as
EU-member states implement guidance and will account for related costs accordingly.

F-20

MARKET RISK

The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, domestic and foreign interest rates, and commodity prices, which can affect
the Company's operating results and overall financial condition. Whirlpool manages its exposure to these market risks through its operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate,
through the use of derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for speculation or for trading purposes. Derivative financial
instruments are contracted with a diversified group of investment grade counterparties to reduce exposure to nonperformance on such instruments. The Company's sensitivity analysis reflects the effects
of changes in market risk.

Whirlpool
uses foreign currency forward contracts, currency options and currency swaps to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted cross-border payments and receipts
related to its ongoing business and operational financing activities. Foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2005, a 10%
unfavorable exchange rate movement in each currency in the Company's portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have resulted in an incremental unrealized loss of approximately $54 million,
while a 10% favorable shift would have resulted in an incremental unrealized gain of approximately $47 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange
rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying exposures.

The
Company enters into commodity swap contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted commodities purchases that are not fixed directly through supply contracts. As
of December 31, 2005, a 10% unfavorable shift in commodity prices would have resulted in an incremental loss of approximately $18 million in the commodity swap contracts, while a 10%
favorable shift would have resulted in an incremental gain of approximately $19 million.

Whirlpool
utilizes interest rate swaps to hedge the Company's interest rate risk. As of December 31, 2005, a 10% shift in interest rates would have resulted in an incremental $7 million
gain or loss related to these contracts.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. Management's
Discussion and Analysis and other sections of this report contain forward-looking statements that reflect the Company's current views with respect to future events and financial performance.

Certain
statements contained in this Financial Supplement, including those within the forward-looking perspective section within this Management's Discussion and Analysis, and other written and oral
statements made from time to time by the Company do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. As such, they are considered "forward-looking statements" which provide current expectations or
forecasts of future events. Such statements can be identified by the use of terminology such as "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "may," "could," "possible," "plan," "project,"
"will," "forecast," and similar words or expressions. The Company's forward-looking statements generally relate to its growth strategies, financial results, product development, and sales efforts.
These forward-looking statements should be considered with the understanding that such statements involve a variety of risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, and may be affected by inaccurate
assumptions. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may vary materially.

Forward-looking
statements in this document include, but are not limited to, statements regarding expected earnings per share, cash flow and material and oil-related costs, as well as
expectations as to the

F-21

closing
of the proposed merger with Maytag. Many risks, contingencies and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from Whirlpool's forward-looking statements. Among these factors
are: (1) intense competition in the home appliance industry reflecting the impact of both new and established global, including Asian and European, manufacturers and the strength of trade
customers; (2) Whirlpool's ability to continue its strong relationship with Sears Holding Corporation in North America (accounting for approximately 16% of Whirlpool's 2005 consolidated net
sales of $14 billion) and other significant trade customers, and the ability of these trade customers to maintain or increase market share; (3) industry demand, which reflects factors
such as gross domestic product, consumer interest rates, consumer confidence, housing starts, sales of existing homes and the level of mortgage refinancing; (4) the ability of Whirlpool to
achieve its business plans, including productivity improvements, cost control, leveraging of its global operating platform and acceleration of the rate of innovation; (5) fluctuations in the
cost of key materials (including steel, oil, plastic resins, copper and zinc) and components and the ability of Whirlpool to offset cost increases; (6) the ability of suppliers of critical
parts, components and manufacturing equipment to deliver sufficient quantities to Whirlpool in a timely and cost-effective manner; (7) changes in market conditions, health care cost
trends and pending regulation that could increase future funding obligations for pension and post-retirement benefit plans; (8) the cost of compliance with environmental and health
and safety regulations, including new regulations in Europe regarding appliance disposal; (9) potential exposure to product liability claims including the outcome of Whirlpool's
previously-announced investigation of a supplier-related quality and potential product safety problem that may affect up to 3.5 million appliances manufactured between 2000 and 2002;
(10) the impact of labor relations; (11) Whirlpool's ability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights; (12) the ability of Whirlpool to manage foreign currency and its
effective tax rate; (13) global, political and/or economic uncertainty and disruptions, especially in Whirlpool's significant geographic markets, including uncertainty and disruptions arising
from natural disasters, including possible effects of recent U.S. hurricanes or terrorist activities; and (14) risks associated with operations outside the U.S. Other such factors relate to
Whirlpool's pending merger with Maytag, including (1) the ability of Whirlpool and Maytag to satisfy the conditions to closing (including regulatory approval) and the costs and consequences of
not closing; (2) the effect on Maytag's business of the pending transaction; and (3) in the event the merger is completed, Whirlpool's ability to integrate the business of Maytag on a
timely basis and realize the full anticipated benefits of the merger within the current estimate of costs.

The
Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, and investors are advised to review disclosures in the Company's filings with the SEC. It is not possible to foresee or
identify all factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historic results. Therefore, investors should not consider the foregoing factors to be an exhaustive statement of all
risks, uncertainties, or factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning these factors can be found in "Risk Factors." See
Item 1A, Risk Factors, to Part I of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(1) SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of Operations

Whirlpool
Corporation is a leading global manufacturer and marketer of major home appliances. The Company manufactures in 12 countries under nine principal brand names and markets products to
distributors and retailers in more than 170 countries.

Principles of Consolidation

The
Consolidated Financial Statements include all majority-owned subsidiaries. Investments in affiliated companies consist of a 40% voting interest in an international company engaged in the sale of
major home appliances, a 30% interest in an international company engaged in the sale of extended warranty contracts and a 25% interest in an international company engaged in the sale of kitchen
cabinets. These companies are accounted for by the equity method. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.

Use of Estimates

Management
is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Revenue Recognition

Sales
are recorded when title passes to the customer. The point at which title passes is determined by the shipping terms. For the majority of the Company's sales, title is transferred to the customer
as soon as the product is shipped. For a portion of the Company's sales, primarily in Europe, title is transferred to the customer upon receipt of the product at the customer's location. Allowances
for estimated returns are made on sales of certain products based on historical return rates for the products involved.

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The
Company carries its accounts receivable at their face amounts less an allowance for doubtful accounts. On a periodic basis, the Company evaluates its accounts receivable and establishes the
allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of specific customer circumstances and credit conditions and based on a history of write-offs and collections. The Company evaluates
items on an individual basis when determining accounts receivable write-offs. The Company's policy is generally to not charge interest on trade receivables after the invoice becomes past
due. A receivable is considered past due if payments have not been received within agreed upon invoice terms.

Freight and Warehousing Costs

Freight
and warehousing costs included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the statements of operations were $800 million, $723 million and $576 million in 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively.

Cash and Equivalents

All
highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an initial maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalents.

F-27

Inventories

Inventories
are stated at first-in, first-out ("FIFO") cost, except U.S. production inventories, which are stated at last-in, first-out ("LIFO") cost,
and Brazilian inventories, which are stated at average cost. Costs do not exceed realizable values.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property,
plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of plant and equipment is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. Useful
lives for buildings range from 25 to 40 years and for machinery and equipment range from 3 to 10 years. Assets recorded under capital leases are included in property, plant and
equipment.

Research and Development Costs

Research
and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. Such costs were $339 million, $315 million and $285 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Advertising Costs

Advertising
costs are charged to expense as incurred. Such costs were $239 million, $221 million and $170 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Contingent Tax Matters

The
Company establishes liabilities for probable and estimable assessments by taxing authorities resulting from known tax exposures. Such amounts represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately
expected to be paid, and may need to be adjusted over time as more information becomes known.

Foreign Currency Translation

The
functional currency for the Company's international subsidiaries and affiliates is typically the local currency. Certain international subsidiaries utilize the U.S. dollar as the functional
currency.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The
Company recognizes all of its derivative instruments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities," as amended. Changes in the fair value of hedge assets or liabilities (i.e., gains or losses) are recognized depending upon the type of hedging relationship and whether a hedge has been
designated. For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, the Company must further designate the hedging instrument, based upon the exposure being hedged, as
a cash flow hedge, fair value hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.

Cash
flow hedges are hedges that use derivatives to offset the variability of expected future cash flows. The effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated as
a cash flow hedge is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same line item associated with the hedged transaction in the same period or
periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the unrealized gain or loss on the derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in interest and sundry
income/expense in current earnings during the period of change.

F-28

Fair
value hedges are hedges that mitigate the risk of changes in the fair values of assets, liabilities and certain types of firm commitments. The gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated
as a fair value hedge and the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item are recognized in the same line item associated with the hedged item in current earnings during the period of the change in
fair values.

Net
investment hedge designation refers to the use of derivative contracts or cash instruments to hedge the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation. For those derivatives
that qualify as net investment hedges, the effective portion of any unrealized gain or loss is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income as part of the cumulative translation adjustment. Any
ineffective portion of net investment hedges is recognized in interest and sundry income/expense in current earnings during the period of change.

For
derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, the unrealized gain or loss is recognized in interest and sundry income/expense in current earnings during the period of change.

Stock-Based Employee Compensation

Stock
option and incentive plans are accounted for under the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,"
and related Interpretations. The Company has adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and Disclosure" but has not
adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," as amended. Had the Company elected to adopt the recognition provisions of SFAS
No. 123, pro-forma net earnings and diluted net earnings per share would be as follows:

Net Earnings Per Common Share

Diluted
net earnings per share of common stock includes the dilutive effect of stock options and stock based compensation plans. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, a total of
approximately 576,000 options, 1,831,000 options and 1,803,000 options, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their exercise prices would render them
anti-dilutive.

Basic
and diluted earnings per share were calculated as follows:

F-30

(2) NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In
December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 123 (R), "Share-Based Payments." SFAS No. 123 (R) requires the Company to measure all
employee stock-based compensation awards using a fair-value method and record such expense in its consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 123 (R) was originally effective
for periods beginning after June 15, 2005; however, in April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") changed the effective date of SFAS No. 123 (R) to fiscal
years beginning after June 15, 2005 for non-small business issuers. SFAS No. 123 (R) provides alternative methods of adoption, which include a modified prospective
application and a modified retroactive application. On January 1, 2006 the Company will apply the modified prospective method which requires entities to recognize compensation costs in
financial statements issued after the date of adoption for all share-based payments granted, modified or settled after the date of adoption as well as for any awards that were granted and unvested
prior to the adoption date. The adoption of FAS 123 (R) is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial position.

In
November 2004, FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costs, an Amendment of ARB No. 43 Chapter 4." SFAS No. 151 requires that items such as idle facility expense,
excessive spoilage, double freight, and rehandling be recognized as current-period charges rather than being included in inventory, regardless of whether the costs meet the criterion of abnormal as
defined in ARB 43. SFAS No. 151 is applicable for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS
No. 151 will have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial position; as such costs have historically been expensed as incurred.

In
December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, "Exchanges of Non-Monetary Assets — an Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29," which addresses the measurement of
exchanges of non-monetary assets. SFAS No. 153 eliminates the exception to fair value for exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for
exchange transactions that do not have commercial substance. SFAS No. 153 specifies that a non-monetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of an entity are
expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. SFAS No. 153 is effective for fiscal periods after June 15, 2005. The implementation of SFAS No. 153 is not expected
to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial position.

In
March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. ("FIN") 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations — an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143." FIN 47
clarifies that SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," requires that an entity recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when
incurred if the liability's fair value can be reasonably estimated. FIN 47 is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. The implementation of FIN 47 did
not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial position.

In
June 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") No. 143-1, "Accounting for Electronic Equipment Waste Obligations." The FSP addresses accounting by commercial users
and producers of electrical and electronic equipment, in connection with Directive 2002/96/EC on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment ("WEEE") issued by the European Union ("EU") on
February 13, 2003. This Directive requires EU-member states to adopt legislation to regulate the collection, treatment, recovery, and environmentally sound disposal of electrical
and electronic waste equipment, and sets forth certain obligations relating to covering the cost of disposal of such equipment by commercial users. Producers will also be required to cover the cost of
disposal of such equipment under the WEEE legislation if they are participating in the market as of August 13, 2005. As of December 31, 2005, while many EU-member states had
enacted legislation, several major EU-member states were still in the drafting process. As a result, final estimates regarding the financial impact from WEEE legislation on the Company
cannot be made at

F-31

this
time. The Company continues to evaluate the impact of the WEEE legislation as EU-member states implement guidance and will account for related costs accordingly.

(3) GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES

Goodwill

Under
SFAS No. 142, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are no longer amortized and are subject to an annual impairment analysis, performed during the fourth quarter of each year. The
Company determines the fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow approach. The Company has determined its reporting units are: North America, Europe, Multibras and Embraco (which
combined are Latin America), and Asia. The Company performed the annual impairment tests and
determined there was no impairment of remaining goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

The
following table summarizes the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill:

December 31

Reporting Unit — Millions of dollars

Latin America



Total

$

The
$1 million increase in the carrying value of North America goodwill is related to the effects of currency translation for its Canadian subsidiary.

Other Intangible Assets

The
carrying amounts of other intangibles are comprised of the following:

The
balances include trademarks acquired as part of the Whirlpool Mexico and Polar S.A. ("Polar") acquisitions in 2002 and intangible assets related to minimum pension liabilities (see
Note 14). Accumulated amortization totaled $4 million and $3 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004. During 2005 and 2004, fully amortized intangible assets were removed
from the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet.

(4) BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS / DISPOSITIONS

Polar

On
June 5, 2002, the Company acquired 95% of the shares of Polar, a leading major home appliance manufacturer in Poland. The results of Polar's operations have been included in the Consolidated
Financial Statements within the Europe operating segment since that date. The aggregate purchase price was $27 million in cash plus outstanding debt at the time of acquisition, which totaled
$19 million. The

F-32

transaction
also generated $17 million in indefinite-lived intangible assets related to trademarks owned by Polar. During 2003, Whirlpool acquired the remaining 5% of the shares of Polar.

MASA

In
September 2005, the Company completed the sale of its 93% interest in Multibras da Amazonia S.A. ("MASA"), an injection molding subsidiary located in Manaus, Brazil, to Flextronics
Plasticos Ltda. Proceeds from the sale were $48 million, and a $9 million pre-tax gain from the sale is included in the interest and sundry income/expense line of the
Company's 2005 Consolidated Statements of Operations. Whirlpool will continue to purchase certain products from Multibras da Amazonia S.A. The entity was not a significant subsidiary, and accordingly,
pro-forma results of operations have not been provided.

Other

On
September 30, 2003, the Company completed the sale of its interest in Wellmann to Alno, both companies being prominent German kitchen cabinet manufacturers. The sale did not have a material
impact to the Company's financial position or results of operations. The Company has a 25% interest in Alno after increasing its interest from 13% during 2005. The increased investment, as well as the
Company's interest in the results of operations of Alno during 2005 were not material. The Company
analyzed the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. ("FIN") 46 with respect to its interest in Alno and determined that Alno did not meet the definition of a variable interest entity.

(6)  FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS

Notes Payable and Debt

On
December 2, 2005, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Long Term Five-Year Credit Agreement (the "Amended and Restated Credit Agreement") by and among the Company,
certain other borrowers, the lenders referred to therein, Citibank N.A., as administrative agent and fronting agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as syndication agent, and ABN Amro Bank N.V., Royal Bank
of Scotland and Bank of America, as documentation agents, which amends and restates the Amended and Restated Long Term Credit Agreement dated as of May 28, 2004. On December 2, 2005, the
parties to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also entered into a 364-Day Credit Agreement (the "364-Day Credit Agreement" and together with the Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement, the "Credit Facilities").

The
Credit Facilities provide for an aggregate of $2.7 billion in committed unsecured revolving credit facilities. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement consists of a $2.2 billion
5-year credit facility,

F-33

which
includes a $200 million letter of credit subfacility. The 364-Day Credit Agreement consists of a $500 million 364-day credit facility, which may be
converted into a term loan. Borrowing capacity of $1.2 billion under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement became available on December 2, 2005. Borrowing capacity of
$500 million under the 364-Day Credit Agreement and the remaining $1.0 billion under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement will become available upon clearance of the
acquisition of Maytag by the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. Borrowings under the Credit Facilities will be available to the Company and designated subsidiaries for general corporate
purposes, including commercial paper support. Subsidiary borrowings will be guaranteed by the Company. Interest under the Credit Facilities accrues at a variable annual rate based on the London
Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus a margin dependent on the Company's credit rating at the time of borrowing.

The
Credit Facilities require the Company to meet certain financial tests, including a leverage ratio not greater than 3.0 to 1.0 and an interest coverage ratio not less than 2.0 to 1.0. The Credit
Facilities also contain covenants which, among other things, require the Company to deliver to the lenders specified
financial information, including annual and quarterly financial information, and limit the Company's ability to (or to permit any subsidiaries to), subject to various exceptions and limitations,
(i) merge with other companies; (ii) create liens on its property; (iii) incur debt or off-balance sheet obligations at the subsidiary level; (iv) enter into
transactions with affiliates, except on an arms-length basis; (v) enter into agreements restricting the payment of subsidiary dividends or restricting the making of loans or
repayment of debt by subsidiaries to the Company or other subsidiaries; and (vi) enter into agreements restricting the creation of liens on its assets.

At
December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under these credit agreements.

During
2005 and 2004, there were no borrowings outstanding under these credit agreements.

Notes
payable consist of the following:

The
fair value of the Company's notes payable approximates the carrying amount due to the short maturity of these obligations. The weighted-average interest rate on notes payable was 4.7% and 3.5% for
the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Long-term
debt consists of the following:

December 31 — Millions of dollars



Eurobonds (EUR 300 million) — 5.875% due 2006

$


$


Debentures — 9.1% due 2008

The
Company's Euro-denominated Eurobonds mature in June 2006. The Company anticipates replacing the Eurobonds with the proceeds of a domestic bond offering and commercial paper.

Annual
maturities of long-term debt in the next five years are $365 million, $9 million, $127 million, $2 million and $365 million, respectively.

The
Company paid interest on short-term and long-term debt totaling $137 million, $124 million and $137 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The
fair value of long-term debt (including current maturities) was $1,213 million and $1,315 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and was estimated
using discounted cash flow analyses based on incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.

On
February 7, 2006, the Company filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, covering an indeterminate amount of debt securities.

Preferred Stock

Although
most of its assets have been divested, WFC remains a legal entity with assets consisting primarily of leveraged leases. WFC also has 17,500 shares of Series B preferred stock
outstanding as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 with a face value of $100 per share, an annual dividend of $6.55 per share and a mandatory redemption date of September 1, 2008. The
preferred stock amounts are included within minority interests in the consolidated balance sheets and the carrying amounts approximate fair value.

The
preferred stockholders are entitled to vote together on a share-for-share basis with WFC's common stockholder, Whirlpool. Preferred stock dividends are payable quarterly.
On September 1, 2003, WFC redeemed 331,800 shares of the Series B preferred stock at a price of $100 per share (at par). The redemption terms required the payment of any accrued unpaid
dividends in addition to the applicable redemption premium, and accordingly, a total of $0.6 million was paid on September 1, 2003 related to dividends. The terms of the preferred
stockholders agreement provides for a final payment on September 1, 2008 (the mandatory redemption date) equal to the number of Series B preferred stock outstanding multiplied by the
face value of $100 per share.

The
Company and WFC are parties to a support agreement. Pursuant to the agreement, if at the close of any quarter, WFC's net earnings available for fixed charges (as defined) for the preceding twelve
months is less than a stipulated amount, the Company is required to make a cash payment to WFC equal to the insufficiency within 60 days of the end of the quarter. The Company was not required
to make any payments under this agreement during 2005 or 2004. The support agreement may be terminated by either WFC or the Company upon 30 days notice provided that certain conditions are met.
The Company has also agreed to maintain ownership of at least 70% of WFC's voting stock.

(7)  GUARANTEES, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Guarantees

The
Company has guarantee arrangements in place in a Brazilian subsidiary. As a standard business practice in Brazil, the subsidiary guarantees customer lines of credit at commercial banks, supporting
purchases from the Company, following its normal credit policies. If a customer were to default on its line of credit with the bank, the subsidiary would be required to satisfy the obligation with the
bank, and the receivable would revert back to the subsidiary. As of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, the guaranteed amounts totaled $236 million and $184 million,
respectively. The only recourse the Company has with respect to these arrangements would be legal or administrative collection efforts directed against the customer.

F-35

The
Company provides guarantees of indebtedness and lines of credit for various consolidated subsidiaries. The maximum amount of credit facilities under guarantee for consolidated subsidiaries totaled
$1.4 billion at both December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004. Outstanding credit facility amounts under guarantee totaled $79 million and $148 million at
December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively.

Product
warranty reserves are established in the same period that revenue from the sale of the related products is recognized. The amounts of those reserves are based on established terms and the
Company's best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date.

The

Contingencies

In
early 2004, Maytag filed a lawsuit against the Company for patent infringement. The suit seeks unspecified damages and an injunction against the continued production or sale of the alleged
infringed patented product. The Company believes this suit is without merit, intends to vigorously defend this suit and at this point cannot reasonably estimate a possible range of loss, if any. The
suit has been stayed pending the outcome of the pending Maytag acquisition.

F-36

In 1989, a Brazilian affiliate (now a subsidiary) of the Company brought an action against a financial institution in Brazil seeking a "Declaration of Non-Enforceability of Obligations"
relating to loan documentation entered into without authority by a senior officer of the affiliate. In September 2000, a decision in the declaratory action adverse to the Company became final.
In 2001, the financial institution began a collection action, and the Company responded with a counterclaim. The lower court dismissed the counterclaim in 2002 and the Superior Court confirmed the
lower court decision in December 2005. The Company has provided for the potential exposure resulting from this litigation during 2005.

The
Company is currently a defendant in 11 purported class action lawsuits in 11 states related to its Calypso clothes washing machine. Two of the original purported class actions have been dismissed.
The complaints in these lawsuits generally allege violations of state consumer fraud acts, unjust enrichment, and breach of warranty based on the allegations that the washing machines have various
defects. There are no allegations of any personal injury, catastrophic property damage, or safety risk. The complaints generally seek unspecified compensatory, consequential and punitive damages. The
Company believes these suits are without merit and intends to vigorously defend these actions. At this point, the Company cannot reasonably estimate a possible range of loss, if any.

Two
purported national class action lawsuits have been filed against the Company, one in a Missouri state court and one in an Illinois state court, each alleging breach of warranty, fraud, and
violation of state consumer protection acts in selling tall tub dishwashers. There are no allegations of any personal injury or property damage and the complaint seeks unspecified compensatory
damages. The Company believes these suits are without merit, intends to vigorously defend these actions, and at this point cannot reasonably estimate a possible range of loss, if any.

Whirlpool
is currently monitoring a supplier-related quality and potential product safety problem that may affect up to 3.5 million appliances manufactured between 2000 and 2002. The Company
currently estimates that its potential cost from this matter ranges from zero to $235 million, depending on whether the cost of any such corrective action is borne initially by Whirlpool or the
supplier, and, if initially borne by Whirlpool, whether Whirlpool will be successful in recovering its costs from the supplier. In addition, Whirlpool could incur other costs arising out of this
matter, which cannot currently be estimated but could be material.

The
Company is involved in various other legal actions arising in the normal course of business. Management, after taking into consideration legal counsel's evaluation of such actions, is of the
opinion that the outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

(8)  HEDGES AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The
Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, domestic and foreign interest rates, and commodity prices. Fluctuations in these rates and prices can affect the
Company's operating results and financial condition. The Company manages its exposure to these market risks through its operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial
instruments. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.

Using
derivative markets means assuming counterparty credit risk. Counterparty risk relates to the loss the Company could incur if a counterparty defaulted on a derivative contract. The Company deals
only with investment-grade counterparties and monitors its overall credit risk and exposure to individual counterparties. The Company does not anticipate nonperformance by any counterparties. The
amount of counterparty credit exposure is generally the unrealized gains on such derivative contracts. The Company does not require, nor does it post, collateral or security on such contracts.

Forecasted cross currency cash flows relate primarily to foreign currency denominated expenditures and intercompany financing agreements, royalty agreements and
dividends. Non-functional currency asset and liability hedges are undesignated but relate primarily to short term payables and receivables and intercompany loans. Commodity swaps relate to
raw material purchases (for example, copper and aluminum) used in the manufacturing process. Unrealized gains relating to these foreign exchange forwards/options and commodity swaps were
$44 million as of December 31, 2005. The unrealized gains and losses for 2004 were not significant.

The
Company's $100 million interest rate swaps maturing in 2006 is designated and is effective as a hedge of future cash payments and is treated as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes.
The fair value of this contract is a loss of $2.8 million as of December 31, 2005 and a loss of $6 million as of December 31, 2004.

The
Company's $100 million interest rate swaps maturing in 2008 are designated and are effective as hedges of the fair value of the fixed-rate debt and are treated as fair value hedges for
accounting purposes. The fair values of these contracts are a loss of $1 million as of December 31, 2005.

The
Company has designated a portion of its Euro-denominated fixed-rate debt as a hedge to protect the value of its net investments in its European subsidiaries. Translation
adjustments related to this debt are not included in the income statement, but are shown in the cumulative translation adjustment account included in accumulated other comprehensive income. During the
year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recognized $29 million of net gain within the cumulative translation adjustment related to this net investment hedge.

During
the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company's gains and losses related to the ineffective portion of its hedging instruments were immaterial. The Company did not recognize
any material gains or losses during the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 for cash flow hedges that were discontinued because the forecasted transaction was not probable to occur.

The
amount of unrealized gains on derivative instruments included in other comprehensive income related to contracts maturing, and expected to be realized, during 2006 is approximately
$42 million at December 31, 2005.

(9)  STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

The
Company's Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $500 million on June 15, 2004. The share repurchases are made from time to time on the open market as
conditions

F-38

warrant.
Share repurchases authorized from the $500 million share repurchase program occurred in 2005 and 2004. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company repurchased 530,100
shares of Whirlpool common stock in the open market at an aggregate purchase price of $34 million. During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company repurchased 20,000 shares of
Whirlpool common stock in the open market at an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1 million.

During
2004, the Company concluded the share repurchase programs approved by the Company's Board of Directors on March 1, 1999 ($250 million) and February 15, 2000
($750 million). The Company repurchased 17.4 million shares at a cost of $1 billion, of which 0.7 million shares were purchased in 2002, 1.0 million shares were
purchased in 2003 and 3.7 million shares were purchased in 2004. The 2004 shares were purchased in the open market at an average cost of $68.39 per share. The 2003 shares
were purchased from the Company's U.S. pension plans at an average cost of $67.24 per share, which was based upon an average of the high and low market prices on the date of purchase.

In
addition to its common stock, the Company has 10 million authorized shares of preferred stock (par value $1 per share), none of which is outstanding.

Accumulated
other comprehensive loss, net of tax, consists of:

Preferred Stock Purchase Rights

One
Preferred Stock Purchase Right ("Rights") is outstanding for each share of common stock. The Rights, which expire May 22, 2008, will become exercisable 10 days after a person or
group (an "Acquiring Person") has acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding common stock (the "Trigger Date") or 10 business days after the
commencement, or public disclosure of an intention to commence, a tender offer or exchange offer by
a person that could result in beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding common stock. Each Right entitles the holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a share
of a Junior Participating Preferred Stock, Series B, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company at a price of $300 per one one-thousandth of a Preferred Share subject to adjustment.

If
a person becomes an Acquiring Person, proper provision shall be made so that each holder of a Right, other than Rights that are or were beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person (which will
thereafter be void), shall thereafter have the right to receive upon exercise of such Right that number of shares of common stock (or other securities) having at the time of such transaction a market
value of two times the exercise price of the Right. If a person becomes an Acquiring Person and the Company is involved in a merger or other business combination transaction where the Company is not
the surviving corporation or where common stock is changed or exchanged or in a transaction or transactions in which 50% or more of its consolidated assets or earning power are sold, proper provision
shall be made so that each holder of a Right (other than such Acquiring Person) shall thereafter have the right to receive, upon the exercise thereof at the then current exercise price of the Right,
that number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company which at the time of such transaction would have a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right. In addition, if an
Acquiring Person does not have beneficial ownership of 50% or more of the common stock, the Company's Board of Directors has the option of exchanging all or part

F-39

of
the Rights for an equal number of shares of common stock in the manner described in the Rights Agreement.

Prior
to the Trigger Date, the Board of Directors of the Company may redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $.01 per Right, payable in cash, shares of common stock or any other
consideration deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors. Immediately upon action of the Board of Directors ordering redemption of the Rights, the ability of holders to exercise the Rights will
terminate and such holders will only be able to receive the redemption price.

Until
such time as the Rights become exercisable, the Rights have no voting or dividend privileges and are attached to, and do not trade separately from, the common stock.

The
Company covenants and agrees that it will cause to be reserved and keep available at all times a sufficient number of shares of Preferred Stock (and following the occurrence of a Triggering Event,
shares of common stock and/or other securities) to permit the exercise in full of all Rights from time to time outstanding.

(10)  STOCK OPTION AND INCENTIVE PLANS

Stock option and incentive plans are accounted for in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees," and related Interpretations. Generally, no compensation expense is recognized for stock options with exercise prices equal to the market value of the underlying shares of stock at the date
of grant. Stock options generally have 10-year terms, and vest and become fully exercisable over a two or three year period after date of grant. Compensation expense related to the
Company's stock-based incentive plans is recognized ratably over each plan's defined vesting period. Pre-tax expenses under the Company's stock-based incentive plans were
$24 million, $15 million and $21 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The
Company's stock option and incentive plans permit the grant of stock options and other stock awards covering up to 10.5 million shares to key employees of the Company and its subsidiaries,
of which options and awards covering up to 2.6 million shares are available for grant at December 31, 2005. Outstanding restricted and phantom shares totaled 1,500,125 with a
weighted-average grant-date fair value of $67.56 per share at December 31, 2005 and 1,249,759 with a weighted-average grant-date fair value of $61.55 per share at
December 31, 2004.

Whirlpool
has a Non-employee Director Equity Plan. This plan provides for (a) a one time grant of 1,000 shares of common stock upon a director joining the Board of Directors;
(b) an annual grant of stock options valued at $36,000 with the number of options to be based on dividing $36,000 by the product of the then current fair market value of a single share of the
common stock multiplied by 0.35; and (c) an annual grant of stock worth $54,000 with the number of shares to be issued to the director determined by dividing $54,000 by the then current fair
market value of the common stock of the Company. The exercise price under each option granted is the fair market value of the common stock as of the final trading day before the annual meeting of
stockholders. These options are exercisable for 20 years or, if earlier, two years after a non-employee director ceases to serve on Whirlpool's Board of Directors, provided that no
option is exercisable within the first six months of its term, unless death or disability of the director occurs. In the event of a non-employee director's death, such options will be
exercisable for one year from the date of death. Payment of the exercise price may be made in cash or, if permitted by law, Whirlpool common stock, valued at its market price at the time of exercise.
At December 31, 2005, there were 275,782 shares available for grant under this plan.

The
fair value of stock options used to compute pro-forma net earnings and diluted net earnings per share disclosures, as presented in Note 1, is the estimated present value at grant date using
the Black-Scholes

F-40

option-pricing
model with the following assumptions for 2005, 2004 and 2003: expected volatility of 25.5%, 28.7% and 31.7%; dividend yield of 2.4%, 2.6% and 2.2%; risk-free interest rate
of 4.4%, 3.6% and 3.2%, and a weighted-average expected option life of five years for all three years.

(11)  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

Under
Whirlpool's ongoing global operating platform initiatives, the Company implemented certain restructuring initiatives to enhance Whirlpool's competitive position in the global appliance industry.
The Company plans to continue its comprehensive worldwide effort to optimize its regional manufacturing facilities, supply base, product platforms and technology resources to better support its global
brands and customers. In addition to the global operating platform initiatives, the Company began to implement organizational initiatives designed to increase efficiencies in support functions
throughout the Company. The restructuring plan primarily relates to headcount reductions in European
sales and supporting offices, moving manufacturing capacity to lower cost locations throughout Europe, and headcount reductions in an Asian manufacturing location.

Under
a restructuring initiative begun in 2004, the Company incurred restructuring charges of $57 million and $22 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company also recognized a
($7) million credit in 2004 resulting from final settlements of prior year restructuring initiatives. Net charges of $57 million and $15 million are included in the restructuring costs
line in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2005, approximately 2,000 employees have been terminated as a result of this initiative. The Company expects that
this restructuring initiative may reduce up to 3,500 positions in total.

Through
December 31, 2003, the Company had approved all phases of a restructuring program that began in the fourth quarter of 2000 and resulted in cumulative pre-tax restructuring
charges of $247 million, of which $3 million was recognized during 2003. These charges are included in the restructuring costs line on the Company's Consolidated Statements of
Operations. The restructuring plan relates primarily to the closing of a refrigeration plant in the Company's Latin America region, a parts packing facility and a

F-41

cooking
plant in the North America region, a plastic components facility in the Asia region, the relocation of several laundry manufacturing facilities in Europe and a restructuring of the Company's
microwave business in its Europe region. Employees terminated to date under the plan include both hourly and salaried employees, the majority of which were hourly personnel at the facilities listed
above. For the initiatives announced through December 31, 2003, the Company expected to reduce over 7,100 positions; substantially all of whom had left the Company as of December 31,
2005.

(12)  PRODUCT RECALLS

On
February 25, 2005, the Company announced the recall of approximately 162,000 under-the-counter plastic tall tub dishwashers due to a potential safety issue. There
have been no reports of personal injury or property damage associated with these
dishwashers. The Company also is undertaking the repair of up to an additional 223,000 of these dishwashers for a separate quality issue. The Company accrued $17.1 million related to the
quality issues within cost of products sold during the fourth quarter of 2004. During 2005, the estimated cost to recall and repair these units was reduced to $13.7 million primarily due to the
recovery of certain costs from a parts supplier. The remaining cost accrual and supplier receivable were not material at December 31, 2005. During 2003, the Company incurred an additional
$16 million ($10 million after-tax) primarily related to final expenses in connection with a 2001 recall.

At
December 31, 2005, the Company has foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $893 million, $689 million of which do not expire with substantially all of the remaining
$204 million expiring in various years through 2014. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had $58 million of foreign tax credit carryforwards available to offset future payments
of federal income taxes, expiring in varying amounts between 2012 and 2015.

The
Company has recorded valuation allowances to reflect the estimated amount of net operating loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards that will be realized. The valuation allowance of
$114 million at December 31, 2005 is made up of $94 million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards and $20 million of other deferred tax assets that the Company
currently believes are more likely than not to remain unrealized in the future.

Other
than earnings specifically noted below, the Company has historically reinvested all of the unremitted earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. Due to a restructuring of selected
foreign subsidiaries, the Company plans to distribute approximately $102 million of foreign earnings over the next several years. This distribution is presently forecast to result in tax
benefits which have not been recorded currently because of its contingent nature. There has been no deferred tax liability provided on the remaining amount of unremitted earnings of
$1.23 billion at December 31, 2005. Should the Company make a distribution from the unremitted earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, it would be subject to additional U.S.
taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of the deferred tax liability

F-44

associated
with these unremitted earnings because of the complexities associated with this hypothetical calculation.

During
the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company repatriated approximately $25 million of foreign earnings from its affiliates in Hong Kong and Colombia under the American Jobs Creation Act of
2004. The repatriation occurred for purposes of balancing the Company's cash position abroad and had an immaterial impact on the Company's tax provision.

In
August 2005, President Bush signed into law the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the "2005 Energy Act"). Among the many provisions of this legislation are manufacturer's tax credits in 2006 and
2007 for the accelerated production of super-efficient washers, refrigerators and dishwashers to meet 2007 Energy Star standards. Whirlpool has historically, and will continue to, invest in innovative
and energy efficient products for its customers and has products in development that will support utilization of these tax credits over the two-year period.

As
of December 31, 2005, the Company was in various stages of audits by various governmental tax authorities. The Company establishes liabilities for probable and estimable assessments by
taxing authorities resulting from known tax exposures. Such amounts represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid, and may need to be adjusted over time as more information
becomes known. The Company paid income taxes of $276 million in 2005, $277 million in 2004 and $261 million in 2003.

(14) PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS PLANS

The
Company has both funded and unfunded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all of its North American employees and certain European and Brazilian employees. The
U.S. salaried employees receive defined benefits based on years of service and final average salary, while U.S. hourly employees receive benefits based on specific dollar amounts for each year of
service.

The
U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans provide that in the event of a plan termination within five years following a change in control of the Company, any assets held by the plans in excess
of the amounts needed to fund accrued benefits would be used to provide additional benefits to plan participants. A change in control generally means either a change in the majority of the incumbent
Board of Directors or an acquisition of 25% (30% for purposes of the Whirlpool Production Employees Retirement Plans) or more of the voting power of the Company's outstanding stock, without the
approval of a majority of the incumbent board.

The
Company also has a postretirement health care benefit program for eligible retired U.S. employees. Eligible retirees are those who were full-time employees with 10 years of
service who attained age 55 while in service with the Company. The health care plans are generally contributory with participants' contributions adjusted annually. The postretirement health care plans
include cost-sharing provisions that limit the Company's exposure for recent and future retirees. The plans are unfunded. The Company has reserved the right to modify the benefits. In
June 2003, the Company announced a modification to its U.S. retiree health care plans that affects certain future and current retirees, and is based on a Retiree Healthcare Savings Account
("RHSA"), where notional accounts are established for eligible active U.S. paid employees. The accounts reflect each year of service beginning at age 40 and is designed to provide employees who retire
from the Company after December 31, 2003 with credits to apply towards health care premiums. In June 2003, the Company recorded a one-time gain of $13.5 million, net
of tax, related to the modification of its retiree health care plan. No significant postretirement medical benefits are provided by the Company to non-U.S. employees.

F-45

The
Company was required to remeasure the net periodic cost and funded status of one of its pension plans and the Whirlpool Retiree Healthcare Plan at February 29, 2004. The interest rate used
for this remeasurement was 6%, the same as at year-end 2003.

In
December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the "Act") was enacted. The Act established a prescription drug benefit under Medicare, known as
Part D, and a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Part D. In 2004, the Company measured the
effects of the Act following the guidance in FSP 106-2, "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003." For
the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company reflected the estimated federal subsidy under the Act as an actuarial gain as required by FSP 106-2, which caused the accumulated other
postretirement
benefit obligation to decrease by $104 million, and reduced the cost that otherwise would have been recognized in 2004 by approximately $15 million.

Lump
sum retirement distributions were made from the Company's nonqualified pension plans in the third and fourth quarters of 2004 resulting in the recognition of settlement charges of
$9.5 million. As a result of these settlements, the Company remeasured the nonqualified pension plans at July 1, 2004 using a discount rate of 6.25% and at December 31, 2004 using
a discount rate of 5.85%.

On
November 14, 2005, the Company amended the Whirlpool Employees Pension Plan (the "WEPP"). The amendment will be reflected in the Company's 2006 pension cost and did not affect the
accumulated benefit obligation (the "ABO") or projected benefit obligation (the "PBO") at December 31, 2005.

In
January 2005, the Company amended the WEPP. The Company remeasured the net periodic cost and funded status of the plan at January 1, 2005 to reflect the amendment. The effect of this
amendment was to reduce the PBO by approximately $80 million. The ABO was not affected by the amendment since the accrued benefits as of December 31, 2005 were not affected by this
change.

The
Company maintains a 401(k) defined contribution plan covering substantially all U.S. employees. Company matching contributions for domestic hourly and certain other employees under the plan, based
on the Company's annual operating results and the level of individual participants' contributions, amounted to $20 million, $12 million and $15 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

The
Company uses a December 31 measurement date for the majority of its pension and other postretirement benefit plans.

In the U.S., the expected rate of return on plan assets was determined by using the historical asset returns for publicly traded equity and fixed income
securities tracked from 1926 through 2005 and the historical returns for private equity. The historical equity returns were adjusted downward to reflect future expectations. This adjustment was based
on published academic research. The expected returns are weighted by the targeted asset allocations. The resulting weighted-average return was rounded to the nearest quarter of one percent.

For
foreign pension plans, the expected rate of return on plan assets was determined by observing historical returns in the local fixed income and equity markets and computing the weighted average
returns with the weights being the asset allocation of each plan.

Assumed
health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the
following effects:

Plan Assets

The
Company's investment philosophy is to diversify the pension assets subject to a specified asset allocation policy. The Company rebalances the asset classes to stay within an acceptable range
around the targeted allocation. The asset allocation is based on the belief that, over the long term, equities will outperform fixed income investments. The assets are invested in both indexed funds
and actively managed funds, depending on the asset class.

Whirlpool's
pension plan asset allocation at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and target allocation for 2006, by asset category are as follows:

Cash Flows

The Company's funding policy is to contribute to its U.S. pension plans amounts sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirement as defined by employee benefit
and tax laws, plus additional amounts which the Company may determine to be appropriate. In certain countries other than the U.S., the funding of pension plans is not common practice. The Company has
several unfunded non-U.S. pension plans. The Company pays for retiree medical benefits as they are incurred.

The
$32 million expected to be contributed to the U.S. pension plans during 2006 represents the sum of $4 million of expected benefit payments from corporate cash for the unfunded
non-qualified pension plans and $28 million of expected voluntary contributions to its funded pension plans. The Company expects no minimum required contributions to its funded
pension plans in 2006.

The
$23 million expected to be contributed to the foreign pension plans during 2006 represents contributions to the Company's pension plans.

The
$52 million expected to be contributed to fund the other postretirement benefit plans during 2006 represents expected benefit payments from corporate cash.

Contributions
by participants to the other postretirement benefit plans were $9 million and $6 million for the years ending December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

(15) BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION

Operating
segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated on a regular basis by the chief operating decision maker, or
decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing performance of the segment.

The
Company identifies such segments based upon geographical regions of operations because each operating segment manufactures home appliances and related components, but serves strategically
different markets. The chief operating decision maker evaluates performance based upon each segment's operating income, which is defined as income before interest income and sundry, interest expense,
taxes, minority interests and before one-time charges. Total assets by segment are those assets directly associated with the respective operating activities. The "Other/Elimination" column
primarily includes corporate expenses, assets and eliminations as well as all other one-time charges. Intersegment sales are eliminated within each region with the exception of compressor
sales out of Latin America which are included in Other/Eliminations.

Sales
activity with Sears, a North American major home appliance retailer, represented 16%, 17% and 18% of consolidated net sales in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Related receivables were 21%,
19% and 22% of consolidated trade receivables as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The
Company conducts business in two countries that individually comprised over 10% of consolidated net sales and/or total assets within the last three years. The United States represented 56%, 56%
and 57% of net sales for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, while Brazil totaled 8%, 6% and 6% for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. As a percentage of total assets, the United States accounted for
42%, 39% and 41% at the end of 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Brazil accounted for 15%, 12% and 11% of total assets at the end of 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

F-52

As described above, the Company's chief operating decision maker reviews each operating segment's performance based upon operating income excluding one-time charges, primarily
restructuring. These charges are included in operating profit on a consolidated basis and included in the Other/Eliminations column in the tables below. For 2005, the operating segments recorded total
restructuring charges as follows: North America — $4 million, Europe — $36 million, Latin America — $8 million, Asia —
$7 million and Corporate — $2 million for a total of $57 million. For 2004, the operating segments recorded total restructuring (See Note 11) as follows: North
America — $2 million, Europe — $7 million, Latin America — $6 million, Asia — $0 million and Corporate —
$0 million, for a total of $15 million. For 2003, the operating segments recorded total restructuring charges as follows: North America — $1 million, Europe
— $2 million, Latin America — $0 million, Asia — $0 million and Corporate — $0 million, for a total of $3 million.

(17)  PENDING MAYTAG ACQUISITION

On
August 22, 2005, Whirlpool entered into a definitive merger agreement with Maytag to acquire all outstanding shares of Maytag common stock. The aggregate transaction value, including the
payment to Maytag stockholders of approximately $850 million in cash and between 9.2 million and 11.3 million shares of Whirlpool common stock and assumption of approximately
$972 million of Maytag debt (based on Maytag stock, exercisable stock options and debt reported outstanding as of December 31, 2005), is approximately $2.7 billion. The number of
shares of Whirlpool common stock to be issued will depend on the volume weighted-average trading prices of Whirlpool common stock during a twenty trading day period ending shortly before completion of
the merger. The transaction was approved by Maytag shareholders on December 22, 2005 and is pending regulatory clearance as discussed below.

Whirlpool
has sufficient resources to finance the acquisition. The acquisition and upcoming debt maturities of the combined company are expected to be financed initially through commercial paper
supported by existing bank agreements and with new committed bank facilities. The Company expects to eventually refinance a portion of its commercial paper in the capital markets.

The
merger is subject to clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, and other customary closing conditions. On December 1, 2005, Whirlpool and Maytag
announced that they had certified substantial compliance with the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice in response to a request for additional information ("second request") and had agreed
not to close the proposed merger before February 27, 2006, without the Antitrust Division's concurrence, recognizing that the Antitrust

F-54

Division
could request additional time for review. On February 13, 2006, Whirlpool and Maytag announced that they agreed with the Antitrust Division to a limited extension of time to complete
the review of the proposed merger. The companies have agreed not to close the transaction before March 30, 2006 without the Antitrust Division's concurrence.

Whirlpool
and Maytag are working closely with the Department of Justice and continue to cooperate fully with its investigation and respond promptly to its inquiries.

On
August 22, 2005, Whirlpool paid Maytag $40 million to reimburse Maytag for its payment of a fee to terminate its prior merger agreement with Triton Acquisition Holding Co. At
December 31, 2005, paid and accrued costs related to the potential merger total $77 million and included the above mentioned fee, as well as $37 million of professional fees
incurred in connection with the proposed acquisition. These costs have been capitalized and are recorded in the other assets line within the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. If consummation of
the transaction does not occur, the costs will be reclassified to expense. Whirlpool has agreed to pay up to $15 million to assist Maytag in retaining key employees while the merger is pending.
Whirlpool also has agreed to pay Maytag a "reverse break-up fee" of $120 million under certain circumstances if the transaction cannot be closed due to an inability to obtain
regulatory clearance.

Report by Management on the Consolidated Financial Statements

The
management of Whirlpool Corporation has prepared the accompanying financial statements. The financial statements have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, whose report, based upon their audits, expresses the opinion that these financial statements present fairly the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows
of Whirlpool and its subsidiaries in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Their audits are conducted in conformity with the auditing standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).

The
financial statements were prepared from the Company's accounting records, books and accounts which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect all material transactions. The Company
maintains a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that the Company's books and records, and the Company's assets are maintained and accounted for, in accordance with
management's authorizations. The Company's accounting records, policies and internal controls are regularly reviewed by an internal audit staff.

The
audit committee of the Board of Directors of the Company is composed of five independent directors who, in the opinion of the board, meet the relevant financial experience, literacy, and expertise
requirements. The audit committee provides independent and objective oversight of the Company's accounting functions and internal controls and monitors (1) the objectivity of the Company's
financial statements, (2) the Company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, (3) the independent registered public accounting firm's qualifications and independence, and
(4) the performance of the Company's internal audit function and independent registered public accounting firm. In performing these functions, the committee has the responsibility to review and
discuss the annual audited financial statements and quarterly financial statements and related reports with management and the independent registered public accounting firm, including the Company's
disclosures under "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," to monitor the adequacy of financial disclosure. The Committee also has the responsibility to
retain and terminate the Company's independent registered public accounting firm and exercise the committee's sole authority to review and approve all audit engagement fees and terms and preapprove
the nature, extent, and cost of all non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The
management of Whirlpool Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Whirlpool's internal control system is designed to provide
reasonable assurance to the Company's management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.

All
internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to
financial statement preparation and presentation.

The
management of Whirlpool assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set
forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework.

Based on our
assessment and those criteria, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005.

Whirlpool
Corporation's independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on our assessment of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. This report appears on
page F-61.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
Stockholders and Board of Directors

Whirlpool Corporation

Benton Harbor, Michigan

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Whirlpool Corporation as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in
stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the index at Item
15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Whirlpool Corporation at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statement taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Whirlpool Corporation's internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
Stockholders and Board of Directors

Whirlpool Corporation

Benton Harbor, Michigan

We
have audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Whirlpool Corporation maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Whirlpool Corporation's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, management's assessment that Whirlpool Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Whirlpool Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2005, based on the COSO criteria.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Whirlpool Corporation as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2005 and our report dated February 28, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
