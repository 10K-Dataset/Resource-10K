ITEM 1.

Business

.

General

Whirlpool Corporation, the leading worldwide manufacturer and
marketer of major home appliances, was incorporated in 1955 under the laws of Delaware as the successor to a business that traces its origin to 1898. The Company manufactures in 14 countries under nine major brand names and markets products to
distributors and retailers in more than 170 countries. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had approximately 68,000 employees. As used herein, and except where the context otherwise requires, the terms “Company” and “Whirlpool”
include Whirlpool Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Products and Markets

The
Company manufactures and markets a full line of major appliances and related products, primarily for home use. The Company’s principal products are home laundry appliances, home refrigerators and freezers, home cooking appliances, home
dishwashers, room air-conditioning equipment, and mixers and other small household appliances. Approximately 10% of the Company’s unit sales volume is purchased from other manufacturers for resale by the Company. The Company also produces
hermetic compressors and plastic components, primarily for the home appliance and electronics industries.

The following table sets forth information regarding the total net sales contributed by each class of similar products which accounted for
10% or more of the Company’s consolidated net sales in 2002, 2001, and 2000.

The
Company markets and distributes major home appliances in the United States under the

Whirlpool

,

KitchenAid

,

Roper

, and

Estate

brand names primarily to retailers, buying groups, and builders.

KitchenAid

portable
appliances, such as mixers, are sold directly to retailers. The Company sells products to the builder trade both directly and through distributors. Additionally, the Company sells to Crosley Corporation under the

Crosley

private label brand,
and to Costco Wholesale Corporation under the

Kirkland Signature

brand. Major home appliances are manufactured and/or distributed in Canada under the

Inglis

,

Admiral

,

Speed Queen

,

Whirlpool

,

Roper

,

and

KitchenAid

brand names. In Mexico, major home appliances are manufactured and marketed under the

Whirlpool

,

Acros

,

KitchenAid, Estate, Roper,

and

Supermatic

brand names. Some products are sold in limited
quantities by the Company to other manufacturers and retailers for resale in North America under their respective brand names.

The Company has been the principal supplier of home laundry appliances to Sears, Roebuck and Co. (“Sears”) for over 80 years.
The Company is also the principal supplier to Sears of residential trash compactors and a major supplier to Sears of dishwashers, freestanding ranges, home refrigerators and freezers, and microwave-hood combinations. The Company supplies products to
Sears for sale under Sears’

Kenmore

brand name. Sears has also been a major outlet for the Company’s

Whirlpool

and

KitchenAid

brand products since 1989. In 2002, approximately 21% of the Company’s net sales were
attributable to sales to Sears.


In Europe,
Whirlpool markets and distributes its major home appliances under the

Whirlpool

,

Bauknecht

,

Ignis

,

Laden

,

Polar

, and other local brand names and its portable appliances under the

KitchenAid

brand name. In
addition to its extensive operations in Western Europe, the Company has sales subsidiaries in Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Croatia, and Morocco and representative offices in
Russia, Ukraine, Yugoslavia, and Slovenia. In certain Eastern European countries, products bearing the

Whirlpool

and

Ignis

brand names are sold through distributors. The Company manufactures refrigerators and freezers and markets a
full line of products under the

Whirlpool

,

KIC

, and

Ignis

brand names in South Africa. Whirlpool’s European operations also sell products carrying the

Whirlpool

,

Bauknecht

,

Ignis

,

Algor

, and

Fides

brand names directly in Asia and to distributors and dealers in Africa and the Middle East.

In Latin America, the Company markets and distributes its major home appliances through regional networks under the

Whirlpool

,

Brastemp

,

Consul

, and

Eslabon de Lujo

brand names. Appliance sales and distribution in Brazil, Argentina, and Chile are managed by the Company’s Brazilian subsidiary, and in Bolivia, Peru, Paraguay, and Uruguay through
distributors. Appliance sales and distribution in Central American countries, the Caribbean, Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador are managed by Whirlpool’s North America Region and through distributors.

In Asia, the Company has organized the manufacture, marketing,
and distribution of its major home appliances into five operating groups: (1) mainland China; (2) South Asia, which includes India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Nepal; (3) Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, and Pacific Islands; (4) North
Asia, which includes Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, and Japan; and (5) Southeast Asia, which includes Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The Company markets and sells its products in Asia under the brand names

Whirlpool

,

KitchenAid

,

Bauknecht

and

Ignis

by a combination of direct sales to high-volume retailers and chain stores, and through full-service distributors to a large network of electronics stores.

Competition

The major home appliance business is highly competitive. In
most major markets throughout the world, 2002 was a challenging year in the industry with rising material costs, decreased consumer demand, and intense price competition. In North America, there has been continued polarization in retail distribution
channels with most retailers either (1) offering little or no customer service and competing solely on the basis of price, or (2) providing value added services coupled with a brand building strategy. The Company firmly believes that it can
best compete in the current environment by providing value added products and services under its strong brand names.

The Company believes that, in terms of units sold, it is the largest North American manufacturer of home laundry appliances and one of the
largest North American manufacturers of home refrigerators and freezers, room air conditioning equipment, dishwashers, and cooking products. The Company believes that in North America there are approximately 20 manufacturers or marketers of major
home appliances.

The Company believes that in
Europe it is, in terms of units sold, one of the four largest manufacturers and marketers of major home appliance products, out of approximately 35 European manufacturers, the majority of which manufacture a limited range of products for a specific
geographic region. There continues to be significant merger and acquisition activity as manufacturers seek to broaden product lines and expand geographic markets, and the Company believes that some merger and acquisition activity will continue. The
Company believes that its Pan European organizational structure and strategy of marketing brand names that are recognized throughout the region are competitive advantages in the European market.

The Company believes that it is well-positioned in the Latin
American appliance market due to its ability to offer a broad range of products under well-recognized brand names to meet the specific requirements of consumers in the region. The Company believes that it is about twice the size of its nearest
competitor and that there are approximately 25 manufacturers or marketers of major home appliances in the region.


In Asia, the
major home appliance market is characterized by low saturation and, as a result, rapid growth (except in Japan and South Korea). The Asian market is served by approximately 50 manufacturers or marketers of varying size and position on a
country-by-country basis. The Company believes that it is the industry leader in the Indian market and it continues to establish itself throughout the remainder of the region.

Competition in most of the Company’s markets is based upon a wide variety of factors, including,
principally, product features, price, product quality and performance, service, warranty, advertising and promotion. As a result of its global position, the Company believes it has a competitive advantage by reason of its ability to leverage
engineering capabilities across regions, transfer best practices, and economically purchase raw materials and component parts in large volumes.

Other Information

The Company’s interests outside the United States are subject to risks which may be greater than, or in addition to, those risks
which are currently present in the United States. Such risks may include currency exchange rate fluctuations; high inflation; the need for governmental approval of, and restrictions on, certain financial and other corporate transactions, and new or
continued business operations; the convertibility of local currencies; government price controls; restrictions on the remittance of dividends, interest, royalties, and other payments; restrictions on imports and exports; duties; political and
economic developments and instability; the possibility of expropriation; uncertainty as to the enforceability of commercial rights and trademarks; and various types of local participation in ownership.

The Company is generally not dependent upon any one source for
raw materials or purchased components essential to its business. In those areas where a single supplier is used, alternative sources are generally available and can be developed within the normal manufacturing environment, although some
unanticipated costs may be incurred in transitioning to a new supplier where a prior single supplier is abruptly terminated. While there are pricing pressures on some materials and significant demand for certain components, the Company believes such
raw materials and components will be available in adequate quantities to meet anticipated production schedules.

Patents presently owned by the Company are considered, in the aggregate, to be important to the conduct of the Company’s business.
The Company is licensed under a number of patents, none of which individually is considered material to its business. The Company is the owner of a number of trademarks and registrations therefor in the U.S. and foreign countries. The most important
for its North American operations are the trademarks

Whirlpool

,

KitchenAid

, the

KitchenAid Mixer Shape

,

Estate

,

Roper

,

Supermatic, Acros

, and

Inglis

. The most important trademarks owned by the Company
in Europe are

Whirlpool

,

Bauknecht

,

,

and

.

In Latin America, the most important trademarks owned by the Company are

Whirlpool

,

, and

. The most important trademark owned by the Company in Asia is

.

Expenditures for Company-sponsored research and engineering activities relating to the development of new products and the improvement of existing products are included in Note 1 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in the Annual Report which is incorporated herein by reference.

The Company’s manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect or enhance the environment, many of which require federal, state, or other governmental
licenses and permits with regard to wastewater discharges, air emissions, and hazardous waste management. The Company’s policy is to comply with all such laws and regulations. Where laws and regulations are less restrictive, the Company has
established and is following its own standards consistent with its commitment to environmental responsibility.

The Company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with all presently applicable federal, state, local, and other
governmental provisions relating to environmental protection in the countries in which it has manufacturing operations. Capital expenditures and expenses for manufacturing operations directly attributable to compliance with such provisions worldwide
amounted to approximately $32.5 million in 2002,


$23 million in 2001, and $22 million in 2000. It is estimated that in 2003 environmental capital expenditures and expenses for manufacturing
operations will be approximately $26 million. Capital expenditures and expenses for product related environmental activities were not material in any of the past three years and are not expected to be material in 2003.

Globally, the entire major home appliance industry, including
the Company, must contend with the adoption of stricter governmental energy and environmental standards to be phased in over the next several years. These include the general phase-out of ozone depleting chemicals used in refrigeration and energy
standards rulemakings for other selected major appliances produced by the Company. Compliance with these various standards as they become effective will require some product redesign. However, the Company believes, based on its understanding of the
current state of proposed regulations, that it should be able to develop, manufacture, and market products that comply with these regulations.

The Company has been notified by state and federal environmental protection agencies of its possible involvement in a number of
“Superfund” sites in the United States. However, based upon evaluation of the facts and circumstances relating to these sites by the Company and its technical consultants, the Company does not presently anticipate any material adverse
effect upon the Company’s earnings, financial condition, or competitive position arising out of the resolution of these matters or the resolution of any other known governmental proceeding regarding environmental protection matters.

Report of Ernst

The Stockholders and Board of Directors

Whirlpool Corporation

Benton Harbor, Michigan

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Whirlpool Corporation as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Whirlpool Corporation as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2002 the Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill and
other intangible assets. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2001 the Company changed its method of accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities.
