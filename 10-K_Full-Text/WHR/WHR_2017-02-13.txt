PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Whirlpool Corporation ("Whirlpool"), the number one major appliance manufacturer in the world, was incorporated in 1955 under the laws of Delaware as the successor to a business that traces its origin to 1898. Whirlpool manufactures products in


countries and markets products in nearly every country around the world under brand names such as

Whirlpool

,

KitchenAid

,

Maytag

,

Consul

,

Brastemp

,

Amana

,

,

Jenn-Air, Indesit, and Hotpoint

*.

Whirlpool’s reportable segments consist of North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"), Latin America and Asia.

As of

December 31, 2016

, Whirlpool had approximately

93,000

employees.

As used herein, and except where the context otherwise requires, “Whirlpool,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Whirlpool Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.

*Whirlpool ownership of the Hotpoint brand in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions is not affiliated with the Hotpoint brand sold in the Americas


In Asia, we have organized the marketing and distribution of our major home appliances and small domestic appliances into five operating groups: (1) mainland China; (2) Hong Kong and Taiwan; (3) India, which includes Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Pakistan; (4) Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand and Pacific Islands; and (5) Southeast Asia, which includes Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Korea, Myanmar and Japan. We market and distribute our products in Asia primarily under the

Whirlpool

,

,

Amana

,

Bauknecht

,

Jenn-Air

,

Diqua, and Royalstar

brand names through a combination of direct sales to appliance retailers and chain stores and through full-service distributors to a large network of retail stores.

Competition

Competition in the major home appliance industry is intense, including competitors such as Arcelik, Bosch Siemens, Electrolux, Haier, Kenmore, LG, Mabe, Midea, Panasonic and Samsung, many of which are increasingly expanding beyond their existing manufacturing footprint. Moreover, our customer base includes large, sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive products, services and prices. Competition in our business is based upon a wide variety of factors, including selling price, product features and design, performance, innovation, energy efficiency, quality, cost, distribution and financial incentives. These financial incentives include cooperative advertising, co-marketing funds, salesperson incentives, volume rebates and terms. We believe that we can best compete in the current environment by focusing on introducing new and innovative products, building strong brands, enhancing trade customer and consumer value with our product and service offerings, expanding our regional footprint and trade distribution channels, increasing productivity, improving quality, lowering costs, and taking other efficiency-enhancing measures.

Raw Materials and Purchased Components

We are generally not dependent upon any one source for raw materials or purchased components essential to our business. In areas where a single supplier is used, alternative sources are generally available and can be developed within the normal manufacturing environment. Some supply disruptions and unanticipated costs may be incurred in transitioning to a new supplier if a prior single supplier relationship was abruptly interrupted or terminated. In the event of a disruption, we believe that we will be able to qualify and use alternate materials, sometimes at premium costs, and that such raw materials and components will be available in adequate quantities to meet forecasted production schedules.

Trademarks, Licenses and Patents

We consider the trademarks, copyrights, patents, and trade secrets we own, and the licenses we hold, in the aggregate, to be a valuable asset. Whirlpool is the owner of a number of trademarks in the United States and foreign countries. The most important trademarks to North America are

Whirlpool

,

Maytag

,

Jenn-Air

,

KitchenAid

,

Amana

and

Acros

. The most important trademarks to Latin America are

Consul,

Brastemp,

Whirlpool

and

KitchenAid

. The most important trademarks to EMEA are

Whirlpool

,

KitchenAid, Bauknecht, Indesit, Hotpoint

*

, Hotpoint-Ariston

and

Ignis

. The most important trademarks to Asia are

Whirlpool, Royalstar and Diqua

. We receive royalties from licensing our trademarks to third parties to manufacture, sell and service certain products bearing the

Whirlpool, Maytag, KitchenAid,

and

Amana

brand names. We continually apply for and obtain United States and foreign patents. The primary purpose in obtaining patents is to protect our designs and technologies.

Research and Development

Expenditures for research and development relating to new and innovative products and the improvement of existing products were approximately $

604 million

,

$579 million

and

$563 million

in


,


and


, respectively.

Protection of the Environment

Our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect or enhance the environment, many of which require federal, state, or other governmental licenses and permits with regard to wastewater discharges, air emissions, and hazardous waste management. Our policy is to comply with all such laws and regulations. Where laws and regulations are less restrictive, we have established and are following our own standards, consistent with our commitment to environmental responsibility.

*Whirlpool ownership of the Hotpoint brand in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions is not affiliated with the Hotpoint brand sold in the Americas


We believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with presently applicable governmental provisions relating to environmental protection in the countries in which we have manufacturing operations. Compliance with these environmental laws and regulations did not have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings, or our competitive position during


and is not expected to be material in


.

The entire major home appliance industry, including Whirlpool, must contend with the adoption of stricter governmental energy and environmental standards. These standards were phased-in over the past several years and include the general phase-out of ozone-depleting chemicals used in refrigeration, and energy standards for selected major appliances, regulatory restrictions on the materials content specified for use in our products by some jurisdictions and mandated recycling of our products at the end of their useful lives. Compliance with these various standards, as they become effective, will require some product redesign. However, we believe, based on our understanding of the current state of proposed regulations, that we will be able to develop, manufacture, and market products that comply with these regulations.

Whirlpool participates in environmental assessments and cleanup at a number of locations globally.  These include operating and non-operating facilities, previously owned properties and waste sites, including "Superfund" (under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA)) sites. However, based upon our evaluation of the facts and circumstances relating to these sites along with the evaluation of our technical consultants, we do not presently anticipate any material adverse effect upon our earnings, financial condition, or competitive position arising out of the resolution of these matters or the resolution of any other known governmental proceeding regarding environmental protection matters.

Acquisitions

ABOUT WHIRLPOOL

Whirlpool is the number one major appliance manufacturer in the world with net sales of approximately

$21 billion

in


. We are a leading producer of major home appliances in North America, Europe and Latin America, and have a significant presence throughout China and India. We have received worldwide recognition for accomplishments in a variety of business and social efforts, including leadership, diversity, innovative product design, business ethics, social responsibility and community involvement. We conduct our business through four reportable segments, which we define based on geography. Our reportable segments consist of North America, EMEA, Latin America and Asia. Our customer base includes large, sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive products, services and prices. The major home appliance industry operates in an intensely competitive environment, reflecting the impact of both new and established global competitors, including Asian and European manufacturers.

The charts below summarize the balance of net sales by reportable segment for


,


and


, respectively:

We monitor country-specific economic factors such as gross domestic product, unemployment, consumer confidence, retail trends, housing starts and completions, sales of existing homes and mortgage interest rates as key indicators of industry demand. In addition to profitability, we also focus on country, brand, product and channel sales when assessing and forecasting financial results.

Our leading portfolio of brands includes

Whirlpool, Maytag, KitchenAid, Embraco, Brastemp, Consul

and

Indesit

. Our global branded consumer products strategy is to introduce innovative new products, increase brand customer loyalty, expand our presence outside the United States, enhance our trade management platform, improve total cost and quality by expanding and leveraging our global operating platform and, where appropriate, make strategic acquisitions and investments.

As we grow revenues in our core products, our strategy is to extend our business by offering products and services that are dependent on and related to our core business and expand into adjacent products, such as

Affresh

cleaners

and

Gladiator

GarageWorks

,

through businesses that leverage our core competencies and business infrastructure.

OVERVIEW

During 2016, we had another year of strong performance for Whirlpool Corporation, as we delivered record results through strong operational execution and decisive actions to adjust to changes in global markets.

Over the last few years, macroeconomic volatility has been a factor in many of the countries where we operate. We continued to experience volatility during 2016. The Brexit decision in June had a negative impact on British currency and demand, while uncertainty in emerging markets generated additional currency and demand weakness, especially in Brazil, Russia and China.


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)

These challenges, along with a further strengthening U.S. dollar, had a combined negative impact of approximately $600 million in revenue and $2 per share of earnings.

Our earnings growth and strong cash generation enabled us to create long-term shareholder value through the execution of our balanced capital allocation approach. We invested in our innovation pipeline through $660 million in capital expenditures while increasing our dividend by 11% and repurchasing $525 million in common stock. These investments continue to be supported by a strong balance sheet, an increased capacity to invest and the confidence that our operating plans will deliver extraordinary levels of shareholder value both now and in the future.

Our long-term value creation framework is built upon the strong foundation we have in place: our industry-leading brand portfolio and robust product innovation pipeline, supported by our best cost global operating platform and executed by our exceptional employees throughout the world. We will measure these value-creation components by focusing on the following key metrics:

•

Deliver 3 to 5 percent annual organic net sales growth across our global footprint

•

Grow earnings per share by 10 to 15 percent annually

•

Expand EBIT margins to 10 percent plus by 2020 through strong cost productivity programs and further leveraging our strong brands and innovative new products

•

Generate free cash flow of 5 to 6 percent of net sales by 2018, which represents over 85 percent earnings to free cash conversion

We remain confident in our ability to effectively manage our business regardless of the operating environment and expect to continue delivering long-term value for all of our shareholders.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)

FORWARD-LOOKING PERSPECTIVE

Earnings per diluted share presented below are net of tax, while each adjustment is presented on a pre-tax basis. The aggregate income tax impact of the taxable components of each adjustment is presented in the income tax impact line item at our anticipated


full-year tax rate of

22%

. We currently estimate earnings per diluted share and industry demand for


to be within the following ranges:

(1)

Reflects industry demand in the United States.

(2)

Reflects industry demand in Brazil.

For the full-year


, we expect to generate cash from operating activities of

$1.7 billion

to

$1.75 billion

and free cash flow of approximately

$1 billion

, including primarily acquisition related restructuring cash outlays of up to

$165 million

, legacy product warranty and liability costs of

$69 million

, pension contributions of

$42 million

and, with respect to free cash flow, capital expenditures of

$700 million

to

$750 million

.

The table below reconciles projected


cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP to free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure. Management believes that free cash flow provides stockholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing Whirlpool’s ability to fund its activities and obligations. There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures, including the difficulty associated with comparing companies that use similarly named non-GAAP measures whose calculations may differ from our calculations. We define free cash flow as cash provided by continuing operations less capital expenditures and including proceeds from the sale of assets/businesses, and changes in restricted cash. The change in restricted cash relates to the private placement funds paid by Whirlpool to acquire majority control of Hefei Sanyo in 2014 and which are

used to fund capital expenditures and technical resources to enhance Whirlpool China’s research and development and working capital, as required by the terms of the Hefei Sanyo acquisition made in October 2014.

(1)

Financial guidance on a GAAP basis for cash provided by (used in) financing activities and cash provided by (used in) investing activities has not been provided because in order to prepare any such estimate or projection, the Company would need to rely on market factors and certain other conditions and assumptions that are outside of its control.

The projections above are based on many estimates and are inherently subject to change based on future decisions made by management and the Board of Directors of Whirlpool, and significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties and contingencies.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Our objective is to finance our business through operating cash flow and the appropriate mix of long-term and short-term debt. By diversifying the maturity structure, we avoid concentrations of debt, reducing liquidity risk. We have varying needs for short-term working capital financing as a result of the nature of our business. We regularly review our capital structure and liquidity priorities, which include funding the business through capital and engineering spending to support innovation and productivity initiatives, funding our pension plan and term debt liabilities, providing return to shareholders and potential acquisitions.


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)

Our short term potential uses of liquidity include funding our ongoing capital spending, restructuring activities, funding pension plans and returns to shareholders. We also have

$560 million

of term debt maturing in the next twelve months, and are currently evaluating our options in connection with this maturing debt, which may include repayment through refinancing, through free cash flow generation, or cash on hand.

We monitor the credit ratings and market indicators of credit risk of our lending, depository, and derivative counterparty banks regularly, and take certain action to manage credit risk. We diversify our deposits and investments in short term cash equivalents to limit the concentration of exposure by counterparty.

As of

December 31, 2016

, the only country where we had cash or cash equivalents greater than 1% of our consolidated assets was China, which represented 2.4%. In addition, we did not have any third-party accounts receivable greater than 1% of our consolidated assets in any single country outside of North America, with the exceptions of Italy, China, and Brazil which represented 1.0%, 1.0%, and 1.3% respectively. We continue to monitor general financial instability and uncertainty globally.

As of December 31,


, we had

€67 million

(approximately

$71 million

as of

December 31, 2016

) in outstanding trade receivables and short-term and long-term notes due to us associated with Alno AG, a long-standing European customer. Approximately

€49 million

(approximately

$51 million

as of

December 31, 2016

) of the outstanding receivables were overdue as of

December 31, 2016

. Our exposure includes not only the outstanding receivables but also the potential risks of an Alno AG bankruptcy and impacts to our distribution process. We believe our reserves related to these outstanding receivables are sufficient. In the fourth quarter of 2016, Whirlpool sold its remaining investment of approximately 10.6 million shares in Alno AG for approximately €5 million (approximately $6 million). We continue to monitor customer financial conditions globally.

The Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately

$1.1 billion

at

December 31, 2016

, of which approximately

$1.0 billion

was held by subsidiaries in foreign countries. For each of its foreign subsidiaries, the Company makes an assertion regarding the amount of earnings intended for permanent reinvestment, with the balance available to be repatriated to the United States. The cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the subsidiaries' operational activities and future foreign investments. Our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the United States and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds to fund our U.S. operations. However, if these funds were repatriated, then we would be required to accrue and pay applicable United States taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to various countries. The repatriation could result in an adjustment to the tax liability after considering available foreign tax credits and other tax attributes. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of the deferred tax liability associated with these unremitted earnings due to the complexity of its hypothetical calculation.

Sources and Uses of Cash

We met our cash needs during


through cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, and financing arrangements. Our cash and cash equivalents at

December 31, 2016

increased

$313 million

compared to the same period in


.

The following table summarizes the net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents for the periods presented. Significant drivers of changes in our cash and cash equivalents balance during


are discussed below:

Cash Flow Summary


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

The decrease in cash provided by operating activities during


reflects strong cash earnings and effective credit management, more than offset by cash expenditures related to the legacy product corrective action.

The timing of cash flows from operations varies significantly throughout the year primarily due to changes in production levels, sales patterns, promotional programs, funding requirements, credit management, as well as receivable and payment terms. Depending on the timing of cash flows, the location of cash balances, as well as the liquidity requirements of each country, external sources of funding are used to support working capital requirements.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Changes in cash used in investing activities during


primarily reflect a reduction in capital expenditures and investment in related businesses, partially offset by increased proceeds from the sale of business assets.

In June 2016, Whirlpool China Co., Ltd. (“Whirlpool China”), our majority-owned indirect subsidiary, entered into an agreement to return land use rights for land now occupied by two Whirlpool China plants in Hefei, China to a division of the Hefei municipal government.  The aggregate price for the return of land use rights was approximately RMB 687 million (approximately $103 million as of June 27, 2016). Whirlpool China received RMB 280 million (approximately $42 million as of June 27, 2016) of the aggregate return price on June 27, 2016 with the remainder to be paid in installments in 2017 and 2018.  The remaining balance is RMB

407 million

(approximately

$59 million

as of

December 31, 2016

).

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

Cash used in financing activities during


primarily reflects share repurchase activity and repayments of long-term debt. Cash used in financing activities during


primarily reflects share repurchase activity under our share repurchase program. Cash provided by financing activities during 2014 primarily reflects funding required to complete the acquisitions of

Hefei Sanyo

and Indesit.

Whirlpool Subsidiary Share Repurchase

On July 12, 2016, Whirlpool S.A. (“WHR SA”) and Brasmotor S.A. (“BMT”), both majority-owned indirect subsidiaries of Whirlpool Corporation, issued public announcements in Brazil reporting that Whirlpool do Brasil Ltda., the controlling shareholder of both WHR SA and BMT, intended to acquire the outstanding common and preferred shares of WHR SA and BMT by means of tender offers for the publicly-held shares. At that time, Whirlpool do Brasil Ltda. and other Whirlpool entities held 99.20% of the common and 95.68% of the preferred shares of WHR SA and 99.40% of the common and 93.55% of the preferred shares of BMT. The tender offers were launched in November 2016 and concluded in December 2016. The offer for BMT was successful and will result in the acquisition of 100% of the shares of BMT after the squeeze-out of the remaining minority shareholders. The cost related to this offer was approximately $25 million as of December 2016. The squeeze-out was completed in January 2017, bringing the total cost to approximately $31 million. The WHR SA tender offer was abandoned because the minimum number of interested minority shareholders was not obtained.

Financing Arrangements

On July 15, 2016,

$244 million

of

7.75%

notes matured and were repaid. On June 15, 2016,

$250 million

of

6.50%

notes matured and were repaid.

On May 23, 2016, we completed a debt offering of

$500 million

principal amount of

4.50%

notes due in 2046. The notes contain covenants that limit our ability to incur certain liens or enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions. In addition, if we experience a specific kind of change of control, we are required to make an offer to purchase all of the notes at a purchase price of

101%

of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The notes are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to our Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-203704) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 29, 2015.

On November 2, 2016, Whirlpool Finance Luxembourg S.à. r.l., an indirect, wholly-owned finance subsidiary of Whirlpool Corporation, completed a debt offering of

€500 million

(approximately $555 million as of the date of issuance) principal amount of

1.250%

notes due in 2026. The Company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed these notes. The notes contain covenants that limit Whirlpool Corporation's ability to incur certain liens or enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions.  In addition, if we experience a specific kind of change of control, we are required to make an offer to purchase all of the notes at a purchase price of 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The notes are registered under the Securities Act

of 1933, as amended, pursuant to our Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No.333-203704-1) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 25, 2016

The Company had a total committed credit facilities of approximately $3.1 billion as of

December 31, 2016

, which is fundamentally unchanged from the committed credit facilitates as of

December 31, 2015

.  The facilities are more geographically diverse and reflect the Company’s growing global operations. The Company believes these facilities are sufficient to support its global operations.

We had

WHIRLPOOL CHINA  ACQUISITION

On

August 12, 2013

, Whirlpool's wholly-owned subsidiary, Whirlpool (China) Investment Co., Ltd., reached agreements to acquire a

51%

equity stake in

Hefei Sanyo

, a joint stock company whose shares are listed and traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. This transaction was completed on

October 24, 2014

.

Hefei Sanyo

has since  been renamed to "Whirlpool China Co., Ltd." The aggregate purchase price was RMB

3.4 billion

(approximately

$551 million

at the dates of purchase). The Company funded the total consideration for the shares with cash on hand. The cash paid for the private placement portion of the transaction is considered restricted cash, which is

used to fund capital expenditures and technical resources to enhance Whirlpool China’s research and development and working capital, as required by the terms of the Hefei Sanyo acquisition made in October 2014.

We expect the acquisition will accelerate Whirlpool's profitable growth in  China. During 2014, Whirlpool began integrating the manufacturing, administrative, supply chain and technology operations of

Hefei Sanyo

. The results of

Hefei Sanyo

’s operations have been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning

October 24, 2014

.

Hefei Sanyo

has an established and broad distribution network that includes a very large number of distribution outlets throughout China. Its significant presence in rural areas complements Whirlpool’s presence in China’s higher-tier cities. With this acquisition, Whirlpool also gained manufacturing scale and a competitive cost structure in the city of Hefei. The ability to consolidate operations offers strong synergies as Whirlpool will provide extensive technical, marketing and product development, combined with

Hefei Sanyo

’s sales execution and operational strengths, to support the next phase of development in the advancement of

Whirlpool China

as an important global production and research and development center for the home appliance sector.

INDESIT ACQUISITION

On

December 3, 2014

, Whirlpool completed the final step in its acquisition of Indesit. Total consideration paid for Indesit was €

1.1 billion

(approximately

$1.4 billion

at the dates of purchase of each step in the transaction) in aggregate net of cash acquired. The Company funded the aggregate purchase price for Indesit through borrowings under its credit facility and commercial paper programs, and repaid a portion of such borrowings through the issuance of an aggregate principal amount of

$650 million

in senior notes on

November 4, 2014

and an aggregate principal amount of €

500 million

(approximately

$525 million

as of the date of issuance) in senior notes on

March 12, 2015

.

This transaction has built Whirlpool’s market position within Europe, and we believe will continue to enable sustainable growth given the complementary market positions, product offerings and distribution channels of Whirlpool and

Indesit

throughout Europe. We expect efficiencies in R&D, capital spending and value chain costs, as well as operational scale with increased volume and the ability to more effectively integrate our product platforms. The results of

Indesit

’s operations have been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning

October 14, 2014

.

Dividends

In April 2016, our Board of Directors approved an 11% increase in our quarterly dividend on our common stock to $1 per share from 90 cents per share.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

We have guarantee arrangements in a Brazilian subsidiary. As a standard business practice in Brazil, the subsidiary guarantees customer lines of credit at commercial banks to support purchases following its normal credit policies. If a customer were to default on its line of credit with the bank, our subsidiary would be required to satisfy the obligation with the bank and the receivable would revert back to the subsidiary. At

December 31, 2016

and

December 31, 2015

, the guaranteed amounts totaled

$258 million

and

$260 million

, respectively. The fair value of these guarantees were nominal at

December 31, 2016

and

December 31, 2015

. Our subsidiary insures against credit risk for these guarantees, under normal operating conditions, through policies purchased from high-quality underwriters. We had

no

losses associated with these guarantees in


or


.

We have guaranteed a

$40 million

five

-year revolving credit facility between certain financial institutions and a not-for-profit entity in connection with a community and economic development project (“Harbor Shores”). The credit facility, which originated in 2008, was refinanced in December 2012 and we renewed our guarantee through 2017. It was also amended in 2015 and  reduced from

$43 million

to

$40 million

by Harbor Shores in 2016. The fair value of this guarantee was nominal at

December 31, 2016

and

December 31, 2015

. The purpose of Harbor Shores is to stimulate employment and growth in the areas of Benton Harbor and St. Joseph, Michigan. In the event of default, we must satisfy the guarantee of the credit facility up to the amount borrowed at the date of default.

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with financial institutions to issue bank guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds. These agreements are primarily associated with unresolved tax matters in Brazil, as is customary under local regulations, and governmental obligations related to certain employee benefit arrangements. As of

December 31, 2016

and


, we had approximately

$327 million

and

$290 million

outstanding under these agreements, respectively.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions, which are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the costs of future benefits and attributing the cost over the employee’s expected period of employment. The determination of our obligation and expense for these costs requires the use of certain assumptions. Those key assumptions include the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, life expectancy, and health care cost trend rates. These assumptions are subject to change based on interest rates on high quality bonds, stock and bond markets and medical cost inflation, respectively. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore, generally affect our recognized expense and accrued liability in such future periods. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate given current economic conditions and actual experience, significant differences in results or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and related future expense.

Our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations at

December 31, 2016

and preliminary retirement benefit costs for


were prepared using the assumptions that were determined as of

December 31, 2016

. The following table summarizes the sensitivity of our

December 31, 2016

retirement obligations and


retirement benefit costs of our United States plans to changes in the key assumptions used to determine those results:

*

Projected benefit obligation (PBO) for pension plans and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) for other postretirement benefit plans.

These sensitivities may not be appropriate to use for other years’ financial results. Furthermore, the impact of assumption changes outside of the ranges shown above may not be approximated by using the above results. For additional information about our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, see Note


of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Income Taxes

We estimate our income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items, such as the timing for recognizing expenses, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences may result in deferred tax assets or liabilities, which are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We are required to assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets, which include net operating loss carryforwards, foreign tax credits and deductible temporary differences, that are expected to be realizable in future years. Realization of our net operating loss and foreign tax credit deferred tax assets is supported by specific tax planning strategies and, where possible, considers projections of future profitability. If recovery is not more likely than not, we provide a valuation allowance based on estimates of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions, and the amount of deferred taxes that are ultimately realizable. If future taxable income is lower than expected or if tax planning strategies are not available as anticipated, we may record additional valuation allowances through income tax expense in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of net recorded amounts, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will benefit income tax expense in the period such determination is made.

As of

December 31, 2016

and


, we had total deferred tax assets of

$3.2 billion

and

$3.3 billion

, respectively, net of valuation allowances of

$150 million

and

$286 million

, respectively. Our income tax expense has fluctuated considerably over the last five years from $133 million in 2012 to $

186 million

in the current year. The tax expense has been influenced primarily by U.S. energy tax credits, foreign tax credits, audit settlements and adjustments, tax planning strategies, enacted legislation, and dispersion of global income. Future changes in the effective tax rate will be subject to several factors, including business profitability, tax planning strategies, and enacted tax laws.

In addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. For additional information about income taxes, see Notes


,


and


of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)

Legacy Product Corrective Action Reserves

In the normal course of business, we engage in investigations of potential quality and safety issues. As part of our ongoing effort to deliver quality products to consumers, we are currently investigating a limited number of potential quality and safety issues globally. As necessary, we undertake to effect repair or replacement of appliances in the event that an investigation leads to the conclusion that such action is warranted.

As part of that process, in 2015, Whirlpool engaged in thorough investigations of incident reports associated with

two

of its dryer production platforms developed by Indesit. These dryer production platforms were developed prior to Whirlpool's acquisition of Indesit in October 2014. This led to Indesit reporting the issue to regulatory authorities for consideration. These discussions determined that corrective action of the affected dryers was required. Whirlpool has implemented modifications at the point of manufacture to ensure that dryers produced after October 2015 are not affected by this issue. An outreach and service campaign is underway to modify dryers that have already been sold. Such dryers were manufactured between April 2004 and October 2015 and sold in the UK and other countries in the EMEA region under the

Hotpoint

* and

Indesit

brand names, as well as various other brands owned by other manufacturers, distributors and retailers whose products Indesit produced.

As of

December 31, 2016

, Whirlpool had

$162 million

of cash expenditures related to the corrective action. We expect the corrective action affecting these dryers to have future cash expenditures in 2017 of

$69 million

.

For additional information about the legacy product corrective action, see Note


of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Warranty Obligations

The estimation of warranty obligations is determined in the same period that revenue from the sale of the related products is recognized. The warranty obligation is based on historical experience and represents our best estimate of expected costs at the time products are sold. Warranty accruals are adjusted for known or anticipated warranty claims as new information becomes available. New product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available. Future events and circumstances could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to the warranty obligations. For additional information about warranty obligations, see Note


of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Goodwill and Other Intangibles

Certain business acquisitions have resulted in the recording of goodwill and trademark assets. Upon acquisition, the purchase price is first allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities, including trademark assets, based on estimated fair value, with any remaining purchase price recorded as goodwill. Primarily, Whirlpool's trademarks and goodwill are considered indefinite-life intangible assets and as such, are not amortized. At

December 31, 2016

, we had goodwill of approximately

$3.0 billion

. There have been no changes to our reporting units or allocations of goodwill by reporting units except for the impact of foreign currency.

We primarily have trademark assets in our North America, EMEA and Asia operating segments with a total carrying value of approximately

$2.6 billion

as of

December 31, 2016

.

We perform our annual impairment assessment for goodwill and other indefinite-life intangible assets as of October 1

st

and more frequently if indicators of impairment exist.

In 2016, the Company primarily elected to perform a quantitative analysis using a discounted cash flow model and other valuation techniques, to evaluate goodwill and certain indefinite-life intangible assets.

Goodwill Valuations

In performing a quantitative assessment, we estimate each reporting units' fair value using the income approach. The income approach uses operating segments projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that are discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital that is determined based on current market conditions. The projection uses management’s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including growth rates in sales, costs and number of units, estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures. Other estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates, future estimates of capital expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements. The estimated fair value of each operating segment is compared to their respective carrying values.

*Whirlpool ownership of the Hotpoint brand in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions is not affiliated with the Hotpoint brand sold in the Americas


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)

Additionally we validate our estimates of fair value under the income approach by comparing the values of fair value estimates using a market approach. A market approach estimates fair value by applying cash flow multiples to the reporting unit’s operating performance. The multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics of the reporting units.  We consider the implied control premium and conclude whether the implied control premium is reasonable based on other recent market transactions.

If actual results are not consistent with managements’ estimate and assumptions, goodwill may be overstated and a charge against net income would be required, which would adversely affect the Company’s financial statements.

Based on the results of our quantitative assessment conducted on October 1, 2016, the fair values of Whirlpool's reporting units continue to exceed their respective carrying values. The range by which the excess fair value of our reporting units' goodwill exceeded their respective carrying values was 4% to 142%. The EMEA reporting unit has excess fair value of 4%. During the fourth quarter 2014, Whirlpool acquired Indesit, resulting in substantially all of the goodwill included in this reporting unit. The range by which the excess fair value of our remaining reporting units' goodwill exceeded their respective carrying values was 70% to 142%.

Other Intangible Valuations

In performing a quantitative assessment of indefinite life intangible assets other than goodwill, primarily trademarks, we estimate the fair value of these intangible assets using the relief-from-royalty method, which requires assumptions related to projected revenues from our annual long-range plan; assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the trademark; and a discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital. If the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, we would recognize an impairment loss.

Three trademarks acquired in fourth quarter of 2014 have fair values that exceed their carrying values by less than 10%. The fair values of all other trademarks exceeded their carrying values by more than 10% with the exception of one North American trademark.

The fair value of this North American trademark exceeded its carrying value of approximately $1 billion by 6% in


and 5% in


. We expect revenue trends for this brand to improve as we continue to execute specific brand investments and product development plans. Additionally, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair value noting that a 10% reduction of forecasted revenues, a 50 basis point decrease in royalty rate, or a 50 basis point increase in discount rate would result in an impairment ranging from approximately $22 million to $78 million.

If actual results are not consistent with management's estimate and assumptions, trademarks or other indefinite-life intangible assets may be overstated and a charge against net income would be required, which would adversely affect the Company’s financial results of operations.

Based on the results of our quantitative assessment performed as of October 1, 2014, impairment of two trademarks was determined to exist, primarily driven by a change in our brand strategy in EMEA as a result of the acquisition of Indesit and resulted in a charge of approximately

$12 million

in 2014.

Our assessment indicates no impairment of any trademarks as of

December 31, 2016

.

of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

restore fair competition in the United States that will support significant investment in the production of large residential washers and the creation of U.S. jobs. The Whirlpool washers affected by the imports subject in this case are made in Clyde, Ohio.

In December 2016, the DOC issued a final determination that Samsung and LG violated U.S. and international trade laws by dumping washers from China into the U.S. As part of the final determination, the DOC also announced certain antidumping margins for Samsung and LG. In January 2017, the ITC voted unanimously that Samsung and LG's dumping had caused material injury to the U.S. washer industry. As in the case of our December 2011 petition, the DOC and ITC decisions will be followed by administrative review procedures and possible appeals over the next several years.

Certain statements contained in this annual report, including those within the forward-looking perspective section within this Management's Discussion and Analysis, and other written and oral statements made from time to time by us or on our behalf do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. As such, they are considered “forward-looking statements” which provide current expectations or forecasts of future events. Such statements can be identified by the use of terminology such as “may,” “could,” “will,” “should,” “possible,” “plan,” “predict,” “forecast,” “potential,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “believe,” “may impact,” “on track,” and similar words or expressions. Our forward-looking statements generally relate to our growth strategies, financial results, product development, and sales efforts. These forward-looking statements should be considered with the understanding that such statements involve a variety of risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, and may be affected by inaccurate assumptions. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may vary materially.

This document contains forward-looking statements about Whirlpool Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries (“Whirlpool”) that speak only as of this date. Whirlpool disclaims any obligation to update these statements. Forward-looking statements in this document may include, but are not limited to, statements regarding expected earnings per share, cash flow, productivity and raw material prices.

Among these factors are: (1) intense competition in the home appliance industry reflecting the impact of both new and established global competitors, including Asian and European manufacturers; (2) Whirlpool's ability to maintain or increase sales to significant trade customers and the ability of these trade customers to maintain or increase market share; (3) Whirlpool's ability to maintain its reputation and brand image; (4) the ability of Whirlpool to achieve its business plans, productivity improvements, and cost control objectives, and to leverage its global operating platform, and accelerate the rate of innovation; (5) Whirlpool's ability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights; (6) acquisition and investment-related risks, including risks associated with our past acquisitions, and risks associated with our increased presence in emerging markets; (7) risks related to our international operations, including changes in foreign regulations, regulatory compliance and disruptions arising from political, legal and economic instability; (8) information technology system failures, data security breaches, network disruptions, and cybersecurity attacks; (9) product liability and product recall costs; (10) the ability of suppliers of critical parts, components and manufacturing equipment to deliver sufficient quantities to Whirlpool in a timely and cost-effective manner; (11) our ability to attract, develop and retain executives and other qualified employees; (12) the impact of labor relations; (13) fluctuations in the cost of key materials (including steel,  resins, copper and aluminum) and components and the ability of Whirlpool to offset cost increases; (14) Whirlpool’s ability to manage foreign currency fluctuations; (15) inventory and other asset risk; (16) the uncertain global economy and changes in economic conditions which affect demand for our products; (17) health care cost trends, regulatory changes and variations between results and estimates that could increase future funding obligations for pension and postretirement benefit plans; (18) litigation, tax, and legal compliance risk and costs, especially if materially different from the amount we expect to incur or have accrued for, and any disruptions caused by the same; (19) the effects and costs of governmental investigations or related actions by third parties; and (20) changes in the legal and regulatory environment including environmental, health and safety regulations.

We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, and investors are advised to review disclosures in our filings with the SEC. It is not possible to foresee or identify all factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historic results. Therefore, investors should not consider the foregoing factors to be an exhaustive statement of all risks, uncertainties, or factors that could potentially cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements.

Additional information concerning these and other factors can be found in “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this report.


ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

MARKET RISK

We have in place an enterprise risk management process that involves systematic risk identification and mitigation covering the categories of enterprise, strategic, financial, operation and compliance and reporting risk. The enterprise risk management process receives Board of Directors and Management oversight, drives risk mitigation decision-making and is fully integrated into our internal audit planning and execution cycle.

We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, domestic and foreign interest rates, and commodity prices, which can affect our operating results and overall financial condition. We manage exposure to these risks through our operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivatives. Derivatives are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for speculation or for trading purposes. Derivatives are generally contracted with a diversified group of investment grade counterparties to reduce exposure to nonperformance on such instruments.

We use foreign currency forward contracts, currency options, and currency swaps to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted cross-border payments and receipts related to ongoing business and operational financing activities. Foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31,


, a 10% favorable or unfavorable exchange rate movement in each currency in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have resulted in an incremental unrealized gain of approximately $125 million or loss of approximately $145 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the re-measurement of the underlying exposures.

We enter into commodity swap contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted commodities purchases, the prices of which are not fixed directly through supply contracts. As of December 31,


, a 10% favorable or unfavorable shift in commodity prices would have resulted in an incremental gain or loss of approximately $30 million, respectively, related to these contracts.

SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General Information

Whirlpool Corporation, a Delaware corporation, is the world's leading manufacturer and marketer of major home appliances. Whirlpool manufactures products in


countries and markets products in nearly every country around the world under brand names such as

Whirlpool

,

KitchenAid

,

Maytag

,

Consul

,

Brastemp

,

Amana

,

Bauknecht

,

Jenn-Air, Indesit, and Hotpoint

* .

Whirlpool’s reportable segments consist of North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"), Latin America and Asia.

Principles of Consolidation

The  consolidated  financial  statements  are  prepared  in  conformity  with  United  States  (U.S.)  generally  accepted  accounting  principles (GAAP), and include all majority-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. We do not consolidate the financial statements of any company in which we have an ownership interest of 50% or less unless that company is deemed to be a variable interest entity ("VIE") of which we are the primary beneficiary. Certain VIEs are consolidated when the company is the primary beneficiary of these entities and has the ability to directly impact the activities of these entities, and have a nominal effect on the Company's results.

Reclassifications

We reclassified certain prior period amounts in our Consolidated Financial Statements to be consistent with current period presentation.

Use of Estimates

We are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. The most significant assumptions are estimates in determining the fair value of intangible assets, legal contingencies, income taxes and pension and postretirement benefits. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

Sales are recognized when revenue is realized or realizable and has been earned. Revenue is recognized when the sales price is determinable and the risk and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer as determined by the shipping terms. For the majority of our sales, title is transferred to the customer as soon as products are shipped. For a portion of our sales, title is transferred to the customer upon receipt of products at the customer’s location. Sales are net of allowances for product returns, which are based on historical return rates and certain promotions.

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We carry accounts receivable at sales value less an allowance for doubtful accounts. We periodically evaluate accounts receivable and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of specific customer circumstances, credit conditions and the history of write-offs and collections. We evaluate items on an individual basis when determining accounts receivable write-offs. In general, our policy is to not charge interest on trade receivables after the invoice becomes past due. A receivable is considered past due if payment has not been received within agreed upon invoice terms.

Freight and Warehousing Costs

We classify freight and warehousing costs within cost of products sold in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an initial maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalents.

*Whirlpool ownership of the Hotpoint brand in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions is not affiliated with the Hotpoint brand sold in the Americas


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (CONTINUED)

Restricted Cash

The restricted cash can only be

used to fund capital expenditures and technical resources to enhance Whirlpool China’s research and development and working capital, as required by the terms of the Hefei Sanyo acquisition made in October 2014.

As of

December 31, 2016

and


, restricted cash was approximately

$155 million

and

$191 million

, respectively. Approximately

$45 million

and

$48 million

is recorded in other current assets as of

December 31, 2016

and


, respectively, with the remaining portion recorded in other non-current assets.

Fair Value Measurements

We measure fair value based on an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, a three-tiered fair value hierarchy is established, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: (Level 1) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level 2) inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable, either directly or indirectly; and (Level 3) unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. We had

no

Level 3 assets or liabilities at

December 31, 2016

and


, with the exception of those disclosed in Note


.

We measured fair value for money market funds and available for sale investments using quoted market prices in active markets for identical or comparable assets. We measured fair value for derivative contracts, all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings, based on model driven valuations using significant inputs derived from observable market data. For assets measured at net asset values, we have no unfunded commitments or significant restraints.

Inventories

United States production inventories are stated at last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) cost. Latin America, Asia and certain EMEA inventories which are stated at average cost. The remaining inventories are stated at first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) cost. Costs do not exceed net realizable values. Changes in the amount that FIFO cost exceed LIFO cost are recognized in cost of goods sold. See Note


for additional information about inventories.

Property

Property is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. For production machinery and equipment, we record depreciation based on units produced, unless units produced drop below a minimum threshold at which point depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method, excluding property acquired from the

Hefei Sanyo

acquisition and certain property acquired from the

Indesit

acquisition. For non-production assets and assets acquired from

Hefei Sanyo

and certain production assets acquired from

Indesit

, we depreciate costs based on the straight-line method. Depreciation expense for property, including accelerated depreciation classified as restructuring expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income, was

$584 million

,

$594 million

and

$527 million

in


,


and


, respectively.

The following table summarizes our property as of

December 31, 2016

and


:

We classify gains and losses associated with asset dispositions in the same line item as the underlying depreciation of the disposed asset in the Consolidated Statements of Income. During


, we retired primarily machinery and equipment with a net book value of approximately

$38 million

that was no longer in use. During


, we retired primarily machinery and equipment with a net book value of approximately

$11 million

that was no longer in use. Net gains and losses recognized in cost of products sold were not material for


,


and


.

We record impairment losses on long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles, when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired and the estimated future cash flows generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts. There were no significant impairments recorded during


,


and


.


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (CONTINUED)

Goodwill and Other Intangibles

We perform our annual impairment assessment for goodwill and other indefinite-life intangible assets as of October 1st and more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. In 2016, the Company primarily elected to perform a quantitative analysis using a discounted cash flow model and other valuation techniques, to evaluate goodwill and certain indefinite-life intangible assets.

Goodwill

In performing a quantitative assessment of goodwill, we estimate each reporting units fair value using fair value using the best information available to us, including market information and discounted cash flow projections also referred to as the income approach. The income approach uses reporting unit’s projections of estimated operating results and cash flows that are discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital, which that is determined based on current market conditions. Additionally we validate our estimates of fair value under the income approach by comparing the values to fair value estimates using a market approach. We performed our assessment as of October 1,


, and determined there was

no

impairment of goodwill.

Other Intangible Assets

We perform a quantitative assessment of other indefinite life intangible assets, which are primarily comprised of trademarks. We estimate the fair value of these intangible assets using the relief-from-royalty method, which primarily requires assumptions related to projected revenues from our annual long-range plan, assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the trademark, and a discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital. We performed our assessment as of October 1,


, and determined there was

no

impairments of indefinite life intangible assets.

Other definite life intangible assets are amortized over their useful life and are assessed for impairment when impairment indicators are present.

Accounts Payable Outsourcing

We offer our suppliers access to third party payable processors, independent to Whirlpool. The processors allow suppliers to sell their receivables to financial institutions at the sole discretion of both the supplier and the financial institution. In China, as a common practice we pay suppliers with banker’s acceptance drafts. Banker’s acceptance drafts allow suppliers to sell their receivables to financial institutions at the sole discretion of both the supplier and the financial institution. We have no economic interest in the sale of these receivables and no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions concerning these services. All of our obligations, including amounts due, remain to our suppliers as stated in our supplier agreements. As of

December 31, 2016

and


, approximately

$1.3 billion

and

$1.2 billion

, respectively, have been issued to participating financial institutions.

Derivative Financial Instruments

We use derivative instruments designated as cash flow and fair value hedges to manage our exposure to the volatility in material costs, foreign currency and interest rates on certain debt instruments. Changes in the fair value of derivative assets or liabilities (i.e., gains or losses) are recognized depending upon the type of hedging relationship and whether a hedge has been designated. For those derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting, we designate the hedging instrument, based upon the exposure being hedged, as a cash flow hedge, fair value hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. For a derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is recognized in earnings in the period of change in fair value together with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item. For a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of Other Comprehensive Income and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings. For a derivative instrument designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is reported in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) as part of the cumulative translation adjustment. Changes in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized immediately in current net earnings. See Note


for additional information about hedges and derivative financial instruments.

Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions

Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated into United States dollars at exchange rates existing at the respective balance sheet dates. Translation adjustments resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates are recorded as a separate component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) within stockholders’ equity. The results of operations of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the average exchange rates during the respective periods. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in net earnings.


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (CONTINUED)

Research and Development Costs

Research and development costs are charged to expense and totaled $

604 million

,

$579 million

and

$563 million

in


,


and


, respectively.

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs are charged to expense when the advertisement is first communicated and totaled

$366 million

,

$310 million

and

$269 million

in


,


and


, respectively.

Income Taxes

We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets is recognized in income in the period of enactment date.

We recognize, primarily in other noncurrent liabilities, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, the effects of uncertain income tax positions. We record liabilities net of the amount, based on technical merits, that will be sustained upon examination. We accrue for other non income tax contingencies when it is probable that a liability to a taxing authority has been incurred and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated.

Provision is made for taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and related companies to the extent that such earnings are not deemed to be permanently invested. See Note


for additional information about income taxes.

Stock Based Compensation

Stock based compensation expense is based on the grant date fair value and is expensed over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (generally the vesting period). The Company's stock based compensation includes stock options, performance stock units, performance shares, restricted stock and restricted stock units. The fair value of stock options are determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which incorporates assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, expected option life, expected forfeitures and dividend yield. Expected forfeitures are based on historical experience. Stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the stock price on the date of grant. The fair value of restricted stock units and performance stock units is generally based on the closing market price of Whirlpool common stock on the grant date. See Note


for additional information about stock based compensation.

BEFIEX Credits

In previous years, our Brazilian operations earned tax credits under the Brazilian government’s export incentive program (BEFIEX). These credits reduce Brazilian federal excise taxes on domestic sales, resulting in an increase in the operations’ recorded net sales. We recognized export credits as they were monetized. See Note


and Note


for additional information regarding BEFIEX credits.

Adoption of New Accounting Standards

In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2015-17, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes", which supersedes the guidance in Topic 740, Income Taxes, that requires an entity to separate deferred tax liabilities and assets into a current amount and noncurrent amount in a classified statement of financial position. The amendment requires entities that present a classified balance sheet to classify all deferred tax liabilities and assets as a noncurrent amount. This pronouncement is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2016, and may be early adopted on a prospective basis or on a retrospective basis to all periods presented. On December 31, 2016, we retrospectively adopted the new accounting standard. The change resulted in the reclassification, from current to noncurrent, of deferred tax assets of approximately

$451 million

and deferred tax liabilities of  approximately

$19 million

, as of December 31, 2015. The impact of this reclassification as of December 31, 2016 has no impact on net income or cash flow, and is comparable to December 31, 2015.

The following standards were adopted during 2016, none of which have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements:


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (CONTINUED)

(a) Represents date standard becomes effective or date standard becomes effective to our Company as a result of early adoption

(b) Early adoption

All other issued and effective accounting standards were not relevant to Whirlpool Corporation.

Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Effective

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)". The guidance in ASU 2016-02 supersedes the lease recognition requirements in ASC Topic 840, Leases (FAS 13). The new standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. Early adoption of the amendments in the update is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect this standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

FASB has issued the following standards, which are not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements:

(a) Represents date standard becomes effective as indicated in the ASU.

(b) In 2014, we established a global project management team to analyze the impact of this standard by reviewing our current accounting policies and practices in each reporting segment to identify potential differences that would result from the application of this standard. We determined minimal changes are required to our business processes, systems and controls to effectively report revenue recognition and disclosure under the new standard. Based on our evaluation, we expect to adopt the requirements of the new standard in the first quarter of 2018 and anticipate using the modified retrospective transition method.

.

All other issued and not yet effective accounting standards are not relevant to Whirlpool Corporation.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value is measured based on an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are based on a market valuation approach using prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. As a basis for considering such assumptions, a three-tiered fair value hierarchy is established, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: (Level 1) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level 2) inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable, either directly or indirectly; and (Level 3) unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. We had

no

On May 17, 2016, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a Third Amended and Restated Long-Term Credit Agreement (the “Amended Long-Term Facility”). The Amended Long-Term Facility provides aggregate borrowing capacity of

$2.5 billion

, which combines amounts previously available under our prior Original Long-Term Facility and Terminated 364-Day Facility. The Amended Long-Term Facility has a maturity date of May 17, 2021 and amends and restates in its entirety our previously existing Second Amended and Restated Long-Term Credit Agreement, dated September 26, 2014 (the "Original Long-Term Facility"), and replaces aggregate borrowing capacity of

$500 million

available under our previously existing Amended and Restated Short-Term Credit Agreement, dated as of September 25, 2015, which agreement was terminated on May 17, 2016 (the "Terminated 364-Day Facility").

The interest and fee rates payable with respect to the Amended Long-Term Facility based on our current debt rating are as follows: (1) the spread over LIBOR is

1.125%

; (2) the spread over prime is

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

OTHER MATTERS

Embraco Antitrust Matters

Beginning in February 2009, our compressor business headquartered in Brazil ("Embraco") was notified of antitrust investigations of the global compressor industry by government authorities in various jurisdictions. Embraco has resolved government investigations in various jurisdictions as well as all related civil lawsuits in the United States and no payments are owed in connection with such resolutions. Embraco also has resolved certain other claims and certain claims remain pending. Additional lawsuits could be filed.

At December 31,


, a nominal amount remains accrued. We continue to defend these actions and take other steps to minimize our potential exposure. The final outcome and impact of these matters, and any related claims and investigations that may be brought in the future are subject to many variables, and cannot be predicted. We establish accruals only for those matters where we determine that a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. While it is currently not possible to reasonably estimate the aggregate amount of costs which we may incur in connection with these matters, such costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity, or results of operations in any particular reporting period.

BEFIEX Credits and Other Brazil Tax Matters

In previous years, our Brazilian operations earned tax credits under the Brazilian government's export incentive program (BEFIEX).  These credits reduced Brazilian federal excise taxes on domestic sales, resulting in an increase in the operations' recorded net sales, as the credits were monetized.  We did not monetize any BEFIEX credits during the years ended December 31, 2016 or 2015.

We began recognizing BEFIEX credits in accordance with prior favorable court decisions allowing for the credits to be recognized.  We recognized export credits as they were monetized.

In December 2013, the Brazilian government reinstituted the monetary adjustment index applicable to BEFIEX credits that existed prior to July 2009, when the Brazilian government required companies to apply a different monetary adjustment index to BEFIEX credits. As of

December 31, 2016

, no BEFIEX credits deemed to be available prior to this action remained to be monetized. Whether use of the reinstituted index should be given retroactive effect for the July 2009 to December 2013 period has been subject to review by the Brazilian courts. If the reinstituted index is given retroactive effect, we would be entitled to recognize additional credits. We are awaiting the resolution of additional proceedings on the retroactive effect of the reinstituted index.

Our Brazilian operations have received governmental assessments related to claims for income and social contribution taxes associated with certain monetized BEFIEX credits. We do not believe BEFIEX export credits are subject to income or social contribution taxes. We are disputing these tax matters in various courts and intend to vigorously defend our positions. We have not provided for income or social contribution taxes on these export credits, and based on the opinions of tax and legal advisors, we have not accrued any amount related to these assessments as of

December 31, 2016

. The total amount of outstanding tax assessments received for income and social contribution taxes relating to the BEFIEX credits, including interest and penalties, is approximately

1.8 billion

Brazilian reais (approximately

$541 million

as of

December 31, 2016

).

Relying on existing Brazilian legal precedent, in 2003 and 2004, we recognized tax credits in an aggregate amount of

$26 million

, adjusted for currency, on the purchase of raw materials used in production (“IPI tax credits”). The Brazilian tax authority subsequently challenged the recording of IPI tax credits. No credits have been recognized since 2004. In 2009, we entered into a Brazilian government program which provided extended payment terms and reduced penalties and interest to encourage tax payers to resolve this and certain other disputed tax credit amounts. As permitted by the program, we elected to settle certain debts through the use of other existing tax credits and recorded charges of approximately

$34 million

in 2009 associated with these matters. In July 2012, the Brazilian revenue authority notified us that a portion of our proposed settlement was rejected and we received tax assessments of

232 million

Brazilian reais (approximately

$71 million

as of

December 31, 2016

)

, reflecting interest and penalties to date. We are disputing these assessments and we intend to vigorously defend our position. Based on the opinion of our tax and legal advisors, we have not recorded an additional reserve related to these matters.

In 2001, Brazil adopted a law making the profits of controlled foreign corporations of Brazilian entities subject to income and social contribution tax regardless of whether the profits were repatriated ("CFC Tax"). Our Brazilian subsidiary, along with other corporations, challenged tax assessments on foreign profits on constitutionality and other grounds. In April 2013, the Brazilian


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (CONTINUED)

Supreme Court ruled on one of our cases, finding that the law is constitutional, but remanding the case to a lower court for consideration of other arguments raised in our appeal, including the existence of tax treaties with jurisdictions in which controlled foreign corporations are domiciled.  As of

December 31, 2016

, our potential exposure for income and social contribution taxes relating to profits of controlled foreign corporations, including interest and penalties and net of expected foreign tax credits, is approximately

171 million

Brazilian reais (approximately

$52 million

as of

December 31, 2016

). We believe these assessments are without merit and we intend to continue to vigorously dispute them. Based on the opinion of our tax and legal advisors, we have not accrued any amount related to these assessments as of

December 31, 2016

.

In addition to the IPI tax credit and CFC Tax matters noted above, we are currently disputing other assessments issued by the Brazilian tax authorities related to non-income and income tax matters, including for the monetization of BEFIEX credits and other matters, which are at various stages of review in numerous administrative and judicial proceedings. The amounts related to these assessments will continue to be increased by monetary adjustments at the Selic rate, which is the benchmark rate set by the Brazilian Central Bank.  In accordance with our accounting policies, we routinely assess these matters and, when necessary, record our best estimate of a loss.  We believe these tax assessments are without merit and are vigorously defending our positions.

Litigation is inherently unpredictable and the conclusion of these matters may take many years to ultimately resolve.  Accordingly, it is possible that an unfavorable outcome in these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity, or results of operations in any particular reporting period.

Other Litigation

We have vigorously defended against numerous lawsuits pending in the United States relating to certain of our front load washing machines.  In 2016, we reached final agreement on a settlement that will resolve all such class action lawsuits (except for attorneys fees in an immaterial case) and received court approval. We are proceeding through the administrative consumer claims process to implement the terms of the settlement, which will be complete in 2017.

In addition, we are currently vigorously defending a number of other lawsuits in federal and state courts in the United States related to the manufacturing and sale of our products which include class action allegations, and have and may become involved in similar actions in other jurisdictions. These lawsuits allege claims which include negligence, breach of contract, breach of warranty, product liability and safety claims, false advertising, fraud, and violation of federal and state regulations, including consumer protection laws. In general, we do not have insurance coverage for class action lawsuits. We are also involved in various other legal actions in the United States and other jurisdictions around the world arising in the normal course of business, for which insurance coverage may or may not be available depending on the nature of the action. We dispute the merits of these suits and actions, and intend to vigorously defend them. Management believes, based upon its current knowledge, after taking into consideration legal counsel's evaluation of such suits and actions, and after taking into account current litigation accruals, that the outcome of these matters currently pending against Whirlpool should not have a material adverse effect, if any, on our financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

Competition Investigation

In 2013, the French Competition Authority commenced an investigation of appliance manufacturers and retailers in France. The investigation includes (among others) Whirlpool and Indesit operations in France. Although it is currently not possible to assess the impact, if any, this matter may have on our Consolidated Financial Statements, the resolution of this matter could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity, or results of operations in any particular reporting period.

Product Warranty and Legacy Product Corrective Action Reserves

Product warranty reserves are included in other current and other noncurrent liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following table summarizes the changes in total product warranty and legacy product warranty liability reserves for the periods presented:

In the normal course of business, we engage in investigations of potential quality and safety issues. As part of our ongoing effort to deliver quality products to consumers, we are currently investigating a limited number of potential quality and safety issues globally. As necessary, we undertake to effect repair or replacement of appliances in the event that an investigation leads to the conclusion that such action is warranted. As part of that process, in 2015, Whirlpool engaged in thorough investigations of incident reports associated with

two

of its dryer production platforms developed by Indesit, prior to Whirlpool's acquisition of Indesit in October 2014. This led to Indesit reporting the issue to regulatory authorities for consideration. These discussions determined that corrective action of the affected dryers was required.

In September 2015, we recorded a liability related to this corrective action cost of

€245 million

(approximately

$274 million

as of September 30, 2015). Approximately 90% of the affected units were manufactured by Indesit prior to its acquisition by the Company in October 2014. Accordingly, in September 2015 we increased the warranty liability as a purchase accounting adjustment in the opening balance sheet with a corresponding increase to goodwill of

€210 million

(approximately

$235 million

as of September 30, 2015). The establishment of this liability is based on several assumptions such as customer response rate, consumer options, field repair costs, inventory repair costs, and timing of tax deductibility. Our experience with respect to these factors may cause our actual costs to differ significantly from our estimated costs. During 2015, we recognized expenses of

$39 million

related to legacy product warranty and liability corrective action on heritage Indesit product in Europe.  Cash settlements related to this corrective action are recognized in other operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  As of

December 31, 2016

, Whirlpool had

$162 million

of cash expenditures related to the corrective action.

In addition, we sought recovery under the terms of the Indesit agreements and reached an agreement with the seller in the fourth quarter of 2016 to recover a portion of our acquisition-related costs. We recognized such amount in interest and sundry (income) expense.

Guarantees

We have guarantee arrangements in a Brazilian subsidiary. As a standard business practice in Brazil, the subsidiary guarantees customer lines of credit at commercial banks to support purchases following its normal credit policies. If a customer were to default on its line of credit with the bank, our subsidiary would be required to satisfy the obligation with the bank and the receivable would revert back to the subsidiary. At

December 31, 2016

and

December 31, 2015

, the guaranteed amounts totaled

$258 million

and

$260 million

, respectively. The fair value of these guarantees were nominal at

December 31, 2016

and

December 31, 2015

. Our subsidiary insures against credit risk for these guarantees, under normal operating conditions, through policies purchased from high-quality underwriters.

We provide guarantees of indebtedness and lines of credit for various consolidated subsidiaries. The maximum contractual amount of indebtedness and credit facilities available under these lines for consolidated subsidiaries totaled

$2.4 billion

at

December 31, 2016

and

$2.0 billion

at

December 31, 2015

. Our total outstanding bank indebtedness under guarantees was nominal at

December 31, 2016

and

, respectively.

We have guaranteed a

The credit facility, which originated in 2008, was refinanced in December 2012 and we renewed our guarantee through 2017. It was also amended in 2015 and 2016 by Harbor Shores and reduced to

$43 million

and

$40 million

, respectively. The fair value of this guarantee was nominal at

December 31, 2016

HEDGES AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Derivative instruments are accounted for at fair value based on market rates. Derivatives where we elect hedge accounting are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges. Derivatives that are not accounted for based on hedge accounting are marked to market through earnings. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use and designation of the derivative instrument. Hedging ineffectiveness and a net earnings impact occur when the change in the fair value of the hedge does not offset the change in the fair value of the hedged item. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognized in earnings.

Using derivative instruments means assuming counterparty credit risk. Counterparty credit risk relates to the loss we could incur if a counterparty were to default on a derivative contract. We generally deal with investment grade counterparties and monitor the overall credit risk and exposure to individual counterparties. We do not anticipate nonperformance by any counterparties. The amount of counterparty credit exposure is limited to the unrealized gains, if any, on such derivative contracts. We do not require nor do we post collateral or security on such contracts.

Hedging Strategy

In the normal course of business, we manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations including those arising from changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Fluctuations in these rates and prices can affect our operating results and financial condition. We use a variety of strategies, including the use of derivative instruments, to manage these risks. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (CONTINUED)

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We incur expenses associated with the procurement and production of products in a limited number of countries, while we sell in the local currencies of a large number of countries. Our primary foreign currency exchange exposures result from cross-currency sales of products. As a result, we enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain firm commitments and forecasted transactions to acquire products and services that are denominated in foreign currencies.

We enter into certain undesignated non-functional currency asset and liability hedges that relate primarily to short-term payables, receivables and intercompany loans. These forecasted cross-currency cash flows relate primarily to foreign currency denominated expenditures and intercompany financing agreements, royalty agreements and dividends. When we hedge a foreign currency denominated payable or receivable with a derivative, the effect of changes in the foreign exchange rates are reflected currently in interest and sundry (income) expense for both the payable/receivable and the derivative. Therefore, as a result of the economic hedge, we do not elect hedge accounting.

Commodity Price Risk

We enter into commodity derivative contracts on various commodities to manage the price risk associated with forecasted purchases of materials used in our manufacturing process. The objective of these hedges is to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with the forecasted purchase of commodities.

Interest Rate Risk

We may enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk exposure. Our interest rate swap agreements, if any, effectively modify our exposure to interest rate risk, primarily through converting certain of our floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis, and certain fixed rate debt to a floating rate basis. These agreements involve either the receipt or payment of floating rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate interest payments or receipts, respectively, over the life of the agreements without an exchange of the underlying principal amounts. We also may utilize a cross-currency interest rate swap agreement to manage our exposure relating to certain intercompany debt denominated in one foreign currency that will be repaid in another foreign currency.

At

December 31, 2016

and


there were

no

outstanding swap agreements.

We may enter into treasury rate lock agreements to effectively modify our exposure to interest rate risk by locking-in interest rates on probable long-term debt issuances.

Net Investment Hedging

We primarily use foreign currency denominated debt to hedge our investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we designated approximately

€700 million

of foreign currency denominated debt instruments as net investment hedges, and as of

December 31, 2016

, the outstanding principal amount of foreign currency denominated debt instruments designated as net investment hedges totaled

€500 million

. We had no net investment hedges as of December 31, 2015.

At

December 31, 2016

, our foreign currency denominated debt designated as net investment hedge consisted of:

For instruments that are designated and qualify as a net investment hedge, the effective portion of the instruments' gain or loss is reported as a component of OCI and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The gain or loss will be subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. The remaining change in fair value of the hedge instruments represents the ineffective portion, which is immediately recognized in interest and sundry (income) expense on our consolidated statements of income. As of

December 31, 2016

, there was

no

ineffectiveness on hedges designated as net investment hedges.

months.

Share-Based Employee Incentive Plans

On April 16, 2013, our stockholders approved the Amended and Restated 2010 Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan (“2010 OSIP”). This plan was previously adopted by our Board of Directors on February 19, 2013 and provides for the issuance of stock options, performance stock units, performance shares, restricted stock and restricted stock units. No new awards may be granted under the 2010 OSIP after the tenth anniversary of the date that the stockholders approved the plan. However, the term and exercise of awards granted before then may extend beyond that date. At

December 31, 2016

, approximately

5.8 million

shares remain available for issuance under the 2010 OSIP.

Stock Options

Eligible employees may receive stock options as a portion of their total compensation. Such options generally become exercisable over a


-year period, expire


years from the date of grant and are subject to forfeiture upon termination of employment, other than by death, disability or retirement. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees. Granted options have exercise prices equal to the market price of Whirlpool common stock on the grant date. The principal assumptions used in valuing options include: (1) risk-free interest rate—an estimate based on the yield of United States zero coupon securities with a maturity equal to the expected life of the option; (2) expected volatility—an estimate based on the historical volatility of Whirlpool common stock for a period equal to the expected life of the option; and (3) expected option life—an estimate based on historical experience. Stock options are expensed on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures. Based on the results of the model, the weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options granted for

Stock Units

Eligible employees may receive restricted stock units or performance stock units as a portion of their total compensation.

Restricted stock units are typically granted to selected management employees on an annual basis and vest over

three

years. Periodically, restricted stock units may be granted to selected executives based on special recognition or retention circumstances and generally vest from

three

years to

seven

years. Some previously granted awards accrue dividend equivalents on outstanding units (in the form of additional stock units) based on dividends declared on Whirlpool common stock. These awards convert to unrestricted common stock at the conclusion of the vesting period.

Performance stock units are granted to executives on an annual basis and generally vest over a

three

year period, converting to unrestricted common stock at the conclusion of the vesting period. The final award may equal

0%

to

200%

of a target based on pre-established Whirlpool financial performance measures.

We measure compensation cost for stock units based on the closing market price of Whirlpool common stock at the grant date, with adjustments for performance stock units to reflect the final award granted. The weighted average grant date fair values of awards granted during

RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

We periodically take action to improve operating efficiencies, typically in connection with business acquisitions or changes in the economic environment. Our footprint and headcount reductions and organizational integration actions relate to discrete, unique restructuring events, primarily reflected in the following plans.

During 2014 and 2015, we announced the following restructuring plans: (a) the closure of a microwave oven manufacturing facility and other organizational efficiency actions in EMEA and Latin America, (b) organizational integration activities in China and Europe to support the integration of Whirlpool China and Indesit, and (c) the closure of a research and development facility in Germany in 2016. All of these actions were substantially completed in 2016.

In the second quarter of 2015, we committed to a restructuring plan to integrate our Italian legacy operations with those of Indesit. The industrial restructuring plan, which was approved by the relevant labor unions in July 2015 and signed by the Italian government in August 2015, provides for the closure or repurposing of certain manufacturing facilities and headcount reductions at other facilities. In addition, the restructuring plan provides for headcount reductions in the salaried employee workforce. We estimate that we will incur up to

€179 million

(approximately

$189 million

as of

December 31, 2016

) in employee-related costs,

€25 million

(approximately

$26 million

as of

December 31, 2016

) in asset impairment costs, and

€37 million

(approximately

$39 million

as of

December 31, 2016

) in other associated costs in connection with these actions. These actions will be substantially complete in 2018. We estimate

€209 million

(approximately

$220 million

as of

December 31, 2016

) of the estimated

€241 million

total cost will result in future cash expenditures.

On January 24, 2017 the Company and certain subsidiary companies began consultations with certain works councils and other regulatory agencies in connection with the Company’s proposal to restructure its EMEA dryer manufacturing operations.  Company management authorized the initiation of such consultations on December 30, 2016.  These actions are expected to result in changing the operations at the Yate, U.K. facility to focus on manufacturing for U.K. consumer needs only; ending production in 2018 in Amiens, France; and concentrating the production of dryers for non-UK consumer needs in Lodz, Poland.  The Company currently anticipates that approximately


positions would be impacted by these actions. The Company would expect these actions to be substantially complete in 2018. The Company estimates that it will incur up to approximately

$65 million

in employee-related costs, approximately

$12 million

in asset impairment costs, and approximately

$11 million

in other associated costs in connection with these actions.  The Company estimates that approximately

$76 million

of the estimated

$88 million

total cost will result in future cash expenditures. The actions outlined above resulted in a 2016 charge of

$20 million

which fell within the reported charges for 2016.

United States Tax on Foreign Dividends

We have historically reinvested all unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. We plan to distribute approximately

$5 million

of foreign earnings over the next several years. This distribution is forecasted to result in tax benefits which have not been recorded because of their contingent nature. There has been no deferred tax liability provided on the remaining amount of unremitted earnings of

$4.6 billion

at December 31,


. The Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately

$1.1 billion

at

December 31, 2016

, of which approximately

$1.0 billion

was held by subsidiaries in foreign countries. Our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the United States and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds to fund our U.S. operations. However, if these funds were repatriated, then we would be required to accrue and pay applicable United States taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and withholding taxes payable to various countries. The repatriation could result in an adjustment to the tax liability after considering available foreign tax credits and other tax attributes. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of the deferred tax liability associated with these unremitted earnings due to the complexity of its hypothetical calculation.

Valuation Allowances

At December 31,


, we had net operating loss carryforwards of

$3.5 billion

,

$1.0 billion

of which were United States State net operating loss carryforwards. Of the total net operating loss carryforwards,

$2.2 billion

do not expire, with substantially all of the remaining carryforwards expiring in various years through 2036. As of December 31,


, we had

$310 million

of foreign tax credit carryforwards and

$964 million

of United States general business credit carryforwards available to offset future payments of federal income taxes, expiring between 2017 and 2036.

We routinely review the future realization of deferred tax assets based on projected future reversal of taxable temporary differences, available tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income. We have recorded a valuation allowance to reflect the net estimated amount of certain deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss and other deferred tax assets we believe will be realized. Our recorded valuation allowance of

$150 million

at December 31,


consists of

$128 million

of net operating loss carryforward deferred tax assets and

$22 million

of other deferred tax assets.  Our recorded valuation allowance was

$286 million

at December 31, 2015 and consisted of

$239 million

of net operating loss carryforward deferred tax assets and

$47 million

of other deferred tax assets. The reduction in our valuation allowance includes

$121 million

recognized in net earnings which consist of

$163 million

of valuation allowance releases and

$42 million

of additional valuation allowances. The remaining change relates to reclassification within our net deferred tax asset. We believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of existing deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances mentioned above.

Settlement of Global Tax Audits

We are in various stages of audits by certain governmental tax authorities. We establish liabilities for the difference between tax return provisions and the benefits recognized in our financial statements. Such amounts represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid, and may need to be adjusted over time as more information becomes known. We are no longer subject to any significant United States federal tax examinations for the years before 2008, or any state, local or foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2004.

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

We have funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans that cover certain employees in North America, Europe, Asia and Brazil. For the United States plan, which comprises the majority of our obligation, the plans are frozen for the majority of participants. The formula for United States salaried employees covered under the qualified defined benefit plan was based on years of service and final average salary, while the formula for United States hourly employees covered under the defined benefit plans was based on specific dollar amounts for each year of service. There were multiple formulas for employees covered under the qualified and nonqualified defined benefit plans sponsored by Maytag, including a cash balance formula. In addition, we sponsor an unfunded Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. This plan is nonqualified and provides certain key employees defined pension benefits that supplement those provided by the Company’s other retirement plans.

A defined contribution plan is being provided to all United States employees subsequent to the pension plan freezes and is not classified within the net periodic benefit cost. The company provides annual match and automatic company contributions, in cash or company stock, of up to

7%

of employees’ eligible pay. Our contributions during


,


and


were

$77 million

,

$76 million

and

$71 million

, respectively.

We provide postretirement health care benefits for eligible retired employees in the United States, Canada and Brazil. For our United States plan, which comprises the majority of our obligation, eligible retirees include those who were full-time employees with


years of service who attained age


while in service with us and those union retirees who met the eligibility requirements of their collective bargaining agreements. In general, the postretirement health and welfare benefit plans include cost-sharing provisions that limit our exposure for recent and future retirees and are contributory, with participants’ contributions adjusted annually. The plans are unfunded. We reserve the right to modify these benefits in the future.

During the second quarter 2011, we modified retiree medical benefits for certain retirees to be consistent with those benefits provided by the Whirlpool Corporation Group Benefit Plan. We accounted for these changes as a plan amendment in 2011, resulting in a reduction in the postretirement benefit obligation of

$138 million

of which approximately

$104 million

of benefit has been recognized in net earnings since 2011, with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax. In response, a group of retirees initiated legal proceedings against Whirlpool asserting the above benefits are vested and changes to the plan are not permitted. We disagree with plaintiffs' assertion and are continuing to vigorously defend our position, including through any necessary appeal process. However, an unfavorable ruling in any particular reporting period could require us to immediately reverse the benefit we have recognized to that point, and remeasure the associated postretirement benefit obligation, the impact of which will depend on timing and the actuarial assumptions then in effect.

Components of Net Periodic Benefit Cost

During the first quarter of 2015, we recognized approximately

from a curtailment gain due to the elimination of amounts credited to notional retiree health accounts for certain employees under age 50. The curtailment gain was recognized in our Consolidated Condensed Statement of Comprehensive Income with

$43 million

recorded in cost of products sold and the remaining balance in selling, general and administrative, with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax.

During the third quarter of 2015, we recognized approximately

Weighted-Average Assumptions used to Determine Net Periodic Cost

Discount Rate

For our United States pension and postretirement benefit plans, the discount rate was selected using a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds outstanding at December 31 that would provide the necessary cash flows to match our projected benefit payments. For our foreign pension and postretirement benefit plans, the discount rate was primarily selected using high quality bond yields for the respective country or region covered by the plan.


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (CONTINUED)

Expected Return on Plan Assets

In the United States, the expected rate of return on plan assets was determined by using the historical asset returns for publicly traded equity and fixed income securities tracked since 1926 and the historical returns for private equity. The historical equity returns were adjusted downward to reflect future expectations. The expected returns are weighted by the targeted asset allocations. The resulting weighted-average return was rounded to the nearest quarter of one percent and applied to the fair value of plan assets as of

December 31, 2016

.

For foreign pension plans, the expected rate of return on plan assets was primarily determined by observing historical returns in the local fixed income and equity markets and computing the weighted average returns with the weights being the asset allocation of each plan.

Estimated Impact of One Percentage-Point Change in Assumed Health Care Cost Trend Rate

A one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects on our health care plan:

Cash Flows

Funding Policy

Our funding policy is to contribute to our United States pension plans amounts sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirement as defined by employee benefit and tax laws, plus additional amounts which we may determine to be appropriate. In certain countries other than the United States, the funding of pension plans is not common practice. Contributions to our United States pension plans may be made in the form of cash or company stock. We pay for retiree medical benefits as they are incurred.

Expected Employer Contributions to Funded Plans

Expected Benefit Payments

Plan Assets

Our overall investment strategy is to achieve an appropriate mix of investments for long-term growth and for near-term benefit payments with a wide diversification of asset types, fund strategies, and investment fund managers. The target allocation for plan assets is generally

40%

equity and

60%

fixed income, with exceptions for foreign pension plans. For our U.S. plan, the target allocation for equity securities is approximately

50%

allocated to United States large-cap,

25%

to international equity,

13%

to United States mid and small-cap companies and

12%

in venture capital. The target allocation for fixed income is allocated with

75%

to corporate bonds and

25%

to United States treasury and other government securities. The fixed income securities duration is intended to match that of our United States pension liabilities.


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (CONTINUED)

Plan assets are reported at fair value based on an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset. As a basis for considering such assumptions, a three-tiered fair value hierarchy is established, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: (Level 1) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level 2) inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable, either directly or indirectly; and (Level 3) unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. We manage the process and approve the results of a third party pricing service to value the majority of our securities and to determine the appropriate level in the fair value hierarchy.

The fair values of our pension plan assets at

December 31, 2016

and


, by asset category were as follows:

(a)

Valued using pricing vendors who use proprietary models to estimate the price a dealer would pay to buy a security using significant observable inputs, such as interest rates, yield curves, and credit risk.

(b)

Valued using the closing stock price on a national securities exchange, which reflects the last reported sales price on the last business day of the year.

(c)

Valued using the net asset value (NAV) of the fund, which is based on the fair value of underlying securities. The fund primarily invests in a diversified portfolio of equity securities issued by non-U.S. companies.

(d)

Valued using the NAV of the fund, which is based on the fair value of underlying securities.

(e)

Valued at estimated fair value based on the proportionate share of the limited partnership's fair value, as determined by the general partner.

Valued using the NAV of the fund, which is based on the fair value of underlying assets.

OPERATING SEGMENT INFORMATION

Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated on a regular basis by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing performance.

We identify such segments based upon geographical regions of operations because each operating segment manufactures home appliances and related components, but serves strategically different markets. The chief operating decision maker evaluates performance based upon each segment’s operating income, which is defined as income before interest and sundry (income) expense, interest expense, income taxes, noncontrolling interests, intangible asset impairment and restructuring costs. Total assets by segment are those assets directly associated with the respective operating activities. The “Other/Eliminations” column primarily includes corporate expenses, assets and eliminations, as well as restructuring costs and intangible asset impairments, if any. Intersegment sales are eliminated within each region except compressor sales out of Latin America, which are included in Other/Eliminations.

We conduct business in three countries - the United States, Brazil, and China - which individually comprised at least 10% of consolidated net sales or long-lived assets within the country in the last three years.

The following table summarizes net sales and long-lived assets by geographic area:


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (CONTINUED)

As described above, our chief operating decision maker reviews each operating segment’s performance based upon operating income which excludes restructuring costs and intangible asset impairment, if any.

REPORT BY MANAGEMENT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The management of Whirlpool Corporation has prepared the accompanying financial statements. The financial statements have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, whose report, based upon their audits, expresses the opinion that these financial statements present fairly the consolidated financial position, statements of income and cash flows of Whirlpool and its subsidiaries in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Their audits are conducted in conformity with the auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).

The financial statements were prepared from the Company’s accounting records, books and accounts which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect all material transactions. The Company maintains a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that the Company’s books and records, and the Company’s assets are maintained and accounted for, in accordance with management’s authorizations. The Company’s accounting records, compliance with policies and internal controls are regularly reviewed by an internal audit staff.

The audit committee of the Board of Directors of the Company is composed of four independent directors who, in the opinion of the board, meet the relevant financial experience, literacy, and expertise requirements. The audit committee provides independent and objective oversight of the Company’s accounting functions and internal controls and monitors (1) the objectivity of the Company’s financial statements, (2) the Company’s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, (3) the independent registered public accounting firm’s qualifications and independence, and (4) the performance of the Company’s internal audit function and independent registered public accounting firm. In performing these functions, the committee has the responsibility to review and discuss the annual audited financial statements and quarterly financial statements and related reports with management and the independent registered public accounting firm, including the Company’s disclosures under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” to monitor the adequacy of financial disclosure. The committee also has the responsibility to retain and terminate the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm and exercise the committee’s sole authority to review and approve all audit engagement fees and terms and pre-approve the nature, extent, and cost of all non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm.


MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of Whirlpool Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a – 15(f) and 15d – 15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Whirlpool’s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to Whirlpool’s management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

The management of Whirlpool assessed the effectiveness of Whirlpool’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2016

.

In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). Based on the assessment and those criteria, management believes that Whirlpool maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2016

.

Whirlpool’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on its assessment of Whirlpool’s internal control over financial reporting. This report appears on page

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of    Whirlpool Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Whirlpool Corporation as of

December 31, 2016

and


, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

December 31, 2016

. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Whirlpool Corporation at

December 31, 2016

and


, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

December 31, 2016

, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Whirlpool Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2016

, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework and our report dated

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of    Whirlpool Corporation

We have audited Whirlpool Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2016

, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework (the COSO criteria). Whirlpool Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Whirlpool Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2016

, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Whirlpool Corporation as of

December 31, 2016

and


, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

December 31, 2016

and our report dated

expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
