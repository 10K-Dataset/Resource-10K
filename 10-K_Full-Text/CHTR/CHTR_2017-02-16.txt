FORM 10-K — FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2016


This annual report on Form 10-K is for the year ended

December 31, 2016

.  The  United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) allows us to “incorporate by reference” information that we file with the SEC, which means that we can disclose important information to you by referring you directly to those documents.  Information incorporated by reference is considered to be part of this annual report.  In addition, information that we file with the SEC in the future will automatically update and supersede information contained in this annual report.  In this annual report, “Charter,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Charter Communications, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

Explanatory Note

On May 18, 2016, Charter Communications, Inc. (formerly known as CCH I, LLC, the “Company” or “Charter”) completed its previously reported merger transactions among Charter, Time Warner Cable Inc. (“Legacy TWC”), Charter Communications, Inc. (“Legacy Charter”), and certain other subsidiaries of Charter (the “TWC Transaction”). Also on May 18, 2016, Charter completed its previously reported acquisition of Bright House Networks, LLC (“Legacy Bright House”) from Advance/Newhouse Partnership (the “Bright House Transaction,” and, together with the TWC Transaction, the “Transactions”).  As a result of the Transactions, Charter became the new public parent company that holds the combined operations of Legacy Charter, Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House and was renamed Charter Communications, Inc. The financial statements presented in this annual report reflect the operations of Legacy Charter through May 17, 2016 and the Company on and after May 18, 2016. See Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2, “Mergers and Acquisitions - Selected Pro Forma Financial Information” for certain financial information presented as if the Transactions had closed on January 1, 2015. Also see Exhibit 99.1 in Charter’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 filed with the SEC on November 3, 2016 for pro forma financial information for each quarter of 2015 and the first and second quarter of 2016.  Throughout this report references to the “Company” or to “Charter” refer to the combined company following the completion of the Transactions.

As a result of the Transactions and by operation of Rule 12g-3(c) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), Charter is the successor issuer to Legacy Charter and succeeds to the attributes of Legacy Charter as the registrant.  Charter’s Class A common stock is deemed to be registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, and Charter is subject to the Exchange Act to the same extent as Legacy Charter.

PART I

Item 1.

Business.

Introduction

We are the second largest cable operator in the United States and a leading broadband communications services company providing video, Internet and voice services to approximately

26.2 million

residential and business customers at

December 31, 2016

.  In addition, we sell video and online advertising inventory to local, regional and national advertising customers and fiber-delivered communications and managed information technology (“IT”) solutions to larger enterprise customers.  We also own and operate regional sports networks and local sports, news and lifestyle channels and sell security and home management services to the residential marketplace.

Our core strategy is to deliver high quality products at competitive prices, combined with outstanding service. This strategy, combined with simple, easy to understand pricing and packaging, is central to our goal of growing our customer base while also selling more individual services to each customer.  We expect to execute this strategy by managing our operations in a consumer-friendly, efficient and cost effective manner. Our operating strategy includes insourcing much of our customer care and field operations workforce which results in higher quality service transactions. While an insourced operating model can increase field operations and customer care costs associated with each service transaction, the higher quality nature of each service transaction significantly reduces the volume of service transactions per customer, more than offsetting the higher investment made in each service transaction. As we reduce the number of service transactions and recurring costs per customer relationship, we effectively pass those savings on to customers in the form of products and prices, that we believe are more cost effective than what our competitors offer. The combination of offering competitively priced products and high quality service, allows us to increase the number of customer relationships over a fixed network and products sold per relationship, while at the same time reducing the number of service transactions per relationship, improving customer satisfaction and reducing churn, which results in lower costs to acquire and serve customers.  Ultimately, this operating strategy enables us to offer high quality, competitively priced services profitably, while continuing to invest in new products and services.

Our principal executive offices are located at 400 Atlantic Street, Stamford, Connecticut 06901.  Our telephone number is (203) 905-7800, and we have a website accessible at www.charter.com.  Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments thereto, are available on our website free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after they have been filed.  The information posted on our website is not incorporated into this annual report.

Products and Services

We offer our customers subscription-based video services, including video on demand (“VOD”), high definition (“HD”) television, and digital video recorder (“DVR”) service), Internet services and voice services.  As of

December 31, 2016

, 70% of our footprint was all-digital enabling us to offer more HD channels, faster Internet speeds and better video picture quality and we intend to transition the remaining portions of our Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House footprints. Our video, Internet, and voice services are offered to residential and commercial customers on a subscription basis, with prices and related charges based on the types of service selected, whether the services are sold as a “bundle” or on an individual basis, and the equipment necessary to receive our services.  Bundled services are available to approximately

99%

of our passings, and approximately

61%

of our customers subscribe to a bundle of services.


All customer statistics as of

December 31, 2016

include the operations of Legacy TWC, Legacy Bright House and Legacy Charter, each of which is based on individual legacy company reporting methodology.  These methodologies differ and their differences may be material and statistical reporting will be conformed over time to a single reporting methodology.  The following table summarizes our customer statistics for video, Internet and voice as of

December 31, 2016

and


(in thousands except per customer data and footnotes).

Residential Services

Video Services

Our video customers receive a package of basic programming which, in our all-digital markets, includes a digital set-top box that provides an interactive electronic programming guide with parental controls, access to pay-per-view services, including VOD (available to nearly all of our passings), digital music channels and the option to view certain video services on third party devices.  Customers have the option to purchase additional tiers of services including premium channels which provide original programming, commercial-free movies, sports, and other special event entertainment programming.  Substantially all of our video programming is available in HD.

In most areas, we offer VOD service which allows customers to select from approximately 30,000 titles at any time.  VOD includes standard definition, HD and three dimensional (“3D”) content.  VOD programming options may be accessed for free if the content is associated with a customer’s linear subscription, or for a fee on a transactional basis.  VOD services are also offered on a subscription basis included in a digital tier premium channel subscription or for a monthly fee.  Pay-per-view channels allow customers to pay on a per-event basis to view a single showing of a one-time special sporting event, music concert, or similar event on a commercial-free basis.

Our goal is to provide our video customers with the programming they want, when they want it, on any device.  DVR service enables customers to digitally record programming and to pause and rewind live programming.  Customers can also use the Charter TV applications available on portable devices, streaming devices and on our websites to watch up to 300 channels of cable TV, view VOD programming, remotely control digital set-top boxes while in the home and to program DVRs remotely.  We intend to consolidate the various legacy entity TV applications into a single Spectrum TV Application in 2017.  Customers also have access to programmer authenticated applications and websites such as HBO Go

®

, Fox Now

®

, Discovery Go

®

and WatchESPN

®

.

In certain markets, we have launched Spectrum Guide

®

, a network or “cloud-based” user interface that runs on traditional set-top boxes, with a look and feel that is similar to that of the Spectrum TV App.  Spectrum Guide

®

is designed to enable our customers to enjoy a state-of-the-art video experience on set-top boxes, regardless of the age of the set-top box.  The guide enables customers to find video content more easily across cable TV channels and VOD options.  We plan to continue to deploy across our footprint and enhance this technology in 2017 and beyond.

Internet Services

Approximately

99%

of our estimated passings are enabled for DOCSIS 3.0 wideband technology, allowing us to offer our residential customers multiple tiers of Internet services with currently marketed download speeds of up to 300 megabits per second (“Mbps”).  In nearly every market where we have launched Spectrum pricing and packaging (“SPP”), our entry level Internet download speed offering is 60 or 100 Mbps which, among other things, allows several people within a single household to stream HD video content online while simultaneously using our Internet service for non-video purposes.  As we roll out SPP in Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House markets, we will bring base speed offerings to a standard minimum of 60 or 100 Mbps at uniform pricing without any usage-based pricing data caps, modem fees or early termination fees.  Finally, we offer a security suite with our Internet services which, upon installation by customers, provides protection against computer viruses and spyware and includes parental control features.

We offer an in-home WiFi product that permits customers to lease high performance wireless routers to maximize their in-home wireless Internet experience.  Additionally, we offer an out-of-home WiFi service (“Spectrum WiFi”) in most of our footprint to our Internet customers at designated “hot spots.” In 2017, we expect to expand WiFi accessibility to our customers both inside and outside of their legacy entity footprints.

Voice Services

We provide voice communications services using VoIP technology to transmit digital voice signals over our network.  Our voice services include unlimited local and long distance calling to the United States, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico, voicemail, call waiting, caller ID, call forwarding and other features and offers international calling either by the minute, or through packages of minutes per month.  For customers that subscribe to both our voice and video offerings, caller ID on TV is also available in most areas.


Other Residential Services

We are continually engaging in product research and development and other opportunities to expand our services including the activation of our Mobile Virtual Network Operator (“MVNO”) agreement with Verizon which would enable us to offer mobile services.  The activation of the MVNO with Verizon does not, however, represent an obligation for us to offer mobile services.

Commercial Services

We offer scalable broadband communications solutions for businesses and carrier organizations of all sizes, selling Internet access, data networking, fiber connectivity to cellular towers and office buildings, video entertainment services and business telephone services.

Small and Medium Business

As Spectrum Business, we offer video, Internet and voice services to small and medium businesses over our coaxial network that are similar to those that we provide to our residential customers.  Spectrum Business includes a full range of video programming and music services and Internet speeds of up to 100 Mbps downstream, 300 Mbps in certain markets, and up to 20 Mbps upstream in its DOCSIS 3.0 markets.  Spectrum Business also includes a set of business services including web hosting, e-mail and security, and multi-line telephone services with more than 30 business features including web-based service management.

Enterprise Solutions

As Spectrum Enterprise, we offer fiber-delivered communications and managed IT solutions to larger businesses, as well as high-capacity last-mile data connectivity services to wireless and wireline carriers, Internet Service Providers (“ISPs”) and other competitive carriers on a wholesale basis.  More specifically, Spectrum Enterprise's portfolio includes fiber Internet access with symmetrical speeds up to 10 gigabits per second (“Gbps”), voice trunking services such as Primary Rate Interface (“PRI”) and Session Initiation Protocol (“SIP”) Trunks, Ethernet services that privately and securely connect geographically dispersed client locations with speeds up to 10 Gbps, and video solutions designed to meet the needs of the hospitality, education, and health care clients.  Our managed IT portfolio includes Cloud Infrastructure as a Service (“IaaS”) and Cloud Desktop as a Service (“DaaS”), and managed hosting, application, and messaging solutions, along with other related IT and professional services.  The Transactions have provided us with a larger footprint which allows us to more effectively serve business customers with multiple sites across given geographic regions.  These customers can benefit from obtaining these advanced services from a single provider simplifying procurement and potentially reducing their costs.

Advertising Services

Our advertising sales division, Spectrum Reach

®

, offers local, regional and national businesses with the opportunity to advertise in individual and multiple markets on cable television networks. We receive revenues from the sale of local advertising on digital advertising networks and satellite-delivered networks such as MTV

®

, CNN

®

and ESPN

®

.  In any particular market, we typically insert local advertising on over 50 channels.  Since completion of the Transactions, our larger footprint has increased opportunities for advertising customers to address broader regional audiences from a single provider and thus reach more customers with a single transaction.  Our increased size provides scale to invest in new technology to create more targeted and interactive advertising capabilities.

Available advertising time is generally sold by our advertising sales force.  In some markets, we have formed advertising interconnects or entered into representation agreements with other video distributors, including, among others, Verizon Communications Inc.’s (“Verizon”) fiber optic service (“FiOS”) and AT&T Inc.’s (“AT&T”) U-verse, under which we sell advertising on behalf of those operators.  In some markets, we enter into representation agreements under which another operator in the area will sell advertising on our behalf.  These arrangements enable us and our partners to deliver linear commercials across wider geographic areas, replicating the reach of local broadcast television stations to the extent possible. In addition, we, together with Comcast Corporation (“Comcast”) and Cox Communications, Inc., own National Cable Communications LLC, which, on behalf of a number of video operators, sells advertising time to national and regional advertisers.

We also sell the advertising inventory of our owned and operated local sports, news and lifestyle channels, and advertising inventory on our regional sports networks that carry Los Angeles Lakers’ basketball games and other sports programming and on SportsNet LA, a regional sports network that carries Los Angeles Dodgers’ baseball games and other sports programing.


We have deployed advanced advertising products such as interactivity, household addressability, dynamic ad insertion into VOD and data infused advertising campaigns within various parts of our footprint. These new products will be distributed across more of our footprint in 2017.

Other Services

Regional Sports and News Networks

We have an agreement with the Los Angeles Lakers for rights to distribute all locally available pre-season, regular season and post-season Los Angeles Lakers’ games through 2033. We broadcast those games on our regional sports network, Spectrum SportsNet.  As of December 31, 2016, Spectrum SportsNet was distributed to approximately 4.7 million multichannel video customers via the majority of major multichannel video distributors in our Southern California, Las Vegas, NV and Hawaii regions. We also manage 36 local news channels, including Spectrum News NY1, a 24-hour news channel focused on New York City, 20 local sports channels and three local lifestyle community channels, and we own 26.8% of Sterling Entertainment Enterprises, LLC (doing business as SportsNet New York), a New York City-based regional sports network that carries New York Mets’ baseball games as well as other regional sports programming.

American Media Productions, LLC ("American Media Productions"), an unaffiliated third party, owns SportsNet LA, a regional sports network carrying the Los Angeles Dodgers’ baseball games and other sports programming. In accordance with agreements with American Media Productions, we act as the network’s exclusive affiliate and advertising sales representative and have certain branding and programming rights with respect to the network. In addition, we provide certain production and technical services to American Media Productions. The affiliate, advertising, production and programming agreements continue through 2038.  We continue to seek distribution agreements for the carriage of SportsNet LA by other major distributors.

Security and Home Management

We also provide security and home management services to our residential customers in certain markets.  Our broadband cable system connects the customer’s in-home system to our emergency response center. In addition to providing traditional security, fire and medical emergency monitoring and dispatch, the service allows customers to remotely arm or disarm their security system, monitor their home via indoor and outdoor cameras, and remotely operate key home functions, including setting and controlling lights, thermostats and door locks.

Pricing of Our Products and Services

Our revenues are principally derived from the monthly fees customers pay for the services we provide.  We typically charge a one-time installation fee which is sometimes waived or discounted in certain sales channels during certain promotional periods.

Our SPP offers a standardized price for each tier of service, bundle of services, and add-on service, regardless of market and emphasizes triple play bundles of video, Internet and voice services.  Our most popular and competitive services are combined in core packages at what we believe are attractive prices.  We began launching SPP in the Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House footprints in the third quarter of 2016, and we expect to offer SPP in all markets by the middle of 2017.  We believe our approach:

•

offers simplicity for customers to understand our offers, and for our employees in service delivery;

•

offers the ability to package more services at the time of sale, thus increasing revenue per customer;

•

offers a higher quality and more value-based set of services, including faster Internet speeds, more HD channels, lower equipment fees and a more transparent pricing structure;

•

drives higher customer satisfaction, lower service calls and churn; and

•

allows for gradual price increases at the end of promotional periods.

Our Network Technology

and Customer Premise Equipment

Our network includes three key components: a national backbone, regional/metro networks and the “last-mile” network.  Both our national backbone and regional/metro network components utilize a redundant Internet Protocol ("IP") ring/mesh architecture.  The national backbone component provides connectivity from the regional demarcation points to nationally centralized content, connectivity and services.  The regional/metro network components provide connectivity between the regional demarcation points and headends within a specific geographic area and enable the delivery of content and services between these network components.

Our last-mile network utilizes a hybrid fiber coaxial cable (“HFC”) architecture, which combines the use of fiber optic cable with coaxial cable.  In most systems, we deliver our signals via fiber optic cable from the headend to a group of nodes, and use coaxial


cable to deliver the signal from individual nodes to the homes served by that node. For our fiber Internet, Ethernet, carrier wholesale, SIP and PRI Spectrum Enterprise customers, fiber optic cable is extended from the individual nodes to the customer’s site.  For certain new build and MDU sites, we increasingly bring fiber to the customer site.  Our design standard is six strands of fiber to each node, with two strands activated and four strands reserved for spares and future services.  This design standard allows these strands to be utilized for additional residential traffic capacity, and enterprise customer needs as they arise.  We believe that this hybrid network design provides high capacity and signal quality.  The design also provides two-way signal capabilities for the support of interactive services.

HFC architecture benefits include:

•

bandwidth capacity to enable traditional and two-way video and broadband services;

•

dedicated bandwidth for two-way services; and

•

signal quality and high service reliability.

Approximately 98% of our estimated passings are served by systems that have bandwidth of 750 megahertz or greater as of

December 31, 2016

.  This bandwidth capacity enables us to offer HD television, DOCSIS-based Internet services and voice services.

An all-digital platform enables us to offer a larger selection of HD channels, faster Internet speeds and better picture quality while providing greater plant security and enabling lower installation and disconnect service truck rolls.  We are currently all-digital in 70% of our footprint and intend to transition the remaining portions of our Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House footprints.

We have been introducing our new set-top box, WorldBox, to consumers in certain markets. The WorldBox design has opened the set-top box market to new vendors and reduced our set-top box costs.  The WorldBox also includes more advanced features and functionality than older set-top boxes, including faster processing times, IP capabilities with increased speed, additional simultaneous recordings, increased DVR storage capacity, and a greater degree of flexibility for consumers to take Charter-provisioned set-top boxes with them, if and when, they move residences. We have also been introducing our new cloud-based user interface, Spectrum Guide

®

, to our video customers in certain markets. Spectrum Guide

®

improves video content search and discovery, and fully enables our on-demand offering. In addition, Spectrum Guide

®

can function on nearly all of Legacy Charter’s deployed set-tops, reducing costs and customer disruption to swap equipment for new functionality.

Management, Customer Care and Marketing

Our operations are centralized, with senior executives located at several key corporate offices, responsible for coordinating and overseeing operations including establishing company-wide strategies, policies and procedures.  Sales and marketing, network operations, field operations, customer operations, engineering, advertising sales, human resources, legal, government relations, information technology and finance are all directed at the corporate level.  Regional and local field operations are responsible for on-site service transactions with customers and maintaining and constructing that portion of our network which is located outdoors.  In 2017, our field operations group will focus on standardizing practices, processes, procedures and metrics, including those used to assure the quality of work performed when servicing customers.

We continue to focus on improving the customer experience through enhanced product offerings, reliability of services, and delivery of quality customer service.  As part of our operating strategy, we are committed to investments and hiring plans that will insource most of our customer service workload over the next few years.  We intend to bring the Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House customer operations workload, much of which is outsourced offshore, back to the United States. Most of these repatriated jobs will be fully insourced and will increase our full time labor force.  We are currently constructing a new call center in McAllen, TX which will solely serve customers who prefer to engage with us in Spanish, resulting in the creation of new jobs. This new facility will be operational and taking calls in 2017.

Legacy Charter’s in-house domestic call centers currently handle approximately 90% of calls, managed centrally to ensure a consistent, high quality customer experience.  On a consolidated basis, in-house domestic call centers handle just over 60% of customer service calls.  Over a multi-year period, however, we plan to migrate Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House customer service centers to Legacy Charter’s model of using segmented, virtualized, U.S.-based in-house call centers.  Segmented, virtualized call centers allow calls to be routed to agents across our footprint based on call type, enabling agents to be experts in addressing specific customer needs, thus creating a better customer experience.  Legacy Charter’s inbound sales, billing, service and retention call centers are also virtualized and segmented by call-type.  A new call center agent desktop interface tool, already used at Legacy Charter, is being developed for the acquired systems.  This new desktop interface tool will enable virtualization of all call centers, regardless of the legacy billing platform, to better serve our customers.


We also provide customers with the opportunity to interact with us through a variety of forums in addition to telephonic communications, including through our customer website, mobile device applications, online chat, and via social media. Our customer websites and mobile applications enable customers to pay their bills, manage their accounts, order new services and utilize self-service help and support.

We sell our residential and commercial services using a national brand platform known as Spectrum®, Spectrum Business® and Spectrum Enterprise®.  These brands reflect our comprehensive approach to industry-leading products, driven by speed, performance and innovation.  Our marketing strategy emphasizes the sale of our bundled services through targeted direct response marketing programs to existing and potential customers and increases awareness and the value of the Spectrum brand.  Our marketing organization creates and executes marketing programs intended to grow customer relationships, increase services per relationship, retain existing customers and cross-sell additional products to current customers.  We monitor the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, customer perception, competition, pricing, and service preferences, among other factors, in order to increase our responsiveness to our customers and to improve our sales and customer retention.  Our marketing organization also manages and directs several sales channels including direct sales, on-line, outbound telemarketing and stores.

Programming

We believe that offering a wide variety of video programming choices influences a customer’s decision to subscribe and retain our cable video services.  We obtain basic and premium programming, usually pursuant to written contracts, from a number of suppliers although media consolidation has resulted in fewer suppliers and additional selling power on the part of programmer suppliers.  Our programming contracts generally continue for a fixed period of time, usually for multiple years, and are subject to negotiated renewal.

Programming is usually made available to us for a license fee, which is generally paid based on the number of customers to whom we make that programming available.  Programming license fees may include “volume” discounts and financial incentives to support the launch of a channel and/or ongoing marketing support, as well as discounts for channel placement or service penetration.  For home shopping channels, we typically receive a percentage of the revenue attributable to our customers’ purchases. We also offer VOD and pay per view channels of movies and events that are subject to a revenue split with the content provider.

Our programming costs have increased in excess of customary inflationary and cost-of-living type increases.  We expect programming costs to continue to increase due to a variety of factors including, annual increases pursuant to our programming contracts, contract renewals with programmers and the carriage of incremental programming, including new services and VOD programming. Increases in the cost of sports programming and the amounts paid for broadcast station retransmission consent have been the largest contributors to the growth in our programming costs over the last few years. Additionally, the demands of large media companies who link carriage of their most popular networks to carriage and cost increases of their less popular networks, has limited our flexibility in creating more tailored and cost-sensitive programming packages for consumers.  Finally, programmers have experienced declines in demand for advertising as advertisers shift more of their marketing spend online.  We believe that this is resulting in programmers demanding higher programming fees from us, as they seek to recover revenue they are losing to online advertising.

Federal law allows commercial television broadcast stations to make an election between “must-carry” rights and an alternative “retransmission-consent” regime.  When a station opts for the retransmission-consent regime, we are not allowed to carry the station’s signal without that station’s permission.  Continuing demands by owners of broadcast stations for cash payments at substantial increases over amounts paid in prior years in exchange for retransmission consent will increase our programming costs or require us to cease carriage of popular programming, potentially leading to a loss of customers in affected markets.

Over the past several years, increases in our video service rates have not fully offset increasing programming costs, and with the impact of increasing competition and other marketplace factors, we do not expect them to do so in the foreseeable future.  Although we pass along a portion of amounts paid for retransmission consent to the majority of our customers, our inability to fully pass programming cost increases on to our video customers has had, and is expected in the future to have, an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating margins associated with our video product.

In order to mitigate reductions of our operating margins due to rapidly increasing programming costs, we continue to review our pricing and programming packaging strategies.

We have programming contracts that have expired and others that will expire at or before the end of 2017.  We will seek to renegotiate the terms of these agreements.  There can be no assurance that these agreements will be renewed on favorable or comparable terms.  To the extent that we are unable to reach agreements with certain programmers on terms that we believe are reasonable, we have been, and may in the future be, forced to remove such programming channels from our line-up, which may result in a loss of customers.


Regions

We operate in geographically diverse areas which are organized in regional clusters.   These regions are managed centrally on a consolidated level.  Our eleven regions and the customer relationships within each region as of

December 31, 2016

are as follows (in thousands):

Competition

Residential Services

We face intense competition for residential customers, both from existing competitors and, as a result of the rapid development of new technologies, services and products, from new entrants.

Video competition

Our residential video service faces competition from direct broadcast satellite (“DBS”) services, which have a national footprint and compete in all of our operating areas. DBS providers offer satellite-delivered pre-packaged programming services that can be received by relatively small and inexpensive receiving dishes. They offer aggressive promotional pricing, exclusive programming (e.g., NFL Sunday Ticket) and video services that are comparable in many respects to our residential video service. Our residential video service also faces competition from phone companies with fiber-based networks, primarily AT&T U-verse, Frontier Communications Corporation (“Frontier”) FiOs and Verizon FiOs, which offer wireline video services in approximately 23%, 8% and 4%, respectively, of our operating areas.   In July 2015, AT&T acquired DIRECTV Group Inc. (“DIRECTV”), the nation’s largest DBS provider, with the combined company able to offer bundles of video, Internet, wireline phone service and wireless service. As a condition to the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") approval of the transaction, AT&T is required to deploy fiber to the home (“FTTH”) to 12.5 million locations within four years from the close of its transaction. AT&T also announced the acquisition of Time Warner Inc. in October 2016 which is subject to regulatory approval.  If approved, it is not yet clear how AT&T will use the various programming and studio assets to benefit its own video on its various platforms or potential program access conditions as part of such regulatory approval.

Our residential video service also faces growing competition from a number of other sources, including companies that deliver linear network programming, movies and television shows on demand and other video content over broadband Internet connections to televisions, computers, tablets and mobile devices.  These newer categories of competitors include virtual multichannel video programming distributors (“V-MVPD”) such as AT&T’s “DirecTV NOW,” DISH Network Corporation’s “Sling TV,” and Sony Corporation’s “Playstation Vue,” and direct to consumer products offered by programmers that have not traditionally sold programming directly to consumers, such as HBO’s “HBO Now,” CBS’ “CBS All Access” and Showtime’s “Showtime Anytime.” Other online video business models have also developed, including, (i) subscription video on demand (“SVOD”) services such as Netflix, Amazon.com Inc.’s (“Amazon”) “Prime,” and “Hulu Plus,” (ii) ad-supported free online video products, including Google Inc.’s (“Google”), “YouTube” and “Hulu,” some of which offer programming for free to consumers that we currently purchase for a fee, (iii) pay-per-view products, such as Apple’s “ITunes” and Amazon’s, “Amazon Instant,” and (iv) additional ad-supported free offerings from wireless providers such as Verizon’s “go90” and T-Mobile’s “Binge On” that exempt certain video content traffic from counting towards monthly data caps. We have viewed online video services as complementary to our


own video offering, and we have developed a cloud-based guide that is capable of incorporating video from many on-line video services currently offered in the marketplace. As the proliferation of online video services grows, however, services such as DirecTV Now and potential forthcoming services such as Hulu Live, and new direct to consumer offerings, could negatively impact the growth of our video business.

Internet competition

Our residential Internet service faces competition from the phone companies’ DSL, FTTH and wireless broadband offerings as well as from a variety of companies that offer other forms of online services, including wireless and satellite-based broadband services.  Verizon’s FiOs and Frontier in certain markets acquired from Verizon, are our primary fiber-to-the-home competitor, although AT&T has also begun fiber-to-the home builds as well, including the required buildout per the FCC condition as a result of AT&T’s acquisition of DIRECTV noted above.  Given the FTTH deployments of our competitors, launches of broadband services offering 1 Gbps speed are becoming more common. Several competitors, including AT&T and Google, deliver 1 Gbps broadband speed in at least a portion of their footprints which overlap our footprint.  DSL service is often offered at prices lower than our Internet services, although typically at speeds lower than the speeds we offer.  Various wireless phone companies are now offering third and fourth generation (3G and 4G) wireless Internet services with fifth generation (5G) and faster services on the horizon, some of which offer unlimited data packages to customers. In addition, a growing number of commercial areas, such as retail malls, restaurants and airports, offer WiFi Internet service.  Numerous local governments are also considering or actively pursuing publicly subsidized WiFi Internet access networks.  These options offer alternatives to cable-based Internet access.

Voice competition

Our residential voice service competes with wireless and wireline phone providers, as well as other forms of communication, such as text messaging on cellular phones, instant messaging, social networking services, video conferencing and email.  We also compete with “over-the-top” phone providers, such as Vonage, Skype, magicJack, Google Voice and Ooma, Inc., as well as companies that sell phone cards at a cost per minute for both national and international service. The increase in the number of different technologies capable of carrying voice services and the number of alternative communication options available to customers as well as the replacement of wireline services by wireless have intensified the competitive environment in which we operate our residential voice service.

Regional Competitors

In some of our operating areas, other competitors have built networks that offer video, Internet and voice services that compete with our services. For example, in Kansas City and Austin, Texas, our residential video, Internet and voice services compete with Google Fiber services.  In addition to Google Fiber, Cincinnati Bell Inc., Hawaiian Telcom, RCN Telecom Services, LLC and WideOpenWest Finance, LLC (“WOW”), each compete with us in parts of our operating area.

Additional competition

In addition to multi-channel video providers, cable systems compete with other sources of news, information and entertainment, including over-the-air television broadcast reception, live events, movie theaters and the Internet.  Competition is also posed by satellite master antenna television systems, or SMATV systems, serving MDUs, such as condominiums, apartment complexes, and private residential communities.

Business Services

We face intense competition as to each of our business services offerings. Our small and medium business video, Internet, networking and voice services face competition from a variety of providers as described above. Our enterprise solutions also face competition from the competitors described above as well as other telecommunications carriers, such as metro and regional fiber-based carriers. We also compete with cloud, hosting and related service providers and application-service providers.

Advertising

We face intense competition for advertising revenue across many different platforms and from a wide range of local and national competitors. Advertising competition has increased and will likely continue to increase as new formats seek to attract the same advertisers. We compete for advertising revenue against, among others, local broadcast stations, national cable and broadcast networks, radio stations, print media and online advertising companies and content providers.


Security and Home Management

Our IntelligentHome service faces competition from traditional security companies, such as The ADT Corporation, service providers such as Verizon and AT&T, as well as new entrants, such as Vivint, Inc., Alarm.com, Inc. and NEST Labs, Inc. (which Google acquired in 2014).

Seasonality and Cyclicality

Our business is subject to seasonal and cyclical variations. Our results are impacted by the seasonal nature of customers receiving our cable services in college and vacation markets. Our revenue is subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. Our advertising revenue is generally higher in the second and fourth calendar quarters of each year, due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season. U.S. advertising revenue is also cyclical, benefiting in even-numbered years from advertising related to candidates running for political office and issue-oriented advertising.  Our capital expenditures and trade working capital are also subject to significant seasonality based on the timing of subscriber growth, network programs, specific projects and construction.

Regulation and Legislation

The following summary addresses the key regulatory and legislative developments affecting the cable industry and our three primary services for both residential and commercial customers: video, Internet, and voice services.  Cable system operations are extensively regulated by the federal government (primarily the FCC), certain state governments, and many local governments.  A failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to substantial penalties.  Our business can be dramatically impacted by changes to the existing regulatory framework, whether triggered by legislative, administrative, or judicial rulings.  Congress and the FCC have frequently revisited the subject of communications regulation and they are likely to do so again in the future.  We could be materially disadvantaged in the future if we are subject to new regulations or regulatory actions that do not equally impact our key competitors.  We cannot provide assurance that the already extensive regulation of our business will not be expanded in the future.   In addition, we are already subject to Charter-specific conditions regarding certain business practices as a result of the FCC’s approval of the Transactions.

Video

Service

Must Carry/Retransmission Consent

There are two alternative legal methods for carriage of local broadcast television stations on cable systems.  Federal “must carry” regulations require cable systems to carry local broadcast television stations upon the request of the local broadcaster.  Alternatively, federal law includes “retransmission consent” regulations, by which popular commercial television stations can prohibit cable carriage unless the cable operator first negotiates for “retransmission consent,” which may be conditioned on significant payments or other concessions.  Popular stations invoking “retransmission consent” have been demanding substantial compensation increases in their recent negotiations with cable operators, thereby significantly increasing our operating costs.

Additional government-mandated broadcast carriage obligations could disrupt existing programming commitments, interfere with our preferred use of limited channel capacity, and limit our ability to offer services that appeal to our customers and generate revenues.

Cable Equipment

In 1996, Congress enacted a statute requiring the FCC to adopt regulations designed to assure the development of an independent retail market for “navigation devices,” such as cable set-top boxes. As a result, the FCC required cable operators to make a separate offering of security modules (

i.e

., a “CableCARD”) that can be used with retail navigation devices. Some of the FCC’s rules requiring support for CableCARDs were vacated by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in 2013, and another of these rules was repealed by Congress in 2014, but the basic obligation to provide separable security for retail devices remains in place. In 2016, the FCC proposed to replace its CableCARD regime with burdensome new rules that would have required us to make disaggregated “information flows” available to set-top boxes and apps supplied by third parties.  That proposal was not adopted, but various parties may continue to advocate alternative regulatory approaches to reduce consumer dependency on traditional operator provided set-top boxes.  It remains uncertain whether the FCC or Congress will change the legal requirements related to our set-top boxes and what the impact of any such changes might be.


Privacy

and Information Security Regulation

The Communications Act limits our ability to collect, use, and disclose subscribers’ personally identifiable information for our video, voice, and Internet services, as well as provides requirements to safeguard such information.  We are subject to additional federal, state, and local laws and regulations that impose additional restrictions on the collection, use and disclosure of consumer, subscriber and employee information.  Further, the FCC, Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), and many states regulate and restrict the marketing practices of communications service providers, including telemarketing and online marketing efforts.  The FCC recently adopted privacy rules that contain new restrictions affecting the use of broadband and voice customer data, and various other federal agencies, including the FTC, continue to provide updated guidance on the use and protection of consumer data.

Our operations are also subject to federal and state laws governing information security, including new “reasonable” data security requirements set forth in the FCC’s recently adopted privacy rules, which will become effective on March 3, 2017.  In the event of an information security breach, such rules may require consumer and government agency notification and may result in regulatory enforcement actions with the potential of monetary forfeitures.  The FCC has recently used the existing authority under its privacy and security requirements for telecommunications services to bring enforcement actions against several companies for failing to protect customer data from unauthorized access by and disclosure to third parties, resulting in substantial monetary settlements.  Similarly, the FTC and state attorneys general regularly bring enforcement actions against companies related to information security breaches and privacy violations.  Several state legislatures are considering the adoption of new data security and cybersecurity legislation that could result in additional network and information security requirements for our business.

Various security standards provide guidance to telecommunications companies in order to help identify and mitigate cybersecurity risk. One such standard is the voluntary framework released by the National Institute for Standards and Technologies (“NIST”) in February 2014, in cooperation with other federal agencies and owners and operators of U.S. critical infrastructure.The NIST cybersecurity framework provides a prioritized and flexible model for organizations to identify and manage cyber risks inherent to their business.   It was designed to supplement, not supersede, existing cybersecurity regulations and requirements.  Several government agencies have encouraged compliance with the NIST cybersecurity framework, including the FCC, which is also considering expansion of its cybersecurity guidelines or the adoption of cybersecurity requirements.  We cannot predict what proposals may be adopted or how new legislation and regulations, if any, would affect our business.

MDUs / Inside Wiring

The FCC has adopted a series of regulations designed to spur competition to established cable operators in MDU complexes.  These regulations allow our competitors to access certain existing cable wiring inside MDUs.  The FCC also adopted regulations limiting the ability of established cable operators, like us, to enter into exclusive service contracts for MDU complexes.  In their current form, the FCC’s regulations in this area favor our competitors.

Pole Attachments

The Communications Act requires most utilities owning utility poles to provide cable systems with access to poles and conduits and simultaneously subjects the rates charged for this access to either federal or state regulation.  In 2011 and again in 2015, the FCC amended its existing pole attachment rules to promote broadband deployment.  The 2011 order allows for new penalties in certain cases involving unauthorized attachments, but generally strengthens the cable industry’s ability to access investor-owned utility poles on reasonable rates, terms, and conditions.  Additionally, the 2011 order reduces the federal rate formula previously applicable to “telecommunications” attachments to closely approximate the rate formula applicable to “cable” attachments.  The 2015 order continues the reconciliation of rates, effectively closing the remaining “loophole” that potentially allowed for significantly higher rates for telecommunications than for “cable” attachments in certain scenarios.  Utility pole owners have appealed the 2015 order.  Neither the 2011 order nor the 2015 order directly affect the rate in states that self-regulate (rather than allow the FCC to regulate pole rates), but many of those states have substantially the same rate for cable and telecommunications attachments.

Although the 2011 and 2015 orders do not impact the status quo treatment of cable-provided VoIP service as an unclassified service eligible for the favorable cable rate, the issue has not been fully resolved by the FCC, and a potential change in classification in a pending proceeding could adversely impact our pole attachment rates in states or for periods of time in which the cable rate is or was lower than the telecommunications rate.  Additionally, although the FCC’s 2015 reclassification of broadband Internet access as a telecommunications service also set forth the FCC’s intention that pole rates not increase as result.  That reclassification ruling could adversely impact our pole attachment rates in states or for periods of time in which the cable rate is or was lower than the telecommunications rate.


Cable Rate Regulation

Federal law strictly limits the potential scope of cable rate regulation.  Pursuant to federal law, all video offerings are universally exempt from rate regulation, except for a cable system’s minimum level of video programming service, referred to as “basic service,” and associated equipment.  Rate regulation of basic service and associated equipment operates pursuant to a federal formula, with local governments, commonly referred to as local franchising authorities, primarily responsible for administering this regulation.  The majority of our local franchising authorities have never certified to regulate basic service cable rates.  In 2015, the FCC adopted an order (which is now under appeal) reversing its historic approach to rate regulation certifications and requiring a local franchise authority interested in regulating cable rates to first make an affirmative showing that there is no “effective competition” (as defined under federal law)  in the community.  Very few local franchise authorities have filed the necessary rate regulation certification, and the FCC’s 2015 order should make it more difficult for such entities to assert rate regulation in the future.

There have been calls to impose expanded rate regulation on the cable industry.  Confronted with rapidly increasing cable programming costs, it is possible that Congress may adopt new constraints on the retail pricing or packaging of cable programming.  Any such constraints could adversely affect our operations.

Ownership Restrictions

Federal regulation of the communications field traditionally included a host of ownership restrictions, which limited the size of certain media entities and restricted their ability to enter into competing enterprises.  Through a series of legislative, regulatory, and judicial actions, most of these restrictions have been either eliminated or substantially relaxed.  Changes in this regulatory area could alter the business environment in which we operate.

Access Channels

Local franchise agreements often require cable operators to set aside certain channels for public, educational, and governmental access programming.  Federal law also requires cable systems to designate up to 15% of their channel capacity for commercial leased access by unaffiliated third parties, who may offer programming that our customers do not particularly desire.  The FCC adopted revised rules in 2007 mandating a significant reduction in the rates that operators can charge commercial leased access users and imposing additional administrative requirements that would be burdensome on the cable industry.  The effect of the FCC’s revised rules was stayed by a federal court, pending a cable industry appeal and an adverse finding by the Office of Management and Budget.  Although commercial leased access activity historically has been relatively limited, increased activity in this area could further burden the channel capacity of our cable systems.

Other FCC Regulatory Matters

FCC regulations cover a variety of additional areas, including, among other things: (1) equal employment opportunity obligations; (2) customer service standards; (3) technical service standards; (4) mandatory blackouts of certain network and syndicated programming; (5) restrictions on political advertising; (6) restrictions on advertising in children’s programming; (7) licensing of systems and facilities; (8) maintenance of public files; (9) emergency alert systems; and (10) disability access, including new requirements governing video-description and closed-captioning.  Each of these regulations restricts our business practices to varying degrees and may impose additional costs on our operations.

It is possible that Congress or the FCC will expand or modify its regulation of cable systems in the future, and we cannot predict at this time how that might impact our business.

Copyright

Cable systems are subject to a federal copyright compulsory license covering carriage of television and radio broadcast signals.  The possible modification or elimination of this compulsory copyright license is the subject of continuing legislative proposals and administrative review and could adversely affect our ability to obtain desired broadcast programming.

Copyright clearances for non-broadcast programming services are arranged through private negotiations.  Cable operators also must obtain music rights for locally originated programming and advertising from the major music performing rights organizations.  These licensing fees have been the source of litigation in the past, and we cannot predict with certainty whether license fee disputes may arise in the future.


Franchise Matters

Our cable systems generally are operated pursuant to nonexclusive franchises, permits, and similar authorizations granted by a municipality or other state or local government entity in order to utilize and cross public rights-of-way.  Cable franchises generally are granted for fixed terms and in many cases include monetary penalties for noncompliance and may be terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions.  The specific terms and conditions of cable franchises vary significantly between jurisdictions.  Cable franchises generally contain provisions governing cable operations, franchise fees, system construction, maintenance, technical performance, customer service standards, supporting and carrying public access channels, and changes in the ownership of the franchisee.  A number of states subject cable systems to the jurisdiction of centralized state government agencies, such as public utility commissions.  Although local franchising authorities have considerable discretion in establishing franchise terms, certain federal protections benefit cable operators.  For example, federal law caps local franchise fees.

Prior to the scheduled expiration of our franchises, we generally initiate renewal proceedings with the granting authorities.  The Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”), which is the primary federal statute regulating interstate communications,  provides for an orderly franchise renewal process in which granting authorities may not unreasonably withhold renewals.  In connection with the franchise renewal process, however, many governmental authorities require the cable operator to make additional costly commitments.   Historically, we have been able to renew our franchises without incurring significant costs, although any particular franchise may not be renewed on commercially favorable terms or otherwise.  If we fail to obtain renewals of franchises representing a significant number of our customers, it could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or our liquidity, including our ability to comply with our debt covenants.  Similarly, if a local franchising authority’s consent is required for the purchase or sale of a cable system, the local franchising authority may attempt to impose more burdensome requirements as a condition for providing its consent.

The traditional cable franchising regime has undergone significant change as a result of various federal and state actions.  The FCC has adopted rules that streamline entry for new competitors (particularly those affiliated with telephone companies) and reduce certain franchising burdens for these new entrants.  The FCC adopted more modest relief for existing cable operators.

At the same time, a substantial number of states have adopted new franchising laws.  Again, these laws were principally designed to streamline entry for new competitors, and they often provide advantages for these new entrants that are not immediately available to existing cable operators.  In many instances, these franchising regimes do not apply to established cable operators until the existing franchise expires or a competitor directly enters the franchise territory.  The exact nature of these state franchising laws, and their varying application to new and existing video providers, will impact our franchising obligations and our competitive position.

Internet Service

FCC regulations subject broadband Internet access services to certain regulations intended to ensure that end users can send and receive lawful Internet content without discrimination by Internet service providers such as us.  Under these rules, providers of broadband Internet access service are not permitted to block access to, or restrict data rates for downloading, lawful content or ban the attachment of non-harmful devices to our service except to the extent required by reasonable network management practices.  Internet service providers are also not permitted to give special priority to the transmission of content from our affiliates or accept payment from third parties to give special priority their content.  Furthermore, Internet service providers are subject to a general obligation not to take actions that unreasonably interfere with the ability of end users (such as our subscribers) and edge providers (such as web sites) to exchange data with each other.  The FCC has also stated that it will investigate problems that may arise regarding interconnection of the networks of retail broadband Internet access providers with “upstream” providers of Internet connectivity.  In addition, the FCC rules require that we meet certain “transparency” obligations, i.e., that we disclose material technical and other terms and conditions applicable to our Internet service.  These FCC regulations were upheld by the D.C. Circuit in June 2016, but remain subject to additional appeals.  We cannot predict how those ongoing appeals will be resolved.  Moreover, it is possible that Congress or the FCC will modify or repeal the existing regulations.

We cannot predict how the FCC will enforce its regulations in particular cases or whether in the future the FCC may seek to expand the scope of its regulatory obligations on Internet access service providers.  In addition to the regulatory obligations noted above, providers of broadband Internet access service are obliged by the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) to configure their networks in a manner that facilitates the ability of law enforcement, with proper legal authorization, to obtain information about our customers, including the content of their Internet communications  The FCC and Congress also are considering subjecting Internet access services to the Universal Service funding requirements.  These funding requirements could impose significant new costs on our Internet service.  Also, the FCC and some state regulatory commissions direct certain subsidies to telephone companies deploying broadband to areas deemed to be “unserved” or “underserved.”  We have opposed such subsidies when directed to areas that we serve.  Despite our efforts, future subsidies may be directed to areas served by us, which could


result in subsidized competitors operating in our service territories.  State and local governmental organizations have also adopted Internet-related regulations.  These various governmental jurisdictions are also considering additional regulations in these and other areas, such as privacy, pricing, service and product quality, and taxation.  The adoption of new Internet regulations or the adaptation of existing laws to the Internet could adversely affect our business.

Aside from the FCC’s generally applicable regulations, we have made certain commitments to comply with the FCC’s order in connection with the FCC’s approval of the TWC Transaction and the Bright House Transaction (discussed above).

The FCC is considering whether online video distributors (“OVDs”) that offer programming to customers with a broadband Internet connection should be classified as multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), and thereby subject to the program access protections available to MVPDs, as well as some of the regulatory requirements applicable to MVPDs.  The outcome of this proceeding, which could impact how OVDs compete in the future with traditional cable service, cannot be determined at the current time.

Voice Service

The Telecommunications Act of 1996 created a more favorable regulatory environment for us to provide telecommunications and/or competitive voice services than had previously existed.  In particular, it established requirements ensuring that competitive telephone companies could interconnect their networks with those providers of traditional telecommunications services to open the market to competition.  The FCC has subsequently ruled that competitive telephone companies that support VoIP services, such as those we offer our customers, are entitled to interconnection with incumbent providers of traditional telecommunications services, which ensures that our VoIP services can compete in the market.  Since that time, the FCC has initiated a proceeding to determine whether such interconnection rights should extend to traditional and competitive networks utilizing IP technology, and how to encourage the transition to IP networks throughout the industry.  New rules or obligations arising from these proceedings may affect our ability to compete in the provision of voice services.

The FCC has collected extensive data from providers of point to point transport (“special access”) services, such as us, and the FCC may use that data to evaluate whether the market for such services is competitive, or whether the market should be subject to further regulation, which may increase our costs or constrain our ability to compete in this market.  The FCC also recently selected a new national local number portability administrator, and the change to that new administrator may adversely impact our ability to manage number porting and related tasks.

Further regulatory changes are being considered that could impact our voice business and that of our primary telecommunications competitors.  The FCC and state regulatory authorities are considering, for example, whether certain common carrier regulations traditionally applied to incumbent local exchange carriers should be modified or reduced, and the extent to which common carrier requirements should be extended to VoIP providers.  The FCC has already determined that certain providers of voice services using Internet Protocol technology must comply with requirements relating to 911 emergency services (“E911”), the CALEA (the statute governing law enforcement access to and surveillance of communications), Universal Service Fund contributions, customer privacy and Customer Proprietary Network Information issues, number portability, network outage reporting, rural call completion, disability access, regulatory fees, and discontinuance of service.  In November 2014, the FCC adopted an order imposing limited back-up power obligations on providers of facilities-based fixed, residential voice services that are not otherwise line-powered, including our VoIP services.  This order became effective in February 2016 and requires us to disclose certain information to customers and to make back-up power available at the point of sale.  In March 2007, a federal appeals court affirmed the FCC’s decision concerning federal regulation of certain VoIP services, but declined to specifically find that VoIP service provided by cable companies, such as we provide, should be regulated only at the federal level.  As a result, some states have begun proceedings to subject cable VoIP services to state level regulation, and at least one state has asserted jurisdiction over our VoIP services.  We have filed a legal challenge to that state’s assertion of jurisdiction, which is now pending before a federal district court in Minnesota.  Although we have registered with, or obtained certificates or authorizations from the FCC and the state regulatory authorities in those states in which we offer competitive voice services in order to ensure the continuity of our services and to maintain needed network interconnection arrangements, it is unclear whether and how these and other ongoing regulatory matters ultimately will be resolved.


Transaction-Related Commitments

In connection with approval of the Transactions, federal and state regulators imposed a number of post-merger conditions on us including but not limited to the following.

FCC Conditions

•

Offer settlement-free Internet interconnection to any party that meets the requirements of our Interconnection Policy (available on Charter’s website) on terms generally consistent with the policy for seven years (with a possible reduction to five);

•

Deploy and offer high-speed broadband Internet access service to an additional two million locations over five years, at least one million of which must be in areas outside our footprint that face competition from another high-speed Internet provider;

•

Refrain from charging usage-based prices or imposing data caps on any fixed mass market broadband Internet access service plans for seven years (with a possible reduction to five);

•

Offer 30/4 Mbps discounted broadband where technically feasible to eligible customers throughout our service area for four years from the offer’s commencement; and

•

Continue to provide CableCARDs to any new or existing customer upon request for use in third-party retail devices for four years-and continue to support such CableCARDs for seven years (in each case, unless the FCC changes the relevant rules).

The FCC conditions also contain a number of compliance reporting requirements.

DOJ Conditions

The Department of Justice (“DOJ”) Order prohibits us from entering into or enforcing any agreement with a video programmer that forbids, limits or creates incentives to limit the video programmer’s provision of content to OVDs.  We will not be able to avail ourself of other distributors’ most favored nation (“MFN”) provisions if they are inconsistent with this prohibition.  The DOJ’s conditions are effective for seven years, although we may petition the DOJ to eliminate the conditions after five years.

State Conditions

Certain state regulators, including California, New York, Hawaii and New Jersey also imposed conditions in connection with the approval of the Transactions.  These conditions include requirements related to:

•

Upgrading networks within the designated state, including upgrades to broadband speeds and conversion of all households served within California and New York to an all-digital platform;

•

Building out our network to households and business locations that are not currently served by cable within the designated states;

•

Offering LifeLine service discounts and low-income broadband to eligible households served within the applicable states;

•

Investing in service improvement programs and customer service enhancements and maintaining customer-facing jobs within the designated state;

•

Continuing to make legacy service offerings available, including allowing Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House customers to maintain their existing service offerings for a period of three years; and

•

Complying with reporting requirements.

Employees

As of

December 31, 2016

, we had approximately 91,500 active full-time equivalent employees.  At

December 31, 2016

, approximately 2,500 of our employees were represented by collective bargaining agreements.  We believe we have good relations with our employees including those represented by collective bargaining agreements.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors.

Risks Related to the Integration of the Transactions

If we are not able to successfully integrate our business with that of Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated cost savings and other benefits of the Transactions may not be realized fully, or at all, or


may take longer to realize than expected. In such circumstance, we may not perform as expected and the value of Charter's Class A common stock may be adversely affected.

Until the closing of the Transactions, Legacy Charter, Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House operated independently, and there can be no assurances that their businesses can be integrated successfully. We now have significantly more systems, assets, investments, businesses, customers and employees than each company did prior to the Transactions. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key Charter employees, the loss of customers, the disruption of our ongoing businesses or in unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and an overall post-completion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated. The process of integrating Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House with the Legacy Charter operations will require significant capital expenditures and the expansion of certain operations and operating and financial systems. Management will be required to devote a significant amount of time and attention to the integration process and there is a significant degree of difficulty and management involvement inherent in that process. These difficulties include:

•

integrating the companies’ operations and corporate functions;

•

integrating the companies’ technologies, networks and customer service platforms;

•

integrating and unifying the product offerings and services available to customers, including customer premise equipment and video user interfaces;

•

harmonizing the companies’ operating practices, employee development and compensation programs, internal controls and other policies, procedures and processes;

•

maintaining existing relationships and agreements with customers, providers, programmers and other vendors and avoiding delays in entering into new agreements with prospective customers, providers and vendors;

•

addressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies;

•

consolidating the companies’ administrative and information technology infrastructure;

•

coordinating programming and marketing efforts;

•

coordinating geographically dispersed organizations;

•

integrating information, purchasing, provisioning, accounting, finance, sales, billing, payroll, reporting and regulatory compliance systems;

•

completing the conversion of analog systems to all-digital for the Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House systems; and

•

attracting and retaining the necessary personnel associated with the acquired assets.

Even if the new businesses are successfully integrated, it may not be possible to realize the benefits that are expected to result from the Transactions, or realize these benefits within the time frame that is expected. For example, the elimination of duplicative costs may not be possible or may take longer than anticipated, or the benefits from the Transactions may be offset by costs incurred or delays in integrating the businesses and increased operating costs. If the combined company fails to realize the anticipated benefits from the transactions, our liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and/or share price may be adversely affected. In addition, at times, the attention of certain members of our management and resources may be focused on the integration of the businesses and diverted from day-to-day business operations, which may disrupt the business of the combined company.

If the operating results of Legacy TWC and/or Legacy Bright House are less than our expectations, or an increase in the capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain those assets as well as to keep pace with technological developments are greater than expected, we may not achieve the expected level of financial results from the Transactions.

We will derive a portion of our continuing revenues and earnings per share from the operations of Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House. Therefore, any negative impact on these companies or the operating results derived from such companies could harm the combined company’s operating results.

Our business and the businesses of Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House are characterized by rapid technological change and the introduction of new products and services. We intend to make investments in the combined business and transition toward only using two-way all-digital set-top boxes. The increase in capital expenditures necessary for the transition toward two-way set-top boxes in the business may negatively impact the expected financial results from the Transactions. The combined company may not be able to fund the capital expenditures necessary to keep pace with technological developments, execute the plans to do so, or anticipate the demand of its customers for products and services requiring new technology or bandwidth. Our inability to maintain, expand and upgrade our existing or combined businesses could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

The Transactions were accounted for as an acquisition in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House have been recorded, as of the date of completion of the Transactions, at their respective fair values and added to our assets and liabilities.


The excess of the purchase price over those fair values has been recorded as goodwill. To the extent the value of goodwill or intangibles becomes impaired, we may be required to incur material charges relating to such impairment. Such a potential impairment charge could have a material impact on our operating results.

As a result of the closing of the Transactions, our businesses are subject to the conditions set forth in the FCC Order and the DOJ Consent Decree and those imposed by state utility commissions and local franchise authorities, and there can be no assurance that these conditions will not have an adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations.

In connection with the Transactions, the FCC Order, the DOJ Consent Decree, and the approvals from state utility commissions and local franchise authorities incorporated numerous commitments and voluntary conditions made by the parties and imposed numerous conditions on our businesses relating to the operation of our business and other matters. Among other things, (i) we will not be permitted to charge usage-based prices or impose data caps and will be prohibited from charging interconnection fees for qualifying parties; (ii) we will be prohibited from entering into or enforcing any agreement with a programmer that forbids, limits or creates incentives to limit the programmer’s provision of content to OVD and cannot retaliate against programmers for licensing to OVDs; (iii) we will not be able to avail ourself of other distributors’ most favored nation (“MFN”) provisions if they are inconsistent with this prohibition; (iv) we must undertake a number of actions designed to promote diversity; (v) we must appoint an independent compliance monitor and comply with a broad array of reporting requirements; and (v) we must satisfy various other conditions relating to our Internet services, including building out an additional two million locations with access to a high-speed connection of at least 60 megabits per second with at least one million of those connections in competition with another high-speed broadband provider in the market served, and implementing a reduced price high-speed Internet program for low income families. These and other conditions and commitments relating to the Transactions are of varying duration, ranging from three to seven years. In light of the breadth and duration of the conditions and potential changes in market conditions during the time the conditions and commitments are in effect, there can be no assurance that our compliance, and ability to comply, with the conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.

Risks Related to Our Indebtedness

We have a significant amount of debt and may incur significant additional debt, including secured debt, in the future, which could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to react to changes in our business.

We have a significant amount of debt and may (subject to applicable restrictions in our debt instruments) incur additional debt in the future. As of

December 31, 2016

, our total principal amount of debt was approximately

$60.0 billion

.

Our significant amount of debt could have consequences, such as:

•

impact our ability to raise additional capital at reasonable rates, or at all;

•

make us vulnerable to interest rate increases, in part because approximately

13%

of our borrowings as of

December 31, 2016

were, and may continue to be, subject to variable rates of interest;

•

expose us to increased interest expense to the extent we refinance existing debt with higher cost debt;

•

require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operating activities to make payments on our debt, reducing our funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate expenses;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the cable and telecommunications industries, and the economy at large;

•

place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have proportionately less debt; and

•

adversely affect our relationship with customers and suppliers.

If current debt amounts increase, our business results are lower than expected, or credit rating agencies downgrade our debt limiting our access to investment grade markets, the related risks that we now face will intensify.

The agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business, as well as significantly affect our liquidity.

Our credit facilities and the indentures governing our debt contain a number of significant covenants that could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, our liquidity, and our results of operations. These covenants restrict, among other things, our and our subsidiaries’ ability to:

•

incur additional debt;

•

repurchase or redeem equity interests and debt;

•

issue equity;


•

make certain investments or acquisitions;

•

pay dividends or make other distributions;

•

dispose of assets or merge;

•

enter into related party transactions; and

•

grant liens and pledge assets.

Additionally, the Charter Operating credit facilities require Charter Operating to comply with a maximum total leverage covenant and a maximum first lien leverage covenant. The breach of any covenants or obligations in our indentures or credit facilities, not otherwise waived or amended, could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations, which in turn could trigger cross defaults under other agreements governing our long-term indebtedness. In addition, the secured lenders under our notes and the Charter Operating credit facilities could foreclose on their collateral, which includes equity interests in our subsidiaries, and exercise other rights of secured creditors.

We depend on generating sufficient cash flow to fund our debt obligations, capital expenditures, and ongoing operations.

We are dependent on our cash on hand and cash flow from operations to fund our debt obligations, capital expenditures and ongoing operations.  Our ability to service our debt and to fund our planned capital expenditures and ongoing operations will depend on our ability to continue to generate cash flow and our access (by dividend or otherwise) to additional liquidity sources at the applicable obligor. Our ability to continue to generate cash flow is dependent on many factors, including:

•

our ability to sustain and grow revenues and cash flow from operations by offering video, Internet, voice, advertising and other services to residential and commercial customers, to adequately meet the customer experience demands in our markets and to maintain and grow our customer base, particularly in the face of increasingly aggressive competition, the need for innovation and the related capital expenditures;

•

the impact of competition from other market participants, including but not limited to incumbent telephone companies, direct broadcast satellite operators, wireless broadband and telephone providers, DSL providers, video provided over the Internet and providers of advertising over the Internet;

•

general business conditions, economic uncertainty or downturn, high unemployment levels and the level of activity in the housing sector;

•

our ability to obtain programming at reasonable prices or to raise prices to offset, in whole or in part, the effects of higher programming costs (including retransmission consents);

•

the development and deployment of new products and technologies including our cloud-based user interface, Spectrum Guide®;

•

the effects of governmental regulation on our business or potential business combination transactions; and

•

any events that disrupt our networks, information systems or properties and impair our operating activities and negatively impact our reputation.

Some of these factors are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or we are unable to access additional liquidity sources, we may not be able to service and repay our debt, operate our business, respond to competitive challenges, or fund our other liquidity and capital needs.

Restrictions in our subsidiaries’ debt instruments and under applicable law limit their ability to provide funds to us and our subsidiaries that are debt issuers.

Our primary assets are our equity interests in our subsidiaries. Our operating subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and are not obligated to make funds available to their debt issuer holding companies for payments on our notes or other obligations in the form of loans, distributions, or otherwise. Charter Operating’s ability to make distributions to Charter or CCO Holdings, our other primary debt issuers other than TWC, LLC and TWCE, to service debt obligations is subject to its compliance with the terms of its credit facilities, and restrictions under applicable law. TWC, LLC’s and TWCE’s ability to make distributions to Charter, CCO Holdings or Charter Operating to service debt obligations is subject to restrictions under applicable law. See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”  Under the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (the “Act”), our subsidiaries may only make distributions if the relevant entity has “surplus” as defined in the Act. Under fraudulent transfer laws, our subsidiaries may not pay dividends if the relevant entity is insolvent or is rendered insolvent thereby. The measures of insolvency for purposes of these fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if:

•

the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all its assets;


•

the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or

•

it could not pay its debts as they became due.

We believe that our relevant subsidiaries currently have surplus and are not insolvent, however, these subsidiaries may become insolvent in the future. Our direct or indirect subsidiaries include the borrowers and guarantors under the Charter Operating credit facilities and notes, under the CCO Holdings notes and under the TWC, LLC and TWCE notes. As of

December 31, 2016

, our total principal amount of debt was approximately

$60.0 billion

.

In the event of bankruptcy, liquidation, or dissolution of one or more of our subsidiaries, that subsidiary’s assets would first be applied to satisfy its own obligations, and following such payments, such subsidiary may not have sufficient assets remaining to make payments to its parent company as an equity holder or otherwise. In that event, the lenders under Charter Operating’s credit facilities and notes and any other indebtedness of our subsidiaries whose interests are secured by substantially all of our operating assets, and all holders of other debt of Charter Operating, CCO Holdings, TWC, LLC and TWCE will have the right to be paid in full before us from any of our subsidiaries’ assets.

Some of our outstanding debt is subject to change of control provisions. We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to fulfill our obligations under our indebtedness following a change of control, which would place us in default under the applicable debt instruments.

We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to fulfill our obligations under our notes and our credit facilities following a change of control. Under the indentures governing the CCO Holdings’ notes, upon the occurrence of specified change of control events, the debt issuer is required to offer to repurchase all of its outstanding notes. However, we may not have sufficient access to funds at the time of the change of control event to make the required repurchase of the applicable notes, and Charter Operating is limited in its ability to make distributions or other payments to any debt issuer to fund any required repurchase. In addition, a change of control under the Charter Operating credit facilities would result in a default under those credit facilities, which would trigger a default under the indentures governing the CCO Holdings’ notes, the Charter Operating notes and the TWC, LLC and TWCE notes. Because such credit facilities and notes are obligations of Charter Operating and its subsidiaries, the credit facilities would have to be repaid before Charter Operating’s assets could be available to CCO Holdings to repurchase their notes. Any failure to make or complete a change of control offer would place CCO Holdings in default under their notes. The failure of our subsidiaries to make a change of control offer or repay the amounts accelerated under their notes and credit facilities would place them in default under such agreements.

Risks Related to Our Business

We operate in a very competitive business environment, which affects our ability to attract and retain customers and can adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.

The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and has become more so in recent years. In some instances, we compete against companies with fewer regulatory burdens, better access to financing, greater personnel resources, greater resources for marketing, greater and more favorable brand name recognition, and long-established relationships with regulatory authorities and customers. Increasing consolidation in the cable industry and the repeal of certain ownership rules have provided additional benefits to certain of our competitors, either through access to financing, resources, or efficiencies of scale.

Our residential video service faces competition from a number of sources, including direct broadcast satellite services, as well as other companies that deliver movies, television shows and other video programming over broadband Internet connections to TVs, computers, tablets and mobile devices. Our residential Internet service faces competition from the phone companies’ DSL, FTTH and wireless broadband offerings as well as from a variety of companies that offer other forms of online services, including wireless and satellite-based broadband services. Our residential voice service competes with wireless and wireline phone providers, as well as other forms of communication, such as text messaging on cellular phones, instant messaging, social networking services, video conferencing and email. Competition from these companies, including intensive marketing efforts with aggressive pricing, exclusive programming and increased HD broadcasting may have an adverse impact on our ability to attract and retain customers.

Overbuilds could also adversely affect our growth, financial condition, and results of operations, by creating or increasing competition. We are aware of traditional overbuild situations impacting certain of our markets, however, we are unable to predict the extent to which additional overbuild situations may occur.

Our services may not allow us to compete effectively. Competition may reduce our expected growth of future cash flows which may contribute to future impairments of our franchises and goodwill and our ability to meet cash flow requirements, including


debt service requirements.  For additional information regarding the competition we face, see “Business —Competition” and “—Regulation and Legislation.”

We face risks relating to competition for the leisure time and discretionary spending of audiences, which has intensified in part due to advances in technology and changes in consumer expectations and behavior.

In addition to the various competitive factors discussed above, we are subject to risks relating to increasing competition for the leisure time, shifting consumer needs and discretionary spending of consumers. We compete with all other sources of entertainment, news and information delivery, as well as a broad range of communications products and services. Technological advancements, such as new video formats and Internet streaming and downloading of programming that can be viewed on televisions, computers, smartphones and tablets, many of which have been beneficial to us, have nonetheless increased the number of entertainment and information delivery choices available to consumers and intensified the challenges posed by audience fragmentation.

Newer products and services, particularly alternative methods for the distribution, sale and viewing of content will likely continue to be developed, further increasing the number of competitors that we face. The increasing number of choices available to audiences, including low-cost or free choices, could negatively impact not only consumer demand for our products and services, but also advertisers’ willingness to purchase advertising from us. We compete for the sale of advertising revenue with television networks and stations, as well as other advertising platforms, such as radio, print and, increasingly, online media. Our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to new technologies and changes in consumer expectations and behavior could significantly adversely affect our competitive position and our business and results of operations.

Our exposure to the economic conditions of our current and potential customers, vendors and third parties could adversely affect our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.

We are exposed to risks associated with the economic conditions of our current and potential customers, the potential financial instability of our customers and their financial ability to purchase our products. If there were a general economic downturn, we may experience increased cancellations by our customers or unfavorable changes in the mix of products purchased, including an increase in the number of homes that replace their video service with Internet-delivered and/or over-air content, which would negatively impact our ability to attract customers, increase rates and maintain or increase revenue.  In addition, providing video services is an established and highly penetrated business.  Our ability to gain new video subscribers is dependent to a large extent on growth in occupied housing in our service areas, which is influenced by both national and local economic conditions.  Weak economic conditions may also have a negative impact on our advertising revenue. These events have adversely affected us in the past, and may adversely affect our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition if a downturn were to occur.

In addition, we are susceptible to risks associated with the potential financial instability of the vendors and third parties on which we rely to provide products and services or to which we outsource certain functions. The same economic conditions that may affect our customers, as well as volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets, also could adversely affect vendors and third parties and lead to significant increases in prices, reduction in output or the bankruptcy of our vendors or third parties upon which we rely. Any interruption in the services provided by our vendors or by third parties could adversely affect our cash flow, results of operation and financial condition.

We face risks inherent in our commercial business.

We may encounter unforeseen difficulties as we increase the scale of our service offerings to businesses. We sell Internet access, data networking and fiber connectivity to cellular towers and office buildings, video and business voice services to businesses and have increased our focus on growing this business. In order to grow our commercial business, we expect to continue investment in technology, equipment and personnel focused on the commercial business. Commercial business customers often require service level agreements and generally have heightened customer expectations for reliability of services. If our efforts to build the infrastructure to scale the commercial business are not successful, the growth of our commercial services business would be limited. We depend on interconnection and related services provided by certain third parties for the growth of our commercial business. As a result, our ability to implement changes as the services grow may be limited. If we are unable to meet these service level requirements or expectations, our commercial business could be adversely affected. Finally, we expect advances in communications technology, as well as changes in the marketplace and the regulatory and legislative environment. Consequently, we are unable to predict the effect that ongoing or future developments in these areas might have on our voice and commercial businesses and operations.


Programming costs are rising at a much faster rate than wages or inflation, and we may not have the ability to reduce or moderate the growth rates of, or pass on to our customers, our increasing programming costs, which would adversely affect our cash flow and operating margins.

Video programming has been, and is expected to continue to be, our largest operating expense item. In recent years, the cable industry has experienced a rapid escalation in the cost of programming. We expect programming costs to continue to increase because of a variety of factors including amounts paid for broadcast station retransmission consent, annual increases imposed by programmers and carriage of incremental programming, including new services and VOD programming. The inability to fully pass programming cost increases on to our customers has had, and is expected in the future to have, an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating margins associated with the video product. We have programming contracts that have expired and others that will expire at or before the end of 2017. There can be no assurance that these agreements will be renewed on favorable or comparable terms. Three programmers have filed lawsuits against us regarding which legacy programming arrangements apply after the closing of the Transactions, and there can be no assurance that other programmers will not bring similar suits in the future.  In addition, a number of programmers have begun to sell their services through alternative distribution channels which may cause those programmers to seek even higher programming fees from us as this may degrade security of their product, increase their operating costs or reduce their advertising revenue.  To the extent that we are unable to reach agreement with certain programmers on terms that we believe are reasonable, we have been, and may be in the future, forced to remove such programming channels from our line-up, which may result in a loss of customers. Our failure to carry programming that is attractive to our subscribers could adversely impact our customer levels, operations and financial results. In addition, if our Internet customers are unable to access desirable content online because content providers block or limit access by our subscribers as a class, our ability to gain and retain customers, especially Internet customers, may be negatively impacted.

Increased demands by owners of some broadcast stations for carriage of other services or payments to those broadcasters for retransmission consent are likely to further increase our programming costs. Federal law allows commercial television broadcast stations to make an election between “must-carry” rights and an alternative “retransmission-consent” regime. When a station opts for the retransmission consent regime, we are not allowed to carry the station’s signal without the station’s permission. In some cases, we carry stations under short-term arrangements while we attempt to negotiate new long-term retransmission agreements. If negotiations with these programmers prove unsuccessful, they could require us to cease carrying their signals, possibly for an indefinite period. Any loss of stations could make our video service less attractive to customers, which could result in less subscription and advertising revenue. In retransmission-consent negotiations, broadcasters often condition consent with respect to one station on carriage of one or more other stations or programming services in which they or their affiliates have an interest. Carriage of these other services, as well as increased fees for retransmission rights, may increase our programming expenses and diminish the amount of capacity we have available to introduce new services, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.

Our inability to respond to technological developments and meet customer demand for new products and services could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively.

We operate in a highly competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environment. Our success is, to a large extent, dependent on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt, upgrade and exploit new and existing technologies to address consumers’ changing demands and distinguish our services from those of our competitors. We may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new products and services. If we choose technologies or equipment that are less effective, cost-efficient or attractive to customers than those chosen by our competitors, if we offer services that fail to appeal to consumers, are not available at competitive prices or that do not function as expected, or we are not able to fund the expenditures necessary to keep pace with technological developments, our competitive position could deteriorate, and our business and financial results could suffer.

The ability of some of our competitors to introduce new technologies, products and services more quickly than we do may adversely affect our competitive position. Furthermore, advances in technology, decreases in the cost of existing technologies or changes in competitors’ product and service offerings may require us in the future to make additional research and development expenditures or to offer at no additional charge or at a lower price certain products and services that we currently offer to customers separately or at a premium. In addition, the uncertainty of our ability, and the costs, to obtain intellectual property rights from third parties could impact our ability to respond to technological advances in a timely and effective manner.

The implementation of our network-based user interface, Spectrum Guide may ultimately be unsuccessful or more expensive than anticipated. Our inability to maintain and expand our upgraded systems and provide advanced services such as a state of the art user interface in a timely manner, or to anticipate the demands of the marketplace, could materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers. Consequently, our growth, financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially.


We depend on third party service providers, suppliers and licensors; thus, if we are unable to procure the necessary services, equipment, software or licenses on reasonable terms and on a timely basis, our ability to offer services could be impaired, and our growth, operations, business, financial results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

We depend on a limited number of third party service providers, suppliers and licensors to supply some of the services, hardware, software and operational support necessary to provide some of our services. Some of our hardware, software and operational support vendors, and service providers represent our sole source of supply or have, either through contract or as a result of intellectual property rights, a position of some exclusivity. If any of these parties breaches or terminates its agreement with us or otherwise fails to perform its obligations in a timely manner,  demand exceeds these vendors’ capacity, they experience operating or financial difficulties, they significantly increase the amount we pay for necessary products or services, or they cease production of any necessary product due to lack of demand, profitability or a change in ownership or are otherwise unable to provide the equipment or services we need in a timely manner, at our specifications and at reasonable prices, our ability to provide some services might be materially adversely affected, or the need to procure or develop alternative sources of the affected materials or services might delay our ability to serve our customers. In addition, the existence of only a limited number of vendors of key technologies can lead to less product innovation and higher costs. These events could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain and attract customers and our operations, business, financial results and financial condition.

Our cable systems have historically been restricted to using one of two proprietary conditional access security systems, which we believe has limited the number of manufacturers producing set-top boxes for such systems. As an alternative, we developed a new conditional access security system which can be downloaded into set-top boxes with features we specify that could be provided by a variety of manufacturers. We refer to our specified set-top box as our Worldbox.  Additionally, we are developing technology to allow our two current proprietary conditional access security systems to be software downloadable into our Worldbox. In order to realize the broadest benefits of our Worldbox technology, we must now complete the support for the downloadable proprietary conditional access security systems within the Worldbox. We cannot provide assurances that this implementation will ultimately be successful or completed in the expected timeframe or at the expected budget.

Our business may be adversely affected if we cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our business depends.

We rely on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and licenses and other agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other parties to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights in technology and the products and services used in our operations. Also, because of the rapid pace of technological change, we both develop our own technologies, products and services and rely on technologies developed or licensed by third parties. However, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged or invalidated, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current industry trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages, which could result in costly redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product or service offerings or other competitive harm. We may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from these third parties on reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question, which could require us to change our business practices or offerings and limit our ability to compete effectively. Even unsuccessful claims can be time-consuming and costly to defend and may divert management’s attention and resources away from our business. In recent years, the number of intellectual property infringement claims has been increasing in the communications and entertainment industries, and, with increasing frequency, we are party to litigation alleging that certain of our services or technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others.

Various events could disrupt our networks, information systems or properties and could impair our operating activities and negatively impact our reputation and financial results.

Network and information systems technologies are critical to our operating activities, both for our internal uses, such as network management and supplying services to our customers, including customer service operations and programming delivery. Network or information system shutdowns or other service disruptions caused by events such as computer hacking, dissemination of computer viruses, worms and other destructive or disruptive software, “cyber attacks,” process breakdowns, denial of service attacks and other malicious activity pose increasing risks.  Both unsuccessful and successful “cyber attacks” on companies have continued to increase in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. While we develop and maintain systems seeking to prevent systems-related events and security breaches from occurring, the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as techniques used in such attacks become more sophisticated and change frequently. We, and the third parties on which we rely, may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures.  While from time to time attempts have been made to access our network, these attempts have not as yet resulted in any material release of information, degradation or disruption to our network and information systems.


Our network and information systems are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, accidents, natural disasters (including extreme weather arising from short-term or any long-term changes in weather patterns), terrorist attacks and similar events. Further, the impacts associated with extreme weather or long-term changes in weather patterns, such as rising sea levels or increased and intensified storm activity, may cause increased business interruptions or may require the relocation of some of our facilities. Our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities.

Any of these events, if directed at, or experienced by, us or technologies upon which we depend,  could have adverse consequences on our network, our customers and our business, including degradation of service, service disruption, excessive call volume to call centers, and damage to our or our customers’ equipment and data.  Large expenditures may be necessary to repair or replace damaged property, networks or information systems or to protect them from similar events in the future.  Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance that we maintain against losses resulting from any such events or security breaches may not be sufficient to cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for any disruptions to our business that may result.  Any such significant service disruption could result in damage to our reputation and credibility, customer dissatisfaction and ultimately a loss of customers or revenue.  Any significant loss of customers or revenue, or significant increase in costs of serving those customers, could adversely affect our growth, financial condition and results of operations.

Furthermore, our operating activities could be subject to risks caused by misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information technology systems and networks and those of our third-party vendors, including customer, personnel and vendor data. We provide certain confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties in connection with our business, and there is a risk that this information may be compromised.

As a result of the increasing awareness concerning the importance of safeguarding personal information, the potential misuse of such information and legislation that has been adopted or is being considered regarding the protection, privacy and security of personal information, information-related risks are increasing, particularly for businesses like ours that process, store and transmit large amount of data, including personal information for our customers. We could be exposed to significant costs if such risks were to materialize, and such events could damage our reputation, credibility and business and have a negative impact on our revenue. We could be subject to regulatory actions and claims made by consumers in private litigations involving privacy issues related to consumer data collection and use practices. We also could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy any such security breach.

The risk described above may be increased during the period in which we are integrating our people, processes and systems as a result of the Transactions.

For tax purposes, Charter could experience a deemed ownership change in the future that could limit its ability to use its tax loss carryforwards.

Charter had approximately

$11.2 billion

of federal tax net operating loss carryforwards resulting in a gross deferred tax asset of approximately

$3.9 billion

as of

December 31, 2016

. These losses resulted from the operations of Charter Communications Holdings Company, LLC ("Charter Holdco") and its subsidiaries and from loss carryforwards received as a result of the TWC Transaction. Federal tax net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years 2018 through 2035.  In addition, Charter had state tax net operating loss carryforwards resulting in a gross deferred tax asset (net of federal tax benefit) of approximately

$304 million

as of

December 31, 2016

. State tax net operating loss carryforwards generally expire in the years 2017 through 2035.

In the past, Charter has experienced “ownership changes” as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). In general, an “ownership change” occurs whenever the percentage of the stock of a corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by “5-percent stockholders” (within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code) increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock of such corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by such “5-percent stockholders” at any time over the preceding three years. As a result, Charter is subject to an annual limitation on the use of its loss carryforwards which existed at November 30, 2009 for the first “ownership change,” those that existed at May 1, 2013 for the second “ownership change,” and those created at May 18, 2016 for the third “ownership change.” The limitation on Charter's ability to use its loss carryforwards, in conjunction with the loss carryforward expiration provisions, could reduce Charter's ability to use a portion of its loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income, which could result in Charter being required to make material cash tax payments. Charter's ability to make such income tax payments, if any, will depend at such time on its liquidity or its ability to raise additional capital, and/or on receipt of payments or distributions from Charter Holdco and its subsidiaries.

If Charter were to experience additional ownership changes in the future (as a result of purchases and sales of stock by its “5-percent stockholders,” new issuances or redemptions of our stock, certain acquisitions of its stock and issuances, redemptions,


sales or other dispositions or acquisitions of interests in its “5-percent stockholders”), Charter's ability to use its loss carryforwards could become subject to further limitations.

If Legacy

TWC’s Separation Transactions (as defined below), including the Distribution (as defined below), do not qualify as tax-free, either as a result of actions taken or not taken by Legacy TWC or as a result of the failure of certain representations by Legacy TWC to be true, Legacy TWC has agreed to indemnify Time Warner Inc. for its taxes resulting from such disqualification, which would be significant.

As part of Legacy TWC’s separation from Time Warner Inc. (“Time Warner”) in March 2009 (the “Separation”), Time Warner received a private letter ruling from the IRS and Time Warner and TWC received opinions of tax counsel confirming that the transactions undertaken in connection with the Separation, including the transfer by a subsidiary of Time Warner of its 12.43% non-voting common stock interest in TW NY to TWC in exchange for 80 million newly issued shares of Legacy TWC’s Class A common stock, Legacy TWC’s payment of a special cash dividend to holders of Legacy TWC’s outstanding Class A and Class B common stock, the conversion of each share of Legacy TWC’s outstanding Class A and Class B common stock into one share of Legacy TWC common stock, and the pro-rata dividend of all shares of Legacy TWC common stock held by Time Warner to holders of record of Time Warner’s common stock (the “Distribution” and, together with all of the transactions, the “Separation Transactions”), should generally qualify as tax-free to Time Warner and its stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The ruling and opinions rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from Time Warner and Legacy TWC regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, Time Warner and its stockholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinions and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the private letter ruling and opinions, the IRS could determine on audit that the Separation Transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated, or for other reasons, including as a result of significant changes in the stock ownership of Time Warner or Legacy TWC after the Distribution.

Under the tax sharing agreement among Time Warner and Legacy TWC, Legacy TWC generally would be required to indemnify Time Warner against its taxes resulting from the failure of any of the Separation Transactions to qualify as tax-free as a result of (i) certain actions or failures to act by Legacy TWC or (ii) the failure of certain representations made by Legacy TWC to be true. In addition, even if Legacy TWC bears no contractual responsibility for taxes related to a failure of the Separation Transactions to qualify for their intended tax treatment, Treasury regulation section 1.1502-6 imposes on Legacy TWC several liability for all Time Warner federal income tax obligations relating to the period during which Legacy TWC was a member of the Time Warner federal consolidated tax group, including the date of the Separation Transactions. Similar provisions may apply under foreign, state or local law. Absent Legacy TWC causing the Separation Transactions to not qualify as tax-free, Time Warner has indemnified Legacy TWC against such several liability arising from a failure of the Separation Transactions to qualify for their intended tax treatment.

If we are unable to retain key employees, our ability to manage our business could be adversely affected.

Our operational results have depended, and our future results will depend, upon the retention and continued performance of our management team. Our ability to retain and hire new key employees for management positions could be impacted adversely by the competitive environment for management talent in the broadband communications industry. The loss of the services of key members of management and the inability or delay in hiring new key employees could adversely affect our ability to manage our business and our future operational and financial results.

Our inability to successfully acquire and integrate other businesses, assets, products or technologies could harm our operating results.

We continuously evaluate and pursue small and large acquisitions and strategic investments in businesses, products or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our business or otherwise offer growth or cost-saving opportunities. From time to time, we may enter into letters of intent with companies with which we are negotiating for potential acquisitions or investments, or as to which we are conducting due diligence. An investment in, or acquisition of, complementary businesses, products or technologies in the future could materially decrease the amount of our available cash or require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. We may not be successful in negotiating the terms of any potential acquisition, conducting thorough due diligence, financing the acquisition or effectively integrating the acquired business, product or technology into our existing business and operations. Our due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business, product or technology, including issues related to intellectual property, product quality or product architecture, regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices, or employee or customer issues.


Additionally, in connection with any acquisitions we complete, including the recently completed Transactions, we may not achieve the growth, synergies or other financial and operating benefits we expected to achieve, and we may incur write-downs, impairment charges or unforeseen liabilities that could negatively affect our operating results or financial position or could otherwise harm our business. Even if we are able to integrate the business operations obtained in such transactions successfully, it is not possible to predict with certainty if or when these cost synergies, growth opportunities and benefits will occur, or the extent to which they actually will be achieved. For example, the benefits from such transactions may be offset by costs incurred in integrating new business operations or in obtaining or attempting to obtain regulatory approvals, or increased operating costs that may be experienced as a result of the transactions. Realization of any benefits and cost synergies could be affected by the factors described in other risk factors and a number of factors beyond our control, as applicable, including, without limitation, general economic conditions, increased operating costs, the response of competitors and vendors and regulatory developments. Further, contemplating or completing an acquisition and integrating an acquired business, product or technology, individually or across multiple opportunities, could divert management and employee time and resources from other matters.

Risks Related to Ownership Position of Liberty Broadband Corporation and Advance/Newhouse Partnership

Liberty Broadband and A/N have governance rights that give them influence over corporate transactions and other matters.

Liberty Broadband currently owns a significant amount of Charter Class A common stock and is entitled to certain governance rights with respect to Charter. A/N currently owns Charter Class A common stock and a significant amount of membership interests in our subsidiary Charter Holdings that are convertible into our Charter Class A common stock and is entitled to certain governance rights with respect to Charter. Members of the Charter board of directors include directors who are also officers and directors of Liberty Broadband and directors who are current or former officers and directors of A/N. Dr. John Malone is the Chairman of Liberty Broadband, and Mr. Greg Maffei is the president and chief executive officer of Liberty Broadband. Steven Miron is the Chief Executive Officer of A/N and Michael Newhouse is an officer or director of several of A/N’s affiliates. As of

December 31, 2016

, Liberty Broadband beneficially held approximately approximately 19% of Charter’s Class A common stock (including shares owned by Liberty Interactive over which Liberty Broadband holds an irrevocable voting proxy) and A/N beneficially held approximately approximately 13% of Charter’s Class A common stock, in each case assuming the conversion of the membership interests held by A/N. Pursuant to the stockholders agreement between Liberty Broadband, A/N and Charter, Liberty Broadband currently has the right to designate up to three directors as nominees for Charter’s board of directors and A/N currently has the right to designate up to two directors as nominees for Charter’s board of directors with one designated director to be appointed to each of the audit committee, the nominating and corporate governance committee, the compensation and benefits committee and the Finance Committee, in each case provided that each maintains certain specified voting or equity ownership thresholds and each nominee meets certain applicable requirements or qualifications.

In connection with the TWC Transaction, Liberty Broadband and Liberty Interactive entered into a proxy and right of first refusal agreement, pursuant to which Liberty Interactive granted Liberty Broadband an irrevocable proxy to vote all Charter Class A common stock owned beneficially or of record by Liberty Interactive, with certain exceptions. In addition, at the closing of the Bright House Transaction, A/N and Liberty Broadband entered into a proxy agreement pursuant to which A/N granted to Liberty Broadband a 5-year irrevocable proxy (which we refer to as the “A/N proxy”) to vote, subject to certain exceptions, that number of shares of New Charter Class A common stock and New Charter Class B common stock, in each case held by A/N (such shares are referred to as the “proxy shares”), that will result in Liberty Broadband having voting power in Charter equal to 25.01% of the outstanding voting power of Charter, provided, that the voting power of the proxy shares is capped at 7.0% of the outstanding voting power of Charter. Therefore, giving effect to the Liberty Interactive proxy and the A/N proxy and the voting cap contained in the stockholders agreement, Liberty Broadband has 25.01% of the outstanding voting power in Charter. The stockholders agreement and Charter’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation fixes the size of the board at 13 directors. Liberty Broadband and A/N are required to vote (subject to the applicable voting cap) their respective shares of Charter Class A common stock and Charter Class B common stock for the director nominees nominated by the nominating and corporate governance committee of the board of directors, including the respective designees of Liberty Broadband and A/N, and against any other nominees, except that, with respect to the unaffiliated directors, Liberty Broadband and A/N must instead vote in the same proportion as the voting securities are voted by stockholders other than A/N and Liberty Broadband or any group which includes any of them are voted, if doing so would cause a different outcome with respect to the unaffiliated directors. As a result of their rights under the stockholders agreement and their significant equity and voting stakes in Charter, Liberty Broadband and/or A/N, who may have interests different from those of other stockholders, will be able to exercise substantial influence over certain matters relating to the governance of Charter, including the approval of significant corporate actions, such as mergers and other business combination transactions.


The stockholders agreement provides A/N and Liberty Broadband with preemptive rights with respect to issuances of Charter equity in connection with certain transactions, and in the event that A/N or Liberty Broadband exercises these rights, holders of Charter Class A common stock may experience further dilution.

The stockholders agreement provides that A/N and Liberty Broadband will have certain contractual preemptive rights over issuances of Charter equity securities in connection with capital raising transactions, merger and acquisition transactions, and in certain other circumstances. Holders of Charter Class A common stock will not be entitled to similar preemptive rights with respect to such transactions. As a result, if Liberty Broadband and/or A/N elect to exercise their preemptive rights, (i) these parties would not experience the dilution experienced by the other holders of Charter Class A common stock, and (ii) such other holders of Charter Class A common stock may experience further dilution of their interest in Charter upon such exercise.

Risks Related to Regulatory and Legislative Matters

Our business is subject to extensive governmental legislation and regulation, which could adversely affect our business.

Regulation of the cable industry has increased cable operators’ operational and administrative expenses and limited their revenues. Cable operators are subject to various laws and regulations including those covering the following:

•

the provisioning and marketing of cable equipment and compatibility with new digital technologies;

•

customer and employee privacy and data security;

•

limited rate regulation of video service;

•

copyright royalties for retransmitting broadcast signals;

•

when a cable system must carry a particular broadcast station and when it must first obtain retransmission consent to carry a broadcast station;

•

the provision of channel capacity to unaffiliated commercial leased access programmers;

•

limitations on our ability to enter into exclusive agreements with multiple dwelling unit complexes and control our inside wiring;

•

the provision of high-speed Internet service, including net neutrality or open Internet rules;

•

the provision of voice communications;

•

cable franchise renewals and transfers;

•

equal employment opportunity, emergency alert systems, disability access, technical standards, marketing practices, customer service, and consumer protection; and

•

approval for mergers and acquisitions often accompanied by the imposition of restrictions and requirements on an applicant’s business in order to secure approval of the proposed transaction.

Legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing, and sometimes do change, existing statutes, rules, regulations, or interpretations thereof, or prescribe new ones. Any future legislative, judicial, regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses. For example, with respect to our retail broadband Internet access service, the FCC has (1) reclassified the service as a Title II service, (2) applied certain existing Title II provisions and associated regulations to it, (3) forborne from applying a range of other existing Title II provisions and associated regulations, but to varying degrees indicated that this forbearance may be only temporary, and (4) issued new rules expanding disclosure requirements and prohibiting blocking, throttling, paid prioritization, and unreasonable interference with the ability of end users and edge providers to reach each other. The order also subjected broadband providers’ Internet traffic exchange rates and practices to potential FCC oversight for the first time and created a mechanism for third parties to file complaints regarding these matters.  These FCC actions were upheld on appeal in June 2016, although additional appeals remain pending.

As a result of the reclassification of broadband Internet access service as a Title II communications service, the FCC adopted new privacy and data security rules for common carriers, interconnected VoIP providers, and broadband service providers on October 27, 2016.  The new rules replace the prior rules and extend broader privacy protections to broadband customers, as well as voice service customers.    The new  rules place heightened restrictions on the use of customer information that Internet service providers obtain from the provision of broadband Internet access service (including increased notice, consumer choice, and security), and are more restrictive than other existing privacy and security frameworks.  The new rules are subject to additional regulatory approval and legal challenges.

Changes to existing statutes, rules, regulations, or interpretations thereof, or adoption of new ones, could have an adverse effect on our business.

There are ongoing efforts to amend or expand the federal, state, and local regulation of some of the services offered over our cable systems, which may compound the regulatory risks we already face. For example, the FCC recently issued a proposal to impose


new regulations on our point to point transport service as well as other commercial data services (“business data services”).  As a result, the FCC may price regulate business data services as common carriage services and impose additional restrictions on contracting terms.  The FCC also has considered adopting new navigation device rules, pursuant to Section 629 of the Communications Act, which directs the FCC to assure the availability of navigation devices (such as set-top boxes)  from third party providers.  In 2016, the FCC proposed burdensome new rules that would have required us to make disaggregated “information flows” available to set-top boxes and apps supplied by third parties.  That proposal has not been adopted, but various parties may continue to advocate alternative regulatory approaches to reduce consumer dependency on traditional operator provided set-top boxes.  The FCC also is considering the appropriate regulatory framework for VoIP service, including whether that service should be regulated under Title II.

Congress is considering legislation that could increase costs on the company, including (1) the adoption of new data security and cybersecurity legislation that could result in additional network and information security requirements for our business, (2) a change in corporate tax laws that could eliminate some of our current deductions, and (3) broadband subsidies to rural areas that could result in subsidized overbuilding of our more rural facilities.

If any of these pending laws and regulations are enacted, they could affect our operations and require significant expenditures.  We cannot predict future developments in these areas, and we are already subject to Charter-specific conditions regarding certain Internet practices as a result of the FCC’s approval of the Transactions, but any changes to the regulatory framework for our Internet or VoIP services could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.

It remains uncertain what rule changes, if any, will ultimately be adopted by Congress and the FCC and what operating or financial impact any such rules might have on us, including on our programming agreements, customer privacy and the user experience. In addition, the FCC’s Enforcement Bureau has been actively investigating certain industry practices of various companies and imposing forfeitures for alleged regulatory violations.

Our cable system franchises are subject to non-renewal or termination. The failure to renew a franchise in one or more key markets could adversely affect our business.

Our cable systems generally operate pursuant to franchises, permits, and similar authorizations issued by a state or local governmental authority controlling the public rights-of-way. Many franchises establish comprehensive facilities and service requirements, as well as specific customer service standards and monetary penalties for non-compliance. In many cases, franchises are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with significant provisions set forth in the franchise agreement governing system operations. Franchises are generally granted for fixed terms and must be periodically renewed. Franchising authorities may resist granting a renewal if either past performance or the prospective operating proposal is considered inadequate. Franchise authorities often demand concessions or other commitments as a condition to renewal. In some instances, local franchises have not been renewed at expiration, and we have operated and are operating under either temporary operating agreements or without a franchise while negotiating renewal terms with the local franchising authorities.

We cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with all significant provisions of our franchise agreements and certain of our franchisers have from time to time alleged that we have not complied with these agreements. Additionally, although historically we have renewed our franchises without incurring significant costs, we cannot assure you that we will be able to renew, or to renew as favorably, our franchises in the future. A termination of or a sustained failure to renew a franchise in one or more key markets could adversely affect our business in the affected geographic area.

Our cable system franchises are non-exclusive. Accordingly, local and state franchising authorities can grant additional franchises and create additional competition for our products, resulting in overbuilds, which could adversely affect results of operations.

Our cable system franchises are non-exclusive. Consequently, local and state franchising authorities can grant additional franchises to competitors in the same geographic area or operate their own cable systems. In some cases, local government entities and municipal utilities may legally compete with us on more favorable terms. Potential competitors (like Google) have recently pursued and obtained local franchises that are more favorable than the incumbent operator’s franchise.

The FCC has adopted rules that streamline entry for new competitors (particularly those affiliated with telephone companies) and reduce franchising burdens for these new entrants. At the same time, a substantial number of states have adopted new franchising laws, principally designed to streamline entry for new competitors, and often provide advantages for these new entrants that are not immediately available to existing operators.


Broadband delivery of video content is not necessarily subject to the same franchising obligations applicable to our traditional cable systems.  The FCC administers a program that collects Universal Service Fund contributions from telecommunications service providers and uses them to subsidize the provision of telecommunications services in high-cost areas and to low-income consumers and the provision of Internet and telecommunications services to schools, libraries and certain health care providers. A variety of regulatory changes may lead the FCC to expand the collection of Universal Service Fund contributions to encompass Internet service providers.  The FCC already has begun to redirect the expenditure of some Universal Service Fund subsidies to broadband deployment in ways that could assist competitors.

Local franchise authorities have the ability to impose additional regulatory constraints on our business, which could further increase our expenses.

In addition to the franchise agreement, cable authorities in some jurisdictions have adopted cable regulatory ordinances that further regulate the operation of cable systems. This additional regulation increases the cost of operating our business. Local franchising authorities may impose new and more restrictive requirements. Local franchising authorities who are certified to regulate rates in the communities where they operate generally have the power to reduce rates and order refunds on the rates charged for basic service and equipment.

Tax legislation and administrative initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

We operate cable systems in locations throughout the United States and, as a result, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of federal, state and local governments. From time to time, various legislative and/or administrative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives. Certain states and localities have imposed or are considering imposing new or additional taxes or fees on our services or changing the methodologies or base on which certain fees and taxes are computed. Potential changes include additional taxes or fees on our services which could impact our customers, combined reporting and other changes to general business taxes, central/unit-level assessment of property taxes and other matters that could increase our income, franchise, sales, use and/or property tax liabilities. In addition, federal, state and local tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. There can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge.

Further regulation of the cable industry could impair our ability to raise rates to cover our increasing costs, resulting in increased losses.

Currently, rate regulation of cable systems is strictly limited to the basic service tier and associated equipment and installation activities, and the FCC recently revised its rules, in response to changed market conditions, to make it more difficult for local franchising authorities to assert rate regulation authority. However, the FCC and Congress continue to be concerned that cable rate increases are exceeding inflation. It is possible that either the FCC or Congress will further restrict the ability of cable system operators to implement rate increases for our video services or even for our Internet and voice services. Should this occur, it would impede our ability to raise our rates. If we are unable to raise our rates in response to increasing costs, our financial results would be adversely impacted.

There has been legislative and regulatory interest in requiring companies that own multiple cable networks to make each of them available on a standalone, rather than a bundled basis to cable operators, and in requiring cable operators to offer historically bundled programming services on an á la carte basis to consumers. While any new regulation or legislation designed to enable cable operators to purchase programming on a standalone basis could be beneficial to us, any regulation or legislation that limits how we sell programming could adversely affect our business.

Changes in channel carriage regulations could impose significant additional costs on us.

Cable operators also face significant regulation of their video channel carriage. We can be required to devote substantial capacity to the carriage of programming that we might not carry voluntarily, including certain local broadcast signals; local public, educational and governmental access (“PEG”) programming; and unaffiliated, commercial leased access programming (required channel capacity for use by persons unaffiliated with the cable operator who desire to distribute programming over a cable system). The FCC adopted revised commercial leased access rules which would dramatically reduce the rate we can charge for leasing this capacity and dramatically increase our administrative burdens, but these remain stayed while under appeal. Legislation has been introduced in Congress in the past that, if adopted, could impact our carriage of broadcast signals by eliminating the cable industry’s compulsory copyright license.  The FCC also continues to consider changes to the rules affecting the relationship between programmers (including broadcasters) and multichannel video distributors, including potential loosening of media ownership rules.


Future regulatory changes could disrupt existing programming commitments, interfere with our preferred use of limited channel capacity, increase our programming costs, and limit our ability to offer services that would maximize our revenue potential. It is possible that other legal restraints will be adopted limiting our discretion over programming decisions.

Our voice service is subject to regulatory burdens which may increase, causing us to incur additional costs.

We offer voice communications services over our broadband network using VoIP services. The FCC has ruled that competitive telephone companies that support VoIP services, such as those we offer our customers, are entitled to interconnect with incumbent providers of traditional telecommunications services, which ensures that our VoIP services can compete in the market. The scope of these interconnection rights are being reviewed in a current FCC proceeding, which may affect our ability to compete in the provision of voice services or result in additional costs. The FCC has also declared that certain VoIP services are not subject to traditional state public utility regulation. The full extent of the FCC preemption of state and local regulation of VoIP services is not yet clear, and at least one state (Minnesota) has asserted jurisdiction over the company’s VoIP services. We have filed a legal challenge to that jurisdictional assertion, which is now pending before a federal district court in Minnesota. Telecommunications companies generally are subject to other significant regulation which could also be extended to VoIP providers. The FCC has already extended certain traditional telecommunications carrier requirements to many VoIP providers such as us. If additional telecommunications regulations are applied to our VoIP service, it could cause us to incur additional costs.

Our principal physical assets consist of cable distribution plant and equipment, including signal receiving, encoding and decoding devices, headend reception facilities, distribution systems, and customer premise equipment for each of our cable systems.

Our cable plant and related equipment are generally attached to utility poles under pole rental agreements with local public utilities and telephone companies, and in certain locations are buried in underground ducts or trenches.  We own or lease real property for signal reception sites, and own our service vehicles.

Our subsidiaries generally lease space for business offices. Our headend and tower locations are located on owned or leased parcels of land, and we generally own the towers on which our equipment is located.  We lease space for our corporate headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut.

The physical components of our cable systems require maintenance as well as periodic upgrades to support the new services and products we introduce.  See “Item 1. Business – Our Network Technology.”  We believe that our properties are generally in good operating condition and are suitable for our business operations.

PART II

Item 5.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.

(A)

Market Information

Charter’s Class A common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “CHTR.”

The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the range of high and low last reported sale price per share of Charter’s Class A common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.

Class A Common Stock

(B)

Holders

As of

December 31, 2016

, there were approximately 15,035 holders of record of Charter’s Class A common stock and one holder of Charter's Class B common stock.

(C)

Dividends

Charter has not paid stock or cash dividends on any of its common stock.

Charter would be dependent on distributions from its subsidiaries if Charter were to make any dividends.  Covenants in the indentures and Charter Operating credit facilities governing the debt obligations of our subsidiaries restrict their ability to make distributions to us, and accordingly, limit our ability to declare or pay cash dividends.  Future cash dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of Charter’s board of directors and will depend upon, among other things, our future operations and earnings, capital requirements, general financial condition, contractual restrictions and such other factors as Charter’s board of directors may deem relevant.


(D)  Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans

The following information is provided as of

December 31, 2016

with respect to equity compensation plans:

(1)

This total does not include 9,811 shares issued pursuant to restricted stock grants made under our 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, which are subject to vesting based on continued employment and market conditions.

For information regarding securities issued under our equity compensation plans, see Note 16 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”


(E)  Performance Graph

The graph below shows the cumulative total return on Charter’s Class A common stock for the period from December 31, 2011 through

December 31, 2016

, in comparison to the cumulative total return on Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and a peer group consisting of the national cable operators that are most comparable to us in terms of size and nature of operations. The Company’s peer group consists of Cablevision Systems Corporation (“Cablevision”), Comcast, and Legacy TWC (through May 18, 2016).  The results shown assume that $100 was invested on December 31, 2011 and that all dividends were reinvested. These indices are included for comparative purposes only and do not reflect whether it is management’s opinion that such indices are an appropriate measure of the relative performance of the stock involved, nor are they intended to forecast or be indicative of future performance of Charter’s Class A common stock.

(F)  Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities

During


, there were no unregistered sales of securities of the registrant other than those previously reported on a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or Current Report on Form 8-K.


(G)

Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer

The following table presents Charter’s purchases of equity securities completed during the fourth quarter of


(dollars in millions, except per share data).

(1)

Includes 60,989, 51,274 and 71,500 shares withheld from employees for the payment of taxes and exercise costs upon the exercise of stock options or vesting of other equity awards for the months of October, November and December 2016, respectively.

(2)

In 2016, Charter purchased approximately 5.1 million shares of its Class A common stock for approximately $1.3 billion pursuant to authorizations by Charter’s board of directors of $3 billion ($750 million authorized on July 26, 2016, $750 million on October 25, 2016 and $1.5 billion on December 2, 2016).  Accordingly, as of December 31, 2016 and provided Charter’s leverage ratio remains at 4 to 4.5 times and Charter Operating’s leverage remains below 3.5 times, management has authority to cause Charter to purchase an additional $1.7 billion of Charter’s Class A common stock without taking into account shares or units that may be purchased from A/N.  Effective November 1, 2016, Charter's board of directors granted authority for a new $750 million of Class A common stock buybacks under the rolling six-month authority without taking into account any Class A common stock purchased prior to November 1.  As a result, a portion of the $1.7 billion of authority is under the authority of management to approve up to $750 million for Class A common stock buybacks in any six-month period.  In December 2016, Charter and A/N entered into a letter agreement ("Letter Agreement") that requires A/N to sell to Charter or to Charter Holdings, on a monthly basis, a number of shares of Charter Class A common stock or Charter Holdings common units that represents a pro rata participation by A/N and its affiliates in any repurchases of shares of Charter Class A common stock from persons other than A/N effected by Charter during the immediately preceding calendar month, at a purchase price equal to the average price paid by Charter for the shares repurchased from persons other than A/N during such immediately preceding calendar month. A/N and Charter both have the right to terminate or suspend the pro rata repurchase arrangement on a prospective basis once Charter or Charter Holdings have repurchased shares of Class A common stock or Charter Holdings common units from A/N and its affiliates for an aggregate purchase price of $537 million.  In December 2016, pursuant to this Letter Agreement, Charter purchased Charter Holdings common units from A/N at a price of $289.83 per unit, or $218 million.  Charter has established a Rule 10b5-1 plan in connection with its share repurchase activity and cannot predict when or if it will repurchase more shares of Charter Class A common stock pursuant to the current plan as such plan includes a price grid including a limit where Charter would not buy shares under the Rule 10b5-1 plan currently in place. Charter may also buy shares of Charter Class A common stock, from time to time, pursuant to private transactions outside of its Rule 10b5-1 plan and any such repurchases would also trigger the repurchases from A/N pursuant to and to the extent provided in the Letter Agreement.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Reference is made to “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” which describe important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations and non-historical information contained herein.  In addition, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto of Charter Communications, Inc. and subsidiaries included in “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Overview

We are the second largest cable operator in the United States and a leading broadband communications services company providing video, Internet and voice services to approximately

26.2 million

residential and business customers at

December 31, 2016

.  In addition, we sell video and online advertising inventory to local, regional and national advertising customers and fiber-delivered communications and managed IT solutions to larger enterprise customers.  We also own and operate regional sports networks and local sports, news and community channels and sell security and home management services to the residential marketplace.  See


“Part I. Item 1. Business — Products and Services” for further description of these services, including customer statistics for different services.

Since 2012, Legacy Charter has actively invested in its network and operations and improved the quality and value of the products and packages that Legacy Charter offered.  Through the roll-out of Spectrum pricing and packaging we have simplified our offers and improved our packaging of products, delivering more value to new and existing customers.  Further, through the transition of our Legacy Charter markets to our all-digital platform, we increased our offerings to more than 200 HD channels in most of the Legacy Charter markets and offered Internet speeds of at least 60 or 100 Mbps, among other benefits.  We believe that this product set combined with improved customer service, as we insource our workforce in our call centers and in our field operations, has led to lower customer churn and longer customer lifetimes.

As a result of the Transactions, 2016 revenues increased by over $18.6 billion year over year.  We also saw an increase in expenses related to our increased scale.  In September 2016, we began launching SPP to Legacy TWC markets and we expect that by mid 2017, we will offer SPP in all Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House markets. In 2017, we intend to begin converting the remaining Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House analog markets to an all-digital platform.  Our corporate organization, as well as our marketing, sales and product development departments, are now centralized.  Field operations are managed through eleven regional areas, each designed to represent a combination of designated marketing areas and managed with largely the same set of field employees that were with the three legacy companies prior to completion of the Transactions.  Over a multi-year period, Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House customer care centers will migrate to Legacy Charter's model of using segmented, virtualized, U.S.-based in-house call centers.  We will focus on deploying superior products and service with minimal service disruptions as we integrate our information technology and network operations. We expect customer and financial results to trend similar to Legacy Charter following the implementation of the Legacy Charter operating strategies across the Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House markets. As a result of implementing our operating strategy at Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House, we cannot be certain that we will be able to grow revenues or maintain our margins at recent historical rates.

The Company realized revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and income from operations during the periods presented as follows (in millions; all percentages are calculated using whole numbers.  Minor differences may exist due to rounding).

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income (loss) plus net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, (gain) loss on financial instruments, net, other (income) expense, net and other operating (income) expenses, such as merger and restructuring costs, other pension benefits, special charges and gain (loss) on sale or retirement of assets.  See “—Use of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow” for further information on Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow.  Growth in total revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and income from operations was primarily due to the Transactions.

On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, total revenue growth was primarily due to growth in our Internet and commercial businesses.  On a pro forma basis, Adjusted EBITDA growth was primarily due to an increase in residential and commercial revenues offset by increases in programming costs and other operating costs.  In addition to the factors discussed above, income from operations on a pro forma basis was affected by increases in depreciation and amortization, merger and restructuring costs and stock compensation expense.

Approximately 90%, 91% and 90% of our revenues for years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


, respectively, are attributable to monthly subscription fees charged to customers for our video, Internet, voice and commercial services provided by our cable systems.  Generally, these customer subscriptions may be discontinued by the customer at any time subject to a fee for


certain commercial customers.  The remaining 10%, 9% and 10% of revenue for fiscal years


,


and


, respectively, is derived primarily from advertising revenues, franchise and other regulatory fee revenues (which are collected by us but then paid to local authorities), pay-per-view and VOD programming, installation, processing fees or reconnection fees charged to customers to commence or reinstate service, and commissions related to the sale of merchandise by home shopping services.

We incurred the following transition costs in connection with the Transactions (in millions).

Amounts included in transition operating expenses and transition capital expenditures represent incremental costs incurred to integrate the Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House operations and to bring the three companies’ systems and processes into a uniform operating structure.  Costs are incremental and would not be incurred absent the integration.  Other operating expenses associated with the Transactions represent merger and restructuring costs and include advisory, legal and accounting fees, employee retention costs, employee termination costs and other exit costs.  Interest expense associated with the Transactions represents interest incurred on the CCO Safari II, CCO Safari III and CCOH Safari notes issued in advance of the closing of the Transactions, the proceeds of which were held in escrow to finance the Transactions.

We have a history of net losses.  Our net losses were principally attributable to insufficient revenue to cover the combination of operating expenses, interest expenses that we incur on our debt, depreciation expenses resulting from the capital investments we have made, and continue to make, in our cable properties, amortization expenses related to our customer relationship intangibles and higher non-cash income tax expense.  We will incur significant increases in interest expense and depreciation and amortization as a result of the Transactions and will incur restructuring and transition costs for at least one to two years, and as a result, absent non-recurring impacts such as the reversal of the income tax valuation allowance in the second quarter of 2016, we may incur net losses in the future.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Certain of our accounting policies require our management to make difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments. Management has discussed these policies with the Audit Committee of Charter’s board of directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the following disclosure.  We consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the estimates, assumptions and judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements, and the uncertainties that could affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows:

•

Property, plant and equipment

•

Capitalization of labor and overhead costs

•

Valuation and impairment of property, plant and equipment

•

Useful lives of property, plant and equipment

•

Intangible assets

•

Valuation and impairment of franchises

•

Valuation and impairment of goodwill

•

Valuation and impairment and amortization of customer relationships

•

Income taxes

•

Litigation

•

Programming agreements

•

Pension plans

In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimates or judgment that are not deemed critical, such as the allowance for doubtful accounts and valuations of our financial instruments, but changes in estimates or judgment in these other items could also have a material impact on our financial statements.


Property, plant and equipment

The cable industry is capital intensive, and a large portion of our resources are spent on capital activities associated with extending, rebuilding, and upgrading our cable network.  As of

December 31, 2016

and


, the net carrying amount of our property, plant and equipment (consisting primarily of cable distribution systems) was approximately

$33.0 billion

(representing

22%

of total assets) and

$8.3 billion

(representing

49%

of total assets excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents), respectively.  Total capital expenditures for the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


were approximately

$5.3 billion

,

$1.8 billion

and

$2.2 billion

, respectively.

Capitalization of labor and overhead costs.

Costs associated with network construction, initial placement of the customer drop to the dwelling and the initial placement of outlets within a dwelling along with the costs associated with the initial deployment of customer premise equipment necessary to provide video, Internet or voices services, are capitalized.  Costs capitalized include materials, direct labor, and certain indirect costs. These indirect costs are associated with the activities of personnel who assist in installation activities, and consist of compensation and overhead costs associated with these support functions.  While our capitalization is based on specific activities, once capitalized, we track these costs on a composite basis by fixed asset category at the cable system level, and not on a specific asset basis.  For assets that are sold or retired, we remove the estimated applicable cost and accumulated depreciation.  The costs of disconnecting service and removing customer premise equipment from a dwelling and the costs to reconnect a customer drop or to redeploy previously installed customer premise equipment are charged to operating expensed as incurred. Costs for repairs and maintenance are charged to operating expense as incurred, while plant and equipment replacement, including replacement of certain components, betterments, and replacement of cable drops and outlets, are capitalized.

We make judgments regarding the installation and construction activities to be capitalized.  We capitalize direct labor and overhead using standards developed from actual costs and applicable operational data.  We calculate standards annually (or more frequently if circumstances dictate) for items such as the labor rates, overhead rates, and the actual amount of time required to perform a capitalizable activity.  For example, the standard amounts of time required to perform capitalizable activities are based on studies of the time required to perform such activities.  Overhead rates are established based on an analysis of the nature of costs incurred in support of capitalizable activities, and a determination of the portion of costs that is directly attributable to capitalizable activities.  The impact of changes that resulted from these studies were not material in the periods presented.

Labor costs directly associated with capital projects are capitalized.  Capitalizable activities performed in connection with installations include such activities as:

•

dispatching a “truck roll” to the customer’s dwelling or business for service connection or placement of new equipment;

•

verification of serviceability to the customer’s dwelling or business (i.e., determining whether the customer’s dwelling is capable of receiving service by our cable network and/or receiving advanced or Internet services);

•

customer premise activities performed by in-house field technicians and third-party contractors in connection with customer installations, installation of equipment in connection with the installation of video, Internet or voice services, and equipment replacement and betterment; and

•

verifying the integrity of the customer’s network connection by initiating test signals downstream from the headend to the customer’s digital set-top box, as well as testing signal levels at the pole or pedestal.

Judgment is required to determine the extent to which overhead costs incurred result from specific capital activities, and therefore should be capitalized.  The primary costs that are included in the determination of the overhead rate are (i) employee benefits and payroll taxes associated with capitalized direct labor, (ii) direct variable costs associated with capitalizable activities, (iii) the cost of support personnel, such as care personnel and dispatchers, who assist with capitalizable installation activities, and (iv) indirect costs directly attributable to capitalizable activities.

While we believe our existing capitalization policies are appropriate, a significant change in the nature or extent of our system activities could affect management’s judgment about the extent to which we should capitalize direct labor or overhead in the future.  We monitor the appropriateness of our capitalization policies, and perform updates to our internal studies on an ongoing basis to determine whether facts or circumstances warrant a change to our capitalization policies.  We capitalized direct labor and overhead of $991 million, $420 million and $427 million, respectively, for the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


.

Valuation and impairment of property, plant and equipment.

We evaluate the recoverability of our property, plant and equipment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  Such events or changes in circumstances could include such factors as the impairment of our indefinite life franchises, changes in technological advances, fluctuations in the fair value of such assets, adverse changes in relationships with local franchise authorities, adverse changes in market conditions, or a deterioration of current or expected future operating results.  A long-lived


asset is deemed impaired when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset.  No impairments of long-lived assets to be held and used were recorded in the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


.

We utilize the cost approach as the primary method used to establish fair value for our property, plant and equipment in connection with business combinations.  The cost approach considers the amount required to replace an asset by constructing or purchasing a new asset with similar utility, then adjusts the value in consideration of physical depreciation and functional and economic obsolescence as of the appraisal date.  The cost approach relies on management’s assumptions regarding current material and labor costs required to rebuild and repurchase significant components of our property, plant and equipment along with assumptions regarding the age and estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment.

Useful lives of property, plant and equipment.

We evaluate the appropriateness of estimated useful lives assigned to our property, plant and equipment, based on annual analysis of such useful lives, and revise such lives to the extent warranted by changing facts and circumstances.  Any changes in estimated useful lives as a result of this analysis are reflected prospectively beginning in the period in which the study is completed.  Our analysis of useful lives in


did not indicate a change in useful lives.  The effect of a one-year decrease in the weighted average remaining useful life of our property, plant and equipment as of

December 31, 2016

would be an increase in annual depreciation expense of approximately $1.7 billion.  The effect of a one-year increase in the weighted average remaining useful life of our property, plant and equipment as of

December 31, 2016

would be a decrease in annual depreciation expense of approximately $863 million.

Depreciation expense related to property, plant and equipment totaled

$5.0 billion

,

$1.9 billion

and

$1.8 billion

for the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


, respectively, representing approximately

19%

,

21%

and

22%

of costs and expenses, respectively.  Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line composite method over management’s estimate of the useful lives of the related assets as listed below:

Intangible assets

Valuation and impairment of franchises.

The net carrying value of franchises as of

December 31, 2016

and


was approximately

$67.3 billion

(representing

45%

of total assets) and

$6.0 billion

(representing

35%

of total assets excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents), respectively.  For more information and a complete discussion of how we value and test franchise assets for impairment, see Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

We perform an impairment assessment of franchise assets annually or more frequently as warranted by events or changes in circumstances. We performed a qualitative assessment in


.   Our assessment included consideration of the fair value appraisals of Legacy Charter and the newly-acquired operations performed as of the date of acquisition for tax and acquisition accounting purposes, respectively, along with a multitude of factors that affect the fair value of our franchise assets. Examples of such factors include environmental and competitive changes within our operating footprint, actual and projected operating performance, the consistency of our operating margins, equity and debt market trends, including changes in our market capitalization, and changes in our regulatory and political landscape, among other factors. Based on our assessment, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our franchise assets equals or exceeds their carrying values and that a quantitative impairment test is not required.

The appraisals indicated that the fair value of our franchise assets exceeded carrying value by approximately 25% in the aggregate, with the excess entirely attributable to the franchise assets of Legacy Charter to which acquisition accounting was not applied. At our unit of accounting level for franchise asset impairment testing, the amount by which fair value exceeds carrying value varies based on the extent to which the unit of accounting was comprised of newly-acquired operations. For units of accounting comprised entirely or substantially of newly-acquired operations, we believe the carrying value approximates the fair value given that there has been no significant adverse changes in factors impacting our fair value estimates since the Transaction date.  For units of accounting comprised of at least 25% Legacy Charter operations, the fair value exceeded carrying value by a range of 36% to 260%.


Valuation and impairment of goodwill.

The net carrying value of goodwill as of

December 31, 2016

and


was approximately

$29.5 billion

(representing

20%

of total assets) and

$1.2 billion

(representing

7%

of total assets excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents), respectively.  For more information and a complete discussion on how we test goodwill for impairment, see Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”  We perform our impairment assessment of goodwill annually as of November 30

th

.  As with our franchise impairment testing, we elected to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill in


which included the fair value appraisals and other factors described above. Based on the appraisals, we determined that the fair value of our goodwill exceeded carrying value by approximately 28% as of the closing of the Transactions. Given the limited amount of time between the closing of the Transactions and the completion of the assessment and absence of significant adverse changes in factors impacting our fair value estimates, we concluded that it is more likely than not that our goodwill is not impaired.

Valuation, impairment and amortization of customer relationships.

The net carrying value of customer relationships as of

December 31, 2016

and


was approximately

$14.6 billion

(representing

10%

of total assets) and

$856 million

(representing

5%

of total assets excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents), respectively.  Amortization expense related to customer relationships for the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


was approximately $1.9 billion, $249 million and $282 million, respectively.  No impairment of customer relationships was recorded in the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


.  For more information and a complete discussion on our valuation methodology and amortization method, see Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Income taxes

As of

December 31, 2016

, Charter had approximately

$11.2 billion

of federal tax net operating loss carryforwards resulting in a gross deferred tax asset of approximately

$3.9 billion

.  These losses resulted from the operations of Charter Holdco and its subsidiaries and from loss carryforwards received as a result of the TWC Transaction. Federal tax net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years 2018 through 2035.  In addition, as of

December 31, 2016

, Charter had state tax net operating loss carryforwards, resulting in a gross deferred tax asset (net of federal tax benefit) of approximately

$304 million

.  State tax net operating loss carryforwards generally expire in the years 2017 through 2035.  Such tax loss carryforwards can accumulate and be used to offset Charter’s future taxable income.  As of

December 31, 2016

, all of Charter's federal tax loss carryforwards are subject to Section 382 and other restrictions.  Pursuant to these restrictions, Charter estimates that approximately

$5.4 billion

in 2017,

$3.8 billion

in 2018,

$432 million

in 2019 and an additional

$226 million

annually over each of the next five years of federal tax loss carryforwards, should become unrestricted and available for Charter’s use. An additional

$415 million

is currently subject to a valuation allowance.  Charter’s state tax loss carryforwards are subject to similar but varying restrictions.

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management takes into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income, available tax planning strategies and reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. Due to Legacy Charter’s history of losses, Legacy Charter was historically unable to assume future taxable income in its analysis and accordingly valuation allowances were established against the deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, from definite-lived assets for book accounting purposes. However, as a result of the TWC Transaction, deferred tax liabilities resulting from the book fair value adjustment increased significantly and future taxable income that will result from the reversal of existing temporary differences for which deferred tax liabilities are recognized, is sufficient to conclude it is more likely than not that we will realize substantially all of our deferred tax assets. As a result, Charter has reversed approximately

$3.3 billion

of its valuation allowance and recognized a corresponding income tax benefit in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended

December 31, 2016

. Approximately

$145 million

of valuation allowance associated with federal tax net operating loss carryforwards and approximately

$55 million

of valuation allowance associated with state tax loss carryforwards and other miscellaneous deferred tax assets remains on the

December 31, 2016

consolidated balance sheet.

In determining our tax provision for financial reporting purposes, Charter establishes a reserve for uncertain tax positions unless such positions are determined to be “more likely than not” of being sustained upon examination, based on their technical merits. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in our financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized when the position is ultimately resolved. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether positions taken on the tax return are “more likely than not” of being sustained.  Charter adjusts its uncertain tax reserve estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by, and settlements with, the various taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations.


No tax years for Charter, Charter Holdings or Charter Holdco, for income tax purposes, are currently under examination by the IRS. Charter and Charter Holdings' 2016 tax year remains open for assessment.  Legacy Charter’s tax years ending 2013 through the short period return dated May 17, 2016 remain subject to examination and assessment. Years prior to 2013 remain open solely for purposes of examination of Legacy Charter’s loss and credit carryforwards.  The IRS is currently examining Legacy TWC’s income tax returns for 2011 and 2012.  Legacy TWC’s tax years ending 2013 through 2015 remain subject to examination and assessment.  Prior to Legacy TWC’s separation from Time Warner Inc. (“Time Warner”) in March 2009 (the “Separation”), Legacy TWC was included in the consolidated U.S. federal and certain state income tax returns of Time Warner. The IRS is currently examining Time Warner’s 2008 through 2010 income tax returns. Time Warner’s income tax returns for 2005 to 2007, which are periods prior to the separation, were settled with the exception of an immaterial item that has been referred to the IRS Appeals Division.  We have unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of interest and penalties, totaling approximately

$172 million

and

$5 million

as of

December 31, 2016

and


, respectively.

Litigation

Legal contingencies have a high degree of uncertainty.  When a loss from a contingency becomes estimable and probable, a reserve is established.  The reserve reflects management’s best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matter and is revised as facts and circumstances change.  A reserve is released when a matter is ultimately brought to closure or the statute of limitations lapses.  We have established reserves for certain matters.  Although these matters are not expected individually to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, such matters could have, in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

Programming agreements

We exercise significant judgment in estimating programming expense associated with certain video programming contracts. Our policy is to record video programming costs based on our contractual agreements with our programming vendors, which are generally multi-year agreements that provide for us to make payments to the programming vendors at agreed upon market rates based on the number of customers to which we provide the programming service. If a programming contract expires prior to the parties’ entry into a new agreement and we continue to distribute the service, we estimate the programming costs during the period there is no contract in place. In doing so, we consider the previous contractual rates, inflation and the status of the negotiations in determining our estimates.  When the programming contract terms are finalized, an adjustment to programming expense is recorded, if necessary, to reflect the terms of the new contract. We also make estimates in the recognition of programming expense related to other items, such as the accounting for free periods, timing of rate increases and credits from service interruptions, as well as the allocation of consideration exchanged between the parties in multiple-element transactions.

Significant judgment is also involved when we enter into agreements that result in us receiving cash consideration from the programming vendor, usually in the form of advertising sales, channel positioning fees, launch support or marketing support. In these situations, we must determine based upon facts and circumstances if such cash consideration should be recorded as revenue, a reduction in programming expense or a reduction in another expense category (e.g., marketing).

Pension plans

Upon completion of the TWC Transaction, we assumed Legacy TWC’s pension plans.  We sponsor two qualified defined benefit pension plans, the TWC Pension Plan and the TWC Union Pension Plan (collectively, the “TWC Pension Plans”), that provide pension benefits to a majority of Legacy TWC employees. We also provide a nonqualified defined benefit pension plan for certain employees under the TWC Excess Pension Plan.  As of

December 31, 2016

, the accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the TWC Pension Plans was

$3.3 billion

and

$2.9 billion

, respectively, and the net underfunded liability of the TWC Pension Plans was recorded as a

$1 million

noncurrent asset,

$6 million

current liability and

$309 million

long-term liability.

Pension benefits are based on formulas that reflect the employees’ years of service and compensation during their employment period.  Actuarial gains or losses are changes in the amount of either the benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets resulting from experience different from that assumed or from changes in assumptions.  We have elected to follow a mark-to-market pension accounting policy for recording the actuarial gains or losses annually during the fourth quarter, or earlier if a remeasurement event occurs during an interim period.  We use a December 31 measurement date for our pension plans.

We recognized a net periodic pension benefit of

$813 million

in 2016.  Net periodic pension benefit or expense is determined using certain assumptions, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rate and expected rate of compensation increases. We determined the discount rate used to compute pension expense based on the yield of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds with cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future defined benefit payments. In developing the expected long-term rate of return on assets, we considered the current pension portfolio’s composition, past


average rate of earnings, and our asset allocation targets. We used a discount rate of 3.99% from the date of the Transaction to June 30, 2016, and 3.72% from July 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016 to compute 2016 pension expense.  A decrease in the discount rate of 25 basis points would result in a $154 million increase in our pension plan benefit obligation as of December 31, 2016 and net periodic pension expense recognized in 2016 under our mark-to-market accounting policy.  Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used to compute 2016 pension expense was 6.50%.  A decrease in the expected long-term rate of return of 25 basis points, from 6.50% to 6.25%, while holding all other assumptions constant, would result in an increase in our 2017 net periodic pension expense of approximately $7 million.  See Note 21 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional discussion on these assumptions.

Results of Operations

The following table sets forth the consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented (dollars in millions, except per share data):

Revenues.

Total revenues grew

$19.2 billion

or

197%

in the year ended

December 31, 2016

as compared to


and grew

$646 million

or

7.1%

in the year ended

December 31, 2015

as compared to


.  Revenue growth primarily reflects the Transactions and increases in the number of residential Internet and triple play customers and in commercial business customers, growth in rates driven by higher equipment revenue and rate increases offset by a decrease in basic video customers.  The Transactions increased revenues for year ended

December 31, 2016

as compared to


by approximately $18.6 billion.  On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, total revenue growth was

7%

compared to


.


Revenues by service offering were as follows (dollars in millions; all percentages are calculated using whole numbers. Minor differences may exist due to rounding):

Video revenues consist primarily of revenues from basic and digital video services provided to our residential customers, as well as franchise fees, equipment rental and video installation revenue.  Excluding the impacts of the Transactions, residential video customers increased by 42,000 in


and decreased by 2,000 in


.  The increases in video revenues are attributable to the following (dollars in millions):

in


and the increase in small and medium business commercial revenues is attributable to the following (dollars in millions):

Excluding the impacts of the Transactions, enterprise PSUs increased 6,000 and 5,000 in


and


, respectively.  On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, enterprise PSUs increased by

16,000

in


.  The Transactions increased enterprise commercial revenues for year ended

December 31, 2016

as compared to


by approximately $1.0 billion.  On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, enterprise commercial revenues increased

$207 million

during the year ended

December 31, 2016

compared to


primarily due to growth in customers.

Advertising sales revenues consist primarily of revenues from commercial advertising customers, programmers and other vendors, as well as local cable and advertising on regional sports and news channels.  Advertising sales revenues increased in


primarily due to the Transactions and decreased in


primarily as a result of a decrease in political advertising.  The Transactions increased advertising sales revenues for the year ended

December 31, 2016

as compared to 2015 by $898 million.  On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, advertising sales revenues increased

$172 million

during the year ended

December 31, 2016

compared to


primarily due to an increase in political advertising.

Other revenues consist of revenue from regional sports and news channels (excluding intercompany charges or advertising sales on those channels), home shopping, late payment fees, wire maintenance fees and other miscellaneous revenues.  The increase in


was primarily due to the Transactions.  The Transactions increased other revenues for the year ended

December 31, 2016

as compared to 2015 by $429 million. On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, other revenues increased

$33 million

during the year ended

December 31, 2016

compared to


primarily due to a settlement related to an early contract termination.


Operating costs and expenses

.

The increases in our operating costs and expenses are attributable to the following (dollars in millions):

Programming costs were approximately

$7.0 billion

,

$2.7 billion

and

$2.5 billion

, representing

38%

,

42%

and

41%

of operating costs and expenses for each of the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


, respectively.  The increase in operating costs and expenses for the year ended

December 31, 2016

compared to 2015 was primarily due to the Transactions.

The increase in other expense is attributable to the following (dollars in millions):

The increases in other expense for the year ended

December 31, 2016

compared to the corresponding prior periods were primarily due to the Transactions.

On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, increases in our operating costs and expenses, exclusive of items shown separately in the consolidated statements of operations, are attributable to the following (dollars in millions):

On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, programming costs were approximately

$9.6 billion

and

$9.0 billion

, representing

37%

and

36%

of total operating costs and expenses for the years ended

December 31, 2016

and


, respectively.


Programming costs consist primarily of costs paid to programmers for basic, digital, premium, VOD, and pay-per-view programming. The increase in pro forma programming costs is primarily a result of annual contractual rate adjustments, including increases in amounts paid for retransmission consents and the introduction of new networks offset by synergies as a result of the Transactions and lower pay-per-view programming expenses.  We expect pro forma programming expenses will continue to increase due to a variety of factors, including annual increases imposed by programmers with additional selling power as a result of media consolidation, increased demands by owners of broadcast stations for payment for retransmission consent or linking carriage of other services to retransmission consent, and additional programming, particularly new services. We have been unable to fully pass these increases on to our customers nor do we expect to be able to do so in the future without a potential loss of customers.

On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, the increase in other expense is attributable to the following (dollars in millions):

The increase in advertising sales expense relates primarily to higher advertising sales revenue.  The increase in corporate costs relates primarily to increases in the number of employees including increases in engineering and IT.  Stock compensation expense increased primarily due to increases in headcount and the value of equity issued.

Depreciation and amortization.

Depreciation and amortization expense increased by

$4.8 billion

in


compared to


primarily as a result of additional depreciation and amortization related to the Transactions, inclusive of the incremental amounts as a result of the higher fair values recorded in acquisition accounting.  Depreciation and amortization expense increased by

$23 million

in


compared to


which primarily represents depreciation on more recent capital expenditures offset by certain assets becoming fully depreciated.

Other operating expenses, net.

The changes in other operating expenses, net are attributable to the following (dollars in millions):

The increase in merger and restructuring costs is primarily due to approximately $262 million of Legacy Charter and Legacy TWC contingent financing and advisory transaction fees paid at the closing of the Transactions as well as approximately $642 million of employee retention and employee termination costs incurred during


.

Other pension benefits includes the pension curtailment gain of $675 million, remeasurement gain of $195 million, expected return on plan assets of $116 million offset by interest costs of $87 million. For more information, see Note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Interest expense, net.

Net interest expense increased by

$1.2 billion

in


from


and by

$395 million

in


from


primarily as a result of an increase of $463 million and $446 million, respectively, of interest expense associated with the debt incurred to fund the Transactions, and, in 2016, $604 million associated with debt assumed from Legacy TWC.


Loss on extinguishment of debt.

Loss on extinguishment of debt of $111 million and $128 million for the years ended

December 31, 2016

and


primarily represents losses recognized as a result of the repurchase of CCO Holdings notes. For more information, see Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Gain (loss) on financial instruments, net.

Interest rate derivative instruments are used to manage our interest costs and to reduce our exposure to increases in floating interest rates, and cross-currency derivative instruments are used to manage foreign exchange risk related to the foreign currency denominated debt assumed in the TWC Transaction.  We recorded gains of

$89 million

and losses of

$4 million

and

$7 million

during the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


, respectively.  Gains and losses on financial instruments are recognized due to changes in the fair value of our interest rate and, in 2016 our cross currency derivative instruments and the remeasurement of the fixed-rate British pound sterling denominated notes (the “Sterling Notes”) into U.S. dollars. The year ended

December 31, 2016

also includes an $11 million loss realized upon termination of Legacy TWC interest rate swap derivative instruments.  For more information, see Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Other expense, net.

Other expense, net primarily represents equity losses on our equity-method investments.  For more information, see Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Income tax benefit (expense).

We recognized income tax benefits of

$2.9 billion

and

$60 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2016

and


, respectively, and income tax expense of

$236 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2014

. Certain of the deferred tax liabilities that were assumed in connection with the closing of the TWC Transaction will reverse and provide a source of future taxable income, resulting in a reduction of approximately $3.3 billion of Legacy Charter’s preexisting valuation allowance associated with its deferred tax assets.  Such release of Legacy Charter’s valuation allowance was recognized directly to income tax benefit in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended

December 31, 2016

.  Income tax benefit for the year ended

December 31, 2016

was also impacted by a change in a state tax law that resulted in approximately $65 million of tax benefit. The tax provision in future periods will vary based on current and future temporary differences, as well as future operating results.  For more information, see Note 17 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

The income tax benefit in 2015 was primarily due to the deemed liquidation of Charter Holdco solely for federal and state income tax purposes, resulting in a $187 million deferred income tax benefit offset by income tax expense primarily through increases in deferred tax liabilities.  Income tax expense was recognized in 2015 and 2014 primarily through increases in deferred tax liabilities related to Legacy Charter’s franchises, which are characterized as indefinite lived for book financial reporting purposes, as well as, to a lesser extent, through current federal and state income tax expense.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for financial reporting purposes represents A/N’s portion of Charter Holdings’ net income based on its effective common unit ownership interest of approximately 10% and on the preferred dividend of $93 million for the year ended

December 31, 2016

.   For more information, see Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in “Item 1. Financial Statements.”

Net income (loss) attributable to Charter shareholders.

Net income attributable to Charter shareholders was

$3.5 billion

for the year ended

December 31, 2016

and net loss attributable to Charter shareholders was

$271 million

and

$183 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


, respectively, primarily as a result of the factors described above. On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, net income attributable to Charter shareholders was

$1.1 billion

and

$159 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2016

and


, respectively.

Use of Adjusted EBITDA

and Free Cash Flow

We use certain measures that are not defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) to evaluate various aspects of our business. Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, consolidated net income (loss) and net cash flows from operating activities reported in accordance with GAAP. These terms, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are reconciled to consolidated net income (loss) and net cash flows from operating activities, respectively, below.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income (loss) plus net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, (gain) loss on financial instruments, other (income) expense, net and other operating (income) expenses, such as merger and restructuring costs, other pension benefits, special charge


s and (gain) loss on sale or retirement of assets. As such, it eliminates the significant non-cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of our businesses as well as other non-cash or special items, and is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities. However, this measure is limited in that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues and our cash cost of financing. These costs are evaluated through other financial measures.

Free cash flow is defined as net cash flows from operating activities, less capital expenditures and changes in accrued expenses related to capital expenditures.

We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow provide information useful to investors in assessing our performance and our ability to service our debt, fund operations and make additional investments with internally generated funds. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA generally correlates to the leverage ratio calculation under our credit facilities or outstanding notes to determine compliance with the covenants contained in the facilities and notes (all such documents have been previously filed with the SEC). For the purpose of calculating compliance with leverage covenants, we use Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, excluding certain expenses paid by our operating subsidiaries to other Charter entities. Our debt covenants refer to these expenses as management fees, which fees were in the amount of

$930 million

,

$322 million

and

$253 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


, respectively.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

Overview

We have significant amounts of debt.  The principal amount of our debt as of

December 31, 2016

was

$60.0 billion

, consisting of

$8.9 billion

of credit facility debt,

$37.7 billion

of investment grade senior secured notes and

$13.4 billion

of high-yield senior unsecured notes. Our business requires significant cash to fund principal and interest payments on our debt.

Our projected cash needs and projected sources of liquidity depend upon, among other things, our actual results, and the timing and amount of our expenditures. Free cash flow was

$3.3 billion

,

$547 million

and

$171 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


, respectively.  As of

December 31, 2016

, the amount available under our credit facilities was approximately

$2.8 billion

and cash on hand was approximately

$1.5 billion

.  We expect to utilize free cash flow, cash on hand and availability under our credit facilities as well as future refinancing transactions to further extend the maturities of or reduce the principal on our obligations. The timing and terms of any refinancing transactions will be subject to market conditions.  Additionally, we may, from time to time, and depending on market conditions and other factors, use cash on hand and the proceeds from securities offerings or other borrowings to retire our debt through open market purchases, privately negotiated purchases, tender offers or redemption provisions. We believe we have sufficient liquidity from cash on hand, free cash flow and Charter Operating’s revolving credit facility as well as access to the capital markets to fund our projected cash needs.

We continue to evaluate the deployment of our cash on hand and anticipated future free cash flow including to invest in our business growth and other strategic opportunities, including mergers and acquisitions as well as stock repurchases and dividends. Our target leverage remains at 4 to 4.5 times, and up to 3.5 times at the Charter Operating level. In 2016, Charter purchased approximately 5.1 million shares of its Class A common stock for approximately $1.3 billion pursuant to authorizations by Charter’s board of directors of $3 billion.  Accordingly, as of December 31, 2016 and provided Charter’s and Charter Operating's leverage ratios remain at target, management has authority to cause Charter to purchase an additional $1.7 billion of Charter’s Class A common stock without taking into account shares or units that may be purchased from A/N.  Effective November 1, 2016, Charter's board of directors granted authority for a new $750 million of Class A common stock buybacks under the rolling six-month authority without taking into account any Class A common stock purchased prior to November 1.  As a result, a portion of the $1.7 billion of authority is under the authority of management to approve up to $750 million for Class A common stock buybacks in any six-month period.  Charter is not obligated to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the timing of any purchases that may occur cannot be predicted and will largely depend on market conditions and other potential uses of capital. Purchases may include open market purchases or negotiated transactions. As possible acquisitions, swaps or dispositions arise, we actively review them against our objectives including, among other considerations, improving the operational efficiency, clustering, product development or technology capabilities of our business and achieving appropriate return targets, and we may participate to the extent we believe these possibilities present attractive opportunities. However, there can be no assurance that we will actually complete any acquisitions, dispositions or system swaps, or that any such transactions will be material to our operations or results.

In December 2016, Charter and A/N exchanged 1.9 million Charter Holdings common units held by A/N for shares of Charter Class A common stock pursuant to the Letter Agreement for an aggregate purchase price of $537 million. The Letter Agreement also requires A/N to sell to Charter or to Charter Holdings, on a monthly basis, a number of shares of Charter Class A common stock or Charter Holdings common units that represents a pro rata participation by A/N and its affiliates in any repurchases of shares of Charter Class A common stock from persons other than A/N effected by Charter during the immediately preceding calendar month, at a purchase price equal to the average price paid by Charter for the shares repurchased from persons other than A/N during such immediately preceding calendar month. Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, Charter Holdings purchased from A/N 752,767 Charter Holdings common units at a price per unit of $289.83, or $218 million.

Recent Events

In January 2017, Charter Operating entered into an amendment to its Credit Agreement decreasing the applicable LIBOR margin on both the term loan E and term loan F to

2.00%

and eliminating the LIBOR floor.

In February 2017, CCO Holdings and CCO Holdings Capital Corp. closed on transactions in which they issued

$1.0 billion

aggregate principal amount of

5.125%

senior notes due 2027.  The net proceeds will be used to redeem CCO Holdings’

6.625%

senior notes due 2022, pay related fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes.


Free Cash Flow

Free cash flow increased

$2.8 billion

and

$376 million

during the years ended

December 31, 2016

and


compared to the corresponding prior periods, respectively, due to the following.

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our payment obligations as of

December 31, 2016

under our long-term debt and certain other contractual obligations and commitments (dollars in millions.)

(a)

The table presents maturities of long-term debt outstanding as of

and

$43 million

, respectively.

(d)

We pay programming fees under multi-year contracts typically based on a flat fee per customer, which may be fixed for the term, or may in some cases escalate over the term.  Programming costs included in the accompanying statement of operations were approximately

$7.0 billion

,

$2.7 billion

and

$2.5 billion

, for the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


, respectively.  Certain of our programming agreements are based on a flat fee per month or have guaranteed minimum payments.  The table sets forth the aggregate guaranteed minimum commitments under our programming contracts.

(e)

“Other” represents other guaranteed minimum commitments, including rights negotiated directly with content owners for distribution on company-owned channels or networks and commitments related to our role as an advertising and distribution sales agent for third party-owned channels or networks as well as commitments to our customer premise equipment vendors.


The following items are not included in the contractual obligations table because the obligations are not fixed and/or determinable due to various factors discussed below.  However, we incur these costs as part of our operations:

•

We rent utility poles used in our operations.  Generally, pole rentals are cancelable on short notice, but we anticipate that such rentals will recur.  Rent expense incurred for pole rental attachments for the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


was

$115 million

,

$53 million

and

$49 million

, respectively.

•

We pay franchise fees under multi-year franchise agreements based on a percentage of revenues generated from video service per year.  We also pay other franchise related costs, such as public education grants, under multi-year agreements.  Franchise fees and other franchise-related costs included in the accompanying statement of operations were

$534 million

,

$212 million

and

$208 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


, respectively.

•

We also have

$278 million

in letters of credit, of which

$220 million

is secured under the Charter Operating credit facility, primarily to our various casualty carriers as collateral for reimbursement of workers' compensation, auto liability and general liability claims.

•

Minimum pension funding requirements have not been presented in the table above as such amounts have not been determined beyond


.  We made no cash contributions to the qualified pension plans in


; however, we are permitted to make discretionary cash contributions to the qualified pension plans in


.  For the nonqualified pension plan, we contributed

$5 million

during


and will continue to make contributions in


to the extent benefits are paid.

See "Part I. Item 1. Business — Transaction-Related Commitments" for a listing of commitments as a result of the Transactions.

Historical Operating, Investing, and Financing Activities

Cash and Cash Equivalents.

We held

$1.5 billion

and

$5 million

in cash and cash equivalents as of

December 31, 2016

and


, respectively.   We also held

$22.3 billion

in restricted cash and cash equivalents as of

December 31, 2015

representing proceeds of debt raised to fund the cash portion of the TWC Transaction consideration that were held in escrow until consummation of the TWC Transaction.

Operating Activities.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased

$5.7 billion

during the

year

ended

December 31, 2016

compared to the

year

ended

December 31, 2015

, primarily due to an increase in Adjusted EBITDA of

$7.2 billion

offset by an increase in cash paid for interest, net of $1.6 billion.

Net cash provided by operating activities remained flat at

$2.4 billion

for the years ended

December 31, 2015

and


.

Investing Activities.

Net cash used in investing activities for the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


, was

$11.3 billion

,

$17.0 billion

and

$9.3 billion

, respectively.  Cash used in investing activities during the year ended

December 31, 2016

primarily represented the acquisitions of Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House with long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents and an increase in capital expenditures of

$3.5 billion

as compared to 2015.

The increase in 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily due to an increase in the investment of net proceeds from the issuance of the CCO Safari II notes, CCO Safari III credit facilities and CCOH Safari notes related to the TWC Transaction in long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents offset by a decrease in long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents upon repayment of the Term G Loans and CCOH Safari notes out of escrow related to the Comcast Transactions and a decrease in capital expenditures.

Financing Activities.

Net cash provided in financing activities was

$4.8 billion

,

$14.7 billion

and

$6.9 billion

for the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


, respectively.  Cash provided during the year ended

December 31, 2016

primarily represented the issuance of $5 billion of equity to Liberty Broadband to fund a portion of the Transactions in 2016 offset by an increase in the purchase of treasury stock of $1.5 billion as compared to 2015.

The increase in cash provided during the year ended

December 31, 2015

as compared to the corresponding period in


was primarily the result of the issuance of the CCO Safari II notes, CCO Safari III credit facilities and CCOH Safari notes related to the TWC Transaction offset by the repayment of $7.1 billion of net proceeds held in escrow related to the CCOH Safari notes and Term G Loans upon the termination of the Comcast Transactions.

Capital Expenditures

We have significant ongoing capital expenditure requirements.  Capital expenditures were

$5.3 billion

,

for the years ended

,


and


, respectively.   The increase was driven by the Transactions.  On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, the increase for the

year

ended

December 31, 2016

compared


to the corresponding prior period was driven by higher product development investments, transition capital expenditures incurred in connection with the Transactions and support capital investments.  See the table below for more details.

The actual amount of our capital expenditures in 2017 will depend on a number of factors, including the pace of transition planning to service a larger customer base as a result of the Transactions, our all-digital transition in the Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House markets and growth rates of both our residential and commercial businesses.

Our capital expenditures are funded primarily from cash flows from operating activities and borrowings on our credit facility.  In addition, our liabilities related to capital expenditures increased by

$603 million

,

$28 million

and

$33 million

for the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


, respectively.

The following tables present our major capital expenditures categories on an actual and pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, in accordance with National Cable and Telecommunications Association (“NCTA”) disclosure guidelines for the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


and


.  The disclosure is intended to provide more consistency in the reporting of capital expenditures among peer companies in the cable industry.  These disclosure guidelines are not required disclosures under GAAP, nor do they impact our accounting for capital expenditures under GAAP (dollars in millions):

(a)

Customer premise equipment includes costs incurred at the customer residence to secure new customers and revenue generating units.  It also includes customer installation costs and customer premise equipment (e.g., set-top boxes and cable modems).

(b)

Scalable infrastructure includes costs not related to customer premise equipment, to secure growth of new customers and revenue generating units, or provide service enhancements (e.g., headend equipment).

(c)

Line extensions include network costs associated with entering new service areas (e.g., fiber/coaxial cable, amplifiers, electronic equipment, make-ready and design engineering).

(d)

Upgrade/rebuild includes costs to modify or replace existing fiber/coaxial cable networks, including betterments.

(e)

Support capital includes costs associated with the replacement or enhancement of non-network assets due to technological and physical obsolescence (e.g., non-network equipment, land, buildings and vehicles).

(f)

Transition represents incremental costs incurred to integrate the Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House operations and to bring the three companies’ systems and processes into a uniform operating structure.


Debt

As of

December 31, 2016

, the accreted value of our total debt was approximately

$61.7 billion

, as summarized below (dollars in millions):


(a)

The accreted values presented in the table above represent the principal amount of the debt less the original issue discount at the time of sale, deferred financing costs, and, (i) in regards to the Legacy TWC debt assumed, a fair value premium adjustment as a result of applying acquisition accounting plus/minus the accretion of those amounts to the balance sheet date and (ii) in regards to the fixed-rate British pound sterling denominated notes (the “Sterling Notes”), a remeasurement of the principal amount of the debt and any premium or discount into US dollars as of the balance sheet date. However, the amount that is currently payable if the debt becomes immediately due is equal to the principal amount of the debt.  We have availability under our credit facilities of approximately

$2.8 billion

as of

December 31, 2016

.

(b)

In general, the obligors have the right to redeem all of the notes set forth in the above table in whole or in part at their option, beginning at various times prior to their stated maturity dates, subject to certain conditions, upon the payment of the outstanding principal amount (plus a specified redemption premium) and all accrued and unpaid interest. For additional information see “Description of our Outstanding Debt” below.

(c)

Principal amount includes

£625 million

valued at

$770 million

.

(d)

Principal amount includes

See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further details regarding our outstanding debt and other financing arrangements, including certain information about maturities, covenants and restrictions related to such debt and financing arrangements. The agreements and instruments governing our debt and financing arrangements are complicated and you should consult such agreements and instruments which are filed with the SEC for more detailed information.

At

December 31, 2016

, Charter Operating had a consolidated leverage ratio of approximately 2.8 to 1.0 and a consolidated first lien leverage ratio of 2.7 to 1.0.   Both ratios are in compliance with the ratios required by the Charter Operating credit facilities of 5.0 to 1.0 consolidated leverage ratio and 4.0 to 1.0 consolidated first lien leverage ratio.  A failure by Charter Operating to maintain the financial covenants would result in an event of default under the Charter Operating credit facilities and the debt of CCO Holdings.  See “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors — The agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business, as well as significantly affect our liquidity.”

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

See Note 22 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

We use derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk on variable debt and foreign exchange risk on the Sterling Notes, and do not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes.

Interest rate derivative instruments are used to manage interest costs and to reduce our exposure to increases in floating interest rates.  We manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by maintaining a mix of fixed and variable-rate debt.  Using interest rate derivative instruments, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals through 2017, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to agreed-upon notional principal amounts.

Upon closing of the TWC Transaction, we assumed cross-currency derivative instruments.  Cross-currency derivative instruments are used to effectively convert £1.275 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate British pound sterling denominated debt, including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to fixed-rate U.S. dollar denominated debt. The cross-currency derivative instruments have maturities of June 2031 and July 2042. We are required to post collateral on the cross-currency derivative instruments when such instruments are in a liability position. In May 2016, we entered into a collateral holiday agreement for 80% of both the 2031 and 2042 cross-currency swaps, which eliminates the requirement to post collateral for three years.  For more information, see Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

As of

December 31, 2016

and


, the weighted average interest rate on the credit facility debt, including the effects of our interest rate swap agreements, was approximately 2.9% and 3.3%, respectively, and the weighted average interest rate on the senior notes was approximately 5.9% and 5.5%, respectively, resulting in a blended weighted average interest rate of 5.4% and 5.1%, respectively.  The interest rate on approximately

87%

and

83%

of the total principal amount of our debt was effectively fixed, including the effects of our interest rate swap agreements, as of

December 31, 2016

and


, respectively.


The table set forth below summarizes the fair values and contract terms of financial instruments subject to interest rate risk maintained by us as of

December 31, 2016

(dollars in millions):

As of

December 31, 2016

, we had

$850 million

in notional amounts of interest rate derivative instruments outstanding.  The notional amounts of interest rate derivative instruments do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, thus, are not a measure of our exposure to credit loss.  The amounts exchanged are determined by reference to the notional amount and the other terms of the contracts.

The estimated fair value of the interest rate derivative instruments is determined using a present value calculation based on an implied forward LIBOR curve (adjusted for Charter Operating’s or counterparties’ credit risk).  Interest rates on variable-rate debt are estimated using the average implied forward LIBOR for the year of maturity based on the yield curve in effect at

December 31, 2016

including applicable bank spread.

Controls and Procedures.

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this report, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of disclosure controls and procedures with respect to the information generated for use in this annual report.  The evaluation was based upon reports and certifications provided by a number of executives.  Based on, and as of the date of that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurances that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.

In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  Based upon the above evaluation, we believe that our controls provide such reasonable assurances.

On May 18, 2016, we completed the Transactions and as a result, we have incorporated internal controls over significant processes specific to the Transactions and to activities post-Transactions that we believe to be appropriate and necessary in consideration of the related integration, including controls associated with the Transactions for the valuations of certain Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House assets and liabilities assumed, as well as adoption of common financial reporting and internal control practices for


the combined company.  In October 2016, Legacy TWC was converted to the Legacy Charter's enterprise resource planning system which resulted in significant changes to the nature and type of internal controls for the most recent fiscal quarter.  As we further integrate Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House, we will continue to validate the effectiveness and integration of internal controls.

Except as described above in the preceding paragraph, during the quarter ended

December 31, 2016

, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) for the Company.  Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.

Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2016

.  In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

(2013)

.

As permitted by guidance issued by the SEC, we have excluded from the scope of our assessment of internal control over financial reporting the operations and related assets of Legacy Bright House.  As of December 31, 2016 and for the period from acquisition through December 31, 2016, both total assets and revenues subject to Bright House’s internal control over financial reporting represented 9% of our consolidated total assets (including goodwill, intangibles and property, plant and equipment acquired in the Bright House Transaction and included within the scope of the assessment) and total revenues as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016.  Based on management’s assessment utilizing these criteria we believe that, as of

December 31, 2016

, our internal control over financial reporting was effective

.

Our independent auditors, KPMG LLP, have audited our internal control over financial reporting as stated in their report on page F-2.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Charter Communications, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Charter Communications, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in shareholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2016. We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting (Item 9A). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Charter Communications, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Charter Communications, Inc. acquired Bright House Networks, LLC (Legacy Bright House) during 2016. Management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, the operations and related assets of Legacy Bright House. As of December 31, 2016 and for the period from acquisition through December 31, 2016, both total assets and revenues subject to Legacy Bright House’s internal control over financial reporting represented approximately 9% of the Company’s consolidated total assets (including goodwill, intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment acquired from Legacy Bright House that are included within the scope of the assessment) and consolidated total revenues as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Charter Communications, Inc. also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Bright House Networks, LLC as of December 31, 2016.

(dollars in millions, except share or per share data or where indicated)

1.    Organization and Basis of Presentation

Organization

Charter Communications, Inc. (together with its controlled subsidiaries, “Charter,” or the “Company”) is the second largest cable operator in the United States and a leading broadband communications company providing video, Internet and voice services to residential and business customers.  In addition, the Company sells video and online advertising inventory to local, regional and national advertising customers and fiber-delivered communications and managed information technology solutions to larger enterprise customers.  The Company also owns and operates regional sports networks and local sports, news and lifestyle channels and sells security and home management services to the residential marketplace.

Charter is a holding company whose principal asset is a controlling equity interest in Charter Communications Holdings, LLC (“Charter Holdings”), an indirect owner of Charter Communications Operating, LLC (“Charter Operating”) under which substantially all of the operations reside. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions among consolidated entities have been eliminated.

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Areas involving significant judgments and estimates include capitalization of labor and overhead costs; depreciation and amortization costs; purchase accounting valuations of assets and liabilities including, but not limited to, property, plant and equipment, intangibles and goodwill; pension benefits; income taxes; contingencies and programming expense.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

2.    Mergers and Acquisitions

TWC Transaction

On May 18, 2016, the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Mergers dated as of May 23, 2015 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Time Warner Cable Inc. (“Legacy TWC”), Charter Communications, Inc. prior to the closing of the Merger Agreement (“Legacy Charter”), CCH I, LLC, previously a wholly owned subsidiary of Legacy Charter (“New Charter”) and certain other subsidiaries of New Charter were completed (the “TWC Transaction,” and together with the Bright House Transaction described below, the “Transactions”).  As a result of the TWC Transaction, New Charter became the new public parent company that holds the operations of the combined companies and was renamed Charter Communications, Inc.

Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, upon consummation of the TWC Transaction, each outstanding share of Legacy TWC common stock (other than Legacy TWC common stock held by Liberty Broadband Corporation (“Liberty Broadband”) and Liberty Interactive Corporation (“Liberty Interactive” and, collectively, the “Liberty Parties”)), was converted into the right to receive, at the option of each such holder of Legacy TWC common stock, either (a)

$100

in cash and Charter Class A common stock equivalent to

0.5409

shares of Legacy Charter Class A common stock (the “Option A Consideration”) or (b)

$115

in cash and Charter Class A common stock equivalent to

0.4562

shares of Legacy Charter Class A common stock (the “Option B Consideration”). The actual number of shares of Charter Class A common stock that Legacy TWC stockholders received, excluding the Liberty Parties, was calculated by multiplying the exchange ratios of

0.5409

or

0.4562

specified above by

0.9042

(the “Parent Merger Exchange Ratio”), which was also the exchange ratio that was used to determine the number of shares of Charter Class A common stock that Legacy Charter stockholders received per share of Legacy Charter Class A common stock.  Such exchange ratio did not impact the aggregate value represented by the shares of Charter Class A common stock issued in the TWC Transaction; however, it did impact the actual number of shares issued in the TWC Transaction.

Out of approximately

277 million

shares of TWC common stock outstanding at the closing of the TWC Transaction, excluding TWC common stock held by the Liberty Parties, approximately

274 million

shares were converted into the right to receive the

F- 9

CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015 AND 2014

(dollars in millions, except share or per share data or where indicated)

Option A Consideration and approximately

3 million

shares were converted into the right to receive the Option B Consideration.  The Liberty Parties received approximately

one

share of Charter Class A common stock for each share of Legacy TWC common stock they owned (equivalent to

1.106

shares of Legacy Charter Class A common stock multiplied by the Parent Merger Exchange Ratio).

As of the date of completion of the Transactions, the total value of the TWC Transaction was approximately

$85 billion

, including cash, equity and Legacy TWC assumed debt.  The purchase price also includes an estimated pre-combination vesting period fair value of

$514 million

for Legacy TWC equity awards converted into Charter awards upon closing of the TWC Transaction (“Converted TWC Awards”) and

$69 million

of cash paid to former Legacy TWC employees and non-employee directors who held equity awards, whether vested or not vested.

Bright House Transaction

Also, on May 18, 2016, Legacy Charter and Advance/Newhouse Partnership (“A/N”), the former parent of Bright House Networks, LLC (“Bright House”), completed their previously announced transaction, pursuant to a definitive Contribution Agreement (the “Contribution Agreement”), under which Charter acquired Bright House (the “Bright House Transaction”).  Pursuant to the Bright House Transaction, Charter became the owner of the membership interests in Bright House and the other assets primarily related to Bright House (other than certain excluded assets and liabilities and non-operating cash).  As of the date of acquisition, the purchase price totaled approximately

$12.2 billion

consisting of (a)

$2.0 billion

in cash, (b)

25 million

convertible preferred units of Charter Holdings with a face amount of

$2.5 billion

that pay a

6%

annual preferential dividend, (c) approximately

31.0 million

common units of Charter Holdings that are exchangeable into Charter Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis and (d)

one

share of Charter Class B common stock.  These Charter Holdings common and convertible preferred units held by A/N are recorded in noncontrolling interests as permanent equity in the consolidated balance sheet.  See Note 11 for conversion features of the Charter Holdings common and preferred units and Note 10 for the terms of the Charter Class B common stock.

Liberty Transaction

In connection with the TWC Transaction, Legacy Charter and Liberty Broadband completed their previously announced transactions pursuant to their investment agreement, in which Liberty Broadband purchased for cash approximately

22.0 million

shares of Charter Class A common stock valued at

$4.3 billion

at the closing of the TWC Transaction to partially finance the cash portion of the TWC Transaction consideration, and in connection with the Bright House Transaction, Liberty Broadband purchased approximately

3.7 million

shares of Charter Class A common stock valued at

$700 million

at the closing of the Bright House Transaction (the “Liberty Transaction”).

Financing for the Transactions

Charter partially financed the cash portion of the purchase price of the Transactions with additional indebtedness and cash on hand.  In 2015, Legacy Charter issued

$15.5 billion

aggregate principal amount of CCO Safari II, LLC (“CCO Safari II”) senior secured notes,

$3.8 billion

aggregate principal amount of CCO Safari III, LLC (“CCO Safari III”) senior secured bank loans and

$2.5 billion

aggregate principal amount of CCOH Safari, LLC (“CCOH Safari”) senior unsecured notes.  The net proceeds were initially deposited into escrow accounts.  Upon closing of the TWC Transaction, the proceeds were released from escrow and the CCOH Safari notes became obligations of CCO Holdings, LLC (“CCO Holdings”), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Charter Holdings, and CCO Holdings Capital Corp. (“CCO Holdings Capital”), and the CCO Safari II notes and CCO Safari III credit facilities became obligations of Charter Operating and Charter Communications Operating Capital Corp. CCOH Safari merged into CCO Holdings and CCO Safari II and CCO Safari III merged into Charter Operating.

In connection with the closing of the Bright House Transaction, Charter Operating closed on a

$2.6 billion

aggregate principal amount term loan A facility (“Term Loan A”) pursuant to the terms of Charter Operating’s Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated May 18, 2016 (the “Credit Agreement”) of which

$2.0 billion

was used to fund the cash portion of the Bright House Transaction and

$638 million

was used to prepay and terminate Charter Operating’s existing Term A-1 Loans.  See Note 9.

Acquisition Accounting

The Transactions enable Charter to apply its operating strategy to a larger set of assets, accelerate product development and innovation through greater scale as well as more effectively compete in medium and large commercial markets.  The operating

F- 10

CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015 AND 2014

(dollars in millions, except share or per share data or where indicated)

results of Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House have been included in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations for the period from the date of the Transactions through

December 31, 2016

.  Revenues included in the Company's consolidated statements of operations were

$16.0 billion

and

$2.6 billion

for Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Charter applied acquisition accounting to the Transactions. The total purchase price was allocated to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values.  The fair values were primarily based on third-party valuations using assumptions developed by management and other information compiled by management including, but not limited to, future expected cash flows.  The excess of the purchase price over those fair values was recorded as goodwill.  Goodwill recognized in the Transactions is representative of resources that do not meet the definition of an identifiable intangible asset and include buy-side synergies, economies of scale of the combined operations, increased market share, assembled workforces and improved credit rating.

The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were preliminarily determined using the income, cost and market approaches.  The fair values were primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement, other than long-term debt assumed in the TWC Transaction, which represents a Level 1 measurement.  See Note 13.

Property, plant and equipment was valued utilizing the cost approach.  The cost approach considers the amount required to replace an asset by constructing or purchasing a new asset with similar utility, then adjusts the value in consideration of all forms of depreciation as of the appraisal date as described below:

•

Physical depreciation - the loss in value or usefulness attributable solely to use of the asset and physical causes such as wear and tear and exposure to the elements.

•

Functional obsolescence - the loss in value due to factors inherent in the asset itself and due to changes in technology, design or process resulting in inadequacy, overcapacity, lack of functional utility or excess operating costs.

•

Economic obsolescence - the loss in value due to unfavorable external conditions such as economics of the industry or geographic area, or change in ordinances.

The cost approach relies on assumptions regarding current material and labor costs required to rebuild and repurchase significant components of property, plant and equipment along with assumptions regarding the age and estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment.

Franchise rights and customer relationships were valued using an income approach model based on the present value of the estimated discrete future cash flows attributable to each of the intangible assets identified.  See Note 6 for more information on the income approach model.  The weighted average life of customer relationships acquired in the TWC Transaction and Bright House Transaction was


years and


years, respectively.

The fair value of equity investments was based on either applying implied multiples to estimated cash flows or utilizing a discounted cash flow model. The implied multiples were estimated based on precedent transactions and comparable companies. The discounted cash flow model required estimating the present value of future cash flows of the investee.

Legacy TWC long-term debt assumed was adjusted to fair value based on quoted market prices.  At the acquisition date, the quoted market values of all but two of Legacy TWC’s bonds were higher than the principal amount of the related debt instrument, which resulted in the recognition of a net debt premium of approximately

$2.4 billion

.  The quoted market value of a debt instrument is higher than the principal amount of the debt when the market interest rates are lower than the stated interest rate of the debt. This debt premium is amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining life of the applicable debt.

Generally, no fair value adjustments were reflected in current assets and current liabilities as carrying value is estimated to approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of the items, except for risk management obligations.  Risk management obligations assumed including various claims for workers compensation, employment practices, and auto and general liabilities were measured at fair value as of the acquisition date based on an actuarially determined study.  Fair value adjustments were reflected in other noncurrent assets and other long-term liabilities relating to contract-based assets and liabilities, capital lease obligations, deferred liabilities and net pension liabilities.  Out-of-market contract-based assets and liabilities relating to non-cancelable executory contracts and operating leases were recognized based on discounted cash flow models to the extent the terms

of the non-cancelable contracts are favorable or unfavorable compared with the relative market terms of the same or similar contract at the acquisition date.  The out-of-market element will be amortized as if the contract were consummated at market terms on the acquisition date.  Capital lease obligations were measured at fair value based on the present value of amounts to be paid under the lease agreement using a market participant discount rate.  Deferred liabilities were not recorded in acquisition accounting to the extent there was no associated payment obligation or substantive performance obligation.  The net pension liabilities assumed in the TWC Transaction were measured at fair value based on an actuarially determined projected benefit obligation, less the fair value of pension investments, as of the acquisition date. See Note 21 for fair value assumptions considered in acquisition accounting for the net pension liabilities.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities were recorded for the deferred tax impact of acquisition accounting adjustments primarily related to property, plant and equipment, franchises, customer relationships and assumed Legacy TWC long-term debt. The incremental deferred tax liabilities were calculated primarily based on the tax effect of the step-up in book basis of net assets of Legacy TWC excluding the amount attributable to nondeductible goodwill.

The Charter Class A common stock issued to Legacy TWC stockholders and Charter Holdings common units issued to A/N were valued based on the opening share price of Charter Class A common stock on the acquisition date.  The convertible preferred units of Charter Holdings issued to A/N were valued at approximately

$3.2 billion

based on a binomial lattice model for convertible bonds that models the future changes in the common equity value of Charter.  The valuation relies on management’s assumptions including risk-free interest rate, volatility and discount yield. The pre-combination vesting period fair value of the Converted TWC Awards was based on the portion of the requisite service period completed at the acquisition date by Legacy TWC employee award holders applied to the total fair value of the Converted TWC Awards.

The allocation of the purchase price to certain assets and liabilities is preliminary and is subject to change based on additional information that may be obtained during the measurement period primarily related to working capital measurement.  The Company will continue to obtain information to assist in finalizing the fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which is not expected to differ materially from the preliminary estimates herein. The Company will apply any measurement period adjustments, including any related impacts to net income (loss), in the reporting period in which the adjustments are determined.  The tables below present the calculation of the purchase price and the preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Transactions.

Selected Pro Forma Financial Information

The following unaudited pro forma financial information of the Company is based on the historical consolidated financial statements of Legacy Charter, Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House and is intended to provide information about how the Transactions and related financing may have affected the Company’s historical consolidated financial statements if they had closed as of January 1, 2015. The pro forma financial information below is based on available information and assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable. The pro forma financial information is for illustrative and informational purposes only and is not intended to represent or be indicative of what the Company’s financial condition or results of operations would have been had the transactions described above occurred on the date indicated. The pro forma financial information also should not be considered representative of the Company’s future financial condition or results of operations.

3.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Charter and all entities in which Charter has a controlling interest.  The Company consolidates based upon evaluation of the Company’s power, through voting rights or similar rights, to direct the activities of another entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance; its obligation to

(dollars in millions, except share or per share data or where indicated)

absorb the expected losses of the entity; and its right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity.  Charter controls and consolidates Charter Holdings.  The noncontrolling interest on the Company’s balance sheet primarily represents A/N’s minority equity interests in Charter Holdings.  See Note 11.  All significant inter-company accounts and transactions among consolidated entities have been eliminated in consolidation.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  These investments are carried at cost, which approximates market value.  Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds and commercial paper.

Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents

Proceeds from the issuance of certain long-term debt were deposited into escrow accounts and were used for acquisition financing and were contractually restricted as to their withdrawal or use.  See Note 2.  The amounts held in escrow were classified as noncurrent restricted cash and cash equivalents in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2015.  The Company’s restricted cash and cash equivalents were primarily invested in money market funds and 90-day or less commercial paper.  The changes in restricted cash and cash equivalents are presented as an investing activity in the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Additions to property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including all material, labor and certain indirect costs associated with the construction of cable transmission and distribution facilities.  While the Company’s capitalization is based on specific activities, once capitalized, costs are tracked on a composite basis by fixed asset category at the cable system level and not on a specific asset basis.  For assets that are sold or retired, the estimated historical cost and related accumulated depreciation is removed.  Costs associated with the initial placement of the customer drop to the dwelling and the initial placement of outlets within a dwelling along with the costs associated with the initial deployment of customer premise equipment necessary to provide video, Internet or voice services are capitalized.  Costs capitalized include materials, direct labor, and certain indirect costs.  Indirect costs are associated with the activities of the Company’s personnel who assist in installation activities and consist of compensation and other costs associated with these support functions.  Indirect costs primarily include employee benefits and payroll taxes, vehicle and occupancy costs, and the costs of sales and dispatch personnel associated with capitalizable activities.  The costs of disconnecting service and removing customer premise equipment from a dwelling and the costs to reconnect a customer drop or to redeploy previously installed customer premise equipment are charged to operating expensed as incurred.  Costs for repairs and maintenance are charged to operating expense as incurred, while plant and equipment replacement, including replacement of certain components, betterments, including replacement of cable drops and outlets, are capitalized.

Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line composite method over management’s estimate of the useful lives of the related assets as follows:

Asset Retirement Obligations

Certain of the Company’s franchise agreements and leases contain provisions requiring the Company to restore facilities or remove equipment in the event that the franchise or lease agreement is not renewed.  The Company expects to continually renew its franchise agreements and therefore cannot reasonably estimate any liabilities associated with such agreements. A remote possibility exists that franchise agreements could be terminated unexpectedly, which could result in the Company incurring significant expense in complying with restoration or removal provisions. The Company does not have any significant liabilities related to asset retirements recorded in its consolidated financial statements.

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets

The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets (e.g., property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets) to be held and used when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  Such events or changes in circumstances could include such factors as impairment of the Company’s indefinite life assets, changes in technological advances, fluctuations in the fair value of such assets, adverse changes in relationships with local franchise authorities, adverse changes in market conditions or a deterioration of operating results.  If a review indicates that the carrying value of such asset is not recoverable from estimated undiscounted cash flows, the carrying value of such asset is reduced to its estimated fair value.  While the Company believes that its estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect its evaluations of asset recoverability.

No

impairments of long-lived assets to be held and used were recorded in


,


and


.

Other Noncurrent Assets

Other noncurrent assets primarily include investments, trademarks, right-of-entry costs and other intangible assets.  The Company accounts for its investments in less than majority owned investees under either the equity or cost method. The Company applies the equity method to investments when it has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. The Company’s share of the investee’s earnings (losses) is included in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company monitors its investments for indicators that a decrease in investment value has occurred that is other than temporary. If it has been determined that an investment has sustained an other than temporary decline in value, the investment is written down to fair value with a charge to earnings. Investments acquired are measured at fair value utilizing the acquisition method of accounting. The difference between the fair value and the amount of underlying equity in net assets for most equity method investments is due to previously unrecognized intangible assets at the investee.  These amounts are amortized as a component of equity earnings (losses), recorded within other expense, net over the estimated useful life of the asset.  Trademarks have been determined to have an indefinite life and are tested annually for impairment.  Right-of-entry costs represent costs incurred related to agreements entered into with landlords, real estate companies or owners to gain access to a building in order to provide cable service.  Right-of-entry costs are generally deferred and amortized to amortization expense over the term of the agreement.

Revenue Recognition

Revenues from residential and commercial video, Internet and voice services are recognized when the related services are provided.  Advertising sales are recognized at estimated realizable values in the period that the advertisements are broadcast.  In some cases, the Company coordinates the advertising sales efforts of other cable operators in a certain market and remits amounts received from customers less an agreed-upon percentage to such cable operator.  For those arrangements in which the Company acts as a principal, the Company records the revenues earned from the advertising customer on a gross basis and the amount remitted to the cable operator as an operating expense.

Fees imposed on the Company by various governmental authorities are passed through on a monthly basis to the Company’s customers and are periodically remitted to authorities.  Fees of

.

Other taxes, such as sales taxes imposed on the Company’s customers, collected and remitted to state and local authorities, are recorded on a net basis because the Company is acting as an agent in such situation.

The Company’s revenues by product line are as follows:

Programming Costs

The Company has various contracts to obtain video programming from vendors whose compensation is typically based on a flat fee per customer.  The cost of the right to exhibit network programming under such arrangements is recorded in operating expenses in the month the programming is available for exhibition.  Programming costs are paid each month based on calculations performed by the Company and are subject to periodic audits performed by the programmers.  Certain programming contracts contain incentives to be paid by the programmers.  The Company receives these payments and recognizes the incentives on a straight-line basis over the life of the programming agreement as a reduction of programming expense.  Programming costs included in the statements of operations were

$7.0 billion

$2.7 billion

and

for the years ended

,


and


, respectively.

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs associated with marketing the Company’s products and services are generally expensed as costs are incurred.

Multiple-Element Transactions

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into multiple-element transactions where it is simultaneously both a customer and a vendor with the same counterparty or in which it purchases multiple products and/or services, or settles outstanding items contemporaneous with the purchase of a product or service from a single counterparty.  Transactions, although negotiated contemporaneously, may be documented in one or more contracts.  The Company’s policy for accounting for each transaction negotiated contemporaneously is to record each element of the transaction based on the respective estimated fair values of the products or services purchased and the products or services sold.  In determining the fair value of the respective elements, the Company refers to quoted market prices (where available), historical transactions or comparable cash transactions.  Cash consideration received from a vendor is recorded as a reduction in the price of the vendor’s product unless (i) the consideration is for the reimbursement of a specific, incremental, identifiable cost incurred, in which case the cash consideration received would be recorded as a reduction in such cost (e.g., marketing costs), or (ii) an identifiable benefit in exchange for the consideration is provided, in which case revenue would be recognized for this element.

Stock-Based Compensation

Restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock options as well as equity awards with market conditions are measured at the grant date fair value and amortized to stock compensation expense over the requisite service period.  The fair value of options is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the fair value of  equity awards with market conditions is estimated on the date of grant using Monte Carlo simulations.  The grant date weighted average assumptions used during the years

The Company’s volatility assumptions represent management’s best estimate and were partially based on historical volatility of Legacy TWC due to the completion of the Transactions.   Expected lives were estimated using historical exercise data.  The valuations assume no dividends are paid.

Pension Plans

The Company sponsors the TWC Pension Plan, TWC Union Pension Plan and TWC Excess Pension Plan (as defined in Note 21).  Pension benefits are based on formulas that reflect the employees’ years of service and compensation during their employment period.  Actuarial gains or losses are changes in the amount of either the benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets resulting from experience different from that assumed or from changes in assumptions.  The Company has elected to follow a mark-to-market pension accounting policy for recording the actuarial gains or losses annually during the fourth quarter, or earlier if a remeasurement event occurs during an interim period.

Income Taxes

The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company’s assets and liabilities and expected benefits of utilizing loss carryforwards.  Since substantially all the Company’s operations are held through its partnership interest in Charter Holdings, the primary deferred tax component recorded in the consolidated balance sheet relates to the excess financial reporting outside basis, excluding amounts attributable to nondeductible goodwill, over Charter’s tax basis in its investment in the partnership.  Valuation allowances are established when management determines that it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized.  The impact on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates and tax law, if any, applied to the years during which temporary differences are expected to be settled, are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period of enactment.  In determining the Company’s tax provision for financial reporting purposes, the Company establishes a reserve for uncertain tax positions unless such positions are determined to be “more likely than not” of being sustained upon examination, based on their technical merits. There is considerable judgment involved in making such a determination.  Interest and penalties are recognized on uncertain income tax positions as part of the income tax provision.  See Note 17.

Segments

The Company’s operations are managed and reported to its Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), the Company’s chief operating decision maker, on a consolidated basis.  The CEO assesses performance and allocates resources based on the consolidated results of operations.  Under this organizational and reporting structure, the Company has

The Company periodically evaluates the estimated useful lives used to depreciate its assets and the estimated amount of assets that will be abandoned or have minimal use in the future.  A significant change in assumptions about the extent or timing of future asset retirements, or in the Company’s use of new technology and upgrade programs, could materially affect future depreciation expense.

$1.8 billion

, respectively. Property, plant and equipment increased by

as a result of the Transactions. See Note 2.

6.    Franchises, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Franchise rights represent the value attributed to agreements or authorizations with local and state authorities that allow access to homes in cable service areas.  For valuation purposes, they are defined as the future economic benefits of the right to solicit and service potential customers (customer marketing rights), and the right to deploy and market new services to potential customers (service marketing rights).

Management estimates the fair value of franchise rights at the date of acquisition and determines if the franchise has a finite life or an indefinite life.  The Company has concluded that all of its franchises, including those acquired as part of the Transactions, qualify for indefinite life treatment given that there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors which limit the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows. We reassess this determination periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur.

The estimated fair value of franchises is determined utilizing an income approach model based on the present value of the estimated discrete future cash flows attributable to each of the intangible assets identified assuming a discount rate.  The fair value of franchises is determined based on estimated discrete discounted future cash flows using assumptions consistent with internal forecasts.  The franchise after-tax cash flow is calculated as the after-tax cash flow generated by the potential customers obtained.  The sum of the present value of the franchises’ after-tax cash flow in years 1 through 10 and the continuing value of the after-tax cash flow beyond year 10 yields the fair value of the franchises.

This approach makes use of unobservable factors such as projected revenues, expenses, capital expenditures, customer trends, and a discount rate applied to the estimated cash flows. The determination of the franchise discount rate is derived from the Company’s weighted average cost of capital, which uses a market participant’s cost of equity and after-tax cost of debt and reflects the risks inherent in the cash flows.  The Company estimates discounted future cash flows using reasonable and appropriate assumptions including among others, penetration rates for video, Internet, and voice; revenue growth rates; operating margins; and capital expenditures.  The assumptions are based on the Company’s and its peers’ historical operating performance adjusted for current and expected competitive and economic factors surrounding the cable industry.  The estimates and assumptions made in the Company’s valuations are inherently subject to significant uncertainties, many of which are beyond its control, and there is no assurance that these results can be achieved. The primary assumptions for which there is a reasonable possibility of the occurrence of a variation that would significantly affect the measurement value include the assumptions regarding revenue growth,

programming expense growth rates, the amount and timing of capital expenditures, actual customer trends and the discount rate utilized.

All franchises are tested for impairment annually or more frequently as warranted by events or changes in circumstances.  Franchise assets are aggregated into essentially inseparable units of accounting to conduct valuations.  The units of accounting generally represent geographical clustering of our cable systems into groups.  The Company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset has been impaired.  If, after this optional qualitative assessment, the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset has been impaired, then no further quantitative testing is necessary.  In completing the qualitative impairment testing, the Company evaluates a multitude of factors that affect the fair value of our franchise assets. Examples of such factors include environmental and competitive changes within our operating footprint, actual and projected operating performance, the consistency of our operating margins, equity and debt market trends, including changes in our market capitalization, and changes in our regulatory and political landscape, among other factors.  After consideration of the qualitative factors, in


the Company concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the franchise assets in each unit of accounting exceeds the carrying value of such assets and therefore did not perform a quantitative analysis.  Periodically, the Company will elect to perform a quantitative analysis for impairment testing. If the Company elects or is required to perform a quantitative analysis to test its franchise assets for impairment, the methodology described above is utilized.

The fair value of goodwill is determined using both an income approach and market approach.  The Company’s income approach model used for its goodwill valuation is consistent with that used for its franchise valuation noted above except that cash flows from the entire business enterprise are used for the goodwill valuation.  The Company’s market approach model estimates the fair value of the reporting unit based on market prices in actual precedent transactions of similar businesses and market valuations of guideline public companies.  Goodwill is tested for impairment as of November 30 of each year

,

or more frequently as warranted by events or changes in circumstances.  Accounting guidance also permits an optional qualitative assessment for goodwill to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value.  If, after this qualitative assessment, the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then no further quantitative testing would be necessary.  If the Company elects or is required to perform the two-step test under the accounting guidance, the first step involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount.  If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and the second step of the goodwill impairment is not necessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, then the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed, and a comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to its carrying amount to determine the amount of impairment, if any.  As with the Company’s franchise impairment testing, in


the Company elected to perform a qualitative goodwill impairment assessment and concluded that goodwill is not impaired.

Customer relationships are recorded at fair value as of the date acquired less accumulated amortization.  Customer relationships, for valuation purposes, represent the value of the business relationship with existing customers, and are calculated by projecting the discrete future after-tax cash flows from these customers, including the right to deploy and market additional services to these customers.  The present value of these after-tax cash flows yields the fair value of the customer relationships.  The use of different valuation assumptions or definitions of franchises or customer relationships, such as our inclusion of the value of selling additional services to our current customers within customer relationships versus franchises, could significantly impact our valuations and any resulting impairment.  Customer relationships are amortized on an accelerated sum of years’ digits method over useful lives of


-


years based on the period over which current customers are expected to generate cash flows.  The Company periodically evaluates the remaining useful lives of its customer relationships to determine whether events or circumstances warrant revision to the remaining periods of amortization.  Customer relationships are evaluated for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  Customer relationships are deemed impaired when the carrying value exceeds the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the customer relationships. No impairment of customer relationships was recorded in the years ended

or


.

The fair value of trademarks is determined using the relief-from-royalty method, a variation of the income approach, which applies a fair royalty rate to estimated revenue derived under the Company’s trademarks.  The fair value of the intangible is estimated to be the present value of the royalty saved because the Company owns the trademarks.  Royalty rates are estimated based on a review of market royalty rates in the communications and entertainment industries.   As the Company expects to continue to use each trademark indefinitely, trademarks have been assigned an indefinite life and are tested annually for impairment using either a qualitative analysis or quantitative analysis as elected by management. As with the Company’s franchise impairment testing, in

The Charter Operating credit facilities also allow us to enter into incremental term loans in the future, with amortization as set forth in the notices establishing such term loans.  Although the Charter Operating credit facilities allow for the incurrence of a certain amount of incremental term loans subject to pro forma compliance with its financial maintenance covenants, no assurance can be given that the Company could obtain additional incremental term loans in the future if Charter Operating sought to do so or what amount of incremental term loans would be allowable at any given time under the terms of the Charter Operating credit facilities.

The obligations of Charter Operating under the Charter Operating credit facilities are guaranteed by the Subsidiary Guarantors.

Restrictive Covenants

The Charter Operating credit facilities contain representations and warranties, and affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type. The financial covenants measure performance against standards set for leverage to be tested as of the end of each quarter.  The Charter Operating credit facilities contain provisions requiring mandatory loan prepayments under specific circumstances, including in connection with certain sales of assets, so long as the proceeds have not been reinvested in the business. Additionally, the Charter Operating credit facilities provisions contain an allowance for restricted payments so long as the consolidated leverage ratio is no greater than

3.5

after giving pro forma effect to such restricted payment. The Charter Operating credit facilities permit Charter Operating and its subsidiaries to make distributions to pay interest on the currently outstanding subordinated and parent company indebtedness, provided that, among other things, no default has occurred and is continuing under the Charter Operating credit facilities. The Charter Operating credit facilities also contain customary events of default.

Assumed Legacy TWC Indebtedness

The Company assumed approximately

$22.4 billion

in aggregate principal amount of Time Warner Cable, LLC (successor to Legacy TWC outstanding debt obligations, “TWC, LLC”) senior notes and debentures and Time Warner Cable Enterprises LLC (“TWCE”) senior debentures with varying maturities.  The Company applied acquisition accounting to Legacy TWC, and as a result, the debt assumed was adjusted to fair value using quoted market values as of the closing date.  This fair value adjustment resulted in recognition of a net debt premium of approximately

$2.4 billion

.

TWC, LLC Senior Notes and Debentures

The TWC, LLC senior notes and debentures are guaranteed by CCO Holdings, Charter Operating, TWCE and the Subsidiary Guarantors and rank equally with the liens on the collateral securing obligations under the Charter Operating notes and credit facilities.

The TWC, LLC indenture contains customary covenants relating to restrictions on the ability of TWC, LLC or any material subsidiary to create liens and on the ability of TWC, LLC and TWCE to consolidate, merge or convey or transfer substantially all of their assets. The TWC, LLC indenture also contains customary events of default.

The TWC, LLC senior notes and debentures may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time at TWC, LLC’s option at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) all of the applicable principal amount being redeemed and (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments on the applicable TWC, LLC senior notes and debentures discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis (with the exception of the Sterling Notes, which are on an annual basis), at a comparable government bond rate plus a designated number of basis points as further described in the indenture and the applicable note or debenture, plus, in each case, accrued but unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date.

The Company may offer to redeem all, but not less than all, of the Sterling Notes in the event of certain changes in the tax laws of the U.S. (or any taxing authority in the U.S.). This redemption would be at a redemption price equal to

100%

of the principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest on the Sterling Notes to, but not including, the redemption date.

TWCE Senior Debentures

The TWCE senior debentures are guaranteed by CCO Holdings, Charter Operating, TWC, LLC and the Subsidiary Guarantors and rank equally with the liens on the collateral securing obligations under the Charter Operating notes and credit facilities.  Interest on each series of TWCE senior debentures is payable semi-annually in arrears. The TWCE senior debentures are not redeemable before maturity.

The TWCE indenture contains customary covenants relating to restrictions on the ability of TWCE or any material subsidiary to create liens and on the ability of TWC, LLC and TWCE to consolidate, merge or convey or transfer substantially all of their assets. The TWCE indenture also contains customary events of default.

Limitations on Distributions

Distributions by the Company’s subsidiaries to a parent company for payment of principal on parent company notes are restricted under the indentures and credit facilities discussed above, unless there is no default under the applicable indenture and credit facilities, and unless each applicable subsidiary’s leverage ratio test is met at the time of such distribution.  As of

December 31, 2016

, there was no default under any of these indentures or credit facilities and each subsidiary met its applicable leverage ratio tests based on

December 31, 2016

financial results.  Such distributions would be restricted, however, if any such subsidiary fails to meet these tests at the time of the contemplated distribution. In the past, certain subsidiaries have from time to time failed to meet their leverage ratio test.  There can be no assurance that they will satisfy these tests at the time of the contemplated distribution.  Distributions by Charter Operating for payment of principal on parent company notes are further restricted by the covenants in its credit facilities.

However, without regard to leverage, during any calendar year or any portion thereof during which the borrower is a flow-through entity for tax purposes, and so long as no event of default exists, the borrower may make distributions to the equity interests of the borrower in an amount sufficient to make permitted tax payments.

In addition to the limitation on distributions under the various indentures, distributions by the Company’s subsidiaries may be limited by applicable law, including the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act, under which the Company’s subsidiaries may make distributions if they have “surplus” as defined in the act.

Liquidity and Future Principal Payments

The Company continues to have significant amounts of debt, and its business requires significant cash to fund principal and interest payments on its debt, capital expenditures and ongoing operations.  As set forth below, the Company has significant future principal payments.  The Company continues to monitor the capital markets, and it expects to undertake refinancing transactions and utilize free cash flow and cash on hand to further extend or reduce the maturities of its principal obligations.  The timing and terms of any refinancing transactions will be subject to market conditions.

December 31, 2016

and


.

The Company accounted for treasury stock using the cost method and the treasury shares upon repurchase were reflected on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as a component of total shareholders’ equity.  Upon retirement, these treasury shares are allocated between additional paid-in capital and accumulated deficit based on the cost of original issue included in additional paid-in capital.

In 2014, the Company issued approximately

5.2 million

shares of Charter Class A common stock as a result of exercises by holders who received warrants pursuant to the Joint Plan of Reorganization upon the Company’s emergence from bankruptcy in 2009.   The exercises resulted in proceeds to the Company of approximately

$90 million

.  As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, there were no warrants outstanding.

11.    Noncontrolling Interests

Noncontrolling interests represents consolidated subsidiaries of which the Company owns less than

100%

.  The Company is a holding company whose principal asset is a controlling equity interest in Charter Holdings, the indirect owner of the Company’s cable systems.  Noncontrolling interests on the Company’s balance sheet primarily includes A/N’s equity interests in Charter Holdings, which is comprised of a common ownership interest and a convertible preferred ownership interest.

In connection with the closing of the Bright House Transaction, Charter Holdings issued approximately

31.0 million

common units to A/N, which are exchangeable at any time into either Charter Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, or, at Charter’s option, cash, based on the then current market price of Charter Class A common stock. Net income (loss) of Charter Holdings attributable to A/N’s common noncontrolling interest for financial reporting purposes is based on the weighted average effective common ownership interest of approximately

10%

which was

$129 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2016

.  Charter Holdings distributed

$3 million

to A/N as a pro rata tax distribution on its common units during the year ended

December 31, 2016

.  Charter Holdings also issued approximately

25 million

convertible preferred units to A/N with a face amount of

$2.5 billion

that pay a

6%

annual preferred dividend.  The

6%

annual preferred dividend is paid quarterly in cash, if and when declared, provided that, if dividends are suspended at any time, the dividends will accrue until they are paid.  Net income (loss) of Charter Holdings attributable to the preferred noncontrolling interest for financial reporting purposes is based on the preferred dividend which was

$93 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2016

.  Each convertible preferred unit is convertible into either

0.37334

of a Charter Holdings common unit (if then held by A/N) or

0.37334

of a share of Charter Class A common stock (if then held by a third party), representing a conversion price of

$267.85

per unit, based on a conversion feature as defined in the Limited Liability Company Agreement of Charter Holdings.  After May 18, 2021, Charter may redeem the convertible preferred units if the price of Charter Class A common stock exceeds

130%

of the conversion price. These Charter Holdings common and convertible preferred units held by A/N are recorded in noncontrolling interests as permanent equity in the consolidated balance sheet.

The common units and convertible preferred units issued to A/N as consideration for the Bright House Transaction were initially measured at their fair value of

$7.0 billion

and

$3.2 billion

, respectively, in accordance with acquisition accounting. However, upon formation of Charter Holdings and subsequent to the acquisition, the carrying amounts of the controlling and noncontrolling interests were adjusted to reflect the relative effective common ownership interest in Charter Holdings. This resulted in an increase to noncontrolling interest of approximately

$589 million

and a corresponding decrease to additional paid-in capital of

$589 million

, net of

$225 million

of deferred income taxes, for the year ended

December 31, 2016

.

In December 2016, Charter and A/N entered into a letter agreement (the "Letter Agreement") pursuant to which A/N exchanged

1.9 million

Charter Holdings common units held by A/N for shares of Charter Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase price of

$537 million

.  The common units exchanged had a net carrying value in noncontrolling interest of approximately

$460 million

.  The exchange of A/N common units resulted in a tax step-up of the assets of Charter Holdings which is further discussed in Note 17.  The Letter Agreement also requires A/N to sell to Charter or to Charter Holdings, on a monthly basis, a number of shares of Charter Class A common stock or Charter Holdings common units that represents a pro rata participation by A/N and its affiliates in any repurchases of shares of Charter Class A common stock from persons other than A/N effected by Charter during the immediately preceding calendar month, at a purchase price equal to the average price paid by Charter for the shares repurchased

12.     Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

The Company uses derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk on variable debt and foreign exchange risk on the Sterling Notes, and does not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes.

Interest rate derivative instruments are used to manage interest costs and to reduce the Company’s exposure to increases in floating interest rates.  The Company manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rate debt.  Using interest rate derivative instruments, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals through 2017, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to agreed-upon notional principal amounts. As of

December 31, 2016

and


, the Company had

$850 million

and

$1.1 billion

, respectively, in notional amounts of interest rate derivative instruments outstanding.  The notional amounts of interest rate derivative instruments do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, thus, are not a measure of exposure to credit loss.  The amounts exchanged were determined by reference to the notional amount and the other terms of the contracts.

Upon closing of the TWC Transaction, the Company acquired interest rate derivative instrument assets with a fair value of

$85 million

(excluding accrued interest), which were terminated and settled with their respective counterparties in the second quarter of 2016 with an

$88 million

cash payment to the Company of which

$14 million

was for interest accrued through the date of termination. The termination resulted in an

$11 million

loss for the year ended

December 31, 2016

which was recorded in gain (loss) on financial instruments, net in the consolidated statements of operations.

Upon closing of the TWC Transaction, the Company assumed cross-currency derivative instrument liabilities with a fair value of

$72 million

(excluding accrued interest).  Cross-currency derivative instruments are used to effectively convert

£1.275 billion

aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate British pound sterling denominated debt, including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to fixed-rate U.S. dollar denominated debt. The cross-currency swaps have maturities of June 2031 and July 2042. The Company is required to post collateral on the cross-currency derivative instruments when the derivative contracts are in a liability position. In May 2016, the Company entered into a collateral holiday agreement for

80%

of both the 2031 and 2042 cross-currency swaps, which eliminates the requirement to post collateral for

three

years.

The effect of derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheets is presented in the table below:

The Company’s interest rate and cross-currency derivative instruments are not designated as hedges and are marked to fair value each period, with the impact recorded as a gain or loss on financial instruments, net in the consolidated statements of operations.  While these derivative instruments are not designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes, management continues to believe such instruments are correlated with the respective debt, thus managing associated risk.

The effect of financial instruments on the consolidated statements of operations is presented in the table below.

13.    Fair Value Measurements

The accounting guidance

establishes a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements, based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date, as follows:

•

Level 1 – inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

•

Level 2 – inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.

•

Level 3 – inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.

Financial Assets and Liabilities

The Company has estimated the fair value of its financial instruments as of

December 31, 2016

and


using available market information or other appropriate valuation methodologies.  Considerable judgment, however, is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value.  Accordingly, the estimates presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company would realize in a current market exchange.

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, payables and other current assets and liabilities approximate fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments.

The Company’s cash and cash equivalents as of

December 31, 2016

and restricted cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2015 were primarily invested in money market funds and 90 day or less commercial paper.  The money market funds are valued at the closing price reported by the fund sponsor from an actively traded exchange and commercial paper is valued at cost plus the accretion of the discount on a yield to maturity basis, which approximated fair value.  The money market funds and commercial paper potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk.  The amount invested within any one financial instrument did not exceed

$250 million

and

$1.5 billion

as of

December 31, 2016

and December 31, 2015, respectively.  As of

December 31, 2016

and 2015, there were no significant concentrations of financial instruments in a single investee, industry or geographic location.

Interest rate derivative instruments are valued using a present value calculation based on an implied forward LIBOR curve (adjusted for Charter Operating’s and counterparties’ credit risk). The weighted average pay rate for the Company’s currently effective interest rate derivative instruments was

1.59%

and

1.61%

at

December 31, 2016

and


, respectively (exclusive of applicable spreads).

Regulatory, connectivity and produced content costs represent payments to franchise and regulatory authorities, costs directly related to providing video, Internet and voice services as well as payments for sports, local and news content produced by the Company.  Included in regulatory, connectivity and produced content costs is content acquisition costs for the Los Angeles Lakers’ basketball games and Los Angeles Dodgers’ baseball games which are recorded as games are exhibited over the applicable season.  Costs to service customers include costs related to field operations, network operations and customer care for the Company’s residential and small and medium business customers, including internal and third-party labor for installations, service and repairs, maintenance, billing and collection, occupancy and vehicle costs. Marketing costs represent the costs of marketing to current and potential commercial and residential customers including labor costs.

16.

Stock Compensation Plans

Legacy Charter’s 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (assumed by Charter upon closing of the Transactions) provides for grants of nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalent rights, performance units and performance shares, share awards, phantom stock, restricted stock units and restricted stock.  Directors, officers and other employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, as well as others performing consulting services for the Company, are eligible for grants under the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan.  In April 2016, Charter’s board of directors and stockholders approved an additional

9 million

shares of Charter Class A common stock (or units convertible into Charter Class A common stock) under the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan which now allows for the issuance of up to

21 million

shares of Charter Class A common stock (or units convertible into Charter Class A common stock).

At the closing of the TWC Transaction, Legacy TWC employee equity awards were converted into Charter Class A common stock equity awards on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the Legacy TWC equity awards, except that the number of shares covered by each award and the option exercise prices were adjusted for the Stock Award Exchange Ratio (as defined in the Merger Agreement) such that the intrinsic value of the Converted TWC Awards was approximately equal to that of the original awards at the closing of the Transactions. The Converted TWC Awards represented approximately

4.2 million

Charter restricted stock units and

0.8 million

Charter stock options (

0.5 million

of which were exercisable at the time of conversion) and continue to be subject to the terms of the Legacy TWC equity plans.  The Converted TWC Awards were measured at their fair value as of the closing of the TWC Transaction. Of that fair value,

$514 million

related to Legacy TWC employee pre-combination service and was treated as consideration transferred in the TWC Transaction (see Note 2), while

$539 million

relates to post-combination service and is being amortized to stock compensation expense over the remaining vesting period of the awards.  The fair values of the Converted TWC Awards were based on a valuation using assumptions developed by management and other information compiled by management including, but not limited to, historical volatility and exercise trends of Legacy Charter and Legacy TWC.  The Parent Merger Exchange Ratio was also applied to outstanding Legacy Charter equity awards and option exercise prices; however, the terms of the equity awards did not change as a result of the Transactions.

Legacy Charter Stock options and restricted stock units cliff vest upon the

three

year anniversary of each grant.  Stock options generally expire

ten

years from the grant date and restricted stock units have no voting rights.  Certain stock options and restricted stock units vest based on achievement of stock price hurdles.  Restricted stock generally vests annually over

one

year beginning from the date of grant.  Legacy TWC restricted stock units that were converted into Charter restricted stock units generally vest

50%

on each of the third and fourth anniversary of the grant date.  Legacy TWC stock options that were converted into Charter stock options vest ratably over a

four

-year period and expire

ten

years from the grant date.

As of

December 31, 2016

, total unrecognized compensation remaining to be recognized in future periods totaled

$262 million

for stock options,

$1 million

for restricted stock and

$279 million

for restricted stock units and the weighted average period over which they are expected to be recognized is


years for stock options,


months for restricted stock and


years for restricted stock units.  The Company recorded

17.    Income Taxes

Substantially all of the Company’s operations are held through Charter Holdings and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Charter Holdings and the majority of its subsidiaries are generally limited liability companies that are not subject to income tax. However, certain of these limited liability companies are subject to state income tax. In addition, the subsidiaries that are corporations are subject to income tax. Generally, the taxable income, gains, losses, deductions and credits of Charter Holdings are passed through to its members, Charter and A/N. Charter is responsible for its share of taxable income or loss of Charter Holdings allocated to it in accordance with the LLC Agreement and partnership tax rules and regulations. As a result, Charter's primary deferred tax component recorded in the consolidated balance sheets relates to its excess financial reporting outside basis, excluding amounts attributable to nondeductible goodwill, over Charter's tax basis in the investment in Charter Holdings.

Charter Holdings, the indirect owner of the Company’s cable systems, generally allocates its taxable income, gains, losses, deductions and credits proportionately according to the members’ respective ownership interests, except for special allocations required under Section 704(c) of the Internal Revenue Code and the Treasury Regulations (“Section 704(c)”).  Pursuant to Section 704(c) and the LLC Agreement, each item of income, gain, loss and deduction with respect to any property contributed to the capital of the partnership shall, solely for tax purposes, be allocated among the members so as to take into account any variation between the adjusted basis of such property to the partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and its initial gross asset value using the “traditional method” as described in the Treasury Regulations.

Income Tax Benefit (Expense)

For the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


, and


, the Company recorded deferred income tax benefit (expense) as shown below.  The tax provision in future periods will vary based on current and future temporary differences, as well as future operating results.

Income tax benefit for the year ended

December 31, 2016

was recognized primarily through the reversal of approximately

$3.3 billion

of valuation allowance (see further discussion below), net of tax effect of permanent differences, a decrease to the anticipated blended state rate applied to Legacy Charter deferred tax balances as a result of the Transactions, a change in a state tax law, and prior to the closing of the Transactions, increases (decreases) in deferred tax liabilities related to Charter’s franchises which are characterized as indefinite-lived for book financial reporting purposes.

Prior to July 2, 2015, Charter Communications Holding Company, LLC ("Charter Holdco") was treated as a partnership for tax purposes.  Effective on July 2, 2015, Charter elected to treat two of its wholly owned subsidiaries as disregarded entities for federal and state income tax purposes (the “Election”).  The subsidiaries that made the Election were two of the three partners in Charter Holdco.  This Election resulted in a deemed liquidation of Charter Holdco into Charter solely for federal and state income tax purposes, and resulted in a net increase of

$638 million

to the tax basis of Charter Holdco’s amortizable and depreciable assets.  After the Election, all taxable income, gains, losses, deductions and credits of Charter Holdco and its indirect limited liability company subsidiaries were treated as income of Charter.  In addition, the indirect subsidiaries of Charter Holdco that are corporations joined the Charter consolidated group. The impact of the Election to the Charter income tax provision, net of valuation allowance, was

$187 million

of income tax benefit recorded as a discrete tax event during the year ended December 31, 2015.

The Company’s effective tax rate differs from that derived by applying the applicable federal income tax rate of

35%

for the years ended

December 31, 2016

,


, and


, respectively, as follows:

CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015 AND 2014

(dollars in millions, except share or per share data or where indicated)

The change in the valuation allowance above differs from the change between the beginning and ending deferred tax position due to a change in deferred tax assets and the establishment of a valuation allowance on the net operating losses which results in no impact to the consolidated statements of operations.

Deferred Tax Assets (Liabilities)

The tax effects of these temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at

December 31, 2016

and


are presented below.

Net deferred tax liabilities included approximately

$25 million

and

$28 million

at

December 31, 2016

and


, respectively, relating to certain indirect subsidiaries that file separate income tax returns.

Valuation Allowance

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management takes into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income, available tax planning strategies and reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. Due to Legacy Charter’s history of losses, Legacy Charter was historically unable to assume future taxable income in its analysis and accordingly valuation allowances were established against the deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, from definite-lived assets for book accounting purposes. However, as a result of the TWC Transaction, deferred tax liabilities resulting from the book fair value adjustment increased significantly and future taxable income that will result from the reversal of existing temporary differences for which deferred tax liabilities are recognized, is sufficient to conclude it is more likely than not that the Company will realize substantially all of its deferred tax assets. As a result, Charter reversed approximately

$3.3 billion

of its valuation allowance and recognized a corresponding income tax benefit in the consolidated statements of operations for the

year

ended

December 31, 2016

. Approximately

$145 million

of valuation allowance associated with federal tax net operating loss carryforwards acquired in the TWC Transaction and approximately

$55 million

of valuation allowance associated with state tax loss carryforwards and other miscellaneous deferred tax assets remains on the

December 31, 2016

consolidated balance sheet.

CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015 AND 2014

(dollars in millions, except share or per share data or where indicated)

Net Operating Loss Carryforwards

As of

December 31, 2016

, Charter had approximately

$11.2 billion

of federal tax net operating loss carryforwards resulting in a gross deferred tax asset of approximately

$3.9 billion

.  Federal tax net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years 2018 through 2035. These losses resulted from the operations of Charter Holdco and its subsidiaries.  In addition, as of

December 31, 2016

, Charter had state tax net operating loss carryforwards, resulting in a gross deferred tax asset (net of federal tax benefit) of approximately

$304 million

.  State tax net operating loss carryforwards generally expire in the years 2017 through 2035.

Upon closing of the TWC Transaction, Charter experienced a third “ownership change” as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code; resulting in a third set of limitations on Charter’s use of its existing federal and state net operating losses, capital losses, and tax credit carryforwards. Both the first ownership change limitations that applied as a result of Legacy Charter’s emergence from bankruptcy in 2009 and second ownership change limitations that applied as a result of Liberty Media Corporation’s purchase in 2013 of a

27%

beneficial interest in Legacy Charter will also continue to apply.  As of

December 31, 2016

, all of Charter's federal tax loss carryforwards are subject to Section 382 and other restrictions. Pursuant to these restrictions, Charter estimates that approximately

$5.4 billion

in 2017,

$3.8 billion

in 2018,

$432 million

in 2019 and an additional

$226 million

annually over each of the next five years of federal tax loss carryforwards should become unrestricted and available for Charter’s use.  An additional

$415 million

is currently subject to a valuation allowance.  Since the limitation amounts accumulate for future use to the extent they are not utilized in any given year, Charter believes its loss carryforwards should become fully available to offset future taxable income. Charter’s state loss carryforwards are subject to similar, but varying, limitations on their future use. If Charter was to experience another “ownership change” in the future, its ability to use its loss carryforwards could be subject to further limitations.

Tax Receivable Agreement

Under the LLC Agreement, A/N has rights to: (1) convert at any time some or all of its preferred units in Charter Holdings for common units in Charter Holdings, and (2) exchange at any time some or all of its common units in Charter Holdings for Charter’s Class A common stock or cash, at Charter’s option. Pursuant to a Tax Receivable Agreement ("TRA") between Charter and A/N, Charter must pay to A/N

50%

of the tax benefit when realized by Charter from the step-up in tax basis resulting from any future exchange or sale of the preferred and common units.  Charter did not record a liability for this obligation as of the acquisition date since the tax benefit is dependent on uncertain future events that are outside of Charter’s control, such as the timing of a conversion or exchange. A future exchange or sale is not based on a fixed and determinable date and the exchange or sale is not certain to occur. If all of A/N's partnership units were to be exchanged or sold in the future, the undiscounted value of the obligation is currently estimated to be in the range of

zero

to

$3 billion

depending on measurement of the tax step-up in the future and Charter’s ability to realize the tax benefit in the periods following the exchange or sale.  Factors impacting these calculations include, but are not limited to, the fair value of the equity at the time of the exchange and the effective tax rates when the benefits are realized.

In connection with the Letter Agreement between Charter and A/N whereby

1.9 million

Charter Holdings common units held by A/N were exchanged for shares of Charter Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase price of

$537 million

, an immediate step-up of

$580 million

in the tax basis of the assets of Charter Holdings occurred.  As it relates to the exchange and tax step-up, a net deferred tax asset of approximately

$82 million

was recorded and a resulting TRA liability owed to A/N of

$137 million

which, as a transaction with a shareholder, was recorded directly to additional paid in capital.  The TRA liability is recorded on an iterative, undiscounted basis and included in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2016.

Uncertain Tax Positions

In connection with the TWC Transaction, the Company assumed

$181 million

of gross unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of interest and penalties, which are recorded within other long-term liabilities. The net amount of the unrecognized tax benefits that could impact the effective tax rate is

$154 million

.  The Company has determined that it is reasonably possible that its existing reserve for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2016 could decrease by

$35 million

during the year ended December 31, 2017 related to various ongoing audits, settlement discussions and expiration of statute of limitations with various state and local agencies; however, various events could cause the Company’s current expectations to change in the future. These uncertain tax positions, if ever recognized in the financial statements, would be recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as part of the income tax provision.  A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of interest and penalties, included in other long-term liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of the Company is as follows:

No tax years for Charter, Charter Holdings, or Charter Communications Holding Company, LLC for income tax purposes, are currently under examination by the IRS. Legacy Charter’s tax years ending 2013 through the short period return dated May 17, 2016 remain subject to examination and assessment. Years prior to 2013 remain open solely for purposes of examination of Legacy Charter’s loss and credit carryforwards. The IRS is currently examining Legacy TWC’s income tax returns for 2011 and 2012.  Legacy TWC’s tax years ending 2013 through 2015 remain subject to examination and assessment.  Prior to Legacy TWC’s separation from Time Warner Inc. (“Time Warner”) in March 2009 (the “Separation”), Legacy TWC was included in the consolidated U.S. federal and certain state income tax returns of Time Warner. The IRS is currently examining Time Warner’s 2008 through 2010 income tax returns. Time Warner’s income tax returns for 2005 to 2007, which are periods prior to the Separation, were settled with the exception of an immaterial item that has been referred to the IRS Appeals Division.  The Company does not anticipate that these examinations will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations. In addition, the Company is also subject to ongoing examinations of the Company’s tax returns by state and local tax authorities for various periods. Activity related to these state and local examinations did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations in


, nor does the Company anticipate a material impact in the future.

18.    Earnings (Loss) Per Share

Basic earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to Charter shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share considers the impact of potentially dilutive securities using the treasury stock and if-converted methods and is based on the weighted average number of shares used for the basic earnings per share calculation, adjusted for the dilutive effect of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, equity awards with market conditions and Charter Holdings convertible preferred units and common units.  Weighted average number of shares outstanding for all periods presented has been recast to reflect the application of the Parent Merger Exchange Ratio.  Basic loss per common share equaled diluted loss per common share for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 because the Company incurred a net loss during those periods. The following is the computation of diluted earnings per common share for the year ended

Charter is a party to management arrangements with Spectrum Management Holding Company, LLC ("Spectrum Management") and certain of their subsidiaries.  Under these agreements, Charter, Spectrum Management and Charter Holdco provide management services for the cable systems owned or operated by their subsidiaries.  Costs associated with providing these services are charged directly to the Company’s operating subsidiaries.  All other costs incurred on behalf of Charter’s operating subsidiaries are considered a part of the management fee.

Broadband and A/N. As of the closing of the Merger Agreement and the Contribution Agreement on May 18, 2016, the Stockholders Agreement replaced Legacy Charter’s existing stockholders agreement with Liberty Broadband, dated September 29, 2014, and superseded the amended and restated stockholders agreement among Legacy Charter, Charter, Liberty Broadband and A/N, dated March 31, 2015.

Under the terms of the Stockholders Agreement, the number of Charter’s directors is fixed at 13, and includes its chief executive officer. Upon the closing of the Bright House Transaction, two designees selected by A/N became members of the board of directors of Charter and three designees selected by Liberty Broadband continued as members of the board of directors of Charter. The remaining eight directors are not affiliated with either A/N or Liberty Broadband.  Each of A/N and Liberty Broadband is entitled to nominate at least one director to each of the committees of Charter’s board of directors, subject to applicable stock exchange listing rules and certain specified voting or equity ownership thresholds for each of A/N and Liberty Broadband, and provided that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Compensation and Benefit Committee each have at least a majority of directors independent from A/N, Liberty Broadband and the Company (referred to as the “unaffiliated directors”). Each of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Compensation and Benefits Committee is currently comprised of three unaffiliated directors and one designee of each of A/N and Liberty Broadband. A/N and Liberty Broadband also have certain other committee designation and other governance rights.  Upon the closing of the Bright House Transaction, Mr. Thomas Rutledge, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), became the chairman of the board of Charter.

In December 2016, the Company and A/N entered into the Letter Agreement in which A/N exchanged Charter Holdings common units for shares of Charter Class A common stock and the Company purchased from A/N Charter Holdings common units.  The Letter Agreement also requires pro rata participation by A/N and its affiliates in any repurchases of shares of Charter Class A common stock until A/N has sold shares or units totaling

Legal Proceedings

In 2014, following an announcement by Comcast and Legacy TWC of their intent to merge, Breffni Barrett and others filed suit in the Supreme Court of the State of New York for the County of New York against Comcast, Legacy TWC and their respective officers and directors.  Later five similar class actions were consolidated with this matter (the “NY Actions”). The NY Actions

CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015 AND 2014

(dollars in millions, except share or per share data or where indicated)

were settled in July 2014, however, such settlement was terminated following the termination of the Comcast and TWC merger in April 2015.  In May 2015, Charter and TWC announced their intent to merge.  Subsequently, the parties in the NY Actions filed a Second Consolidated Class Action Complaint (the “Second Amended Complaint”), removing Comcast as a defendant and naming TWC, the members of the TWC board of directors, Charter and the merger subsidiaries as defendants. The Second Amended Complaint generally alleges, among other things, that the members of the TWC board of directors breached their fiduciary duties to TWC stockholders during the Charter merger negotiations and by entering into the merger agreement and approving the mergers, and that Charter aided and abetted such breaches of fiduciary duties. The complaint sought, among other relief, injunctive relief enjoining the stockholder vote on the mergers, unspecified declaratory and equitable relief, compensatory damages in an unspecified amount, and costs and attorneys’ fees.

In September 2015, the parties entered into a memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) to settle the action. Pursuant to the MOU, the defendants issued certain supplemental disclosures relating to the mergers on a Form 8-K, and plaintiffs agreed to release with prejudice all claims that could have been asserted against defendants in connection with the mergers. The settlement is conditioned on, among other things, approval by the New York Supreme Court. That court gave preliminary approval to the settlement in October 2016. A hearing to consider final approval of this settlement is set for March 2017.  In the event that the New York Supreme Court does not approve the settlement, Charter intends to vigorously defend this case.

In August 2015, a purported stockholder of Charter, Matthew Sciabacucchi, filed a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery, on behalf of a putative class of Charter stockholders, challenging the transactions between Charter, TWC, A/N, and Liberty Broadband announced by Charter on May 26, 2015 (collectively, the “Transactions”). The lawsuit names as defendants Liberty Broadband, Charter, the board of directors of Charter, and New Charter. Plaintiff alleged that the Transactions improperly benefit Liberty Broadband at the expense of other Charter shareholders, and that Charter issued a false and misleading proxy statement in connection with the Transactions.  Plaintiff requested, among other things, that the Delaware Court of Chancery enjoin the September 21, 2015 special meeting of Charter stockholders at which Charter stockholders were asked to vote on the Transactions until the defendants disclosed certain information relating to Charter and the Transactions. The disclosures demanded by the plaintiff included (i) certain unlevered free cash flow projections for Charter and (ii) a Form of Proxy and Right of First Refusal Agreement (“Proxy”) by and among Liberty Broadband, A/N, Charter and New Charter, which was referenced in the description of the Second Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement, dated May 23, 2015, among Charter, New Charter, Liberty Broadband and A/N. On September 9, 2015, Charter issued supplemental disclosures containing unlevered free cash flow projections for Charter. In return, the plaintiff agreed its disclosure claims were moot and withdrew its application to enjoin the Charter stockholder vote on the Transactions. Charter has filed a motion to dismiss this litigation but the court has not yet ruled upon it.  Charter denies any liability, believes that it has substantial defenses, and intends to vigorously defend this suit.

The California Attorney General and the Alameda County, California District Attorney are investigating whether certain of Legacy Charter’s waste disposal policies, procedures and practices are in violation of the California Business and Professions Code and the California Health and Safety Code. That investigation was commenced in January 2014. A similar investigation involving Legacy TWC was initiated in February 2012.  Charter is cooperating with these investigations.  While the Company is unable to predict the outcome of these investigations, it does not expect that the outcome will have a material effect on its operations, financial condition, or cash flows.

On December 19, 2011, Sprint Communications Company L.P. (“Sprint”) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas alleging that Legacy TWC infringes 12 U.S. patents purportedly relating to Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) services. Over the course of the litigation Sprint dismissed its claims relating to five of the asserted patents, and shortly before trial Sprint dropped its claims with respect to two additional patents.  A trial on the remaining five patents is scheduled to begin on February 13, 2017.  The plaintiff is seeking monetary damages of approximately

$150 million

. The plaintiff is also claiming that TWC willfully infringed the patents, and may seek up to treble damages as well as attorneys’ fees and costs.  Charter intends to vigorously defend against this lawsuit. However, no assurances can be made that such defenses would ultimately be successful. At this time, the Company does not expect that the outcome of this litigation will have a material adverse effect on its operations, financial condition or cash flows although the ultimate outcome of the litigation cannot be predicted.

On October 23, 2015, the New York Office of the Attorney General (the “NY AG”) began an investigation of Legacy TWC's advertised Internet speeds and other Internet product advertising. On February 1, 2017, the NY AG filed suit in the Supreme Court for the State of New York alleging that Legacy TWC's advertising of Internet speeds was false and misleading.  The suit seeks restitution and injunctive relief.  The Company denies that Legacy TWC engaged in any wrongdoing and the Company intends to defend itself vigorously.  However, no assurances can be made that such defenses would ultimately be successful. At this time,

CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

(dollars in millions, except share or per share data or where indicated)

the Company does not expect that the outcome of this litigation will have a material adverse effect on its operations, financial condition or cash flows.

The Company is a defendant or co-defendant in several lawsuits involving alleged infringement of various patents relating to various aspects of its businesses. Other industry participants are also defendants in certain of these cases. In the event that a court ultimately determines that the Company infringes on any intellectual property rights, the Company may be subject to substantial damages and/or an injunction that could require the Company or its vendors to modify certain products and services the Company offers to its subscribers, as well as negotiate royalty or license agreements with respect to the patents at issue. While the Company believes the lawsuits are without merit and intends to defend the actions vigorously, no assurance can be given that any adverse outcome would not be material to the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. The Company cannot predict the outcome of any such claims nor can it reasonably estimate a range of possible loss.

The Company is party to lawsuits, claims and regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of conducting its business, including lawsuits claiming violation of wage and hour laws and breach of contract by vendors, including by three programmers. The ultimate outcome of these other legal matters pending against the Company cannot be predicted, and although such lawsuits and claims are not expected individually to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, such lawsuits could have, in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Whether or not the Company ultimately prevails in any particular lawsuit or claim, litigation can be time consuming and costly and injure the Company’s reputation.

21.    Employee Benefit Plans

Pension Plans

Upon completion of the TWC Transaction, Charter assumed sponsorship of Legacy TWC’s pension plans.  The Company sponsors two qualified defined benefit pension plans, the TWC Pension Plan and the TWC Union Pension Plan, that provide pension benefits to a majority of Legacy TWC employees. The Company also provides a nonqualified defined benefit pension plan for certain employees under the TWC Excess Pension Plan.

consisted of the following:

The

was primarily driven by the effects of an increase of the discount rate from

3.99%

4.20%

at

December 31, 2016

and a gain to record pension assets at

December 31, 2016

fair values.

Weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations as of

December 31, 2016

consisted of the following:

The weighted average of discount rates used to measure the projected benefit obligation at the closing date of the TWC Transaction was

3.99%

.  The rate of compensation increase used to measure the projected benefit obligation as of the closing of the TWC Transaction was an age-graded average increase of

4.25%

. The Company utilized the RP 2015/MP2015 mortality tables published by the Society of Actuaries to measure the benefit obligations as of

December 31, 2016

and the closing date of the TWC Transaction.

Weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit costs for the year ended

December 31, 2016

consisted of the following:

(a)

The discount rate used to determine net periodic pension benefit was

3.99%

from the closing date of the TWC Transaction through remeasurement date (June 30, 2016), and was

3.72%

from remeasurement date through

December 31, 2016

.

(b)

The rate of compensation increase used to determine net periodic pension benefit was

4.25%

from the closing date of the TWC Transaction through remeasurement date (June 30, 2016), and

0%

thereafter.  See “Pension Plan Curtailment Amendment” below for further discussion.

In developing the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the Company considered the pension portfolio’s composition, past average rate of earnings and the Company’s future asset allocation targets.  The weighted average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used to determine net periodic pension benefit for the year ended December 31, 2017 is expected to be

6.50%

.  The Company determined the discount rates used to determine benefit obligations and net periodic pension benefit based on the yield of a large population of high quality corporate bonds with cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future defined benefit payments.

Pension Plan Curtailment Amendment

Following the closing of the TWC Transaction, Charter amended the pension plans to freeze future benefit accruals to current active plan participants as of August 31, 2016. Effective September 1, 2016, no future compensation increases or future service will be credited to participants of the pension plans and new hires are not eligible to participate in the plans. Upon announcement and approval of the plan amendment, the assumptions underlying the pension liability and pension asset values were reassessed utilizing remeasurement date assumptions in accordance with Charter’s mark-to-market pension accounting policy to record gains and losses in the period in which a remeasurement event occurs. The

$675 million

curtailment gain recorded during the year ended

December 31, 2016

was primarily driven by the reduction of the compensation rate assumption to

0%

in accordance with the terms of the plan amendment, reflecting the pension liability at its accumulated benefit obligation instead of its projected benefit obligation at the remeasurement date.

Pension Plan Assets

The assets of the qualified pension plans are held in a master trust in which the qualified pension plans are the only participating plans (the “Master Trust”). The investment policy for the qualified pension plans is to achieve a reasonable long-term rate of return on plan assets with an acceptable level of risk in order to maintain adequate funding levels. The investment portfolio is a mix of fixed-income and equity securities with the objective of matching plan liability performance, diversifying risk and achieving a target investment return.  The pension plan’s Investment Committee establishes risk mitigation policies and regularly monitors investment performance, investment allocation policies, and the execution of these strategies.  The Investment Committee engages a third-party investment firm with responsibility of executing the directives of the Investment Committee, monitoring the performance of individual investment managers of the Master Trust, and making adjustments and changes within defined parameters when necessary.  On a periodic basis, the Investment Committee conducts a broad strategic review of its portfolio construction and investment allocation policies.  Neither the Company, the Investment Committee, nor the third-party investment firm manages any assets internally or directly utilizes derivative instruments or hedging; however, the investment mandate of some investment managers allows the use of derivatives as components of their standard portfolio management strategies. Pension assets are managed in a balanced portfolio comprised of two major components: a return-seeking portion and a liability-matching portion. The expected role of return-seeking investments is to achieve a reasonable long-term growth of pension assets with a prudent level of risk, while the role of liability-matching investments is to provide a partial hedge against liability performance associated with changes in interest rates. The objective within return-seeking investments is to achieve asset diversity in order to balance return and volatility.

The Company adopted an investment strategy referred to as a de-risking glide path to increase the fixed income allocation as the funded status of the qualified pension plans improves.  As the qualified pension plans reach set funded status milestones, the assets will be rebalanced to shift more assets from equity to fixed income.  Based on the progress with this strategy, the target investment allocation for pension fund assets is permitted to vary within specified ranges subject to Investment Committee approval for return-seeking securities and liability-matching securities.  The target and actual investment allocation of the qualified pension plans by asset category as of

December 31, 2016

consisted of the following:

The following table sets forth the investment assets of the qualified pension plans, which exclude accrued investment income and other receivables, accrued liabilities, and investments with a fair value measured at net asset value per share as a practical expedient, by level within the fair value hierarchy as of

December 31, 2016

:

(a)

Common stocks, mutual funds and U.S. Treasury debt securities are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded. No single industry comprised a significant portion of common stock held by the qualified pension plan as of

December 31, 2016

.

(b)

Commingled equity funds and commingled bond funds are valued using the net asset value provided by the administrator of the fund. The net asset value is based on the readily determinable value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, less liabilities, and then divided by the number of units outstanding.

(c)

Other equity securities consist of preferred stocks, which are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded.

(d)

Corporate debt securities are valued based on observable prices from the new issue market, benchmark quotes, secondary trading and dealer quotes. An option adjusted spread model is incorporated to adjust spreads of issues that have early redemption features and final spreads are added to the U.S. Treasury curve.

(e)

Collective trust funds primarily consist of short-term investment strategies comprised of instruments issued or fully guaranteed by the U.S. government and/or its agencies and are valued using the net asset value provided by the administrator of the fund. The net asset value is based on the readily determinable value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, less liabilities, and then divided by the number of units outstanding.

(f)

U.S. government agency asset-backed debt securities consist of pass-through mortgage-backed securities issued by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the Federal National Mortgage Association valued using available trade information, dealer quotes, market indices and research reports, spreads, bids and offers.

(g)

Corporate asset-backed debt securities primarily consist of pass-through mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. and foreign corporations valued using available trade information, dealer quotes, market indices and research reports, spreads, bids and offers.

Other fixed-income securities consist of foreign government debt securities, municipal bonds and U.S. government agency debt securities, which are valued based on observable prices from the new issue market, benchmark quotes, secondary trading and dealer quotes. An option adjusted spread model is incorporated to adjust spreads of issues that have early redemption features and final spreads are added to the U.S. Treasury curve.

(i)

Accrued investment income and other receivables includes amounts receivable under foreign exchange contracts of

$70 million

as of

December 31, 2016

. Accrued liabilities includes amounts accrued under foreign exchange contracts of

$71 million

as of

December 31, 2016

. The fair value of the assets and liabilities associated with these foreign exchange contracts are presented on a gross basis and are valued using the exchange rates in effect for the applicable currencies as of the valuation date (a Level 1 fair value measurement).

(j)

Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. These investments primarily consist of hedge funds valued utilizing net asset value provided by the administrator of the fund, which is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, less liabilities, and then divided by the number of units outstanding. Shares of the fund are not redeemable and the underlying assets are anticipated to be liquidated and distributed to investors in the near term. There are no material unfunded commitments with respect to these investments. The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit the reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the total fair value of plan assets discussed throughout this footnote.

Pension Plan Contributions

The Company made no cash contributions to the qualified pension plans during the year ended

December 31, 2016

; however, the Company may make discretionary cash contributions to the qualified pension plans in the future. Such contributions will be dependent on a variety of factors, including current and expected interest rates, asset performance, the funded status of the qualified pension plans and management’s judgment. For the nonqualified unfunded pension plan, the Company will continue to make contributions during 2017 to the extent benefits are paid.

Benefit payments for the pension plans are expected to be

$170 million

,

$174 million

,

$177 million

,

$180 million

in


,

$182 million

in


and

$911 million

in 2022 to 2026.

Multiemployer Plans

Upon completion of the TWC Transaction, Charter assumed Legacy TWC’s multiemployer plans.  The Company contributes to a number of multiemployer plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements that cover its union-represented employees. Such multiemployer plans provide medical, pension and retirement savings benefits to active employees and retirees. The Company made contributions to multiemployer plans of

$31 million

for the year ended

December 31, 2016

.

The risks of participating in multiemployer pension plans are different from single-employer pension plans in the following aspects: (a) assets contributed to a multiemployer pension plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers, (b) if a participating employer stops contributing to the multiemployer pension plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers and (c) if the Company chooses to stop participating in any of the multiemployer pension plans, it may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability.

The multiemployer pension plans to which the Company contributes each received a Pension Protection Act “green” zone status in 2015. The zone status is based on the most recent information the Company received from the plan and is certified by the plan’s actuary. Among other factors, plans in the green zone are at least 80% funded.

Defined Contribution Benefit Plans

The Company’s employees may participate in the Charter Communications, Inc. 401(k) Plan (the “401(k) Plan”).  Upon completion of the TWC Transaction, Charter assumed Legacy TWC’s defined contribution plan, the TWC Savings Plan. In June 2016, the Company announced changes to both the 401(k) Plan and the TWC Savings Plan that were effective September 1, 2016 and  effective January 1, 2017, the 401(k) Plan and TWC Savings Plan merged into one plan.  Employees that qualify for participation can contribute up to

50%

of their salary, on a pre-tax basis, subject to a maximum contribution limit as determined by the Internal Revenue Service.  The Company’s matching contribution is discretionary and is equal to

100%

of the amount of the salary reduction the participant elects to defer (up to

6%

of the participant’s eligible compensation), excluding any catch-up contributions and is

22.    Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

(“ASU 2014-09”), which is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP.  The new standard provides a single principles-based, five-step model to be applied to all contracts with customers, which steps are to (1) identify the contract(s) with the customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (5) recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied. More specifically, revenue will be recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration expected in exchange for those goods or services.  ASU 2014-09 will be effective, reflecting the one-year deferral, for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (January 1, 2018 for the Company).  Early adoption of the standard is permitted but not before the original effective date. Companies can transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating which method of transition will be utilized. The Company is continuing to assess all potential impacts that the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements, including developing new accounting policies, internal controls and processes to facilitate the adoption of the standard.  The most significant impacts upon adoption are anticipated to result from the deferral over a period of time instead of recognized immediately of (1) the residential installation revenues which represent nonrefundable up-front fees that convey a material right to the customer and (2) the internal and external commission expenses which represent costs of obtaining a contract.

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05,

Customer’s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement

(“ASU 2015-05”), which provides guidance in determining whether fees for purchasing cloud computing services (or hosted software solutions) are considered internal-use software or should be considered a service contract.  The cloud computing agreement that includes a software license should be accounted for in the same manner as internal-use software if customer has contractual right to take possession of the software during the hosting period without significant penalty and it is feasible to either run the software on customer’s hardware or contract with another vendor to host the software. Arrangements that don’t meet the requirements for internal-use software should be accounted for as a service contract. ASU 2015-05 was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 (January 1, 2016 for the Company).  The adoption of ASU 2015-05 did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,

Leases

(“ASU 2016-02”), which requires lessees to recognize almost all leases on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability.  Lessees are allowed to account for short-term leases (i.e., leases with a term of 12 months or less) off-balance sheet, consistent with current operating lease accounting.  For income statement purposes, the FASB retained a dual model, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance. Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting, but without explicit bright lines.  ASU 2016-02 will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 (January 1, 2019 for the Company).  Early adoption is permitted.  The new standard requires a modified retrospective transition through a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial statements.  The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements including identifying the population of leases, evaluating technology solutions and collecting lease data.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,

Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting

(“ASU 2016-09”), which includes multiple provisions intended to simplify various aspects of the accounting for share-based payments. The new standard (1) requires all excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement in the period in which they occur regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period, (2) requires classification of excess tax benefits as an operating activity on the statements of cash flows, (3) allows an entity to make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures when they occur and (4) causes the threshold under which employee share-based awards partially settled in cash can

qualify for equity classification to increase to the maximum statutory tax rates in the applicable jurisdiction. ASU 2016-09 will be effective for interim and annual periods after December 15, 2016 (January 1, 2017 for the Company). The new standard generally requires a modified retrospective transition through a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the beginning of the period of adoption, with certain provisions requiring either a prospective or retrospective transition. The Company adopted ASU 2016-09 on January 1, 2017.  Upon adoption of ASU 2016-09, the Company will recognize excess tax benefits of approximately

$136 million

in deferred tax assets that were previously not recognized in a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings.  The Company will prospectively record a deferred tax benefit or expense associated with the difference between book and tax for stock compensation expense.  On January 1, 2017, the Company will also establish an accounting policy election to assume zero forfeitures for stock award grants and account for forfeitures when they occur which will prospectively impact stock compensation expense.  Other aspects of adoption ASU 2016-09 are not anticipated to have a material impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,

Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments

(“ASU 2016-15”), which clarifies how entities should classify cash receipts and cash payments related to eight specific cash flow matters on the statement of cash flows, with the objective of reducing existing diversity in practice.  ASU 2016-15 will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (January 1, 2018 for the Company).  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU 2016-15 will have on its consolidated financial statements.
