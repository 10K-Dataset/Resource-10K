PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

Introduction

Charter Communications, Inc., operating through its subsidiaries, is the
fourth largest operator of cable systems in the United States. Through our
broadband network of coaxial and fiber optic cable, we provide video, data,
interactive and private business network services to approximately 7 million
customers in 40 states. All of our systems offer traditional analog cable
television. We are steadily increasing the availability of digital television,
along with an array of advanced products and services such as high-speed
Internet access (data services), interactive video programming and
video-on-demand, in an increasing number of our systems. In 2002, we expect to
offer several new advanced products and services in targeted markets, including
a set-top terminal companion that enables digital video recorder capability,
home networking and internet-access over the television; wireless home
networking; and an enhanced customized internet portal, with a customized
browser and charter.com e-mail. In 2002, we began offering telephony on a
limited basis through our broadband network using switch technology and will
continue our trials of voice-over Internet protocol telephony. The
introduction and roll-out of new products and services represents an important
step toward the realization of our Wired World™ vision, where cable’s ability
to transmit interactive video, data and voice at high-speeds enables it to
serve as the primary platform for the delivery of new services to the home and
workplace.

Charter Communications, Inc. was organized as a Delaware corporation in
1999 and conducted an initial public offering of its Class A common stock in
November 1999. Certain of our subsidiaries commenced operations under the
“Charter Communications” name in 1994. Our principal executive offices are
located at Charter Plaza, 12405 Powerscourt Drive, St. Louis, Missouri 63131.
Our telephone number is (314) 965-0555. We have a web site accessible at
http://www.charter.com. The information posted on our web site is not
incorporated into this Annual Report.

General Business Developments in 2001

In 2001, we continued the upgrade of our cable systems to more quickly
provide advanced products and services and improve service reliability. Our
upgrade plan emphasizes higher bandwidth capacity and two-way communication
capability, as well as reduction of the number of headend control centers. As
a result of this rebuild effort, by December 31, 2003, we expect that over 87%
of our customers will be served by systems with bandwidth of 750 megahertz or
greater and also will have the two-way communication capability that is
necessary for cable modem high-speed Internet access.

In 2001, we emphasized digital service as a core product and the base
platform for interactive and other advanced services. For an increasing number
of systems, we deployed video-on-demand and Wink-enhanced interactive content.
We also launched virtual interactive channels, or “i-channels” starting in
November 2001. Complementing our system upgrade in 2001 and increased digital
availability, we offered cable modem high-speed Internet access (data services)
to an increasing number of customers.

We completed two acquisitions in 2001, which resulted in a net addition of
approximately 604,500 customers as of the acquisition date, prior to a closing
adjustment of approximately 21,000 fewer customers, primarily to existing
operating areas. For these acquired systems, we applied our core operating
strategies to integrate and improve the operations. As a result of one of
these acquisitions, we assumed existing telephony operations for approximately
16,000 customers, using switch-based telephony.

To finance our acquisitions and the upgrade of our systems, as well as to
pay off certain debt, we issued additional long-term debt, long-term
convertible debt and equity, and refinanced some of our existing credit
facility debt.

We will continue to evaluate opportunities for new acquisitions and swaps
of our cable systems for systems of other cable operators. Our primary
criterion in considering these opportunities is the potential financial
benefits we expect to ultimately realize as a result of the acquisition or
swap. We consider each acquisition or swap in the context of our overall
existing and planned operations. In particular, we focus on the impact the
acquisition or swap may have on our ability to enhance our operations in
existing markets or to develop major new markets for our operations.

Recent Developments in 2002

In January 2002, we issued additional long-term debt in the form of high
yield bonds in an aggregate principal amount of $1.1 billion for net proceeds
of approximately $872.8 million, repaid a portion of the amounts outstanding
under our revolving credit facilities and refinanced some of our existing
credit facility debt.

In February 2002, one of our subsidiaries acquired the contracts and
associated assets of High Speed Access Corp. that served our customers for whom
High Speed Access was the Internet access provider and provided operational
support. The acquired assets, which all related to the high-speed cable modem
Internet service, included a customer contact center, network operations center
and provisioning software. See “Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related
Transactions – Business Relationships.”

Outstanding and Pro Forma Shares of Charter Communications, Inc.

The following table sets forth information as of February 28, 2002 with
respect to the outstanding shares of common stock of Charter Communications,
Inc. and pro forma for (i) the exchange of membership units in two of its
subsidiaries (Charter Communications Holding Company, LLC and CC VIII, LLC),
which are exchangeable for shares of Charter Communications, Inc. Class A
common stock on a one-for-one basis at any time, (ii) conversion of all
outstanding shares of Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock of
Charter Communications, Inc., which are convertible into shares of Charter
Communications, Inc. Class A common stock and (iii) conversion of all
outstanding 5.75% convertible senior notes and 4.75% convertible senior notes
of Charter Communications, Inc., which are convertible into shares of Charter
Communications, Inc. Class A common stock:

- 5 -


Organizational Structure

Charter Communications, Inc.’s principal asset is an approximate 52.8%
equity interest (assuming conversion and exchange of all convertible or
exchangeable securities) and a 100% voting interest in Charter Communications
Holding Company, LLC. Charter Communications Holding Company, through its
subsidiaries, owns cable systems and certain strategic investments. Charter
Communications, Inc. provides management services to Charter Communications
Holding Company and its subsidiaries. As sole manager, Charter Communications,
Inc. controls the affairs of Charter Communications Holding Company and its
subsidiaries.

Charter Communications, Inc. is the issuer of $750.0 million principal
amount of 5.75% convertible senior notes issued in October and November 2000
and $632.5 million principal amount of 4.75% convertible senior notes issued in
May 2001.

The following more detailed textual information concerns our ownership
structure as of February 28, 2002:

Ownership of Charter Communications, Inc

. Paul G. Allen owns approximately
3.7% of the outstanding capital stock of Charter Communications, Inc. and
controls approximately 92.3% of the voting power of Charter Communications,
Inc.’s capital stock. The remaining equity interests and voting power are held
by the public. Mr. Allen’s voting control arises primarily from his ownership
of Charter Communications, Inc.’s high vote Class B common stock, which gives
him voting rights that reflect investments by his affiliates (Charter
Investment and Vulcan Cable III) in our subsidiary, Charter Communications
Holding Company, although he also owns shares of Charter Communications, Inc.
Class A common stock.

Convertible Redeemable Series A Preferred Stock of Charter Communications,
Inc.

Upon the closing of the Cable USA acquisition, some of the sellers
received a portion of the purchase price in the form of 5.75% convertible
preferred stock in Charter Communications, Inc. rather than in cash. The
shares of Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock which were issued to
these sellers are convertible into shares of Charter Communications, Inc. Class
A common stock from April 1, 2002 through August 31, 2008, at an initial
conversion price of $24.71 per share, subject to certain adjustments. The
shares have a liquidation preference of $100 per share and are entitled to
cumulative cash dividends at an annual rate of 5.75%. If all of the Cable USA
sellers converted their Series A preferred shares, this group of holders would
have less than a 1% equity interest in Charter Communications, Inc.

Convertible Senior Notes of Charter Communications, Inc.

In October and
November 2001, Charter Communications, Inc. issued $750.0 million aggregate
principal amount of 5.75% convertible senior notes due 2005 that are
convertible at any time prior to their maturity or earlier redemption or
repurchase at an initial conversion rate of 46.3822 shares of Class A common
stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to a conversion
price of approximately $21.56 per share. The conversion rate is subject to
adjustment in certain events. On an as converted basis, the 5.75% convertible
senior notes represent 4.8% of the equity of Charter Communications, Inc. In
May 2001, Charter Communications, Inc. issued 4.75% convertible senior notes
due 2006 in the aggregate principal amount of $632.5 million that are
convertible into shares of Class A common stock at any time prior to their
maturity or earlier redemption or repurchase at an initial conversion rate of
38.0952 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes,
which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $26.25 per share.
The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain events. On an as
converted basis, the 4.75% convertible senior notes represent 3.4% of the
equity of Charter Communications, Inc.

Charter Communications Holding Company, LLC.

Charter Communications
Holding Company is the direct 100% parent of Charter Communications Holdings,
LLC. The common membership units of Charter Communications Holding Company are
owned 52.8% by Charter Communications, Inc., 16.2% by Vulcan Cable III and
31.0% by Charter Investment (assuming conversion and exchange of all
convertible and exchangeable securities). All of the outstanding common
membership units in Charter Communications Holding Company held by Vulcan Cable
III and Charter Investment are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis at any time
for shares of Class B common stock of Charter Communications, Inc. which are in
turn convertible into Class A common stock of Charter Communications, Inc.
Charter Communications, Inc. controls 100% of the voting power of Charter
Communications Holding Company.

Certain provisions of the Charter Communications, Inc. certificate of
incorporation and Charter Communications Holding Company limited liability
company agreement effectively require that Charter Communications, Inc.’s
investment in Charter Communications Holding Company replicate, on a “mirror”
basis, Charter Communications, Inc.’s outstanding

- 6 -


equity and debt structure. As a result of these coordinating provisions,
whenever Charter Communications, Inc. issues equity or debt, Charter
Communications, Inc. transfers the proceeds from such issuance to Charter
Communications Holding Company, and Charter Communications Holding Company
issues a “mirror” security to Charter Communications, Inc. that replicates the
characteristics of the security issued by Charter Communications, Inc. As a
result, in addition to its equity interest in common units of Charter
Communications Holding Company, Charter Communications, Inc. also holds 100% of
the mirror convertible notes of Charter Communications Holding Company that
automatically convert into common membership units upon the conversion of any
Charter Communications, Inc. convertible senior notes and 100% of the mirror
preferred units of Charter Communications Holding Company that automatically
convert into common membership units upon the conversion of the Series A
Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock of Charter Communications, Inc.

Vulcan Cable III Inc.

Vulcan Cable III has a 16.2% common equity interest
(assuming conversion and exchange of all convertible and exchangeable
securities) and no voting rights in Charter Communications Holding Company.
Vulcan Cable III’s membership units in Charter Communications Holding Company
are exchangeable for shares of Charter Communications, Inc. Class B common
stock on a one-for-one basis at any time. Mr. Allen owns 100% of the
outstanding capital stock of Vulcan Cable III.

Charter Investment, Inc.

Charter Investment has a 31.0% common equity
interest (assuming conversion and exchange of all convertible and exchangeable
securities) and no voting rights in Charter Communications Holding Company.
Charter Investment’s membership units in Charter Communications Holding Company
are exchangeable for shares of Charter Communications, Inc. Class B common
stock at any time on a one-for-one basis. Mr. Allen owns 100% of the
outstanding capital stock of Charter Investment.

Sellers of Bresnan Cable Systems.

Upon the closing of the Bresnan
acquisition, some of the sellers received a portion of their purchase price in
the form of equity interests in subsidiaries of Charter Communications, Inc.
rather than in cash. Certain sellers received common membership units in
Charter Communications Holding Company that were exchangeable for shares of
Charter Communications, Inc. Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis at any
time. In February 2002, Bresnan sellers holding in aggregate 14,831,552
membership units in Charter Communications Holding Company (representing
approximately 2.1% of the common equity of Charter Communications, Inc.
(assuming conversion and exchange of all convertible or exchangeable
securities)), exercised their right to cause Mr. Allen or his designee to
purchase the membership units. As a result, Vulcan Cable III and Charter
Investment, as Mr. Allen’s designees, acquired 9,597,940 and 5,233,612 units,
respectively, in Charter Communications Holding Company. Other sellers in the
Bresnan acquisition received preferred membership units in CC VIII, LLC that
are exchangeable for shares of Charter Communications, Inc. Class A Common
Stock. These sellers also have a right to put these units to Mr. Allen. If
these remaining Bresnan sellers exchanged their membership units in CC VIII,
LLC, these equity holders as a group would have a total 3.4% equity interest in
Charter Communications, Inc. (assuming conversion and exchange of all
convertible or exchangeable securities). If Charter Communications, Inc.
issues Class A common stock to the Bresnan sellers in exchange for their CC
VIII preferred membership units, Charter Communications Holding Company will
issue mirror Class B common units to Charter Communications, Inc.

with respect to the common units of Charter Communications Holding Company and
pro forma for (i) the conversion of the mirror convertible notes into Class B
common units, (ii) the conversion of the Class B preferred units into Class B
common units and (iii) exchange by the Bresnan sellers of their CC VIII
preferred membership units for Class A common stock:

Charter Communications Holdings, LLC.

Charter Holdings, a Delaware
limited liability company formed on February 9, 1999, is a co-issuer of the
publicly held Charter Holdings notes that consist of $3.575 billion aggregate
principal amount of notes issued in March 1999, $1.532 billion aggregate
principal amount of notes issued in January 2000, $2.075 billion aggregate

of Charter Communications Holdings Capital, the co-issuer of these notes.
Charter Holdings also owns the various subsidiaries that conduct all of our
cable operations, including the Charter, CCV, CC VI, CC VII and CC VIII
Companies described below.

Operating Subsidiaries.

These companies are subsidiaries of Charter
Holdings and own or operate all of our cable systems. There are separate

Acquisitions Completed in 2001

AT&T Transactions.

In February 2001, Charter Communications, Inc. and
certain of its subsidiaries entered into several agreements with AT&T
Broadband, LLC and certain of its affiliates involving several strategic cable
system transactions. Charter Communications, Inc. assigned the agreements to
certain of its subsidiaries, and the AT&T transactions closed in June 2001. In
the AT&T transactions, we acquired cable systems from AT&T Broadband serving
customers in Missouri, Illinois, Alabama, Nevada and California for a total
adjusted purchase price of $1.74 billion, consisting of $1.71 billion in cash
and a Charter cable system valued at $25.1 million, for a net addition of
approximately 551,100 customers as of the closing date. A portion of the net
proceeds from the sale of the Charter Holdings May 2001 notes was used to pay a
portion of the purchase price of the AT&T transactions. As of December 31,
2001, these cable systems had 570,800 customers. For the year ended December
31, 2001, including the period prior to our acquisition, these systems had
revenues of $332.7 million.

Cable USA Transaction.

In August 2001, Charter Communications, Inc. and
Charter Communications Holding Company completed the acquisition of several
cable systems from Cable USA, Inc. and its affiliates, resulting in a net

December 31, 2001, including the period prior to our acquisition, these systems
had revenues of $13.9 million.

Business Strategy

This section includes forward-looking statements regarding, among other
things, our plans, strategies and prospects. Forward-looking statements are
inherently subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Many of the
forward-looking statements contained in this section may be identified by the
use of forward-looking words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,”
“should,” “planned,” “will,” “may,” “intend,” “estimate,” and “potential,”
among others. Among these risks, uncertainties and assumptions are those
specified in “– Certain Trends and Uncertainties” and in Exhibit 99.1, “Risk
Factors.” We refer you to these sections, as well as to “Forward-Looking
Statements.”

Our ultimate objective is to increase the amount of revenue and cash flow
per customer. To achieve this objective, we are pursuing the following
strategies:

Offer an Array of Advanced Products and Services.

Consistent with our
Wired World™ vision, we seek to be a market leader in the introduction and
distribution of advanced products and services. We currently offer advanced
video and interactive services, as well as high-speed Internet access data
services. Using digital technology, we are able to offer additional video
channels to our standard, premium and pay-per-view line-up, including
programming of local interest, as well as digital music services. In addition,
we offer interactive video programming, including video-on-demand, virtual
interactive channels accessible on television through a web-like screen, and an
interactive program guide to access television program listings by channel,
time, date or programming type. In 2002, we expect to offer several new
advanced products and services in targeted markets, including an advanced media
center terminal that enables digital video recorder capability, home networking
and internet-access over the television; wireless home networking; and an
enhanced customized internet portal, with a customized browser and charter.com
e-mail. In 2002, we began to offer telephony on a limited basis through our
broadband network using circuit-based switch technology and will continue with
trials of our voice-over Internet protocol telephony. Digital television and
its related suite of interactive services, as well as high-speed cable modem
Internet access, provide additional value and product differentiation, both to
us and to our customers, and as a result, are instrumental in solidifying the
relationship with our customers.

- 9 -


Build and Operate a Technologically Advanced Broadband Network.

We
continue to upgrade the technical quality and capacity of our existing systems.
We will build out new systems to a minimum bandwidth of 550 megahertz or
greater, which will allow us to:

•

offer digital television, high-speed Internet access (data
services) and other advanced products and services;

•

increase channel capacity up to 82 analog channels, and add
even more channels and services when our bandwidth is used for
digital signal transmission; and

•

permit two-way communication, so that Internet access does not
require a separate telephone line and our systems can provide
interactive services, and potentially, telephony services.

By December 31, 2003, when we anticipate that the upgrade of our existing
systems will be substantially complete, we expect that approximately 92% of our
customers will be served by cable systems with at least 550 megahertz bandwidth
capacity, 87% of our customers will be served by cable systems with at least
750 megahertz bandwidth capacity, 89% of our customers will have the two-way
communication capability that is necessary for cable modem high-speed Internet
access, and 92% of our customers will have access to digital services.

As part of our upgrade, we are working to reduce the number of headends
that serve our customers. Because headends are the control centers of a cable
television system, where incoming signals are amplified, converted, processed
and combined for transmission to the customer, reducing the number of headends
reduces related equipment and maintenance expenditures. Headend consolidation,
together with our other upgrades, also will provide enhanced picture quality
and system reliability. It is anticipated that upon completion of our upgrade,
approximately 83.5% of our customers will be served by headends serving at
least 10,000 customers.

In 2001, we completed a national network operations center to monitor and
control all aspects of our network to enhance the reliability of our upgraded
systems and support our high-speed Internet access and other advanced products.
By December 31, 2003, we plan to have nine regional operations centers that
will focus on our local network operations.

As a result of our upgraded cable systems, we believe that we are well
positioned to be a market leader in the deployment of technologically advance
products and services as they are developed.

Focus on the Customer.

To maximize customer satisfaction and loyalty, we
operate our business to provide reliable, high-quality products and services
and superior customer care. We tailor our product and service packages to suit
the diverse communities we serve and satisfy local preferences for programming.
Because of our decentralized operating structure, we are able to maintain a
strong management presence at the local system level to improve our customer
service and respond to local customer needs. We operate seven state-of-the-art
regional customer contact centers that provide customers with access to
specialized customer care representatives 24 hours a day, seven days a week,
including a fully-staffed and equipped facility acquired in 2002 from High
Speed Access Corp. We expect to build four additional customer contact centers
in 2002. We believe that our customer service efforts enhance customer
satisfaction, enable us to attract and retain valuable customers, increase
customer demand and acceptance for our new advanced products and services, and
strengthen the Charter brand name.

Employ Innovative Marketing.

Our marketing efforts continue to focus on
offering our variety of Charter-branded entertainment and information services
that provide value, choice, convenience and quality to our customers. We offer
value-priced packages of multiple advanced products and services, such as
combinations of digital television, premium video channels and high speed
Internet access for a price that is lower than purchasing the products
separately. These bundled offerings enable us to respond to consumer demand
for advanced services such as high-speed Internet access, provide cutting-edge
new services such as interactive virtual channels, and at the same time, offer
an attractive price/value ratio that enhances customer satisfaction. Because
our advanced products and services are often new to the marketplace, our
marketing programs are designed to educate customers about the availability and
the advantages of those products and services. We utilize database marketing
to target audiences and tailor marketing programs to local customer
preferences. In 2001, we retained Dan Aykroyd to serve as our celebrity
spokesperson for media advertising. In addition, we promote our services
through consumer electronics retailers and proprietary locations. We also have
retention and loyalty programs for retaining customers that include televised
advertising to reinforce the link between quality service and the Charter brand
name.

Statements.”

We offer our customers traditional cable television services and
programming as well as advanced high bandwidth services such as digital
television, cable modem high-speed Internet access and interactive television.
We plan to continue to enhance and upgrade these services by adding new
programming and other advanced products and services as they are developed. In
2001, we focused on our digital television and high-speed Internet services,
with several market deployments of video-on-demand. Because our upgraded
systems now allow us to offer advanced products and services in a greater
number of markets, in 2002 we will focus on increased deployment of high-speed
Internet access so that more customers will have access to both data and video
services.

“basic” and “expanded basic” service generally receive a line-up of between 33
and 82 channels of television programming, depending on the bandwidth capacity
of the system. Customers who pay additional amounts can also subscribe to
additional channels, either individually or in packages, as add-ons to the
basic channels. We tailor both our basic channel line-up and our additional
channel offerings to each system according to demographics, programming
preferences, competition, price sensitivity and local regulation.

Our traditional cable television service offerings include the following:

•

Basic Cable

. All of our customers receive a package of basic
programming, transmitted via an analog signal, which generally
consists of local broadcast television, local community programming,
including governmental and public access, and limited satellite
delivered or non-broadcast channels.

•

Expanded Basic Cable

. This expanded programming level includes
a package of satellite-delivered or non-broadcast channels (such as
ESPN, CNN and Lifetime Television) in addition to the basic channel
line-up.

•

Premium Channels

. These channels provide commercial-free
movies, sports and other special event entertainment programming.
Home Box Office, Cinemax, Showtime, the Movie Channel, Starz and
Encore are examples of premium channels. Although we offer
subscriptions to premium channels on an individual basis, we are
offering an increasing number of premium channel packages and are
bundling premium channels with our advanced services.

•

Pay-Per-View

. These channels allow customers to pay on a per
event basis to view a single showing of a recently released movie, a
one-time special sporting event or music concert on a commercial-free
basis.

Advanced Products and Services.

Cable’s high bandwidth is a key factor in
the successful delivery of advanced products and services. A variety of
emerging technologies and increasing Internet usage by our customer base have
presented us with substantial opportunities to expand our sources of revenue.
In an increasing number of our systems, we now offer a variety of advanced
products and services, including:

•

digital television and its related enhancements, such as an interactive programming guide;

•

high-speed Internet access via cable modem;

•

interactive services related to on-screen broadcast
programming, such as Wink, which adds interactivity and electronic
commerce opportunities to traditional programming and advertising;

•

virtual interactive channels for news, finance, weather,
sports, shopping and movie theater listings, accessible on television
through a web-like screen;

- 11 -


•

video-on-demand;

Digital Television.

As part of our systems upgrade, we are installing
headend equipment capable of delivering digitally encoded cable transmissions
to a two-way digital-capable set-top terminal in the customer’s home. This
digital connection offers significant advantages. For example, we can compress
the digital signal to allow the transmission of up to twelve digital channels
in the bandwidth normally used by one analog channel. The increased channel
capacity will allow us to increase both programming and service offerings,
including offering video-on-demand to pay-per-view customers.

We offer digital service to our customers in several different service
combination packages. All digital packages include a digital set-top terminal,
an interactive electronic programming guide, 45 channels of CD quality digital
music, an expanded menu of pay-per-view channels and at least thirty additional
digital channels. In markets where Wink-enhanced programming and
video-on-demand are available, all of our digital customers also are able to
receive these services. Certain digital packages also offer customers one or
more premium channels of their choice with “multiplexes.” Multiplexes give
customers access to several different versions of the same premium channel
which are varied as to time of broadcast (such as east and west coast time
slots) or programming content theme (such as westerns or romance). Other
digital packages bundle digital television with other advanced services, such
as Internet access.

As of December 31, 2001, we had approximately 2.1 million digital
customers and our digital penetration was 20.2% of digital homes passed. We
expect to increase our digital customers to approximately 2.7 million by
December 31, 2002.

Cable Modem-Based High-Speed Internet Access.

We offer high-speed data
and Internet access to our residential customers primarily via cable modems
attached to personal computers, at speeds of up to approximately 50 times the
speed of a conventional telephone modem. As of December 31, 2001 we had
approximately 607,700 cable modem high-speed Internet customers. Primarily as
a result of increased consumer demand, by December 31, 2002, we expect to
increase the number of our cable modem high-speed Internet access customers to
between approximately 1.2 million and 1.25 million.

We offer high-speed Internet access services under the Charter Pipeline
brand to our high-speed Internet access customers and in certain markets we
offer high-speed Internet access in conjunction with a third-party provider.
In October 2001, pursuant to an agreement with Microsoft Corporation, we
introduced for our Charter Pipeline customers a custom start page that is
co-branded with Microsoft’s network of websites, known as MSN, with content
modules that we provide, including, for example, movie trailers, previewing
movies on pay-per-view and video-on-demand, and television listings. In the
second quarter of 2002, we expect to introduce a custom browser that will be
co-branded with the MSN browser and charter.com e-mail. Our recent acquisition
of high-speed Internet access assets from High Speed Access in February 2002,
included a customer contact center, network operating center and provisioning
software, all of which were being utilized to service our high-speed cable
modem Internet access customers.

On September 28, 2001, Excite@Home Corporation, the provider of high-speed
Internet access service to approximately 145,000, or 25%, of our data
customers, filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
By March 1, 2002, we successfully transitioned over all of our customers served
by Excite@Home to our Charter Pipeline™ service. As of December 31, 2001,
after giving effect to the Excite@Home transition and the High Speed Access
acquisition, approximately 87.3% of our high-speed Internet access customers
received our Charter Pipeline high-speed Internet access service and 13.7%
received services provided in conjunction with a third-party service provider.

Traditional Dial-Up Modem Internet Access.

Traditional dial-up Internet
access is available upon customer request in a limited number of our markets
where two-way cable modem Internet access is not yet available.

TV-Based Internet Access.

We expect to launch the digeo™
television-based Internet access service in St. Louis in the second half of
2002. This premium digeo™ product is designed to blend the power of the
Internet with the convenience of the television. Through the use of an
advanced digital set-top terminal companion, customers will be able to access
Internet-based streaming media on the television, including both local and
national news, sports and entertainment. The Internet domain name of customers
using this service will be “Charter TV.” The digeo™ product is a “portal,”
which is an Internet web site that serves as a user’s initial point of entry to
the World Wide Web. By offering selected content, services and links to other
web sites, a portal guides and directs users through the World Wide Web. In
addition, the portal generates revenues from advertising on its own web pages
and by sharing revenues generated by linked or featured web sites.

- 14 -


We plan to use digeo™ as our television-based portal for an initial
six-year period. A Charter Communications subsidiary and an affiliate of Mr.
Allen both own equity interests in digeo, inc. See “Item 13. Certain
Relationships and Related Transactions – Business Relationships.”

Our WorldGate television-based Internet access service offers easy,
low-cost Internet access to customers at connection speeds ranging up to 128
kilobits per second. This service, with its user-friendly interface, appeals
to first-time Internet users and does not require the use of a personal
computer, an existing or additional telephone line, or any additional
equipment. The Internet domain name of the customers who use this service is
“Charter.net.” This allows customers to switch or expand to our other Internet
services without a change of e-mail address. As of December 31, 2001, we had
557,100 homes passed and 9,000 TV-based Internet customers.

Video-On-Demand.

Roll-out of video-on-demand (VOD) service to digital
customers began in some of our markets in 2000, with expanded distribution in
2001. With VOD service, customers can access hundreds of movies and other
programming at any time, with digital picture quality. VOD allows full VCR
functionality, including the ability to pause, rewind and fast-forward
programs. Customers can also stop a program and resume watching it several
hours later during the rental period. In addition, the VOD programming
available in a particular market can be customized for market-based or customer
preferences and local interest. For example, foreign language or other local
programming could be offered in markets where such programming is likely to
appeal to customers. Generally, customers pay for VOD (such as movies) on a
per-selection basis. Some VOD programming is also available on a category
basis (such as children’s programming) for a single monthly fee in addition to
single selection purchases.

As of December 31, 2001, VOD was available to digital customers in systems
passing approximately 2.0 million homes in ten markets with approximately 300
titles available to customers. In systems where VOD is available, it is
included as a standard feature of our digital service packages. By December
31, 2002, we expect video-on-demand to be available in systems passing in
excess of 4.0 million homes. In 2001, we relied on a single source-provider
for the hardware, software, programming content, and operational support used
for VOD. In 2002, we plan to add other sources for each of these products and
services and will attempt to secure some or all of the programming content
directly from programmers rather than through a third-party content
consolidator.

Interactive Video Programming.

We provide interactive programming using
technology developed by Wink Communications, Inc. The Wink technology embeds
interactive features, such as additional information and statistics about a
television program or the option to order an advertised product, into
programming and advertisements. A customer with a Wink-enabled set-top
terminal and a Wink-enabled cable provider sees an icon flash on the screen
when additional Wink features are available to enhance a program or
advertisement. By pressing the select button on a standard remote control, a
viewer of a Wink-enhanced program is able to access additional information
regarding such program, including, for example, information on prior episodes
or the program’s characters. A viewer watching an advertisement is able to
access additional information regarding the advertised product and may also be
able to utilize the two-way transmission features to order a product. We have
bundled Wink’s services with our traditional cable services in both our
advanced analog and digital platforms. Wink’s services are provided free of
charge to the customer. A company controlled by Mr. Allen has a minority
equity interest in Wink. See “Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related
Transactions – Business Relationships.”

Various programming networks, including CNN, NBC, ESPN, HBO, Showtime,
Lifetime, VH1, the Weather Channel and Nickelodeon, together currently produce
over 2,400 hours of Wink-enhanced programming per week. Under certain
revenue-sharing arrangements, we will modify our headend technology to allow
Wink-enabled programming to be offered on our systems. We receive fees from
Wink each time one of our customers uses Wink to request certain additional
information or order advertised products. In 2001 our customers averaged
approximately 381,000 clicks per week on Wink icons.

In September 2001, Charter Communications, Inc. amended its agreement with
digeo interactive, LLC, a subsidiary of digeo, inc., to provide that digeo
would provide Charter Interactive Channels (commonly known as “i-channels”) to
certain of our customers receiving Wink services. In November 2001, we made
this service available to our digital subscribers in Glendale, California, and
by March 1, 2002, the i-channels were available to an aggregate of 550,000
digital subscribers. As of March 1, 2002, over 20% of the digital subscribers
in these markets were active users of the i-channels, with a per-user average
of 12.5 screen views per week. We plan to deploy this service aggressively in
2002 and intend to offer the service to over 1.0 million customers by December
31, 2002. Currently, those digital subscribers receiving i-channels receive
the service at no additional charge.

Telephony/Voice Services.

We are exploring technologies using Internet
protocol telephony to transmit digital voice signals over our systems. We
launched preliminary Internet protocol telephony trials in 2001 and 2002, and
will continue with our market trials during 2002. Following these market
trials, we will evaluate the business model for deployment of this service.
Commencing in January 2002, we began offering traditional circuit switch-based
telephony in the St. Louis area to approximately 16,000 customers acquired in
the AT&T acquisition. We have marketed telephony services as a competitive
access provider in Wisconsin through one of our subsidiaries and are currently
exploring the expansion of our services as a competitive access provider in
other states.

Other New Business Initiatives.

We are seeking to provide our customers
in 2002 with advanced broadband media center terminals that include digital
video recording capabilities (commonly referred to as “DVR”) and operate in
conjunction with certain existing digital set top terminals. Built-in DVR
capability in the set-top terminal will enable customers to store video, audio
and Internet content. In February 2002, we signed an agreement with Motorola,
Inc. to engineer, manufacture and market these media centers, and a
stand-alone unit is also planned for development. digeo, inc. collaborated
with us on the design for the advanced broadband media centers. A Charter
Communications subsidiary and an affiliate of Mr. Allen both own equity
interests in digeo, inc. See “Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related
Transaction – Business Relationships.”

We expect to offer high-definition television (HDTV) on a limited basis in
five test markets by the end of the first half of 2002, and in at least two
additional test markets by the third quarter of 2002. HDTV will provide our
digital customers with video services at a higher resolution than standard
television. We hope to expand our offering of HDTV to additional markets and
to increase the number of channels for which we provide HDTV by December 31,
2002.

In addition, in 2002 we are anticipating that we will be able to expand
our offering of subscription video-on-demand (commonly known as “SVOD”), or VOD
programming that is available on a category basis, for a single monthly fee,
beyond children’s programming to include premium programming. If we are
successful in expanding this offering, our customers receiving SVOD would have
access to the regular programming provided by many of our program providers and
access to a certain number of movies carried by these providers.

We are also exploring the deployment of wireless networking technology for
our residential cable modem customers. This will initially be available to
cable modem customers who will utilize the technology over multiple personal
computers. The service is expected to eventually have a broader application by
allowing shared use of other video-based data throughout the home.

We evaluate the feasibility and profitability of our new business
initiatives on an ongoing basis to understand the risks and benefits posed by
investing in such new products and services and to gauge our interest and
commitment level with respect to these new products. Because we launch new
products and services in a limited number of targeted markets, we do not expect
these initiatives to produce meaningful or material revenues or cash flows.
Additionally, because it takes time for new products and services to gain
acceptance and reach certain utilization levels, we cannot predict when, if
ever, such initiatives would begin to produce such revenues or cash flow.

Private Business Networks.

We established Charter Business Networks as a
separate division to offer integrated network solutions for data, video,
Internet and private voice communications to commercial and institutional
customers in certain of our markets. These solutions include virtual local
area and wide area networks with bandwidth and Internet access capacity based
on customer needs, supported by remote monitoring.

Sale of Local Advertising.

We receive revenue from the sale of local
advertising on satellite-delivered networks such as MTV, CNN and ESPN. In any
particular system, we generally insert local advertising on a minimum of twelve
networks, and have covered up to 40 channels. Our system rebuild and
additional digital services launches have increased the number of channels, and
made it possible to insert local advertising. In addition, we receive revenue
from certain programmers related to the launch of new cable television
channels.

Home Shopping.

In 2001, we received revenues from channels devoted
exclusively to home shopping (such as HSN) and other channels that allow us to
insert infomercials during off-peak hours.

Pricing for Our Products and Services

Our revenues are derived principally from the monthly fees our customers
pay for cable services. The prices we charge vary based on the market served
and level of service selected and are usually adjusted on an annual basis. As
of December 31, 2001, the average monthly fee was $13.22 for basic service and
$23.84 for expanded basic service. A one-time installation fee, which may be
waived in part during certain promotional periods, is charged to new customers.
We believe our price practices are in accordance with Federal Communications
Commission guidelines and are consistent with those prevailing in the industry
generally. See “– Regulation and Legislation.”

In accordance with the Federal Communications Commission’s rules, the
prices we charge for cable-related equipment, such as set-top terminals and
remote control devices, and installation services are based on actual costs
plus a permitted rate of return.

Although our service offerings vary by market because of differences in
the bandwidth capacity of the cable systems in each of our markets and
competitive and regulatory factors, our services, when offered on a stand-alone
basis, are typically offered at monthly price ranges as follows:

Our Network Technology

As of December 31, 2001, our cable systems consisted of approximately
210,228 sheath miles, including approximately 43,046 sheath miles of fiber
optic cable, passing approximately 11.5 million households and serving
approximately 7 million customers. Fiber optic cable is a communication medium
that uses glass fibers to transmit signals over long distances with minimum
signal loss or distortion.

The following table describes the current technological state of our
systems as of December 31, 2001 and the anticipated progress of planned
upgrades through 2003, based on the percentage of our customers who will have
access to the bandwidths listed below and two-way capability:

We have adopted the hybrid fiber coaxial cable (HFC) architecture as the
standard for our ongoing systems upgrades. HFC architecture combines the use
of fiber optic cable with coaxial cable. Fiber optic cable has excellent
broadband frequency characteristics, noise immunity and physical durability and
can carry hundreds of video, data and voice channels over extended distances.
Coaxial cable is less expensive and requires a more extensive signal
amplification in order to obtain the desired transmission levels for delivering
channels. In most systems, we deliver our signals via fiber optic cable from
the headend to a group of nodes, and use coaxial cable to deliver the signal
from individual nodes to the homes passed served by that node. Our system
design enables a maximum of 500 homes passed to be served by a single node.
Currently, our average node serves approximately 380 homes passed. Our system
design provides for six strands of fiber to each node, with two strands
activated and four strands reserved for future services (sometimes referred to
as “dark fiber”). We believe that this hybrid network design provides high
capacity and superior signal quality, and will enable us to provide the newest
forms of telecommunications services to our customers. It also provides
reserve capacity for the addition of future services.

- 17 -


The primary advantages of HFC architecture over traditional coaxial-only cable networks include:

•

increased bandwidth capacity, for more channels and other services;

•

dedicated bandwidth for two-way services, which avoids reverse
signal interference problems that can otherwise occur with two-way
communication capability;

•

improved picture quality and service reliability; and

•

operating efficiencies resulting from a reduced number of headends.

In 2001, we established a fully operational national network operations
center to monitor our networks and ensure maximum quality of service.
Monitoring becomes increasingly important as we increase the number of
customers utilizing two-way high-speed data service. In February 2002, we
acquired a fully operational network operations center from High Speed Access
Corp., which we will convert into a regional network operations center. By
December 31, 2003, we expect to operate nine regional operations centers that
will focus on local network operations. These regional operations centers will
be either new facilities or conversions of existing facilities.

Management of Our Systems

Our operating philosophy emphasizes decentralized management, with
decisions being made as close to the customer as possible. In January 2002, we
restructured from two to three operating divisions and consolidated from twelve
to ten operating regions; the existing Eastern Division was subdivided into
four operating regions; the Western Division was subdivided into three
operating regions; and the Midwest Division was subdivided into three operating
regions. Each of the three divisions is managed by a Senior Vice President,
who is responsible for the overall supervision of the operating regions within
the division. Each operating region is separately managed and supported by
operational, marketing and engineering personnel at the regional and local
system level.

Our consolidation of certain functions at the regional level has resulted
in numerous operating efficiencies and superior customer care. At the same
time, our centralized financial management by our corporate office enables us
to set financial and operating benchmarks and monitor system performance on an
ongoing basis. Our corporate office also performs certain financial functions
such as accounting, finance and acquisitions, payroll and benefit
administration, internal audit, purchasing and programming contract
administration on a centralized basis.

Markets

We provide our cable and other services throughout 40 of the 48
continental United States, with approximately 80% of our customers located in
14 states. The following table shows our major strategic markets and the
number of basic customers in each of these markets as of December 31, 2001:

- 18 -


Sales and Marketing

We have a strong team responsible for overseeing the sales and the
marketing strategies of our individual systems. We have a dedicated marketing
manager in each of our significant systems, while smaller systems are handled
regionally. We believe our success in marketing comes in large part from new
and innovative ideas and from good interaction, quick information flow and
sharing of best practices between our corporate office, which handles programs
and administration, and our field offices, which implement the various
programs. In addition, we constantly monitor the regulatory arena, customer
perception, competition, pricing and product preferences to increase our
responsiveness to our customers.

Our long-term marketing objective is to increase our revenue growth per
household. We hope that customers will come to view their cable connection as
the best “pipeline” to the home for a multitude of services. To achieve this
objective, we are pursuing the following strategies:

We invest significant amounts of time, effort and financial resources in
marketing new and existing services. To increase customer penetration and
increase the level of services used by our customers, we use coordinated
marketing techniques, including door-to-door solicitation, media advertising,
e-marketing, and proprietary locations. We have developed specialized programs
to attract customers who have never subscribed for cable services and customers
of competitive services. In 2001, we began to sell our services through
consumer electronics retailers and other retailers that sell televisions or
cable modems.

Customer Care

Maximizing customer satisfaction is a key element of our business
strategy. In support of our commitment to customer satisfaction, we operate a
24-hour customer service hotline for nearly all of our systems and offer
on-time installation and service guarantees.

To better serve our customers, we are consolidating some of our local
customer care functions at the regional level. As of December 31, 2001, the
ten largest customer contact centers handled approximately 38% of our
customers. In February 2002, through our acquisition of the high-speed
Internet access assets of High Speed Access, we acquired an additional customer
contact center dedicated to serving cable modem high-speed Internet access
customers. By establishing regional customer contact centers, we are able to
service our customers 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with highly trained
personnel. These regional centers utilize state-of-the-art equipment that
enhances all interactions with our customers and provides a high-performance
employee environment. Our customer care specialists receive extensive training
to develop customer contact skills and product knowledge that are critical to
high rates of customer retention as

- 19 -


well as selling additional services and higher levels of service to our
customers. We expect that our customer care functions will benefit from the
additional technologies available as our national and regional network
operations centers open in the related area. We utilize surveys, focus groups
and other research tools as part of our efforts to determine and respond to
customer needs.

Consistent with our focus on customer satisfaction, we have implemented
stringent customer care standards that we believe meet or exceed those
established by the National Cable Television Association, the Washington,
D.C.-based trade association for the cable industry.

Programming

General.

We believe that offering a wide variety of conveniently
scheduled programming is an important factor influencing a customer’s decision
to subscribe to and retain our cable services. We devote considerable
resources to obtaining access to a wide range of programming that we believe
will appeal to both existing and potential customers. We rely on extensive
market research, customer demographics and local programming preferences to
determine channel offerings in each of our markets. We obtain basic and
premium programming from a number of suppliers, usually pursuant to a written
contract. Our programming contracts generally continue for a fixed period of
time, usually from three to ten years, and are subject to negotiated renewal.
Some program suppliers offer financial support for the launch of a new channel
and ongoing marketing support. We also try to negotiate volume discount
pricing structures.

Costs.

Programming tends to be made available to us for a flat fee per
customer. However, some channels are available without cost to us. In
connection with the launch of a new channel, we may receive a distribution fee
to support the channel launch. For home shopping channels, we receive a
percentage of the amount spent in home shopping purchases by our customers on
channels we carry.

Our cable programming costs have increased in recent years and are
expected to continue to increase due to factors including:

•

additional programming being provided to customers as a result
of system rebuilds that increase channel capacity;

•

increased cost to produce or purchase cable programming;

•

inflationary or negotiated annual increases; and

•

system acquisitions that increase the number of customers.

In every year we have operated, our costs to acquire programming have
exceeded customary inflationary and cost-of-living type increases. In
particular, sports programming costs have increased significantly over the past
several years. In addition, contracts to purchase sports programming sometimes
contain built-in cost increases for programming added during the term of the
contract.

Under rate regulations of the Federal Communications Commission, cable
operators may increase their rates to customers to cover increased costs for
programming, subject to certain limitations. See “–Regulation and
Legislation.”

Franchises

As of December 31, 2001, our systems operated pursuant to a total of
approximately 4,570 franchises, permits and similar authorizations issued by
local and state governmental authorities. Each franchise is awarded by a
governmental authority and is usually not transferable unless the granting
governmental authority consents. Most franchises are subject to termination
proceedings in the event of a material breach. In addition, most franchises
require us to pay the granting authority a franchise fee of up to 5.0% of gross
revenues, which is the maximum amount that may be charged under the applicable
federal law.

Prior to the scheduled expiration of most franchises, we initiate renewal
proceedings with the granting authorities. This process usually takes three
years but can take a longer period of time. The Communications Act provides
for an orderly franchise renewal

- 20 -


process in which granting authorities may not
unreasonably withhold renewals. If a renewal is withheld and the granting
authority takes over operation of the affected cable system or awards the cable
franchise to another party, the granting authority must pay the existing cable
operator the “fair market value” of the physical system assets. However, there
is no requirement that the granting authority take over the operation or award
it to another party. The Communications Act also established comprehensive
renewal procedures requiring that an incumbent franchisee’s renewal application
be evaluated on its own merit and not as part of a comparative process with
competing applications. In connection with the franchise renewal process, many
governmental authorities require the cable operator to make certain
commitments, such as technological upgrades to the system. Although
historically we have been able to renew our franchises without incurring
significant costs, we cannot assure you that any particular franchise will be
renewed or that it can be renewed on commercially favorable terms. Our failure
to obtain renewals of our franchises, especially those in major metropolitan
areas where we have the most customers, would have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations and financial condition. Approximately 37%
of our franchises covering approximately 37% of our basic cable customers
expire within five years of December 31, 2001.

Under the 1996 Telecom Act, state and local authorities are prohibited
from limiting, restricting or conditioning the provision of telecommunications
services. They may, however, impose “competitively neutral” requirements and
manage the public rights-of-way. Granting authorities may not require a cable
operator to provide telecommunications services or facilities, other than
institutional networks, as a condition of an initial franchise grant, a
franchise renewal, or a franchise transfer. The 1996 Telecom Act also limits
franchise fees to an operator’s cable-related revenues and clarifies that they
do not apply to revenues that a cable operator derives from providing new
telecommunications services. In a March 2002 decision, the Federal
Communications Commission tentatively held that a cable operator’s provision of
Internet access service should not subject the operator to additional
franchising requirements nor should the revenue derived from such service be
subject to local franchise fee assessments.

We believe our relations with the franchising authorities under which our
systems are operated are generally good. Substantially all of the material
franchises relating to our systems which are eligible for renewal have been
renewed or extended at or prior to their stated expiration dates.

Competition

We face competition in the areas of price, products and services, and
service reliability. We compete with other providers of television signals and
other sources of home entertainment. In addition, as we expand into additional
services such as high-speed Internet access, interactive services and
telephony, we face competition from other providers of each type of service.
We operate in a very competitive business environment which can adversely
affect our business and operations.

Through business developments such as the merger of Tele-Communications,
Inc. and AT&T and the merger of America Online, Inc. (AOL) and Time Warner
Inc., customers have come to expect a variety of services from a single
provider. While these mergers are not expected to have a direct or immediate
impact on our business, they encourage providers of cable and
telecommunications services to expand their service offerings. They also
encourage consolidation in the cable industry, such as the proposed merger of
AT&T Broadband with Comcast Corp., the largest and third largest cable
providers in the country, as cable operators recognize the competitive benefits
of a large customer base and expanded financial resources.

Our key competitors include:

DBS.

Direct broadcast satellite, known as DBS, is a significant
competitor to cable systems. The DBS industry has grown rapidly over the last
several years, far exceeding the growth rate of the cable television industry,
and now serves more than 17 million subscribers nationwide. DBS service allows
the subscriber to receive video and high-speed Internet access services
directly via satellite using a relatively small dish antenna. Moreover, video
compression technology allows DBS providers to offer more than 100 digital
channels, thereby surpassing the typical analog cable system.

DBS companies historically were prohibited from retransmitting popular
local broadcast programming. However, a change to the copyright laws in 1999
eliminated this legal impediment. As a result, DBS companies now may
retransmit such programming, once they have secured retransmission consent from
the popular broadcast stations they wish to carry, and they faced mandatory
carriage obligations of less popular broadcast stations as of January 2002. In
response to the legislation, DirecTV, Inc. and EchoStar Communications
Corporation have begun carrying the major network stations in

- 21 -


the nation’s top television markets. DBS, however, is limited in the
local programming it can provide because of the current capacity limitations of
satellite technology, and the DBS companies currently offer local broadcast
programming only in the larger U.S. markets. The DBS industry initiated a
judicial challenge to the 2002 requirement mandating carriage of less popular
broadcast stations. This lawsuit alleges that the requirement (similar to the
one applicable to cable systems) is unconstitutional. The federal district
court and circuit court both rejected the DBS industry’s constitutional
challenge, but the industry is now seeking review by the U.S. Supreme Court.

In October 2001, EchoStar and DirecTV, the two largest DBS providers in
the country, announced EchoStar’s planned merger with DirecTV, subject to,
among other things, regulatory approval. If approved by regulators and
consummated, the proposed merger would provide expanded transmission capacity
for a single company serving more than 17 million customers. It is unclear
what impact the consolidation of these two companies will have on the
competition we face from the DBS industry. EchoStar and DirecTV have announced,
however, that the merger would afford the surviving entity sufficient capacity
to expand the carriage of local broadcast programming to every U.S. television
market.

DSL.

The deployment of digital subscriber line technology, known as DSL,
allows Internet access to subscribers at data transmission speeds greater than
available over conventional telephone lines. DSL service therefore is
competitive with high-speed Internet access over cable systems. Several
telephone companies and other companies offer DSL service. There are bills now
before Congress that would reduce regulation of Internet services offered by
incumbent telephone companies, and the Federal Communications Commission
recently initiated a rulemaking proceeding that could materially reduce
existing regulation of DSL service, essentially freeing such service from
traditional telecommunications regulation. The Federal Communications
Commission’s decisions and policies in this area are subject to change. We
cannot predict the likelihood of success of the Internet access services
offered by our competitors, or the impact on our business and operations of
these competitive ventures.

DSL and other forms of high-speed Internet access provide competition to
our own provision of Internet access. For example, EchoStar and DirecTV have
both begun the provision of high-speed Internet access to residential
consumers. High-speed Internet access also facilitates the streaming of video
into homes and businesses. As the quality and availability of video streaming
over the Internet improve, video streaming may compete with the traditional
delivery of video programming services over cable systems. It is possible that
programming suppliers will consider bypassing cable operators and market their
services directly to the consumer through video streaming over the Internet.

Broadcast Television.

Cable television has long competed with broadcast
television, which consists of television signals that the viewer is able to
receive without charge using an “off-air” antenna. The extent of such
competition is dependent upon the quality and quantity of broadcast signals
available through “off-air” reception compared to the services provided by the
local cable system. The recent licensing of digital spectrum by the Federal
Communications Commission will provide incumbent television licenses with the
ability to deliver high definition television pictures and multiple
digital-quality program streams, as well as advanced digital services such as
subscription video and data transmission.

Traditional Overbuilds.

Cable television systems are operated under
non-exclusive franchises granted by local authorities. More than one cable
system may legally be built in the same area. It is possible that a
franchising authority might grant a second franchise to another cable operator
and that such a franchise might contain terms and conditions more favorable
than those afforded us. In addition, entities willing to establish an open
video system, under which they offer unaffiliated programmers
non-discriminatory access to a portion of the system’s cable system, may be
able to avoid local franchising requirements. Well-financed businesses from
outside the cable industry, such as public utilities that already possess fiber
optic and other transmission lines in the areas they serve, may over time
become competitors. There are a number of cities that have constructed their
own cable systems, in a manner similar to city-provided utility services.
There also has been interest in traditional overbuilds by private companies.
Constructing a competing cable system is a capital intensive process which
involves a high degree of risk. We believe that in order to be successful, a
competitor’s overbuild would need to be able to serve the homes and businesses
in the overbuilt area on a more cost-effective basis than us. Any such
overbuild operation would require either significant access to capital or
access to facilities already in place that are capable of delivering cable
television programming.

As of December 31, 2001, we are aware of overbuild situations impacting
approximately 3.5% of our total basic customers, and potential overbuild
situations in areas servicing approximately 4.6% of our total basic customers,
together representing a total of approximately 8.1% of our basic customers.
Additional overbuild situations may occur in other systems. In response to
such overbuilds, these systems have been designated priorities for the upgrade
of cable plant and

- 22 -


the launch of new and enhanced services. As of December 31, 2001, we have
upgraded many of these systems to at least 750 megahertz two-way HFC
architecture.

Telephone Companies and Utilities.

The competitive environment has been
significantly affected by technological developments and regulatory changes
enacted under the 1996 Telecom Act, which was designed to enhance competition
in the cable television and local telephone markets. Federal cross-ownership
restrictions historically limited entry by local telephone companies into the
cable business. The 1996 Telecom Act modified this cross-ownership
restriction, making it possible for local exchange carriers, who have
considerable resources, to provide a wide variety of video services competitive
with services offered by cable systems.

Several telephone companies have obtained or are seeking cable franchises
from local governmental authorities and are constructing cable systems. Some
local exchange carriers may choose to make broadband services available under
the open video regulatory framework of the Federal Communications Commission or
through wireless technology. In addition, local exchange carriers provide
facilities for the transmission and distribution of voice and data services,
including Internet services, in competition with our existing or potential
interactive services ventures and businesses. We cannot predict the likelihood
of success of the broadband services offered by our competitors or the impact
on us of such competitive ventures. Although enthusiasm on the part of local
exchange carriers appears to have waned in recent months, the entry of
telephone companies as direct competitors in the video marketplace may become
more widespread and could adversely affect the profitability and valuation of
established cable systems.

As we expand our offerings to include Internet access and other
telecommunications services, we will be subject to competition from other
telecommunications providers. The telecommunications industry is highly
competitive and includes competitors with greater financial and personnel
resources, who have brand name recognition and long-standing relationships with
regulatory authorities and customers. Moreover, mergers, joint ventures and
alliances among franchise, wireless or private cable operators, local exchange
carriers and others may result in providers capable of offering cable
television, Internet, and telecommunications services in direct competition
with us.

Additionally, we are subject to competition from utilities which possess
fiber optic transmission lines capable of transmitting signals with minimal
signal distortion.

Private Cable.

Additional competition is posed by satellite master
antenna television systems known as “SMATV systems” serving multiple dwelling
units, referred to in the cable industry as “MDUs”, such as condominiums,
apartment complexes, and private residential communities. These private cable
systems may enter into exclusive agreements with such MDUs, which may preclude
operators of franchise systems from serving residents of such private
complexes. Private cable systems can offer both improved reception of local
television stations and many of the same satellite-delivered program services
which are offered by cable systems. SMATV systems currently benefit from
operating advantages not available to franchised cable systems, including fewer
regulatory burdens and no requirement to service low density or economically
depressed communities. Exemption from regulation may provide a competitive
advantage to certain of our current and potential competitors. The Federal
Communications Commission ruled in 1998 that private cable operators can lease
video distribution capacity from local telephone companies and distribute cable
programming services over public rights-of-way without obtaining a cable
franchise. In 1999, both the Fifth and Seventh Circuit Courts of Appeals
upheld this Federal Communications Commission policy.

Wireless Distribution.

Cable television systems also compete with
wireless program distribution services such as multi-channel multipoint
distribution systems or “wireless cable,” known as MMDS. MMDS uses low-power
microwave frequencies to transmit television programming over-the-air to paying
customers. Wireless distribution services generally provide many of the
programming services provided by cable systems, and digital compression
technology is likely to increase significantly the channel capacity of their
systems. Both analog and digital MMDS services require unobstructed “line of
sight” transmission paths.

Regulation and Legislation

The following summary addresses the key regulatory developments and
legislation affecting the cable industry.

The operation of a cable system is extensively regulated by the Federal
Communications Commission, some state governments and most local governments.
The Federal Communications Commission has the authority to enforce its
regulations through the imposition of substantial fines, the issuance of cease
and desist orders and/or the imposition of other

- 23 -


administrative sanctions, such as the revocation of Federal Communications
Commission licenses needed to operate certain transmission facilities used in
connection with cable operations. The 1996 Telecom Act altered the regulatory
structure governing the nation’s communications providers. It removed barriers
to competition in both the cable television market and the local telephone
market. Among other things, it reduced the scope of cable rate regulation and
encouraged additional competition in the video programming industry by allowing
local telephone companies to provide video programming in their own telephone
service areas.

The 1996 Telecom Act required the Federal Communications Commission to
undertake a host of implementing rulemakings. Moreover, Congress and the
Federal Communications Commission have frequently revisited the subject of
cable regulation. Future legislative and regulatory changes could adversely
affect our operations.

Cable Rate Regulation.

The 1992 Cable Act imposed an extensive rate
regulation regime on the cable television industry, which limited the ability
of cable companies to increase subscriber fees. Under that regime, all cable
systems were subjected to rate regulation, unless they faced “effective
competition” in their local franchise area. Federal law defines “effective
competition” on a community-specific basis as requiring satisfaction of certain
conditions. These conditions are not typically satisfied in the current
marketplace; hence, most cable systems potentially are subject to rate
regulation. However, with the rapid growth of DBS, it is likely that
additional cable systems will soon qualify for “effective competition” and
thereby avoid further rate regulation.

Although the Federal Communications Commission established the underlying
regulatory scheme, local government units, commonly referred to as local
franchising authorities, are primarily responsible for administering the
regulation of the lowest level of cable service – the basic service tier, which
typically contains local broadcast stations and public, educational, and
government access channels. Before a local franchising authority begins basic
service rate regulation, it must certify to the Federal Communications
Commission that it will follow applicable federal rules. Many local
franchising authorities have voluntarily declined to exercise their authority
to regulate basic service rates. Local franchising authorities also have
primary responsibility for regulating cable equipment rates. Under federal
law, charges for various types of cable equipment must be unbundled from each
other and from monthly charges for programming services.

As of December 31, 2001, approximately 16.3% of our local franchising
authorities were certified to regulate basic tier rates. Because the 1992
Cable Act permits communities to become certified and regulate rates at any
time, it is possible that additional localities served by the systems may
choose to certify and regulate basic rates in the future.

For regulated cable systems, the basic service tier rate increases are
governed by a complicated price cap scheme devised by the Federal
Communications Commission that allows for the recovery of inflation and certain
increased costs, as well as providing some incentive for system upgrades.
Operators also have the opportunity to bypass this “benchmark” regulatory
scheme in favor of traditional “cost-of-service” regulation in cases where the
latter methodology appears favorable. Cost of service regulation is a
traditional form of rate regulation, under which a utility is allowed to
recover its costs of providing the regulated service, plus a reasonable profit.

With regard to cable programming service tiers, which are the expanded
basic programming packages that offer services other than basic programming and
which typically contain satellite-delivered programming, the Federal
Communications Commission historically administered rate regulation of these
tiers. Under the 1996 Telecom Act, however, the Federal Communications
Commission’s authority to regulate cable programming service tier rates expired
on March 31, 1999. The Federal Communications Commission still adjudicates
cable programming service tier complaints filed prior to that date, but
strictly limits its review, and possible refund orders, to the time period
prior to March 31, 1999. As of December 31, 2001, we had cable programming
service tier rate complaints relating to approximately 93 franchise areas
pending at the Federal Communications Commission. We do not believe any
adjudications regarding these complaints will have a material adverse effect on
our business. The elimination of cable programming service tier regulation
affords us substantially greater pricing flexibility.

Premium cable services offered on a per-channel or per-program basis
remain unregulated under both the 1992 Cable Act and the 1996 Telecom Act.
However, federal law requires that the basic service tier be offered to all
cable subscribers and limits the ability of operators to require purchase of
any cable programming service tier if a customer seeks to purchase premium
services offered on a per-channel or per-program basis, subject to a technology
exception which expires in October 2002. The 1996 Telecom Act also relaxes
existing “uniform rate” requirements by specifying that uniform rate
requirements do not apply where the operator faces “effective competition,” and
by exempting bulk discounts

- 24 -


to multiple dwelling units, although complaints about predatory pricing
still may be made to the Federal Communications Commission.

Cable Entry into Telecommunications and Pole Attachment Rates.

The 1996
Telecom Act creates a more favorable environment for us to provide
telecommunications services beyond traditional video delivery. It provides
that no state or local laws or regulations may prohibit or have the effect of
prohibiting any entity from providing any interstate or intrastate
telecommunications service. A cable operator is authorized under the 1996
Telecom Act to provide telecommunications services without obtaining a separate
local franchise. States are authorized, however, to impose “competitively
neutral” requirements regarding universal service, public safety and welfare,
service quality, and consumer protection. State and local governments also
retain their authority to manage the public rights-of-way and may require
reasonable, competitively neutral compensation for management of the public
rights-of-way when cable operators provide telecommunications service. The
favorable pole attachment rates afforded cable operators under federal law can
be gradually increased by utility companies owning the poles if the operator
provides telecommunications service, as well as cable service, over its plant.
The Federal Communications Commission clarified that a cable operator’s
favorable pole rates are not endangered by the provision of Internet access,
and that approach ultimately was upheld by the United States Supreme Court.

Cable entry into telecommunications will be affected by the rulings and
regulations implementing the 1996 Telecom Act, including the rules governing
interconnection. A cable operator offering telecommunications services
generally needs efficient interconnection with other telephone companies to
provide a viable service. A number of details designed to facilitate
interconnection are subject to ongoing regulatory and judicial review, but the
basic obligation of incumbent telephone companies to interconnect with
competitors, such as cable companies offering telephone service, is well
established. Even so, the economic viability of different interconnection
arrangements can be greatly affected by regulatory changes. Consequently, we
cannot predict whether reasonable interconnection terms will be available in
any particular market we may choose to enter.

Internet Service.

Over the past several years, proposals have been
advanced at the Federal Communications Commission and Congress that would
require cable operators to provide non-discriminatory access to unaffiliated
Internet service providers and online service providers. Several local
franchising authorities actually adopted mandatory “open access” requirements,
but various federal courts have rejected each of these actions, relying on
different legal theories.

In March 2002, the Federal Communications Commission ruled that cable
modem service (that is, the provision of high speed internet access over cable
system infrastructure) is an interstate information service, rather than a
cable or telecommunications service. This classification should leave cable
modem service exempt from the burdens associated with traditional cable and
telecommunications regulation. Indeed, the Federal Communications Commission
tentatively concluded that revenue earned from the provision of cable service
is not subject to local cable franchise fee assessments. With regard to the
open access question, the Federal Communications Commission specifically held
that, regardless of classification, regulatory forbearance should now apply.

The full consequences of classifying cable modem service as an interstate
information service are not yet fully known. The Federal Communications
Commission is already considering whether providers of cable modem service
should contribute to the federal government’s universal service fund. This
contribution could more than offset the savings associated with excluding cable
modem service from local franchise fee assessments. The Federal Communications
Commission also initiated a rulemaking proceeding to determine whether its
jurisdiction over information services still might warrant imposition of open
access requirements in the future. Finally, the information services
classification itself is likely to be subject to judicial review. If
regulators ultimately were allowed to impose Internet access requirements on
cable operators, it could burden the capacity of cable systems and complicate
our own plans for providing Internet service.

Telephone Company Entry into Cable Television.

The 1996 Telecom Act
allows telephone companies to compete directly with cable operators by
repealing the historic telephone company/cable cross-ownership ban. Local
exchange carriers can now compete with cable operators both inside and outside
their telephone service areas with certain regulatory safeguards. Because of
their resources, local exchange carriers could be formidable competitors to
traditional cable operators. Various local exchange carriers already are
providing video programming services within their telephone service areas
through a variety of distribution methods.

Under the 1996 Telecom Act, local exchange carriers or any other cable
competitor providing video programming to subscribers through broadband wire
should be regulated as a traditional cable operator, subject to local
franchising and

- 25 -


federal regulatory requirements, unless the local exchange carrier or
other cable competitor elects to deploy its broadband plant as an open video
system. To qualify for favorable open video system status, the competitor must
reserve two-thirds of the system’s activated channels for unaffiliated
entities. Even then, the Federal Communications Commission revised its open
video system policy to leave franchising discretion to state and local
authorities. It is unclear what effect this ruling will have on the entities
pursuing open video system operation.

Although local exchange carriers and cable operators can now expand their
offerings across traditional service boundaries, the general prohibition
remains on local exchange carrier buyouts of cable systems serving an
overlapping territory. Cable operator buyouts of overlapping local exchange
carrier systems, and joint ventures between cable operators and local exchange
carriers in the same market, also are prohibited. The 1996 Telecom Act
provides a few limited exceptions to this buyout prohibition, including a
carefully circumscribed “rural exemption.” The 1996 Telecom Act also provides
the Federal Communications Commission with the limited authority to grant
waivers of the buyout prohibition.

Electric Utility Entry into Telecommunications/Cable Television.

The 1996
Telecom Act provides that registered utility holding companies and subsidiaries
may provide telecommunications services, including cable television,
notwithstanding the Public Utility Holding Company Act. Electric utilities
must establish separate subsidiaries, known as “exempt telecommunications
companies” and must apply to the Federal Communications Commission for
operating authority. Like telephone companies, electric utilities have
substantial resources at their disposal, and could be formidable competitors to
traditional cable systems. Several such utilities have been granted broad
authority by the Federal Communications Commission to engage in activities
which could include the provision of video programming.

Additional Ownership Restrictions.

The 1996 Telecom Act eliminates
statutory restrictions on broadcast/cable cross-ownership, including broadcast
network/cable restrictions, but leaves in place existing Federal Communications
Commission regulations prohibiting local cross-ownership between co-located
television stations and cable systems. The District of Columbia Circuit Court
of Appeals recently struck down this remaining cross-ownership prohibition,
concluding that the Federal Communications Commission had failed to explain why
its continuation was “necessary” in the public interest. In the same decision,
the Court struck down another Federal Communications Commission regulation
precluding any entity from operating broadcast television stations serving more
than 35% of the nation. If these rulings withstand further administrative and
judicial review, they may trigger additional consolidation among domestic media
companies.

Pursuant to the 1992 Cable Act, the Federal Communications Commission
adopted rules precluding a cable system from devoting more than 40% of its
activated channel capacity to the carriage of affiliated national video program
services. Also pursuant to the 1992 Cable Act, the Federal Communications
Commission adopted rules that preclude any cable operator from serving more
than 30% of all U.S. domestic multichannel video subscribers, including cable
and direct broadcast satellite subscribers. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals
struck down these vertical and horizontal ownership limits as unconstitutional,
concluding that the Federal Communications Commission had not adequately
justified the specific rules (i.e., the 40% and 30% figures) adopted. As a
result, an existing divestiture requirement on AT&T was suspended. The Federal
Communications Commission is now considering replacement regulations. These
ownership restrictions may be affected by the proposed merger of EchoStar and
DirecTV and the proposed merger of AT&T Broadband and Comcast Cable. These
recently announced transactions involve the nation’s two largest DBS providers
and the nation’s largest and third largest cable operators. The proposed
combinations might prompt additional consolidation in the cable industry and
are likely to heighten regulatory concerns regarding industry consolidation.
Although any resulting restrictions could be limited to the particular entities
involved, it is also possible that the restrictions would apply to other cable
operators, including us.

Must Carry/Retransmission Consent.

The 1992 Cable Act contains broadcast
signal carriage requirements. Broadcast signal carriage is the transmission of
broadcast television signals over a cable system to cable customers. These
requirements, among other things, allow local commercial television broadcast
stations to elect once every three years between “must carry” status or
“retransmission consent” status. Less popular stations typically elect must
carry, which is the broadcast signal carriage requirement that allows local
commercial television broadcast stations to require a cable system to carry the
station. More popular stations, such as those affiliated with a national
network, typically elect retransmission consent which is the broadcast signal
carriage requirement that allows local commercial television broadcast stations
to negotiate for payments for granting permission to the cable operator to
carry the stations. Must carry requests can dilute the appeal of a cable
system’s programming offerings because a cable system with limited channel
capacity may be required to forego carriage of popular channels in favor of
less popular broadcast stations electing must carry. Retransmission consent
demands may require substantial payments or other concessions. Either option
has a potentially adverse effect on our business. The burden associated with
must carry may increase substantially if broadcasters proceed

- 26 -


with planned conversion to digital transmission and the Federal
Communications Commission determines that cable systems simultaneously must
carry all analog and digital broadcasts in their entirety. This burden would
reduce capacity available for more popular video programming and new Internet
and telecommunication offerings. The Federal Communications Commission
tentatively decided against imposition of dual digital and analog must carry in
a January 2001 ruling. At the same time, however, it initiated further
fact-gathering which ultimately could lead to a reconsideration of the
tentative conclusion. The Federal Communications Commission is also
considering whether it should maintain its initial ruling that, whenever a
digital broadcast signal does become eligible for must carry, a cable
operator’s obligation is limited to carriage of the primary video signal. If
the Commission reverses itself, and cable operators are required to carry
ancillary digital feeds, the burden associated with digital must carry could be
significantly increased.

Access Channels.

Local franchising authorities can include franchise
provisions requiring cable operators to set aside certain channels for public,
educational and governmental access programming. Federal law also requires
cable systems to designate a portion of their channel capacity, up to 15% in
some cases, for commercial leased access by unaffiliated third parties. The
Federal Communications Commission has adopted rules regulating the terms,
conditions and maximum rates a cable operator may charge for commercial leased
access use. We believe that requests for commercial leased access carriages
have been relatively limited. The Federal Communications Commission rejected a
request that unaffiliated Internet service providers be found eligible for
commercial leased access.

Access to Programming.

To spur the development of independent cable
programmers and competition to incumbent cable operators, the 1992 Cable Act
imposed restrictions on the dealings between cable operators and cable
programmers. Of special significance from a competitive business position, the
1992 Cable Act precludes video programmers affiliated with cable companies from
favoring their cable operators over new competitors and requires such
programmers to sell their satellite-delivered programming to other multichannel
video distributors. This provision limits the ability of vertically integrated
cable programmers to offer exclusive programming arrangements to cable
companies. This prohibition is scheduled to expire in October 2002, unless the
Federal Communications Commission determines in a pending proceeding that an
extension is necessary to protect competition and diversity. There also has
been interest expressed in further restricting the marketing practices of cable
programmers, including subjecting programmers who are not affiliated with cable
operators to all of the existing program access requirements, and subjecting
terrestrially-delivered programming (especially regional sports networks) to
the program access requirements. Terrestrially-delivered programming is
programming delivered other than by satellite and is currently exempt from the
ban on exclusivity. These changes should not have a dramatic impact on us, but
would limit potential competitive advantages we now enjoy. DBS providers have
no similar restrictions on exclusive programming contracts. Pursuant to the
Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act, the Federal Communications Commission
has adopted regulations governing retransmission consent negotiations between
broadcasters and all multichannel video programming distributors, including
cable and DBS.

Inside Wiring; Subscriber Access.

In an order issued in 1997, the Federal
Communications Commission established rules that require an incumbent cable
operator upon expiration of a multiple dwelling unit service contract to sell,
abandon, or remove “home run” wiring that was installed by the cable operator
in a multiple dwelling unit building. These inside wiring rules are expected
to assist building owners in their attempts to replace existing cable operators
with new programming providers who are willing to pay the building owner a
higher fee, where such a fee is permissible. The Federal Communications
Commission has also proposed terminating all exclusive multiple dwelling unit
service agreements held by incumbent operators, but allowing such contracts
when held by new entrants. In another proceeding, the Federal Communications
Commission has preempted restrictions on the deployment of private antennae on
property within the exclusive use of a condominium owner or tenant, such as
balconies and patios. This Federal Communications Commission ruling may limit
the extent to which we along with multiple dwelling unit owners may enforce
certain aspects of multiple dwelling unit agreements which otherwise prohibit,
for example, placement of digital broadcast satellite receiver antennae in
multiple dwelling unit areas under the exclusive occupancy of a renter. These
developments may make it even more difficult for us to provide service in
multiple dwelling unit complexes.

- 27 -


Other Regulations of the Federal Communications Commission.

In addition
to the Federal Communications Commission regulations noted above, there are
other regulations of the Federal Communications Commission covering such areas
as:

•

subscriber privacy,

•

programming practices, including, among other things,

The Federal Communications Commission ruled that cable customers must be
allowed to purchase set-top terminals from third parties and established a
multi-year phase-in during which security functions (which would remain in the
operator’s exclusive control) would be unbundled from basic converter
functions, which could then be provided by third party vendors. The first
phase implementation date was July 1, 2000.

Additional Regulatory Policies May Be Added in the Future.

The Federal
Communications Commission recently initiated an inquiry to determine whether
the cable industry’s future provision of interactive services should be subject
to regulations ensuring equal access and competition among service vendors.
The inquiry, which grew out of the Commission’s review of the AOL-Time Warner
merger, is in its earliest stages, but is yet another expression of regulatory
concern regarding control over cable capacity.

Copyright.

Cable television systems are subject to federal copyright
licensing covering carriage of television and radio broadcast signals. In
exchange for filing certain reports and contributing a percentage of their
revenues to a federal copyright royalty pool that varies depending on the size
of the system, the number of distant broadcast television signals carried, and
the location of the cable system, cable operators can obtain blanket permission
to retransmit copyrighted material included in broadcast signals. The possible
modification or elimination of this compulsory copyright license is the

- 28 -


subject of continuing legislative review and could adversely affect our
ability to obtain desired broadcast programming. We cannot predict the outcome
of this legislative activity. Copyright clearances for nonbroadcast
programming services are arranged through private negotiations.

Cable operators distribute locally originated programming and advertising
that use music controlled by the two principal major music performing rights
organizations, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers and
Broadcast Music, Inc. The cable industry has had a long series of negotiations
and adjudications with both organizations. Although we cannot predict the
ultimate outcome of these industry proceedings or the amount of any license
fees we may be required to pay for past and future use of
association-controlled music, we do not believe such license fees will be
significant to our business and operations.

State and Local Regulation.

Cable systems generally are operated pursuant
to nonexclusive franchises granted by a municipality or other state or local
government entity in order to cross public rights-of-way. Federal law now
prohibits local franchising authorities from granting exclusive franchises or
from unreasonably refusing to award additional franchises. Cable franchises
generally are granted for fixed terms and in many cases include monetary
penalties for non-compliance and may be terminable if the franchisee fails to
comply with material provisions.

The specific terms and conditions of franchises vary materially between
jurisdictions. Each franchise generally contains provisions governing cable
operations, franchising fees, system construction and maintenance obligations,
system channel capacity, design and technical performance, customer service
standards, and indemnification protections. A number of states, including
Connecticut, subject cable systems to the jurisdiction of centralized state
governmental agencies, some of which impose regulation of a character similar
to that of a public utility. Although local franchising authorities have
considerable discretion in establishing franchise terms, there are certain
federal limitations. For example, local franchising authorities cannot insist
on franchise fees exceeding 5% of the system’s gross cable-related revenues,
cannot dictate the particular technology used by the system, and cannot specify
video programming other than identifying broad categories of programming.
Certain states are considering the imposition of new broadly applied
telecommunications taxes.

Federal law contains renewal procedures designed to protect incumbent
franchisees against arbitrary denials of renewal. Even if a franchise is
renewed, the local franchising authority may seek to impose new and more
onerous requirements such as significant upgrades in facilities and service or
increased franchise fees as a condition of renewal. Similarly, if a local
franchising authority’s consent is required for the purchase or sale of a cable
system or franchise, such local franchising authority may attempt to impose
more burdensome or onerous franchise requirements in connection with a request
for consent. Historically, most franchises have been renewed for and consents
granted to cable operators that have provided satisfactory services and have
complied with the terms of their franchise.

Under the 1996 Telecom Act, states and local franchising authorities are
prohibited from limiting, restricting, or conditioning the provision of
competitive telecommunications services, except for certain “competitively
neutral” requirements and as necessary to manage the public rights-of-way.
This law should facilitate entry into competitive telecommunications services,
although certain jurisdictions still may attempt to impose rigorous entry
requirements. In addition, local franchising authorities may not require a
cable operator to provide any telecommunications service or facilities, other
than institutional networks under certain circumstances, as a condition of an
initial franchise grant, a franchise renewal, or a franchise transfer. The
1996 Telecom Act also provides that franchising fees are limited to an
operator’s cable-related revenues and do not apply to revenues that a cable
operator derives from providing new telecommunications services. In a March
2002 decision, the Federal Communications Commission tentatively held that a
cable operator’s provision of Internet access service should not subject the
operator to additional franchising requirements nor should the revenue derived
from such service be subject to local franchise fee assessments.

Our corporate office includes employees of Charter Communications, Inc.
and Charter Communications Holding Company. The corporate office is
responsible for coordinating and overseeing our operations, including certain
critical functions, such as marketing and engineering, that are conducted by
personnel at the regional and local system level. The corporate office also
performs certain financial functions such as accounting, finance and
acquisitions, payroll and benefit administration, internal audit, purchasing
and programming contract administration on a centralized basis. Those
individuals who are employed by Charter Communications Holding Company are
leased to Charter Communications, Inc. pursuant to a mutual services agreement. See “Item 13. Certain
Relationships and Related Transactions — Management and Consulting
Arrangements.”

- 29 -


As of December 31, 2001, we had approximately 17,900 full-time equivalent
employees, approximately 300 of which were represented by collective bargaining
agreements. We believe we have a good relationship with our employees and have
never experienced a work stoppage.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.

Our principal physical assets consist of a cable television distribution
plant and equipment, including signal receiving, encoding and decoding devices,
headend reception facilities, distribution systems and customer drop equipment
for each of our cable television systems.

Our cable television plant and related equipment are generally attached to
utility poles under pole rental agreements with local public utilities and
telephone companies, and in certain locations are buried in underground ducts
or trenches. We own or lease real property for signal reception sites and own
most of our service vehicles.

Our subsidiaries generally own the real property and buildings for our
regional data center, customer contact centers and our regional and divisional
administrative offices. Our subsidiaries generally have leased space for
business offices throughout our operating regions, although an increasing
number of our systems are now purchasing property for system offices. Our
headend and tower locations are located on owned or leased parcels of land, and
we generally own the towers on which our equipment is located. Charter
Communications Holding Company owns the real property and building for our
principal executive offices.

The physical components of our cable systems require maintenance and
periodic upgrades to support the new services and products we introduce. We
believe that our properties are in good operating condition and are suitable
for our business operations.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

We are involved from time to time in routine legal matters and other
claims incidental to our business. We believe that the resolution of such
matters, taking into account established reserves and insurance, will not have
a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth
quarter of the year ended December 31, 2001.

Dividends

Charter Communications, Inc. has not paid stock or cash dividends on any
of its common stock, and we do not intend to pay cash dividends on common stock
in the foreseeable future. Except for the cash dividends required on preferred
stock issued from time to time, we intend to retain future earnings, if any, to
finance the expansion of our business.

Charter Communications, Inc. pays the holders of its Series A Convertible
Redeemable Preferred Stock quarterly cumulative cash dividends at an annual
rate of 5.75% on a liquidation preference of $100 per share from distributions
it receives from Charter Communications Holding Company on its Class B
Preferred membership units. The Class B Preferred membership units issued by
Charter Communications Holding Company to Charter Communications, Inc. are a
“mirror” security to Charter Communications, Inc.’s Series A Convertible
Redeemable Preferred Stock that replicate its dividend and conversion features.
For the year ended December 31, 2001, Charter Communications, Inc. paid an
aggregate of $969,190 in dividends to the holders of its Series A Convertible
Redeemable Preferred Stock.

Charter Communications Holding Company may make pro rata distributions to
all holders of its common membership units, including us. Covenants in the
indentures and credit agreements governing the debt obligations of Charter
Communications Holdings and its subsidiaries restrict their ability to make
distributions to us, and accordingly, limit our ability to declare or pay cash
dividends. Additionally, Charter Communications, Inc. is prohibited from
declaring or paying cash dividends on any class of stock on par with or junior
to the Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock, including the common
stock, unless the cumulative dividends on the preferred stock and any accrued
dividends on stock on par with the preferred stock for any past or current
period have been paid or set aside in full. See “Item 7. Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

Reference is made to “Certain Trends and Uncertainties” of this section
and Exhibit 99.1 “Risk Factors” which describes important factors that could
cause actual results to differ from expectations and non-historical information
contained herein. In addition, this section should be read in conjunction with
the audited consolidated financial statements of Charter Communications, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of and for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and
1999.

Introduction

We do not believe that our historical financial condition and results of
operations are accurate indicators of future results because of certain
significant past events. Those events include numerous mergers, acquisitions,
and equity and debt financing transactions over the last several years.

Prior to the acquisition of the Charter companies by Mr. Allen on December
23, 1998 and the merger of Marcus Holdings with and into Charter Holdings
effective April 7, 1999, the cable systems of the Charter and Marcus companies
were operated under four groups of companies. Three of these groups were
comprised of companies that were managed by Charter Investment and in which
Charter Investment had an ownership interest: (i) Charter Communications
Properties Holdings, LLC (CCPH); (ii) CCA Group; and (iii) CharterComm
Holdings, LLC. The fourth group was comprised of companies that were
subsidiaries of Marcus Holdings which Charter Investment began managing in
October 1998. In April 1998, Mr. Allen acquired approximately 99% of the
non-voting economic interests in Marcus Cable and agreed to acquire the
remaining interests.

Mr. Allen’s acquisition of the Charter companies became effective on
December 23, 1998, through a series of transactions in which Mr. Allen acquired
approximately 94% of the equity interests of Charter Investment for an
aggregate purchase price of $2.2 billion, excluding $2.0 billion in assumed
debt. CCPH and the operating companies that formerly comprised CCA Group and
CharterComm Holdings were contributed to Charter Operating subsequent to Mr.
Allen’s acquisition. CCPH is deemed to be our predecessor. Consequently, the
contribution of CCPH was accounted for as a reorganization under common
control. Accordingly, our results of operations for periods prior to and
including December 23, 1998 include the accounts of CCPH. The contributions of
the operating companies that formerly comprised CCA Group and CharterComm
Holdings were accounted for in accordance with purchase accounting.
Accordingly, our results of operations for periods after December 23, 1998
include the accounts of CCPH, CCA Group and CharterComm Holdings.

In February 1999, Charter Holdings was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary
of Charter Investment, and Charter Operating was formed as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Charter Holdings. All of Charter Investment’s direct interests in
the entities described above were transferred to Charter Operating. All of the
prior management agreements were terminated, and a single new management
agreement was entered into between Charter Investment and Charter Operating to
cover all of the subsidiaries.

In March 1999, all of Mr. Allen’s interests in Marcus Cable were
transferred to Marcus Holdings, a then newly-formed company. Later in March
1999, Mr. Allen acquired the remaining interests in Marcus Cable, including
voting control, which interests were transferred to Marcus Holdings. In April
1999, Mr. Allen merged Marcus Holdings into Charter Holdings and the operating
subsidiaries of Marcus Holdings and all of the cable systems they owned came
under the ownership of Charter Holdings and, in turn, Charter Operating. For
financial reporting purposes, the merger of Marcus Holdings with and into
Charter Holdings was accounted for as an acquisition of Marcus Holdings
effective March 31, 1999, and accordingly, the results of operations of Marcus
Holdings have been included in our consolidated financial statements since that
date.

In May 1999, Charter Communications Holding Company was formed as a wholly
owned subsidiary of Charter Investment. All of Charter Investment’s interests
in Charter Holdings were transferred to Charter Communications Holding Company.
In July 1999, Charter Communications, Inc. was formed as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Charter Investment.

In November 1999, Charter Communications, Inc. conducted its initial
public offering. In the initial public offering, substantially all of the
equity interests in Charter Communications, Inc. were sold to the public, and
less than 1% of its equity interests were sold to Mr. Allen. Charter
Communications, Inc. contributed substantially all of the proceeds of its
initial public offering to Charter Communications Holding Company, which issued
membership units to Charter Communications, Inc. In November 1999, the
management agreement between Charter Investment and Charter Operating

- 33 -


was amended and assigned from Charter Investment to Charter
Communications, Inc. Also in November 1999, Charter Communications Holding
Company sold membership units to Vulcan Cable III. Our organizational
structure is very complex and is described in more detail in “Item 1.
Business.”

Charter Communications, Inc., operating through its subsidiaries, is the
fourth largest operator of cable systems in the United States. Through our
broadband network of coaxial and fiber optic cable, we provide video, data,
interactive and private business network services to approximately 7 million
customers in 40 states. We seek to be a market leader in the introduction and
distribution of advanced products and services. We currently offer advanced
video and interactive services, as well as high-speed Internet access data
services. Using digital technology, we are able to offer additional video
channels to our standard, premium and pay-per-view line-up, including
programming of local interest, as well as digital music services. In addition,
we offer interactive video programming, including video-on-demand, virtual
interactive channels accessible on television through a web-like screen, and an
interactive program guide to access television program listings by channel,
time, date or programming type. In 2002, we expect to offer several new
advanced products and services in targeted markets, including an advanced media
center terminal that enables digital video recorder capability, home networking
and internet-access over the television; wireless home networking; and an
enhanced customized internet portal, with a customized browser and charter.com
e-mail. In 2002, we began to offer telephony on a limited basis through our
broadband network using circuit-based switch technology and will continue with
trials of our voice-over Internet protocol telephony. Digital television and
its related suite of interactive services, as well as high-speed cable modem
Internet access, provide additional value and product differentiation, both to
us and to our customers, and as a result, are instrumental in solidifying the
relationship with our customers.

Acquisitions

During the three-year period ended December 31, 2001, we completed a total
of 18 acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of $16.6 billion, including
aggregate cash payments of $10.9 billion, $3.3 billion of assumed debt and $2.4
billion of securities issued and other consideration paid. These acquisitions
were funded through the issuances of equity and long-term debt, bank
borrowings, capital contributions, the assumption of outstanding debt amounts
and internally generated funds. In 2000, we transferred the cable systems we
acquired in three of those acquisitions (Fanch, Falcon and Avalon) to our
subsidiary, Charter Holdings. All acquisitions were accounted for under the
purchase method of accounting and results of operations were included in our
consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.

The following table sets forth information regarding our acquisitions in
1999, 2000 and 2001:

- 34 -


AT&T Transactions.

In February 2001, Charter Communications, Inc. and
certain of its subsidiaries entered into several agreements with AT&T
Broadband, LLC and certain of its affiliates involving several strategic cable
system transactions. Charter Communications, Inc. assigned the agreements to
certain of its subsidiaries, and the AT&T transactions closed in June 2001. In
the AT&T transactions, we acquired cable systems from AT&T Broadband serving
customers in Missouri, Illinois, Alabama, Nevada and California for a total
adjusted purchase price of $1.74 billion, consisting of $1.71 billion in cash
and a Charter cable system valued at $25.1 million, for a net addition of
approximately 551,100 customers as of the closing date. A portion of the net
proceeds from the sale of the Charter Holdings May 2001 notes was used to pay a
portion of the purchase price of the AT&T transactions. As of December 31,
2001, these cable systems had 570,800 customers. For the year ended December
31, 2001, including the period prior to our acquisition, these systems had
revenues of $332.7 million.

Cable USA Transaction.

In August 2001, Charter Communications, Inc. and
Charter Communications Holding Company completed the acquisition of several
cable systems from Cable USA, Inc. and its affiliates, resulting in a net
addition of approximately 30,600 customers in Nebraska, Minnesota and Colorado
for a total purchase price of $100.3 million (including certain assumed
liabilities), consisting of $44.6 million in cash, 505,664 shares of Charter
Communications, Inc. Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock valued at
$50.6 million and additional shares of Series A Convertible Redeemable
Preferred Stock valued at $5.1 million to be issued to certain sellers subject
to certain holdback provisions of the acquisition agreement. We contributed the
systems acquired in these acquisitions to our subsidiaries. As of December 31,
2001, these cable systems had 32,200 customers. For the year ended December
31, 2001, including the period prior to our acquisition, these systems had
revenues of $13.9 million.

- 35 -


Purchase of Certain Enstar Limited Partnership Systems.

In August 2001,
Interlink Communications Partners, LLC, Rifkin Acquisition Partners, LLC and
Charter Communications Entertainment I, LLC, each an indirect, wholly-owned
subsidiary of Charter Holdings, entered into an agreement to purchase
substantially all of the assets of Enstar Income Program II-2, L.P., Enstar
Income Program II-1, L.P., Enstar Income Program IV-3, L.P., Enstar
Income/Growth Program Six-A, L.P. and Enstar Cable of Macoupin County and
certain assets of Enstar IV/PBD Systems Venture, serving in the aggregate
approximately 28,000 customers. Enstar Communications Corporation, a direct
subsidiary of Charter Communications Holding Company, is the general partner of
the Enstar limited partnerships. The cash sale price of approximately $63.0
million, subject to certain closing adjustments, was the highest bid received
by the Enstar limited partnerships following a broadly-based solicitation
process. We expect that the transaction will close in the first half of 2002.
See “Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions – Business
Relationships.”

Overview of Operations

Approximately 85% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001 are
attributable to monthly subscription fees charged to customers for our basic,
expanded basic, premium and digital cable television programming services,
Internet access through television-based service, dial-up telephone modems and
high-speed cable modem service, equipment rental and ancillary services
provided by our cable systems. The remaining 15% of revenue is derived
primarily from installation and reconnection fees charged to customers to
commence or reinstate service, pay-per-view programming, where users are
charged a fee for individual programs viewed, advertising revenues and
commissions related to the sale of merchandise by home shopping services and
franchise revenues. We have generated increased revenues in each of the past
three years, primarily through customer growth from acquisitions, internal
customer growth, basic and expanded tier price increases and revenues from new
services and products.

Our expenses primarily consist of operating costs, general and
administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization expense, interest
expense and management fees/corporate expense charges. Operating costs
primarily include programming costs, cable service related expenses, marketing
and advertising costs, franchise fees and expenses related to customer
billings.

We have had a history of net losses and expect to continue to report net
losses for the foreseeable future. The principal reasons for our prior net
losses include depreciation and amortization expenses associated with our
acquisitions and capital expenditures related to construction and upgrading of
our systems, and interest costs on borrowed money. These factors, with the
exception of amortization of our franchise assets, are expected to contribute
to anticipated net losses in the future. We cannot predict what impact, if
any, continued losses will have on our ability to finance our operations in the
future.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions
on an ongoing basis based on a combination of historical information and
various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
particular circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates based
on different assumptions or conditions. Although we believe that certain of the
accounting policies that most impact our consolidated financial statements and
that require our management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments
are described below, Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our
consolidated financial statements, which describes our significant accounting
policies, should be read in conjunction with this Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Investment in Cable Properties.

Our investment in cable properties
represents a significant portion of our total assets. Investment in cable
properties totaled $24.3 billion and $22.3 billion, representing approximately
97.3% and 96.9% of total assets, at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Investment in cable properties includes property, plant and equipment and
franchises. Our investment in cable properties has continued to grow over the
past several years as we have completed numerous acquisitions of other cable
systems and increased capital expenditures to upgrade, rebuild and expand our
cable systems.

Property, Plant and Equipment

.

Property, plant and equipment totaled $7.1
billion and $5.3 billion, representing approximately 28.6% and 22.9% of total
assets, at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Property, plant and

- 36 -


equipment are recorded at cost, including all direct and certain indirect
costs associated with the construction of cable transmission and distribution
facilities and the cost of new customer installations. The costs of
disconnecting a customer are charged to expense in the period incurred.
Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to operating expense as
incurred, while equipment replacement and betterments are capitalized.

Depreciation expense related to property, plant and equipment totaled $1.7
billion, $1.2 billion and $225.0 million, representing approximately 32.3%,
28.6% and 13.9% of operating expenses, for the years ended December 31, 2001,
2000 and 1999, respectively. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line
method over management’s estimate of the estimated useful lives of the related
assets as follows:

Cable distribution systems

3-15 years

Buildings and leasehold improvements

5-15 years

Vehicles and equipment

3-5 years

During the years ended December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, we reduced
the estimated useful lives of certain depreciable assets expected to be
abandoned as a result of our rebuild and upgrade of cable distribution systems.
As a result, an additional $540.9 million and $508.5 million of depreciation
expense was recorded during the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. We periodically evaluate the estimated useful lives used to
depreciate our assets and the estimated amount of assets that will be abandoned
or have minimal use in the future. While we believe our estimates of useful
lives are reasonable, significant differences in actual experience or
significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect future
depreciation expense.

Franchises.

Franchises totaled $17.1 billion at both December 31, 2001
and 2000, representing approximately 68.7% and 74.1% of total assets,
respectively. Costs incurred in obtaining and renewing cable franchises are
deferred and amortized using the straight-line method over a period of 15
years. Franchise rights acquired through the purchase of cable systems
represent management’s estimate of fair value and are generally amortized using
the straight-line method over a period of 15 years. The period of 15 years was
management’s best estimate of the useful lives of the franchises and assumed
that substantially all of those franchises that expired during the period would
be renewed, although not indefinitely. Because substantially all of our
franchises rights have been acquired in the past several years (see Notes 2 and
3 to the consolidated financial statements), we did not have sufficient
experience with the local franchise authorities to conclude that renewals of
franchises could be accomplished indefinitely. In addition, because the
technological state of our cable systems, with many systems with less than 550
megahertz bandwidths, could have resulted in demands from local franchise
authorities to upgrade those systems sooner than previously planned, there was
a risk that the franchises would not be renewed.

We believe that facts and circumstances have changed to enable us to
conclude that substantially all of our franchises will be renewed indefinitely,
with some portion of the franchises continuing to be amortized. We have
sufficiently upgraded the technological state of our cable systems and now have
sufficient experience with the local franchise authorities where we acquired
franchises to conclude substantially all franchises will be renewed
indefinitely. Any revisions to the estimated useful lives of franchises will be
reflected in the 2002 financial statements (see Note 22 to the consolidated
financial statements regarding the adoption of SFAS 142).

Amortization expense related to franchises totaled $1.3 billion, $1.2
billion and $520.0 million, representing approximately 25.4%, 28.6% and 32.2%
of operating expenses, for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.

Valuation of long-lived assets

. We evaluate the recoverability of
long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and franchises, for
impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Such events or changes in
circumstances could include such factors as changes in technological advances,
fluctuations in the market value of such assets or adverse changes in
relationships with local franchise authorities. If a review indicates that the
carrying value of such asset is not recoverable based on projected undiscounted
net cash flows related to the asset over its remaining life, the carry value of
such asset is reduced to its estimated fair value. While we believe that our
estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions regarding
such cash flows could materially affect our evaluations.

Minority Interest.

Charter Communications, Inc. is a holding company
whose sole asset is a controlling equity interest in Charter Communications
Holding Company, the indirect owner of our cable systems. Minority interest on
our

- 37 -


consolidated balance sheets represents total members’ equity of Charter
Communications Holding Company multiplied by 53.5% and 59.2% as of December 31,
2001 and 2000, respectively, representing the ownership percentages of Charter
Communications Holding Company not owned by us, plus preferred equity in an
indirect subsidiary. Members’ equity of Charter Communications Holding Company
was $6.2 billion and $7.7 billion as of December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. Gains (losses) arising from issuances by Charter Communications
Holding Company of its membership units are recorded as capital transactions
thereby increasing (decreasing) shareholders’ equity and decreasing
(increasing) minority interest on the consolidated balance sheets.
Historically, these gains (losses) have been material.

Operating losses are allocated to the minority owners based on the above
percentages, thereby reducing our net loss. Minority interest in loss of
subsidiary totaled $1.5 billion, $1.2 billion and $572.6 million for the years
ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Significant changes to
the ownership of Charter Communications Holding Company could have a material
impact on our future net income (loss) and shareholders’ equity.

Income Taxes.

Substantially all of the taxable income, gains, losses,
deductions and credits of Charter Communications Holding Company are passed
through to its members, including Charter Investment, Vulcan Cable III, the
former owners of acquired companies and us. We are responsible for our share
of taxable income (loss) of Charter Communications Holding Company allocated to
us in accordance with the Charter Communications Holding Company amended and
restated limited liability company agreement and partnership tax rules and
regulations. We do not expect to pay any material income taxes in the
foreseeable future.

The amended and restated limited liability company agreement provides
that, through the end of 2003, tax losses of Charter Communications Holding
Company that would otherwise have been allocated to us based generally on the
percentage of outstanding common membership units (the cumulative amount of
such losses is approximately $1.7 billion through the period ended December 31,
2001, assuming the other provisions of the amended and restated limited
liability company agreement were generally the same) will be allocated instead
to the membership units held by Vulcan Cable III and Charter Investment. These
special loss allocation provisions will reduce Vulcan Cable III and Charter
Investment’s rights to receive distributions upon a liquidation of Charter
Communications Holding Company if over time there are insufficient allocations
to be made under the special profit allocation provisions described below to
restore these distribution rights.

The amended and restated limited liability company agreement further
provides that, beginning at the time Charter Communications Holding Company
first becomes profitable (as determined under the applicable federal income tax
rules for determining book profits), tax profits that would otherwise have been
allocated to Charter Communications, Inc. based generally on its percentage of
outstanding common membership units will instead be allocated to Vulcan Cable
III and Charter Investment. The special profit allocations will also have the
effect of restoring over time Vulcan Cable III and Charter Investment ‘s rights
to receive distributions upon a liquidation of Charter Communications Holding
Company. These special profit allocations generally will continue until such
time as Vulcan Cable III and Charter Investment ‘s rights to receive
distributions upon a liquidation of Charter Communications Holding Company that
had been reduced as a result of the special loss allocations have been fully
restored. We do not expect Charter Communications Holding Company to generate
taxable income in the foreseeable future.

In certain situations, the special loss allocations and special profit
allocations described above could result in our having to pay taxes in an
amount that is more or less than if Charter Communications Holding Company had
allocated profits and losses among its members based generally on the number of
common membership units owned by such members. However, we do not anticipate
that the special loss allocations and special profit allocations will result in
us having to pay taxes in an amount that is materially different on a present
value basis than the taxes that would be payable had profits and losses been
allocated among the members of Charter Communications Holding Company based
generally on the number of common membership units owned by such members,
although there is no assurance that a material difference will not result.

We are required to record a valuation allowance when it is more likely
than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be
realized. Deferred income tax assets include net operating loss carry forwards
and a temporary difference attributable to the investment in Charter
Communications Holding Company of $48.5 million (generally expiring in years
2008 through 2021, and $15.2 million of which are subject to certain
limitations on our ability to utilize) and $488.5 million, respectively, as of
December 31, 2001. The deferred income tax assets were offset entirely by a
valuation allowance because of current and expected future losses. While we
believe our share of taxable income (loss) has been allocated to us properly
and in accordance with partnership tax rules and regulations, we cannot
guarantee

- 38 -


that such allocations will not be challenged by taxing authorities. Any
adjustments to the allocation of taxable income (loss) should not have a
material impact on future income tax expense.

Results of Operations

The following table sets forth the percentages of revenues that items in
the accompanying consolidated statements of operations constitute for the
indicated periods (dollars in millions):

Year Ended December 31, 2001 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2000

Revenues.

Revenues increased by $703.9 million, or 21.7%, from $3,249.2
million in 2000 to $3,953.1 million in 2001. System operations acquired after
January 1, 2000 accounted for $524.6 million, or 75%, of the increase in 2001,
while systems acquired before January 1, 2000 accounted for $179.3 million, or
25%. Revenues by service offering are as follows (dollars in millions):

Analog video customers increased by 602,800, or 9.5%, to 6,953,700 at
December 31, 2001 as compared to 6,350,900 at December 31, 2000. Of this
increase, approximately 581,700 customer additions were the result of
acquisitions. The remaining net increase of 21,100 customers relates to
internal growth.

- 39 -


Digital video customers increased by 1,075,300, or 100.5%, to 2,144,800 at
December 31, 2001 from 1,069,500 at December 31, 2000. The increase resulted
primarily from internal growth, which continues to increase as we upgrade our
systems to provide advanced services to a larger customer base. Increased
marketing efforts and strong demand for this service have also contributed to
the increase.

Data customers increased by 392,400, or 155.5%, to 644,800 at December 31,
2001 from 252,400 at December 31, 2000. Data customers consisted of 607,700
cable modem customers and 37,100 dial-up customers at December 31, 2001. The
increase resulted primarily from internal growth, which continues to increase
as we upgrade our systems to offer high-speed interactive services to a larger
customer base. Marketing efforts coupled with strong demand for such services
have also contributed to the increase.

Advertising sales increased $78.0 million, or 33.2%, from $234.6 million
in 2000 to $312.6 million in 2001. The increase resulted primarily from
internal growth and was partially offset by a weakening advertising
environment. As a result of our rebuild efforts, we experienced increased
capacity primarily as the result of expanded channel line-ups. In addition, the
level of advertising purchased by programmers to promote their channels, added
as part of our expansion of channel line-ups, increased during 2001 compared to
the corresponding period in 2000.

Operating, General and Administrative Expenses.

Operating, general and
administrative expenses increased by $458.7 million, or 27.8%, from $1,651.3
million in 2000 to $2,110.0 million in 2001. System operations acquired after
January 1, 2000 accounted for $288.5 million, or 63%, of the increase in 2001
while systems acquired before January 1, 2000 accounted for $170.2 million, or
37%. Key expense components as a percentage of revenues are as follows (dollars
in millions):

The increase in general, administrative and service costs of $142.1
million, or 19.7%, resulted from increased bad debt expense of $48.6 million
resulting primarily from the discounting of our analog product, coupled with
increased spending on customer care and overall continued growth. The increase
in analog video programming costs of $166.8 million, or 22.7%, was primarily
the result of continued inflationary or negotiated increases, primarily in
sports programming, coupled with increased channel capacity. The increase of
$75.0 million, or 207.2%, in direct operating costs to provide digital video
services resulted primarily from internal growth of these advanced services.
The increase of $60.8 million, or 155.1%, in direct operating costs to provide
cable modem services resulted primarily from internal growth. Advertising sales
costs increased $7.5 million, or 13.3%, primarily as the result of internal
growth and increased channel capacity. Marketing expenses increased $6.5
million, or 10.2%, related to an increased level of promotions of our service
offerings.

Gross Margin.

Gross margin (defined as revenues less operating, general
and administrative expenses) decreased from 49.2% in 2000 to 46.6% in 2001,
primarily resulting from the acquisition of less profitable cable systems from
AT&T. Analog video gross margin decreased from 70.6% in 2000 to 67.6% in 2001,
primarily resulting from such acquisitions coupled with continued inflation and
negotiated increases in programming costs. Digital video gross margin increased
from 59.5% in 2000 to 63.8% in 2001, primarily resulting from an increased
customer base. Cable modem gross margin increased from 28.3% in 2000 to 35.2%
in 2001 resulting from an increased customer base. Advertising sales gross
margin increased from 75.9% in 2000 to 79.5% in 2001 resulting from expanded
channel capacity as a result of our system upgrades, coupled with increased
advertising purchases by programmers.

Depreciation and Amortization.

Depreciation and amortization expense
increased by $537.0 million, or 21.7%, from $2,473.1 million in 2000 to
$3,010.1 million in 2001. This increase resulted from capital expenditures
under our

- 40 -


rebuild and upgrade program in 2000 and 2001 and amortization of
franchises in connection with acquisitions completed in 2000 and 2001.

Option Compensation Expense.

Option compensation expense decreased by
$86.7 million from $41.0 million of expense in 2000 to $45.7 million of income
in 2001. The decrease is primarily the result of the reversal of $66.6 million
of expense previously recorded in connection with approximately 7 million
options forfeited by our former President and Chief Executive Officer as part
of his September 2001 separation agreement. This was partially offset by
expense recorded because exercise prices on certain options that were issued
prior to our initial public offering in 1999 were less than the estimated fair
values of our common stock at the time of grant. Compensation expense is being
accrued over the vesting period of such options and will continue to be
recorded at a decreasing rate until the last vesting period lapses in April
2004.

Special Charges.

Special charges of $17.6 million represent charges
associated with the transition of approximately 145,000 data customers from the
Excite@Home Internet service to our Charter Pipeline service, as well as
employee severance costs. These charges included $14.3 million in operational
expenses in connection with the transition, including a one-time contract payment of $1.0 million to
Excite@Home for the provision of services through February 2002 to the 10% of
customers that would not be transitioned by December 31, 2001; and severance
costs of $3.3 million associated with the termination of approximately 360
employees.

Corporate Expenses.

Corporate expenses increased by $1.7 million, or
3.1%, from $55.2 million in 2000 to $56.9 million in 2001. The increase was
primarily a result of continued growth as a result of acquisitions.

Interest Expense.

Interest expense increased by $265.4 million, or 25.1%,
from $1,059.1 million in 2000 to $1,324.5 million in 2001. The increase in
interest expense was a result of increased average debt outstanding in 2001 of
$15,706.0 million compared to $12,281.2 million in 2000, partially offset by a
decrease in our average borrowing rate of 0.62% from 9.02% in 2000 to 8.40% in
2001. The increased debt was used for acquisitions, capital expenditures and
for other corporate purposes.

Interest Income.

Interest income increased by $5.4 million, or 74.0%,
from $7.3 million in 2000 to $12.7 million in 2001. The increase in interest
income was a result of higher average cash balances during in 2001.

Loss on Equity Investments.

Loss on equity investments increased by $34.8
million, or 180.3%, from $19.3 million in 2000 to $54.1 million in 2001. The
increase in loss on equity investments was primarily due to losses of $42.6
million on investments carried under the equity method of accounting, losses of
$3.6 million on marketable securities and other
than temporary losses of $7.8 million on investments carried under the cost
method. These losses were primarily the result of weakening market conditions
coupled with poor performance of these investments. The loss on equity
investments included a loss of $38.2 million related to our investment in High
Speed Access, a related party, which is described below.

Other Expense.

Other expense increased by $81.7 million from $12.5
million, in 2000 to $94.2 million in 2001. This increase resulted primarily
from a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $23.9 million
related to our adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001 and a loss of $51.2
million on interest rate agreements as a result of SFAS No. 133.

Minority Interest in Loss of Subsidiary.

Minority interest in loss of
subsidiary increased by $251.9 million, or 20.5%, from $1,226.3 million in 2000
to $1,478.2 million in 2001. Minority interest in loss of subsidiary
represents the allocation of losses to the minority interest in loss of
subsidiary based on ownership of Charter Communications Holding Company and the
2% accretion of the preferred membership units in an indirect subsidiary of
Charter Holdings issued to certain Bresnan sellers. These membership units are
exchangeable on a one-for-one basis for shares of Class A common stock of
Charter Communications, Inc. The increase is a result of an increase in loss
before minority interest offset by a decrease in the minority interest
percentage as a result of the issuance of Class A common stock by Charter
Communications, Inc.

Net Loss.

Net loss increased by $349.0 million from $828.7 million in
2000 to $1,177.7 million in 2001 as a result of the combination of factors
described above.

- 41 -


Preferred Stock Dividends.

Charter Communications, Inc. issued 505,664
shares of Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock in connection with
the Cable USA acquisition in August 2001, on which it pays a quarterly
cumulative cash dividends at an annual rate of 5.75% on a liquidation
preference of $100 per share.

Loss Per Common Share.

The loss per common share increased by $0.70, or
19.1%, from $3.67 per common share for the year ended December 31, 2000 to
$4.37 per common share for the year ended December 31, 2001 as a result of the
factors described above, partially offset by an increase in weighted average
shares outstanding due to the issuance of 60,247,350 shares of common stock in
May 2001.

Year Ended December 31, 2000 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 1999

Revenues.

Revenues increased by $1,821.0 million, or 128%, from $1,428.2
million in 1999 to $3,249.2 million in 2000. System operations acquired after
January 1, 1999 accounted for $1,578.3 million, or 87%, of the increase in
2000, while systems acquired before January 1, 1999 accounted for $242.7
million, or 13%. Revenues by service offering are as follows (dollars in
millions):

Analog video customers increased by 898,300, or 16.5%, to 6,350,900 at
December 31, 2000 as compared to 5,452,600 at December 31, 1999. Of this
increase, approximately 781,400 customer additions were the result of
acquisitions. The remaining net increase of 116,900 customers relates to
internal growth, which represents an increase of approximately 2.5% compared to
the prior year on a pro forma basis.

Digital video customers increased by 943,300, or 747.5%, to 1,069,500 at
December 31, 2000 from 126,200 at December 31, 1999. Of this increase,
approximately 29,200 customer additions were the result of acquisitions. The
remaining net increase of 914,100 customers relates to internal growth. The
pace of growth increased throughout the year as we upgraded our systems. We
surpassed our expectations throughout the year, with an average of 17,600
digital installations per week during 2000 which increased to 40,000 digital
installations per week in December 2000. Increased marketing efforts and strong
demand for this service contributed to the increase.

Data customers increased by 180,400, or 250.6%, to 252,400 at December 31,
2000 from 72,000 at December 31, 1999. Of this increase, approximately 12,400
customer additions were the result of acquisitions. The remaining net increase
of 168,000 customers relates to internal growth. Data customers consisted of
215,900 cable modem customers and 36,500 dial-up customers at December 31,
2000. The increase resulted primarily from internal growth, which continued to
increase as we upgraded our systems to offer high-speed interactive services to
a larger customer base. Marketing efforts coupled with strong demand for such
services also contributed to the increase.

Advertising sales increased $162.6 million, or 225.8%, from $72.0 million
in 1999 to $234.6 million in 2000. Of this increase, approximately $101.8
million was the result of acquisitions. The remaining increase of $60.8 million
relates to internal growth. As a result of our rebuild efforts, we experienced
increased capacity primarily as the result of expanded channel line-ups and
thus, increased advertising. The significant level of political campaign
advertising in 2000 also contributed to increased advertising revenues.

- 42 -


Operating, General and Administrative Expenses.

Operating, general and
administrative expenses increased by $913.3 million from $738.0 million in 1999
to $1,651.3 million in 2000. System operations acquired after January 1, 1999
accounted for $813.8 million or 89% of the increase in 2000 while systems
acquired before January 1, 1999 accounted for $99.5 million or 11%. Key expense
components as a percentage of revenues are as follows (dollars in millions):

The increase in general, administrative and service costs of approximately
$376.7 million, or 109.9%, resulted primarily from increases in corporate and
regional resources to support our growth. The increase in analog video
programming costs of approximately $408.1 million, or 124.5%, was primarily the
result of continued inflationary or negotiated increases, primarily in sports
programming, coupled with increased channel capacity. The increase of
approximately $32.7 million, or 934.3%, in direct operating costs to provide
digital video services resulted from acquisitions and internal growth of these
advanced services. The increase of approximately $30.2 million, or 335.6%, in
direct operating costs to provide cable modem services resulted from
acquisitions and internal growth. Advertising sales costs increased by
approximately $37.5 million, or 197.4%, primarily as the result of acquired
operations. Marketing expenses increased by approximately $28.1 million, or
78.7%, as the result of acquired operations coupled with an increased level of
promotions of advanced product offerings, including digital video and cable
modem high-speed service.

Gross Margin.

Gross margin (defined as revenues less operating, general
and administrative expenses) increased from 48.3% in 1999 to 49.2% in 2000,
primarily resulting from the increases in sales of digital video and cable
modem services in 2000 as compared to 1999. Analog video gross margin
decreased from 71.6% in 1999 to 70.6% in 2000, primarily resulting from
continued inflation and negotiated increases in programming costs. Digital
video gross margin increased from 54.5% in 1999 to 59.5% in 2000, primarily
resulting from an increased customer base. Cable modem gross margin increased
from 10.0% in 1999 to 28.3% in 2000 resulting from an increased customer base.
Advertising sales gross margin increased from 73.6% in 1999 to 75.9% in 2000
resulting from expanded channel capacity as a result of our system upgrades,
coupled with increased advertising purchases by programmers.

Depreciation and Amortization.

Depreciation and amortization expense
increased by $1,727.8 million, or 231.8%, from $745.3 million in 1999 to
$2,473.1 million in 2000. This increase resulted from a full year of expense on
the fixed assets and franchises of our 1999 acquisitions, a partial year of
expense on 2000 acquisitions and capital expenditures of $2.8 billion to
rebuild and upgrade our cable systems in 2000. Related to the rebuild and
upgrade of our plant, the useful lives of certain depreciable assets were
shortened. As a result, an additional $508.5 million of depreciation expense
was recorded during 2000. These increases were partially offset by the
elimination of depreciation and amortization expense related to dispositions of
cable systems.

Option Compensation Expense.

Option compensation expense decreased by
$39.0 million, or 48.8%, from $80.0 million in 1999 to $41.0 million in 2000.
The expense relates to option grants at the time of our initial public offering
at prices less than the estimated fair market value of our stock resulting in
compensation expense to be accrued over the vesting period of the options.
Compensation expense will continue to be recorded at a decreasing rate until
the last vesting period lapses in April 2004.

Corporate Expenses.

Corporate expenses increased by $3.8 million, or
7.4%, from $51.4 million in 1999 to $55.2 million in 2000. The increase was
primarily a result of continued growth as a result of acquisitions.

Interest Expense.

Interest expense increased by $581.3 million, or
121.7%, from $477.8 million in 1999 to $1,059.1 million in 2000. The increase
in interest expense was a result of increased average debt outstanding in 2000
of $12,281.2 million compared to $7,108.5 million in 1999, coupled with an
increase in our average borrowing rate of 0.66%

- 43 -


from 8.36% in 1999 to 9.02% in 2000. The increased debt was used for
acquisitions, capital expenditures and for other corporate purposes.

Interest Income.

Interest income decreased by $27.2 million, or 78.8%,
from $34.5 million in 1999 to $7.3 million in 2000. The decrease in interest
income was a result of lower average cash balances during 2000 due to required
credit facility draw downs in 1999 which were not required in 2000.

Loss on Equity Investments.

The loss in 2000 was primarily due to losses
of $7.5 million on investments carried under the equity method of accounting
and other than temporary losses of $11.8 million on investments carried under
the cost method. These losses were primarily the result of weakening market
conditions coupled with poor performance.

Minority Interest in Loss of Subsidiary.

Minority interest in loss of
subsidiary increased by $653.7 million, or 114.2%, from $572.6 million in 1999
to $1,226.3 million in 2000. Minority interest in loss of subsidiary
represents the allocation of losses to the minority interest in loss of
subsidiary based on ownership of Charter Communications Holding Company and the
2% accretion of the preferred membership units in an indirect subsidiary of
Charter Holdings issued to certain Bresnan sellers. These membership units are
exchangeable on a one-for-one basis for shares of Class A common stock of
Charter Communications, Inc.

Net Loss.

Net loss increased by $762.5 million from $66.2 million in 1999
to $828.7 million in 2000 as a result of the combination of factors discussed
above.

Loss Per Common Share.

The loss per common share increased by $1.45, or
65.3%, from $2.22 per common share for the year ended December 31, 1999 to
$3.67 per common share for the year ended December 31, 2000 as a result of the
factors described above, partially offset by the issuance of stock during 2000.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our business requires significant cash to fund acquisitions, capital
expenditures, debt service costs and ongoing operations. We have historically
funded and expect to fund future liquidity and capital requirements through
cash flows from operations, borrowings under the credit facilities of our
subsidiaries, issuances of debt securities by our subsidiaries and us and our
issuances of equity securities. Charter Communications, Inc.’s ability to make
payments on its debt securities is dependent on its receipt of payments on its
mirror debt securities issued by its subsidiaries and distributions from
Charter Communications Holdings Company or proceeds of the sale of its
securities.

Operating Activities

.

Net cash provided by operating activities for the
years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $518.7 million, $1.1 billion
and $479.9 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2001, net
cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to a loss before
minority interest of $2.7 billion, and offset partially by a
change in other operating assets and liabilities of
$679.4 million. For the year ended December 31, 2000, net cash provided by operating
activities was due primarily to a loss before minority interest of $2.1
billion, and offset partially by a change in other operating assets and
liabilities of $466.8 million. For the year ended December 31, 1999, net cash
provided by operating activities was due primarily to a loss before minority
interest of $638.8 million, and offset by a change in other operating assets
and liabilities of $186.2 million.

Operating activities provided $612.5 million less cash in 2001 than in
2000. Net loss provided $349.0 million less cash in 2001 than in 2000
primarily due to increases in interest expense resulting from higher average
outstanding debt balances due to net borrowings of $3.0 billion during 2001,
and changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses that provided $750.9
million less cash in 2001 than in 2000 primarily due to differences in the
timing of payments.

Operating activities provided $651.3 million more cash in 2000 than in
1999. Net loss provided $762.4 million less cash in the year ended December
31, 2000 than in 1999 primarily due to increases in interest expense resulting
from higher average outstanding debt balances due to net borrowings of $1.6
billion during 2000, changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses that
provided $522.3 million more cash in 2000 than in 1999 primarily due to
differences in the timing of payments, and changes in accounts receivable that
used $106.1 million more cash in 2000 than in 1999 primarily due to differences
in the timing of receivable collections.

Investing Activities.

Net cash used in investing activities for the years
ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $4.8 billion, $4.1 billion and $10.1
billion, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2001, net cash used in

- 44 -


investing activities resulted primarily from capital expended of $3.0
billion for property and equipment and $1.8 billion for the acquisition of
cable systems. For the year ended December 31, 2000, cash used in investing
activities resulted primarily from capital expended of $2.8 billion for
property and equipment and $1.2 billion for the acquisition of cable systems.
For the year ended December 31, 1999, net cash used in investing activities
resulted primarily from $7.6 billion for the acquisition of cable systems and
$1.7 billion from a loan to Marcus Cable Holdings. Capital expenditures are
primarily for the continued upgrade and rebuild of our systems in order to
offer advanced services to our customers and for normal recurring capital
expenditures and our continued upgrade and rebuild will continue to require
substantial capital. In 2002, we expect to spend a total of approximately $2.5
billion to upgrade and rebuild our systems. See “– Capital Expenditures” for
further information.

Investing activities used $755.3 million more cash in 2001 than in 2000.
Purchases of property, plant and equipment used $201.9 million more cash in
2001 than in 2000 as a result of our efforts to upgrade, rebuild and expand our
cable systems. Payments for acquisitions used $566.7 million more cash in 2001
than in 2000 primarily as a result of our acquisition of cable systems from
AT&T Broadband.

Investing activities used $6.0 billion less cash in 2000 than in 1999.
Purchases in property, plant and equipment used $2.1 billion more cash in 2000
than in 1999 as a result of our efforts to upgrade, rebuild and expand our
cable systems. This was offset by payments for acquisitions which used $6.4
billion less cash in 2000 than in 1999 due to our eleven acquisitions in 1999
for which we paid, among other consideration, $7.6 billion in cash, net of cash
acquired. In addition, we used $1.7 billion less cash in 2000 than in 1999 due
to a nonrecurring loan to Marcus Cable Holdings during 1999.

Financing Activities.

Net cash provided by financing activities for the
years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $4.2 billion, $2.9 billion and
$9.7 billion, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2001, we received
proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $7.3 billion and proceeds from
the issuance of common stock of $1.2 billion. This was offset primarily by
repayment of long-term debt of $4.3 billion. For the year ended December 31,
2000, we received proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $7.5 billion.
This was offset primarily by repayment of long-term debt of $4.5 billion. The
increase in cash from financing activities was primarily due to the additional
funding needed for acquisitions, capital expenditures and general corporate
purposes. For the year ended December 31, 1999, we received proceeds from the
issuance of long-term debt of $10.1 billion, proceeds from the initial public
offering of Class A common stock of $3.5 billion and proceeds from capital
contributions by Vulcan Cable III of $1.9 billion. This was offset primarily
by repayment of long-term debt of $5.7 billion.

Financing activities provided $1.2 billion more cash in 2001 than in 2000.
The increase in cash provided in 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily due to
proceeds from the issuance of Class A common stock of $1.2 billion.

Financing activities provided $6.8 billion less cash in 2000 than in 1999.
Borrowings of long-term debt provided $2.6 billion less cash in 2000 than in
1999 due to lower borrowings in 2000 while repayments of long-term debt used
$1.2 billion less cash in 2000 than in 1999. Net proceeds from our initial
public offering of Class A common stock and capital contributions to Charter
Communications Holding Company by Vulcan Cable III provided $3.5 billion and
$1.9 billion less cash in 2000 than in 1999, respectively, as these were one
time events that did not recur in 2000. See “– Financing Activities.”

As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, long-term debt totaled approximately
$16.3 billion and $13.1 billion, respectively. This debt was comprised of
approximately $6.7 billion and $7.3 billion of debt under our subsidiaries’
credit facilities, $8.2 billion and $5.0 billion of high yield debt and
approximately $1.4 billion and $750.0 million of debt related to our
convertible senior notes at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. As of
December 31, 2001, we had unused availability of $2.3 billion under the credit
facilities of our subsidiaries. After giving effect to the amendment of the
Charter Operating and CC VIII Operating credit facilities on January 3, 2002,
we would have had $2.6 billion of unused availability under the credit
facilities of our subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001.

As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, the weighted average rate on the bank
debt was approximately 6.0% and 8.3%, respectively, while the weighted average
rate on the high yield debt was approximately 10.1% and 9.1%, respectively,
resulting in a blended weighted average rate of 7.6% and 8.6%, respectively.
Approximately 81.9% of our debt was effectively fixed including the effects of
our interest rate hedge agreements as of December 31, 2001 as compared to
approximately 57.2% at December 31, 2000. The fair value of our total
fixed-rate debt was $9.5 billion and $5.5 billion at December 31, 2001 and
2000, respectively. The fair value of fixed-rate debt is based on quoted
market prices. The fair

- 45 -


value of variable-rate debt approximated the carrying value of $6.7
billion and $7.3 billion at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, since
this debt bears interest at current market rates.

In recent years, we have incurred significant additional debt to fund our
capital expenditures and acquisitions. Our significant amount of debt may
adversely affect our ability to obtain financing in the future and react to
changes in our business. Our credit facilities and other debt instruments
contain various financial and operating covenants that could adversely impact
our ability to operate our business, including restrictions on the ability of
our operating subsidiaries to distribute cash to their parents. See “

–

Financing Activities,” “

–

Certain Trends and Uncertainties

–

Restrictive
Covenants” and Exhibit 99.1 “Risk Factors” for further information.
Additionally, in the event of a default or an event of default under the credit
agreements of our subsidiaries, such as the failure to maintain the applicable
required financial ratios, we would be unable to borrow under these credit
facilities, which could adversely impact our ability to operate our business
and to make payments under our debt instruments. An event of default may in
certain circumstances result in the acceleration of our debt under the related
credit facility and may result in defaults under the agreements governing our
other long-term indebtedness. See “– Financing Activities” for a description
of certain of the terms of the agreements governing our long-term indebtedness.

We currently anticipate that we will have sufficient capital from
operating revenues and existing credit facilities to fund our operating costs,
interest expense, required debt repayments and capital expenditures during 2002
and through 2003, after which time we expect that cash flows from operations
will fund our operating costs, interest expense and capital expenditures.
However, any projections about future capital need and cash flows are subject
to substantial uncertainty. See “– Certain Trends and Uncertainties.”

Capital Expenditures

We have substantial ongoing capital expenditure requirements. We make
capital expenditures primarily to upgrade, rebuild and expand our cable
systems, as well as for system improvements, for the development of new
products and services, and deployment of digital converters and cable modems.
Upgrading our cable systems will enable us to offer an increasing variety of
advanced products and services, including digital television, cable modem
high-speed Internet access, video-on-demand interactive services additional
channels and tiers and expanded pay-per-view options, to a larger customer
base.

We made capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions of cable systems of
$3.0 billion, $2.8 billion and $741.5 million for the years ended December 31,
2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The majority of the capital expenditures in
2001 related to our rebuild and upgrade program and purchases of converters and
cable modems, and were funded from cash flows from operations, the issuance of
debt, borrowings under credit facilities and the issuance of Class A common
stock.

In 2002, we expect to spend a total of approximately $2.5 billion to
upgrade and rebuild our systems in order to offer advanced services to our
customers and for normal recurring capital expenditures. Normal recurring
capital expenditures will include extensions of systems, development of new
products and services, purchases of converters and cable modems, system
improvements and the build-out of advanced customer contact centers. The actual
amount that we spend on these types of capital expenditures will depend on the
level of our growth in digital cable customer base and in the delivery of other
advanced services. We currently anticipate that we will have sufficient capital
to fund our capital expenditures through 2003, after which time we expect that
cash flows from operations will fund our capital expenditures and interest
expense. However, we may need additional capital if there is accelerated growth
in digital cable customers or in the delivery of other advanced services,
whether as a result of increasing demand for advanced products and services in
our upgraded service areas or a need to upgrade other service areas ahead of
schedule. We may also need additional capital if we acquire substantial
additional customers. If we are not able to obtain such capital from increases
in our operating cash flow, additional borrowings or other sources, we may not
be able to fund any accelerated growth, offer advanced products and services or
compete effectively. Consequently, our growth, financial condition and results
of operations could suffer materially.

purchased 37,000 shares and 38,000 shares, respectively, of Series D
convertible preferred stock of High Speed Access for $37.0 million and $38.0
million, respectively.

On September 28, 2001, Charter Communications Holding Company and High
Speed Access entered into an asset purchase agreement pursuant to which Charter
Communications Holding Company agreed to purchase from High Speed Access the
contracts and associated assets, and assume related liabilities, that serve our
customers, including a customer contact center, network operations center and
provisioning software. On December 20, 2001, Charter Communications Holding
Company assigned certain of its rights under the asset purchase agreement and
certain related agreements to its subsidiary, CC Systems, LLC. The transaction
closed on February 28, 2002. At the closing, CC Systems wired funds in the
amount of $77.5 million to High Speed Access and delivered 37,000 shares of
High Speed Access’ Series D convertible preferred stock and all of the warrants
to buy High Speed Access common stock owned by Charter Communications Holding
Company and High Speed Access purchased 38,000 shares of its Series D Preferred
Stock from Vulcan Ventures for $8.0 million. To secure indemnity claims
against High Speed Access under the asset purchase agreement, $2.0 million of
the purchase price was held back. Additional purchase price adjustments may be
made as provided in the asset purchase agreement. Charter Communications
Holding Company obtained a fairness opinion from a qualified investment-banking
firm regarding the valuation of the assets purchased by CC Systems pursuant to
the asset purchase agreement. Concurrently with the closing of the
transaction, High Speed Access purchased all of its common stock held by Vulcan
Ventures, and certain of the agreements between our subsidiaries and High Speed
Access Corp., including the programming content agreement, the services
agreement, the systems access agreement, the 1998 network services agreement
and the May 2000 network services agreement were terminated. As of December
31, 2001 and 2000, the carrying value of the investment in High Speed Access
was zero and $38.2 million, respectively. Following the closing of the asset
purchase, neither we nor any of our subsidiaries nor Vulcan Ventures
beneficially owned any equity securities of High Speed Access. See “Item 13.

Convertible Senior Notes and High Yield Indebtedness – Change of Control;
Restrictive Covenants.

In the event of a specified change of control under
each of the indentures governing the public notes of our subsidiaries described
above, including the Charter Holdings notes, our subsidiaries must offer to
repurchase any then outstanding public notes at 101% of their principal amount
or accreted value, as applicable, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.
See “– Certain Trends and Uncertainties – Long-Term Indebtedness – Change of
Control Payments.”

In the event of a specified change of control event in the indentures
governing the Charter Communications, Inc. convertible senior notes, Charter
Communications, Inc. must offer to repurchase any then outstanding 5.75%
convertible senior notes and 4.75% convertible senior notes at 100% of their
principal amount plus accrued interest to the repurchase date. See “

–

Certain
Trends and Uncertainties – Long-Term Indebtedness – Change of Control
Payments.”

The indentures governing the public notes of our subsidiaries contain
certain covenants that restrict the ability of Charter Holdings and Charter
Capital and their restricted subsidiaries to:

The indentures governing the Avalon and Renaissance notes contain similar
restrictions.

Additionally, the indentures governing the high yield debt of our
subsidiaries contain information requirements and events of default and certain
restrictive covenants. The events of default under the Charter Holdings notes
include a cross-default to acceleration of, or failure to pay when due any
scheduled payment of principal in respect of, any indebtedness of Charter
Holdings, Charter Capital or any of Charter Holdings’ restricted subsidiaries
having an outstanding principal amount in excess of $100 million. Each of the
indentures governing our convertible senior notes includes a substantially
similar provision for Charter Communications, Inc., and its significant
subsidiaries. As a result, an event of default related to the failure to make
a principal payment when due or the acceleration of the indebtedness under the
credit facilities of our subsidiaries or the Avalon and Renaissance indentures
could cause a cross-default under the Charter Holdings indentures and the
indentures governing our convertible senior notes. See “

–

Certain Trends and
Uncertainties – Acceleration of Indebtedness of Subsidiaries” and “

–

Certain
Trends and Uncertainties – Restrictive Covenants.”

The Renaissance indenture contains a similar cross-default provision with
a $10 million threshold that applies to the issuers of the Renaissance notes
and their restricted subsidiaries. The Avalon indenture contains events of
default that include a cross-default to acceleration of, or failure to make
payments when due or within the applicable grace period, by CC V Holdings, CC V
Holdings Finance or any restricted subsidiary, on any indebtedness in excess of
$5.0 million. As a result, an event of default related to the failure to make
a payment when due or the acceleration of the indebtedness under the CC VIII
Operating credit facility could cause a cross-default under the Avalon
indenture. See “

–

Certain Trends and Uncertainties – Acceleration of
Indebtedness of Subsidiaries.”

Distributions under the indentures governing the Charter Holdings notes by
Charter Holdings to Charter Communications Holding Company or to Charter
Communications, Inc. to pay interest or principal on the convertible senior
notes are generally permitted, provided that Charter Holdings meets certain
specified financial ratios. In each case, such distributions are not permitted
during the existence of a default under the Charter Holdings indentures.
Distributions to Charter Holdings to pay interest on the Charter Holdings notes
are subject to the restricted payment provisions contained in the indenture for
the 11.875% CC V Holdings, LLC notes and the Renaissance notes. See “

Trends and Uncertainties – Restrictive Covenants.”

Charter Operating Credit Facilities.

Obligations under the Charter
Operating credit facilities are guaranteed by Charter Operating’s parent,
Charter Holdings, and by Charter Operating’s subsidiaries. The obligations
under the Charter Operating credit facilities are secured by pledges by Charter
Operating of intercompany obligations and the equity interests of Charter
Operating in its subsidiaries and its subsidiaries obligations of and interests
in each of their subsidiaries, but are not secured by the other assets of
Charter Operating or its subsidiaries. The obligations under the Charter
Operating credit facilities are also secured by pledges of intercompany
obligations and the equity interests of Charter Holdings in Charter Operating,
but are not secured by the other assets of Charter Holdings.

The Charter Operating credit facilities were amended and restated on
January 3, 2002 and provide for four term facilities: two Term A facilities
with an aggregate principal amount of $1.11 billion that matures in September
2007, each with different amortization schedules, one beginning in June 2002
and one beginning in September 2005; and two Term B facilities with an
aggregate principal amount of $2.75 billion, of which $1.85 billion matures in
March 2008 and $900 million matures in September 2008. The amortization of the
principal amount of the Term B term loan facilities is substantially
“back-ended,” with more than 90% of the principal balance due in the year of
maturity. The Charter Operating credit facilities also provide for two
revolving credit facilities, in an aggregate amount of $1.34 billion, which
will reduce annually beginning in March 2004 and September 2005, with a
maturity date in September 2007. At the option of the lenders, supplemental
credit facilities in the amount of $100.0 million may be available. Amounts
under the Charter Operating credit facilities bear interest at the base rate or
the Eurodollar rate, as defined, plus a margin of up to 2.75% for Eurodollar
loans (6.50% to 7.69% as of December 31, 2001) and 1.75% for base rate loans. A
quarterly commitment fee of between 0.25% and 0.375% per annum is payable on
the unborrowed balance of the revolving credit facilities.

As of December 31, 2001, outstanding borrowings were approximately $4.1
billion and the unused availability was $855.0 million. After giving effect to
the amendment to the Charter Operating credit facilities on January 3, 2002,
unused availability would have been $1.06 billion as of December 31, 2001. We
repaid $465.0 million under the Charter Operating revolving credit facilities
with proceeds from the issuance of the January 2002 Charter Holdings notes.

CC VI Operating Credit Facilities

. The obligations under the CC VI
Operating credit facilities are guaranteed by CC VI Operating’s parent, CC VI
Holdings, LLC, and by the subsidiaries of CC VI Operating. The obligations
under the CC VI Operating credit facilities are secured by pledges of the
equity interests and intercompany obligations of CC VI Operating in its
subsidiaries and its subsidiaries obligations of and interests in each of their
subsidiaries, but are not secured by other assets of CC VI Operating or its
subsidiaries. The obligations under the CC VI Operating credit facilities are
also secured by pledges of intercompany obligations and the equity interests of
CC VI Holdings in CC VI Operating, but are not secured by the other assets of
CC VI Holdings.

The CC VI Operating credit facilities provide for two term facilities, one
with a principal amount of $450.0 million that matures May 2008 (Term A), and
the other with a principal amount of $400.0 million that matures November 2008
(Term B). The CC VI credit facilities also provide for a $350.0 million
reducing revolving credit facility with a maturity date in May 2008. At the
option of the lenders, supplemental credit facilities in the amount of $300.0
million may be available until December 31, 2004. Amounts under the CC VI
credit facilities bear interest at the base rate or the Eurodollar rate, as
defined, plus a margin of up to 3.0% for Eurodollar loans (6.34% to 7.93% as of
December 31, 2001) and 2.0% for base rate loans. A quarterly commitment fee of
between 0.250% and 0.375% per annum is payable on the unborrowed balance of the
Term A facility and the revolving facility. We used $850.0 million of the
credit facilities to fund a portion of the Fanch purchase price.

As of December 31, 2001, outstanding borrowings were $901.0 million and
unused availability was $299.0 million. We repaid $76.0 million under the CC VI
revolving credit facilities with proceeds from the issuance of the January 2002
Charter Holdings notes.

CC VII Credit Facilities

. The obligations under the CC VII credit
facilities are guaranteed by the direct parent of Falcon Cable Communications,
Charter Communications VII, LLC, and by the subsidiaries of Falcon Cable
Communications. The obligations under the CC VII credit facilities are secured
by pledges of the equity interests and intercompany obligations of Falcon Cable
Communications in its subsidiaries and its subsidiaries’ obligations and
interests in each of their subsidiaries, but are not secured by other assets of
Falcon Cable Communications or its subsidiaries. The obligations under the CC
VII credit facilities are also secured by pledges of intercompany obligations
and the equity interests of Charter Communications VII in Falcon Cable
Communications, but are not secured by the other assets of Charter
Communications VII.

The previous Falcon credit facilities were amended in connection with the
Falcon acquisition in November 1999 and again in September 2001. The CC VII
credit facilities provide for two term facilities, one with a principal amount
of $194.0 million that matures June 2007 (Term B), and the other with the
principal amount of $291.0 million that matures December 2007 (Term C). The CC
VII credit facilities also provide for a reducing revolving facility of up to
approximately $77.7 million (maturing in December 2006), a reducing
supplemental facility of up to $110.0 million (maturing in December 2007) and a
second reducing revolving facility of up to $670.0 million (maturing in June
2007). At the option of the lenders, supplemental credit facilities in the
amount of up to $486.4 million may also be available. Amounts under the CC VII
credit facilities bear interest at the base rate or the Eurodollar rate, as
defined, plus a margin of up to 2.5% for

- 54 -


Eurodollar loans (5.50% to 7.08% as of December 31, 2001) and up to 1.5%
for base rate loans. A quarterly commitment fee of between 0.25% and 0.375% per
annum is payable on the unborrowed balance of the revolving facilities.

As of December 31, 2001, outstanding borrowings were $582.0 million and
unused availability was $760.7 million. We repaid $97.0 million under the CC
VII revolving credit facilities with proceeds from the issuance of the January
2002 Charter Holdings notes.

CC V Holdings Credit Facilities.

In December 2000, the entities holding
the systems acquired in the Bresnan and Avalon transactions were consolidated
under CC V Holdings. Upon completion of the Bresnan/Avalon combination in
January 2001, all amounts outstanding under the CC V Holdings credit facilities
were repaid and the CC V Holdings credit facilities were terminated.

CC VIII Operating Credit Facilities.

The obligations under the CC VIII
Operating credit facilities are guaranteed by the parent company of CC VIII
Operating, CC VIII Holdings, LLC, and by the subsidiaries of CC VIII Operating.
The obligations under the CC VIII Operating credit facilities are secured by
pledges of the equity interests and intercompany obligations of CC VIII
Operating in its subsidiaries and its subsidiaries obligations of and interests
in each of their subsidiaries, but are not secured by other assets of CC VIII
Operating or its subsidiaries. The obligations under the CC VIII Operating
credit facilities are also secured by pledges of intercompany obligations and
the equity interests of CC VIII Holdings in CC VIII Operating, but are not
secured by the other assets of CC VIII Holdings.

Upon the completion of the Bresnan/Avalon combination in January 2001, the
CC VIII Operating credit facilities were amended and restated to, among other
things, increase borrowing availability by $555.0 million. The credit
facilities were further amended and restated on January 3, 2002 and provide for
borrowings of up to $1.55 billion. The CC VIII Operating credit facilities
provide for three term facilities, two Term A facilities with an aggregate
principal amount of $500.0 million that mature in June 2007, and a Term B
facility with a principal amount of $500.0 million that matures in February
2008. The amortization of the principal amount of the Term B term loan
facilities is substantially “back-ended,” with more than 90% of the principal
balance due in the year of maturity. The CC VIII Operating credit facilities
also provide for two reducing revolving credit facilities, in the aggregate
amount of $550.0 million, which will reduce quarterly beginning in March 2002
and September 2005, respectively, with maturity dates in June 2007. At the
option of the lenders, supplemental facilities in the amount of $300.0 million
may be available. Amounts under the CC VIII Operating credit facilities bear
interest at the base rate or the Eurodollar rate, as defined, plus a margin of
up to 2.75% for Eurodollar loans (6.09% to 7.84% as of December 31, 2001) and
up to 1.75% for base rate loans. A quarterly commitment fee of between 0.250%
and 0.375% is payable on the unborrowed balance of the revolving credit
facilities.

As of December 31, 2001, outstanding borrowings were $1.1 billion, and
unused availability was $368.0 million. After giving effect to the amendment to
the CC VIII credit facilities on January 3, 2002, unused availability would
have been $468.0 million as of December 31, 2001. We repaid $107.0 million
under the CC VIII revolving credit facilities with proceeds from the issuance
of the January 2002 Charter Holdings notes.

Charter Holdings 2000 Senior Bridge Loan Facility.

On August 4, 2000,
Charter Holdings and Charter Capital entered into a senior bridge loan
agreement providing for senior increasing rate bridge loans in an aggregate
principal amount of up to $1.0 billion.

On August 14, 2000, Charter Holdings borrowed $1.0 billion under the
senior bridge loan facility and used substantially all of the proceeds to repay
a portion of the amounts outstanding under the Charter Operating and the CC VII
revolving credit facilities. The bridge loan initially bore interest at an
annual rate of 10.21%. For amounts not repaid by November 14, 2000, the
interest rate increased by 1.25% at such date.

The net proceeds, totaling $727.5 million, from the sales in October and
November 2000 of convertible senior notes were used to repay $727.5 million of
the amount outstanding under the Charter Holdings 2000 senior bridge loan
facility. The remaining balance of $272.5 million on the senior bridge loan
facility was repaid with the proceeds from the sale of the Charter Holdings
January 2001 notes.

Credit Facilities – Change of Control; Restrictive Covenants.

Similar to
our indentures and the indentures of our subsidiaries, the credit facilities of
our subsidiaries contain change of control provisions, making it an event of
default, and permitting acceleration of the debt, in the event of certain
specified changes of control, including if Mr. Allen, his estate, heirs and
related entities, fails to maintain, directly or indirectly, at least 51%
voting interest in the related borrower, or

- 55 -


ceases to own of record or beneficially, directly or indirectly, at least
25% of the equity interests in the related borrower. See “

–

Certain Trends and
Uncertainties – Long-Term Indebtedness – Change of Control Payments.”

Each of the credit facilities of our subsidiaries contain representations
and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants similar to those described
above with respect to the indentures governing the public notes of our
subsidiaries, information requirements, events of default and financial
covenants. The financial covenants, which are generally tested on a quarterly
basis, measure performance against standards set for leverage, debt service
coverage, and operating cash flow coverage of cash interest expense.
Additionally, the credit facilities contain provisions requiring mandatory loan
prepayments under specific circumstances, including when significant amounts of
assets are sold and the proceeds are not promptly reinvested in assets useful
in the business of the borrower. The Charter Operating credit facility also
provides that in the event that any existing Charter Holdings notes or other
long-term indebtedness of Charter Holdings remain outstanding on the date which
is six months prior to the scheduled final maturity, the term loans under the
Charter Operating credit facility will mature and the revolving credit
facilities will terminate on such date. See “

–

Certain Trends and Uncertainties
– Restrictive Covenants.”

Distributions under the credit facilities of our subsidiaries to Charter
Holdings to pay interest on the Charter Holdings notes and distributions under
the Charter Operating, CC VIII Operating and CC VII credit facilities to pay
interest on the convertible senior notes are generally permitted, in each case
provided the relevant borrower’s cash flow for the most recent fiscal quarter
preceding the distribution exceeds 1.75 times its cash interest expense,
including the amount of such distribution. Other distributions to Charter
Holdings are also permitted if the relevant borrower meets specified financial
ratios. In each case, such distributions are not permitted during the existence
of a default under the related credit facilities. See “

–

Certain Trends and
Uncertainties – Restrictive Covenants.”

The events of default for these credit facilities include, among other
things, the failure to comply with specified covenants and a cross-default to
acceleration of, or failure to make payments when due or within the applicable
grace period, by the related guarantor, borrower or the borrower’s restricted
subsidiaries, or any specified subsidiary, on any indebtedness in excess of the
amounts specified below:

Guarantor / Borrower

Principal Amount

Charter Holdings / Charter Operating

$50.0 million

CC VI Holdings / CC VI Operating

$25.0 million

Charter Communications VII /Falcon

Cable Communications

$10.0 million

CC VIII Holdings / CC VIII Operating

$25.0 million

An event of default related to the failure to make a payment or the
acceleration of the indebtedness under the indentures governing the Charter
Holdings notes, which could be caused by a similar event of default under the
credit facilities of our subsidiaries, could trigger the cross-default
provision of the Charter Operating credit facilities. See “

–

Certain Trends and
Uncertainties – Acceleration of Indebtedness of Subsidiaries.”

Capital Transactions.

In May 2001, Charter Communications, Inc. sold
shares of its Class A common stock for total proceeds of approximately $1.27
billion. The net proceeds of approximately $1.22 billion were used for general
corporate purposes, including capital expenditures.

Related Party Transactions

See “Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions – Business
Relationships” for information regarding related party transactions and
transactions with other parties with whom we or our related parties may have a
relationship that enables the parties to negotiate terms of material
transactions that may not be available from other, more clearly independent
parties, on an arm’s length basis.

Outlook

During 2001, we continued to roll out our advanced services aggressively,
focusing on our digital cable and cable modem businesses. We expect 2002
revenue growth of 12% to 14% and operating cash flow growth, after corporate
overhead expense, of 11% to 13% over the pro forma results in 2001 (as detailed
below in “

–

Supplemental Unaudited Pro

- 56 -


Forma Data”). We expect no meaningful increase in basic customers in 2002.
We anticipate that the number of our digital customers will increase
dramatically, from 2.1 million customers at December 31, 2001 to approximately
2.7 million customers by the end of 2002 as a result of increased marketing
efforts and strong demand for this service. We anticipate that the number of
our data customers will increase from 644,800 data customers at December 31,
2001 to between 1.2 million and 1.25 million data customers by the end of 2002.
In addition, video-on-demand launches are planned for 17 additional markets in
2002 and we expect that approximately half of our digital customers will have
access to video-on-demand technology by the end of 2002. Furthermore, we will
continue our focus on interactive TV following its recent launch to over
550,000 customers in a number of markets with additional launches in several
other markets in 2002 and expect to expand our offering of this service in 2002
to include over 1.0 million customers. In 2002 we expect to offer several new
advanced products and services, including an advanced broadband media center
terminal that enables digital video recorder capability, home networking and
internet-access over the television; wireless home networking; and an enhanced
customized internet portal, with a customized browser and charter.com e-mail.
Voice-over Internet protocol telephony initiatives will continue to be tested
and developed.

Customer care will remain a priority at Charter. In 2002, we plan to build
four additional customer contact centers with goals of increasing efficiency
and improving customer service. These new customer contact centers will serve
our customer base with state-of-the-art technology to further improve customer
satisfaction.

We will continue our system rebuilds and upgrades so that our customers
have access to advanced service technology. We expect to spend approximately
$2.5 billion during 2002 for upgrades, rebuilds, and normal recurring capital
expenditures.

Achieving the anticipated growth and increases specified in this Outlook
section is subject to many factors, some of which are outside our control.
This section includes forward-looking statements regarding, among other things,
our plans, strategies and prospects, both business and financial.
Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties and
assumptions. Many of the forward-looking statements contained in this section
may be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as “believe,”
“expect,” “anticipate,” “should,” “planned,” “will,” “may,” “intend,”
“estimate,” and “potential,” among others. Among these risks, uncertainties
and assumptions are those specified in “

–

Certain Trends and Uncertainties” and
in Exhibit 99.1, “Risk Factors.” We refer you to these sections, as well as to
“Forward-Looking Statements.”

Certain Trends And Uncertainties

The following discussion highlights a number of trends and uncertainties,
in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report, including in
Exhibit 99.1 “Risk Factors”, which is incorporated by reference herein, and in
other documents that we file with the SEC, that could materially impact our
business, results of operations and financial condition.

Substantial Leverage.

We and our subsidiaries have a significant amount
of debt. As of December 31, 2001, pro forma for the issuance and sale of the
January 2002 Charter Holdings notes and the application of the net proceeds
therefrom to repay a portion of the amounts then outstanding under the credit
facilities of our subsidiaries, our total debt would have been approximately
$16.5 billion, our total shareholders’ equity would have been approximately
$2.5 billion and the deficiency of our earnings available to cover fixed
charges would have been approximately $2.8 billion. Since December 31, 2001,
our subsidiaries have incurred substantial additional debt under their
revolving credit facilities.

We anticipate that we may incur significant additional debt, including
through our subsidiaries, in the future to fund the expansion, maintenance and
upgrade of our cable systems. If current debt levels increase, the related
risks that we now face will intensify. Our ability to service our debt and to
fund our planned capital expenditures for upgrading our cable systems and our
ongoing operations will depend on our ability to generate cash and to secure
financing in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general
economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors
beyond our control. Additionally, it is difficult to assess the impact that
the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 and the subsequent armed conflict
and related events, combined with the general economic slowdown, will have on
future operations. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from
operations, and sufficient future distributions are not available to us from
borrowings under our credit facilities or from other sources of financing, we
may not be able to repay our debt, to grow our business or to fund our other
liquidity and capital needs.

- 57 -


Restrictive Covenants.

The credit facilities of our subsidiaries and the
indentures governing the publicly held notes of our subsidiaries contain a
number of significant covenants that could adversely impact our business. In
particular, the credit facilities and indentures of our subsidiaries restrict
our subsidiaries’ ability to:

Furthermore, in accordance with our subsidiaries’ credit facilities, a
number of our subsidiaries are required to maintain specified financial ratios
and meet financial tests. The ability to comply with these provisions may be
affected by events beyond our control. The breach of any of these covenants
will result in a default under the applicable debt agreement or instrument
could trigger acceleration of the debt under the applicable agreement and in
certain cases under other agreements governing our long-term indebtedness. Any
default under our credit facilities or indentures governing our outstanding
debt might adversely affect our growth, our financial condition and our results
of operations and the ability to make payments on the publicly held notes of
Charter Communications, Inc. and our subsidiaries and the credit facilities of
our subsidiaries.

Acceleration of Indebtedness of Our Subsidiaries.

In the event of a
default under our subsidiaries’ credit facilities or public notes, our
subsidiaries’ creditors could elect to declare all amounts borrowed, together
with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, to be due and payable. In
such event, our subsidiaries’ credit facilities and indentures will not permit
our subsidiaries to distribute funds to Charter Communications Holding Company
or Charter Communications, Inc. to pay interest or principal on our public
notes. If the amounts outstanding under such credit facilities or public notes
are accelerated, all of our subsidiaries’ debt and liabilities would be payable
from our subsidiaries’ assets, prior to any distribution of our subsidiaries’
assets to pay the interest and principal amounts on our public notes and we
might not be able to repay or make any payments on our public notes.
Additionally, such a default would cause a cross-default in the indentures
governing the Charter Holdings notes and our convertible senior notes and would
trigger the cross-default provision of the Charter Operating Credit Agreement.
Any default under any of our subsidiaries’ credit facilities or public notes
might adversely affect the holders of our public notes and our growth,
financial condition and results of operations.

Long-Term Indebtedness – Change of Control Payments.

We may not have the
ability to raise the funds necessary to fulfill our obligations under our
public notes or the public notes and credit facilities of our subsidiaries
following a change of control. Under the indentures governing our public
notes, upon the occurrence of specified change of control events, including
certain specified dispositions of our stock by Mr. Allen, we are required to
offer to repurchase all of our outstanding public notes. However, we may not
have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control event to make the
required repurchase of our public notes and our subsidiaries are limited in
their ability to make distributions or other payments to us to fund any
required repurchase. In addition, a change of control under our subsidiaries’
credit facilities and indentures governing their public notes would require the
repayment of borrowings under those credit facilities and indentures. Because
such credit facilities and public notes are obligations of our subsidiaries,
the credit facilities and the public notes would have to be repaid by our
subsidiaries before their assets could be available to us to repurchase our
public notes. Our failure to make or complete a change of control offer would
place us in default under our public notes. The failure of our subsidiaries to
make a change of control offer to repay the amounts outstanding under their
credit facilities would place them in default of these agreements and could
result in a default under the indentures governing our public notes.

- 58 -


Variable Interest Rates.

At December 31, 2001, excluding the effects of
hedging, approximately 41.1% of our debt bears interest at variable rates that
are linked to short-term interest rates. In addition, a significant portion of
our existing debt, assumed debt or debt we might arrange in the future will
bear interest at variable rates. If interest rates rise, our costs relative to
those obligations will also rise. As of December 31, 2001 and December 31,
2000, the weighted average rate on the bank debt was approximately 6.0% and
8.3%, respectively, while the weighted average rate on the high-yield debt was
approximately 10.1% and 9.1%, respectively, resulting in a blended weighted
average rate of 7.6% and 8.6%, respectively. Approximately 81.9% of our debt
was effectively fixed including the effects of our interest rate hedge
agreements as of December 31, 2001 as compared to approximately 57.2% at
December 31, 2000.

Regulation and Legislation.

Cable systems are extensively regulated at
the federal, state, and local level, including rate regulation of basic service
and equipment and municipal approval of franchise agreements and their terms,
such as franchise requirements to upgrade cable plant and meet specified
customer service standards. Cable operators also face significant regulation
of their channel carriage. They currently can be required to devote substantial
capacity to the carriage of programming that they would not carry voluntarily,
including certain local broadcast signals, local public, educational and
government access programming, and unaffiliated commercial leased access
programming. This carriage burden could increase in the future, particularly if
the Federal Communications Commission were to require cable systems to carry
both the analog and digital versions of local broadcast signals. The Federal
Communications Commission is currently conducting a proceeding in which it is
considering this channel usage possibility, although it recently issued a
tentative decision against such dual carriage.

There is also uncertainty whether local franchising authorities, state
regulators, the Federal Communications Commission, or the U.S. Congress will
impose obligations on cable operators to provide unaffiliated Internet service
providers with access to cable plant on non-discriminatory terms. If they were
to do so, and the obligations were found to be lawful, it could complicate our
operations in general, and our Internet operations in particular, from a
technical and marketing standpoint. These access obligations could adversely
impact our profitability and discourage system upgrades and the introduction of
new products and services. Multiple federal courts have now struck down
open-access requirements imposed by several different franchising authorities
as unlawful. In March 2002, the Federal Communications Commission adopted a
policy of regulatory forbearance concerning cable’s provision of high-speed
Internet service, and it officially classified such service in a manner that
makes open access requirements unlikely. At the same time, the Federal
Communications Commission initiated a rulemaking proceeding that leaves open
the possibility that the Commission may assert regulatory control in the
future. As we offer other advanced services over our cable system, we are
likely to face additional calls for regulation of our capacity and operation.
These regulations, if adopted, could adversely affect our operations.

Management of Growth.

We have experienced rapid growth that has placed
and is expected to continue to place a significant strain on our management,
operations and other resources. Our future success will depend in part on our
ability to successfully integrate the operations acquired. The failure to
implement management, operating or financial systems necessary to successfully
integrate acquired operations or otherwise manage growth when and as needed
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

New Services and Products.

We expect that a substantial portion of our
future growth will be achieved through revenues from new products and services.
We may not be able to offer these new products and services successfully to
our customers and these new products and services may not generate adequate
revenues. If we are unable to grow our cash flow sufficiently, we may be
unable to fulfill our obligations or obtain alternative financing. Further,
due to declining market conditions and slowing economic trends during the last
year, both before and after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, we
cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve our planned levels of growth
as these conditions and events may negatively affect the demand for our
additional services and products and spending by customers and advertisers.

Economic Slowdown, Terrorism and Armed Conflict.

Although we do not
believe that the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 and the subsequent
armed conflict and related events have resulted in any material changes to our
business and operations to date, it is difficult to assess the impact that
these events, combined with the general economic slowdown, will have on future
operations. These events, combined with the general economic slowdown, could
result in reduced spending by customers and advertisers, which could reduce our
revenues and operating cash flow. Additionally, an economic slowdown could
affect our ability to collect accounts receivable. If we experience reduced
operating revenues, it could negatively affect our ability to make expected
capital expenditures and could also result in our inability to meet our
obligations under our financing agreements. These developments could also have
a negative impact on our financing and variable interest rate agreements
through disruptions in the market or negative market conditions. Terrorist
attacks could

- 59 -


interrupt or disrupt our ability to deliver our services (or the services
provided to us by programmers) and could cause unforeseen damage to our
physical facilities. Terrorism and the related events may have other adverse
effects on us, in ways that cannot be presently predicted.

Interest Rate Risk

We use interest rate risk management derivative instruments, such as
interest rate swap agreements, interest rate cap agreements and interest rate
collar agreements (collectively referred to herein as interest rate agreements)
as required under the terms of the credit facilities of our subsidiaries. Our
policy is to manage interest costs using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt.
Using interest rate swap agreements, we agree to exchange, at specified
intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts
calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. Interest
rate cap agreements are used to lock in a maximum interest rate should variable
rates rise, but enable us to otherwise pay lower market rates. Interest rate
collar agreements are used to limit our exposure to and benefits from interest
rate fluctuations on variable rate debt to within a certain range of rates.

At December 31, 2001 and 2000, we had outstanding $3.3 billion and $1.9
billion, $0 and $15.0 million, and $520.0 million and $520.0 million,
respectively, in notional amounts of interest rate swaps, caps and collars,
respectively. The notional amounts of interest rate instruments do not
represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, thus, are not a measure of our
exposure to credit loss. See “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk,” for further information regarding the fair
values and contract terms of our interest rate agreements.

New Accounting Standards

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, “Business Combinations”, No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” and No. 143, “Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations.” We adopted SFAS No. 141, which requires all business
combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the
purchase method of accounting, on July 1, 2001. Adoption of SFAS No. 141 did
not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets
are no longer subject to amortization over their useful lives, rather, they are
subject to at least annual assessments for impairment. Also, under SFAS Nos.
141 and 142, an intangible asset should be recognized if the benefit of the
intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights or if
the intangible asset can be sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged.
Such intangibles will be amortized over their useful lives. We believe that
substantially all franchises will qualify for indefinite life treatment under
the new standard. While the analysis, including the impairment testing of
franchises required under the new standard, is not complete, we expect to stop
amortizing franchise intangible assets that meet the indefinite life treatment
beginning January 1, 2002. We will test these assets for impairment at least
annually. Other than during any periods in which we may record a charge for
impairment, we expect that the adoption of SFAS No. 142 will result in a
reduced loss as a result of reduced amortization expense. If the new standard
had been in effect for 2001, amortization expense would have been reduced by
approximately $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion.

Under SFAS No. 143, the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement
obligation is required to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred
if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset
retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the
long-lived asset. We implemented SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2002. Adoption of
SFAS No. 143 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements.

In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.
144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” SFAS No.
144 addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of
long-lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and supersedes
SFAS No. 121, “Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of.” SFAS No. 144 establishes a single
accounting model for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale and resolves
implementation issues related to SFAS No. 121. We implemented SFAS No. 144 on
January 1, 2002. Adoption of SFAS No. 144 will not have a material impact on
our consolidated financial statements.

SUPPLEMENTAL UNAUDITED PRO FORMA DATA

The following Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Data is based on the
historical financial data of Charter Communications, Inc. Our financial data,
on a consolidated basis, is adjusted on a pro forma basis to illustrate the
estimated effects of the following transactions as if they had occurred on
January 1, 2001:

The Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements reflect the
application of the principles of purchase accounting in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board Opinions No. 16, Accounting for Business
Combinations, to the transactions listed in the first bullet point, above.
Accordingly, the Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements include
adjustments to reflect amortization of franchises. Upon adoption of SFAS 142,
on January 1, 2002, franchises will no longer be amortized. The impact of the
adoption of SFAS 142 is not reflected in the Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma
Statements of Operations. The Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Financial
Statements do not purport to be indicative of what our financial position or
results of operations actually would have been had the transactions described
above been completed on the dates indicated or to project our results of
operations for any future date. The allocation of the purchase price related
to the AT&T transactions is based, in part, on preliminary information, which
is subject to adjustment upon obtaining complete valuation information of
intangible assets and is subject to post-closing purchase price adjustments. We
believe that the finalization of the allocation of the purchase price will not
have a material impact on the results of operations or financial position of
Charter Communications, Inc. The Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Financial
Statements do not reflect the Cable USA Transaction that closed in 2001,
because the effect of the transaction is not significant.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to various market risks, including fluctuations in interest
rates. We use interest rate risk management derivative instruments, such as
interest rate swap agreements, interest rate cap agreements and interest rate
collar agreements (collectively referred to herein as interest rate agreements)
as required under the terms of the credit facilities of our subsidiaries. Our
policy is to manage interest costs using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt.
Using interest rate swap agreements, we agree to exchange, at specified
intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts
calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. Interest
rate cap agreements are used to lock in a maximum interest rate should variable
rates rise, but enable us to otherwise pay lower market rates. Interest rate
collar agreements are used to limit our exposure to and benefits from interest
rate fluctuations on variable rate debt to within a certain range of rates.
Interested rate risk management agreements are not held or issued for
speculative or trading purposes.

As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, long-term debt totaled approximately
$16.3 billion and $13.1 billion, respectively. This debt was comprised of
approximately $6.7 billion and $7.3 billion of debt under our subsidiaries’
credit facilities, $8.2 billion and $5.0 billion of high-yield debt and
approximately $1.4 billion and $750.0 million of debt related to our
convertible senior notes at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. As of
December 31, 2001 and 2000, the weighted average rate on the bank debt was
approximately 6.0% and 8.3%, respectively, while the weighted average rate on
the high-yield was approximately 10.1% and 9.1%, respectively, resulting in a
blended weighted average rate of 7.6% and 8.6%, respectively. Approximately
81.9% of our debt was effectively fixed including the effects of our interest
rate hedge agreements as of December 31, 2001 as compared to approximately
57.2% at December 31, 2000. The fair value of our total fixed-rate debt was
$9.5 billion and $5.5 billion at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The
fair value of fixed-rate debt is based on quoted market prices. The fair value
of variable-rate debt approximated the carrying value of $6.7 billion and $7.3
billion at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, since this debt bears
interest at current market rates.

Effective January 1, 2001, we adopted SFAS No. 133 “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” Our interest rate agreements
are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2001 as either
an asset or liability measured at fair value. In connection with the adoption
of SFAS No. 133, we recorded a loss of $23.9 million for the cumulative effect
of change in accounting principle as other expense. The effect of adoption was
to increase other expense resulting in increased loss before minority interest,
net loss and loss per share by $23.9 million, $9.8 million and $0.04,
respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2001.

We have certain interest rate derivative instruments that have been
designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Such instruments are those which
effectively convert variable interest payments on debt instruments into fixed
payments. For qualifying hedges, SFAS No. 133 allows derivative gains and
losses to offset related results on hedged items in the consolidated statement
of operations. We have formally documented, designated and assessed the
effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting. For the year ended
December 31, 2001, other expense includes $2.5 million of losses, which
represent cash flow hedge ineffectiveness on interest rate hedge agreements
arising from differences between the critical terms of the agreements and the
related hedged obligations. Changes in the fair value of interest rate
agreements

- 64 -


designated as hedging instruments of the variability of cash flows
associated with floating-rate debt obligations are reported in accumulated
other comprehensive loss. At December 31, 2001, included in accumulated other
comprehensive loss was a loss of $38.5 million related to derivative
instruments designated as cash flow hedges. The amounts are subsequently
reclassified into interest expense as a yield adjustment in the same period in
which the related interest on the floating-rate debt obligations affects
earnings (losses).

Certain interest rate derivative instruments are not designated as hedges
as they do not meet the effectiveness criteria specified by SFAS No. 133.
However, we believe such instruments are closely correlated with the respective
debt, thus managing associated risk. Interest rate derivative instruments not
designated as hedges are marked to fair value with the impact recorded as other
income or expense. For the year ended December 31, 2001, we recorded other
expense of $48.8 million for interest rate derivative instruments not
designated as hedges.

The table set forth below summarizes the fair values and contract terms of
financial instruments subject to interest rate risk maintained by us as of
December 31, 2001 (dollars in thousands):

The notional amounts of interest rate instruments do not represent amounts
exchanged by the parties and, thus, are not a measure of our exposure to credit
loss. The amounts exchanged are determined by reference to the notional amount
and the other terms of the contracts. The estimated fair value approximates the
costs (proceeds) to settle the outstanding contracts. Interest rates on
variable debt are estimated using the average implied forward London Interbank
Offering Rate (LIBOR) rates for the year of maturity based on the yield curve
in effect at December 31, 2001.

At December 31, 2001 and 2000, we had outstanding
$3.3 billion and $1.9
billion, $0 and $15.0 million, and $520.0 million and $520.0 million,
respectively, in notional amounts of interest rate swaps, caps and collars,
respectively. The collar agreements are structured so that if LIBOR falls below
5.3%, we pay 6.7%. If the LIBOR rate is between 5.3% and 8.0%, we pay LIBOR. If
LIBOR falls between 8.0% and 9.9%, the LIBOR rate is capped at 8.0%. If rates
go above 9.9%, the cap is removed. As of December 31, 2001, the fair value of
the collars was a liability of $33.7 million.

We do not hold collateral for these instruments and are therefore subject
to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counter party to the
interest rate exchange agreement. However we do not anticipate nonperformance
by the counter party to the interest rate exchange agreement.

January 2002 Charter Holdings Notes – Credit Facility Amendment.

In
January 2002, Charter Holdings and Charter Capital issued senior notes with an
aggregate principal amount at maturity of $1.1 billion. The January 2002
Charter Holdings notes are comprised of $350.0 million 9.625% senior notes due
2009, $300.0 million 10.000% senior notes due 2011, and $450.0 principal amount
at maturity of 12.125% senior discount notes due 2012. The net proceeds of
approximately $872.8 million were used to repay a portion of the amounts
outstanding under the revolving credit facilities of our subsidiaries.

In January 2002, we amended the Charter Operating credit facilities and
the CC VIII credit facilities to provide, among other things, for the deferral
of the repayment of the principal and a delay in the reduction of certain
facilities and, in consideration, we increased the interest rates related to
such facilities and paid a consent fee to those lenders that consented to the
amendment. The amounts available for borrowing under the Charter Operating and
the CC VIII facilities were increased by $200 million and $100 million,
respectively, at the time of the amendments.

pursuant to two plans – the 1999 Charter Communications Option Plan and the
2001 Stock Incentive Plan. The 1999 Charter Communications Option Plan
provided for the grant of options to purchase membership units in Charter
Communications Holding Company to current and prospective employees and
consultants of Charter Communications Holding Company and its affiliates and
current and prospective non-employee directors of Charter Communications, Inc.
Membership units received upon exercise of any options are immediately
exchanged for shares of Charter Communications, Inc. Class A common stock on a
one-for-one basis.

The 2001 Stock Incentive Plan provides for the grant of non-qualified
stock options, stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalent rights,
performance units and performance shares, share awards, phantom stock and/or
shares of restricted stock (not to exceed 3,000,000) as each term is defined in
the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan. Employees, officers, consultants and directors
of Charter Communications, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates are
eligible to receive grants under the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan. Generally,
options expire 10 years from the grant date.

Together, the plans allow for the issuance of up to an aggregate of
60,000,000 shares of Charter Communications, Inc. Class A common stock (or
units exchangeable for Charter Communication, Inc. Class A common stock). Any
shares covered by options that are terminated under the 1999 Charter
Communications Option Plan will be transferred to the 2001 Stock Incentive
Plan, and no new options will be granted under the 1999 Charter Communications
Option Plan. At December 31, 2001, 524,939 shares had been issued under the
plans, 165,750 shares are subject to vesting under restricted stock agreements.
Of the remaining 59,640,811 shares covered by the plans, as of December 31,
2001, 46,557,571 were subject to outstanding options (21.5% of which are
vested) and 12,917,490 remain eligible for future grant.

The board of directors of Charter Communications, Inc. appointed Nancy B.
Peretsman and Ronald L. Nelson as members of the Option Plan Committee to
administer and authorize grants and awards under the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan
to any eligible individuals. The Option Plan Committee will determine the
terms of each stock option grant, restricted stock grant or other award at the
time of grant, including the exercise price to be paid for the shares, the
vesting schedule for each option, the price, if any, to be paid by the grantee
for the restricted stock, the restrictions placed on the shares, and

- 74 -


the time or times when the restrictions will lapse. The Option Plan
Committee also has the power to accelerate the vesting of any grant or extend
the term thereof.

Upon a change of control, the Option Plan Committee can shorten the
exercise period of any option, have the survivor or successor entity assume the
options with appropriate adjustments, or cancel options and pay out in cash.
If an optionee’s or grantee’s employment is terminated without “cause” or for
“good reason” during the 12-month period following a “change in control” (as
those terms are defined in the plans), unless otherwise provided in an
agreement, with respect to such optionee’s or grantee’s awards under the plans,
all outstanding options will become immediately and fully exercisable, all
outstanding stock appreciation rights will become immediately and fully
exercisable, the restrictions on the outstanding restricted stock will lapse,
and all of the outstanding performance units will vest and the restrictions on
all of the outstanding performance shares will lapse as if all performance
objectives had been satisfied at the maximum level.

Unless sooner terminated by the board of directors of Charter
Communications, Inc., the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan will terminate on February
12, 2011, and no option or award can be granted thereafter.

in the form of three-year promissory notes. One-third of the original
outstanding principal amount of each of these notes and interest is forgiven at

the employee is still employed by the issuer of the bonus or any of its
affiliates. Generally, the promissory notes bear interest at 7% per year. The
following table provides certain information about such notes as of December
31, 2001 with respect to our current executive officers:

ITEM 12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT.

Beneficial Ownership of Securities

The following table sets forth certain information regarding beneficial
ownership of Charter Communications, Inc.’s Class A common stock as of February
28, 2002 by:

•

each of the directors of Charter Communications, Inc.

•

the current chief executive officer and the executive officers
of Charter Communications, Inc. named in the Summary Compensation
Table;

•

all directors and executive officers of Charter Communications,
Inc. as a group; and

•

each person known by us to own beneficially 5% or more of the
outstanding Charter Communications, Inc. Class A common stock.

With respect to the percentage of voting power set forth in the following table:

•

each holder of Charter Communications, Inc. Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share; and

•

each holder of Charter Communications, Inc. Class B common
stock is entitled to a number of votes based on the number of such
holder’s and his affiliates’ shares of Class B common stock and
membership units of Charter Communications Holding Company
exchangeable for Class B common stock. For example, Mr. Allen is
entitled to ten votes for each share of Class B common stock held by
him or his affiliates and ten votes for each membership unit of
Charter Communications Holding Company held by him or his affiliates.

*

Less than 1%.

(1)

Includes shares for which the named person has:

•

sole voting and investment power; or

•

shared voting and investment power with a spouse.

Does not include shares that may be acquired through exercise of options.

- 79 -


(2)

Includes unvested shares of restricted stock issued under the 2001 Stock
Incentive Plan, as to which the applicable employee has sole voting power
but not investment power.

(3)

Includes shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of options
vested on or before April 29, 2002 under the 1999 Charter Communications
Option Plan and the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan.

(4)

Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3. The
beneficial owners of Charter Communications, Inc. Class B common stock,
Charter Communications Holding Company membership units, CC VIII, LLC
membership units and convertible senior notes of Charter Communications,
Inc. are deemed to be beneficial owners of an equal number of shares of
Charter Communications, Inc. Class A common stock because such holdings
are either convertible into Class A shares (in the case of Class B shares
and convertible senior notes) or exchangeable (directly or indirectly) for
Class A shares (in the case of the membership units) on a one-for-one
basis. Unless otherwise noted, the named holders have sole investment and
voting power with respect to the shares listed as beneficially owned.

(5)

The calculation of this percentage assumes for each person that:

A person is deemed to have the right to acquire shares of Class A common
stock with respect to options vested under the 1999 Charter Communications
Option Plan. When vested, these options are exercisable for membership
units of Charter Communications Holding Company, which are immediately
exchanged on a one-for-one basis for shares of Charter Communications,
Inc. Class A common stock. A person is also deemed to have the right to
acquire shares of Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of
vested options under the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan.

(6)

The calculation of this percentage assumes that Mr. Allen’s equity
interests are retained in the form that maximizes voting power (i.e., the
50,000 shares of Class B common stock held by Mr. Allen have not been
converted into shares of Class A common stock; that the membership units
of Charter Communications Holding Company owned by each of Vulcan Cable
III and Charter Investment have not been exchanged for shares of Class A
common stock); and that outstanding membership units of CC VIII, LLC owned
by certain Bresnan sellers have not been exchanged for shares of Class A
common stock.

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS.

The following sets forth certain transactions in which we and our
directors, executive officers and affiliates are involved. Unless otherwise
disclosed, management believes that each of the transactions described below
was on terms no less favorable to us than could have been obtained from
independent third parties.

Management and Consulting Arrangements

Management Arrangements.

Charter Communications, Inc. has entered into
management arrangements with Charter Communications Holding Company and certain
of its subsidiaries. Under these agreements, Charter Communications, Inc.
provides management services for and operates the cable television systems
owned or acquired by its subsidiaries. The management agreements covering the
CC VI and CC VII companies limit management fees payable to Charter
Communications, Inc. to 5% of gross revenues. Under the arrangement covering
all of our other operating subsidiaries, there is no limit on the dollar amount
or percentage of revenues payable as management fees. However, the total
amount paid by Charter Communications Holding Company and all of its
subsidiaries is limited to the amount necessary to reimburse Charter
Communications, Inc. for all of its expenses, costs, losses, liabilities and
damages paid or incurred by it in connection with the performance of its
services under the various management agreements. The expenses subject to
reimbursement include any fees Charter Communications, Inc. is obligated to pay
under the mutual services agreement described below. Payment of management
fees by Charter Communications, Inc.’s operating subsidiaries is subject to
certain restrictions under the credit facilities of such subsidiaries. In the
event any portion of the management fee due and payable is not paid, it is
deferred by Charter Communications, Inc. and accrued as a liability of such
subsidiaries.

- 81 -


Any deferred amount of the management fee will bear interest at the rate
of 10% per annum, compounded annually, from the date it was due and payable
until the date it is paid.

For the year ended December 31, 2001, Charter Communications, Inc.
received a total of $6.2 million as management fees from Charter Communications
Holding Company and its subsidiaries, exclusive of amounts being paid to
Charter Investment pursuant to the mutual services agreement described below.

Mutual Services Agreement.

During 2001, pursuant to a mutual services
agreement between Charter Communications, Inc., Charter Communications Holding
Company and Charter Investment, Charter Communications Holding Company leased
the necessary personnel and provided services on a cost-reimbursement basis to
Charter Communications, Inc. to manage its subsidiaries. The mutual services
agreement provides that each party shall provide rights and services to the
other parties as may be reasonably requested for the management of the entities
involved and their subsidiaries, including the cable systems owned by their
subsidiaries. The officers and employees of each party are available to the
other parties to provide these rights and services, and all expenses and costs
incurred in providing these rights and services are paid by Charter
Communications, Inc. Each of the parties will indemnify and hold harmless the
other parties and their directors, officers and employees from and against any
and all claims that may be made against any of them in connection with the
mutual services agreement except due to its or their gross negligence or
willful misconduct. The mutual services agreement expires on November 12,
2009, and may be terminated at any time by any party upon thirty days’ written
notice to the other. For the year ended December 31, 2001, Charter
Communications, Inc. paid $50.7 million to Charter Investment for services
rendered pursuant to the mutual services agreement. All such amounts are
reimbursable to Charter Communications, Inc. pursuant to a management
arrangement with subsidiaries. See “

–

Management Arrangements.”

Consulting Agreement.

Charter Communications Holding Company is a party
to a consulting agreement with Vulcan Inc. (f/k/a Vulcan Northwest) and Charter
Investment. Pursuant to this consulting agreement, Vulcan Inc. provides and,
through January 2001, Charter Investment provided, advisory, financial and
other consulting services with respect to the acquisitions by Charter
Communications Holding Company of the business, assets or stock of other
companies. Such services include participation in the evaluation, negotiation
and implementation of these acquisitions. The original agreement had an
expiration date of December 31, 2000, but has and will continue to
automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless otherwise terminated.
The consulting agreement provides for a fee equal to 1% of the aggregate value
of any acquisition by Charter Communications Holding Company or any of its
affiliates, for which Vulcan provides services, as well as reimbursement of
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred and indemnification. For the year
ended December 31, 2001, no fees were incurred with respect to these consulting
services. Because Charter Investment personnel became employees of Charter
Communications Holding Company effective January 1, 2001, Charter Investment no
longer provides services pursuant to the terms of the agreement.

Previous Management Agreement with Charter Investment.

Prior to November
12, 1999, Charter Investment provided management and consulting services to our
operating subsidiaries for a fee equal to 3% of the gross revenues of the
systems then owned, plus reimbursement of expenses. The balance of management
fees payable under the previous management agreement was accrued with payment
at the discretion of Charter Investment, with interest payable on unpaid
amounts. For the year ended December 31, 2001, Charter Communications, Inc.’s
subsidiaries did not pay any fees to Charter Investment to reduce management
fees payable. As of December 31, 2001, total management fees payable to
Charter Investment were $13.8 million, exclusive of any interest that may be
charged.

Charter Communications Holding Company Limited Liability Agreement -
Taxes.

The amended and restated limited liability company agreement of Charter
Communications Holding Company contains certain provisions regarding the
allocation of tax losses and profits among its members – Vulcan Cable III,
Charter Investment and us – that may result in different tax consequences than
would otherwise occur if Charter Communications Holding Company had allocated
profits and losses among its members based generally on the number of common
membership units. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies.”

Allocation of Business Opportunities with Mr. Allen

As described under “Business Relationships” in this section, Mr. Allen and
a number of his affiliates have interests in various entities that provide
services or programming to our subsidiaries. Given the diverse nature of Mr.
Allen’s investment activities and interests, and to avoid the possibility of
future disputes as to potential business, Charter Communications, Inc. and
Charter Communications Holding Company, under the terms of their respective
organizational documents, may not, and may

- 82 -


not allow their subsidiaries, to engage in any
business transaction outside the cable transmission business except for the
digeo, inc. joint venture; the joint venture to develop a digital video
recorder set-top terminal; the investment in High Speed Access Corp.; the
investment in Cable Sports Southeast, LLC, a provider of regional sports
programming; as an owner and operator of the business of Interactive
Broadcaster Services Corporation (Chat TV); an investment in @Security
Broadband Corp., a company developing broadband security applications; and
incidental businesses engaged in as of the closing of Charter Communications,
Inc.’s initial public offering in November 1999. This restriction will remain
in effect until all of the shares of Charter Communications, Inc.’s high-vote
Class B common stock have been converted into shares of Class A common stock
due to Mr. Allen’s equity ownership falling below specified thresholds.

Should Charter Communications, Inc. or Charter Communications Holding
Company or any of their subsidiaries wish to pursue, or allow their
subsidiaries to pursue, a business transaction outside of this scope, it must
first offer Mr. Allen the opportunity to pursue the particular business
transaction. If he decides not to pursue the business transaction and consents
to Charter Communications, Inc. or its subsidiaries engaging in the business
transaction, they will be able to do so. In any such case, the restated
certificate of incorporation of Charter Communications, Inc. and the amended
and restated limited liability company agreement of Charter Communications
Holding Company would be amended accordingly to modify the current restrictions
on the ability of such entities to engage in any business other than the cable
transmission business. The cable transmission business means the business of
transmitting video, audio, including telephony, and data over cable television
systems owned, operated or managed by Charter Communications, Inc., Charter
Communications Holding Company or any of their subsidiaries from time to time.

Under Delaware corporate law, each director of Charter Communications,
Inc., including Mr. Allen, is generally required to present to Charter
Communications, Inc., any opportunity he or she may have to acquire any cable
transmission business or any company whose principal business is the ownership,
operation or management of cable transmission businesses, so that we may
determine whether we wish to pursue such opportunities. However, Mr. Allen and
the other directors generally will not have an obligation to present other
types of business opportunities to Charter Communications, Inc. and they may
exploit such opportunities for their own account.

Intercompany Loans

From time to time, there are intercompany borrowings and repayments
between or among Charter Communications, Inc. and its subsidiaries and between
or among its subsidiaries. For amounts borrowed, our practice is for the
borrowing party to pay interest to the lending party based on the borrower’s
cost of funds on its revolving credit facility, which is based on a spread over
LIBOR. On occasion, indebtedness between companies has been forgiven in lieu of
a contribution to capital. The average month-end outstanding principal balance
of indebtedness from Charter Communications Holding Company to us during the
year ended December 31, 2001 was $1,598.7 million. The total interest paid by
Charter Communications Holding Company to us for indebtedness was $56.4 million
for the year ended December 31, 2001, and accrued interest on such debt at
December 31, 2001 was $10.3 million.

Other Relationships

David L. McCall, Senior Vice President — Operations — Eastern Division, is
a partner in a partnership that leases office space to us. The partnership
received approximately $117,600 pursuant to such lease and related agreements
for the year ended December 31, 2001. In addition, approximately $571,553 was

to a construction company controlled by Mr. McCall’s son for the year ended
December 31, 2001.

Mr. Wood resigned as a director in December 2001. In 2001, the benefit to
a company controlled by Mr. Wood that owned an airplane for the full annual
cost of two individuals qualified to operate the plane, who were otherwise
available to Charter Communications, Inc. in connection with its own flight
operations was approximately $108,500 for annual compensation to the pilots.
Charter Communications, Inc. is entitled to reimbursement for these amounts.
In addition, Mr. Wood also used Charter Communications, Inc.’s airplane for
occasional personal use in 2001, a benefit valued at $12,500 for the year ended
December 31, 2001.

Additionally in 1999, one of Mr. Wood’s daughters, who resigned as a Vice
President of Charter Communications Holding Company in February 2002, received
a bonus in the form of a three-year promissory note bearing interest at 7% per
year. One-third of the original outstanding principal amount of the note and
interest were forgiven as long as she

remained employed by Charter Communications Holding Company at the end of
each of the first three anniversaries of the issue date in February 1999. The
amount of principal and interest forgiven on this note for the year ended
December 31, 2001, was $85,500, and the outstanding balance on the note was
forgiven effective as of February 22, 2002. Another daughter of Mr. Wood
received approximately $70,210 during the year ended December 31, 2001 for

from January 1, 2001 to April 2001. For the Riverside warehouse space,
aggregate rent paid for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $182,989.

Business Relationships

Mr. Allen or his affiliates own equity interests or warrants to purchase
equity interests in various entities with which we do business or which provide
us with services or programming. Among these entities are Wink Communications,
Inc., TechTV Inc., USA Networks, Inc., Oxygen Media Corporation, digeo, inc.,
Microsoft Corporation and, prior to February 28, 2002, High Speed Access Corp.
Mr. Allen owns 100% of the equity of Vulcan Ventures and Vulcan Inc. and is the
president of Vulcan Ventures. Mr. Savoy is also a vice president and a
director of Vulcan Ventures. The various cable, Internet and telephony
companies in which Mr. Allen has invested may mutually benefit one another.
The agreements governing our relationship with digeo, inc. are an example of a
cooperative business relationship among his affiliated companies. We can give
no assurance, nor should you expect, that any of these business relationships
will be successful, that we will realize any benefits from these relationships
or that we will enter into any business relationships in the future with Mr.
Allen’s affiliated companies.

Mr. Allen and his affiliates have made, and in the future likely will
make, numerous investments outside of us and our business. We cannot assure
you that, in the event that we or any of our subsidiaries enter into
transactions in the future with any affiliate of Mr. Allen, such transactions
will be on terms as favorable to us as terms we might have obtained from an
unrelated third party. Also, conflicts could arise with respect to the
allocation of corporate opportunities between us and Mr. Allen and his
affiliates. We have not instituted any formal plan or arrangement to address
potential conflicts of interest.

In February 2001, Charter Communications, Inc. entered into certain of the
purchase agreements related to the AT&T transactions and in June 2001, it
assigned its rights and obligations under these contracts to certain of its
subsidiaries which purchased the assets from AT&T. In August 2001, the systems
acquired in the Cable USA transaction by Charter Communications, Inc. and
Charter Communications Holding Company, were contributed through Charter
Holdings to certain of its subsidiaries which now own and operate these
systems.

Vulcan Ventures.

Vulcan Ventures Incorporated, an entity controlled by
Mr. Allen, Charter Communications, Inc., Charter Investment and Charter
Communications Holding Company are parties to an agreement dated September 21,
1999 regarding the right of Vulcan Ventures to use up to eight of our digital
cable channels in consideration of a capital contribution of $1.325 billion.
Specifically, we will provide Vulcan Ventures with exclusive rights for
carriage of up to eight digital cable television programming services or
channels on each of the digital cable television systems with local and to the
extent available, national control of the digital product owned, operated,
controlled or managed by us now or in the future of 550 megahertz or more. If
the system offers digital services but has less than 550 megahertz of capacity,
then the programming services will be equitably reduced. Upon request of
Vulcan Ventures, we will attempt to reach a comprehensive programming agreement
pursuant to which we will pay the programmer, if possible, a fee per digital
subscriber. If such fee arrangement is not achieved, then we and the
programmer shall enter into a standard programming agreement. As of December
31, 2001, Vulcan Ventures did not use any of these channels.

High Speed Access.

High Speed Access Corp. has been a provider of
high-speed Internet access services over cable modems. During the period from
1997 to 2000, certain Charter Communications entities entered into
Internet-access related service agreements, and both Vulcan Ventures, an entity
controlled by Mr. Allen, and certain of our subsidiaries made equity
investments in High Speed Access.

On September 28, 2001, Charter Communications Holding Company and High
Speed Access entered into an asset purchase agreement pursuant to which Charter
Communications Holding Company agreed to purchase from High Speed Access the
contracts and associated assets, and assume related liabilities, that serve our
customers, including a customer contact center, network operations center and
provisioning software. On December 20, 2001, Charter Communications Holding
Company assigned certain of its rights under the asset purchase agreement and
certain related agreements to its subsidiary, CC Systems, LLC. The transaction
closed on February 28, 2002. At the closing, CC Systems wired funds in the
amount of $77.5 million to High Speed Access and delivered 37,000 shares of
High Speed Access’s Series D convertible preferred stock and all of the
warrants to buy High Speed Access common stock owned by Charter Communications
Holding Company and High Speed Access purchased 38,000 shares of its Series D
Preferred Stock from Vulcan Ventures for $8.0 million. To secure indemnity
claims against High Speed Access under the asset purchase agreement, $2.0
million of the purchase price was held back. Additional purchase price
adjustments may be made as provided in the asset purchase agreement. Charter
Communications Holding Company obtained a fairness opinion from a qualified
investment-banking firm regarding the valuation of the assets purchased by CC
Systems pursuant to the asset purchase agreement. Concurrently with the
closing of the transaction, High Speed Access purchased all of its common stock
held by Vulcan Ventures, and certain of the agreements between our subsidiaries
and High Speed Access Corp., including the programming content agreement, the
services agreement, the systems access agreement, the 1998 network services
agreement and the May 2000 network services agreement, each as described in
more detail below, were terminated. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, the
carrying value of the investment in High Speed Access was zero and $38.2
million, respectively.

On September 28, 2001, in connection with the asset purchase agreement
with High Speed Access, Charter Communications Holding Company and High Speed
Access entered into a license agreement that was effective on February 28,
2002, pursuant to which Charter Communications Holding Company granted High
Speed Access the right to use certain intellectual property sold by High Speed
Access to Charter Communications Holding Company pursuant to the asset purchase
agreement described above. High Speed Access does not pay any fees under the
agreement. The domestic portion of the license terminates on June 30, 2002,
and the international portion of the license will expire on February 2, 2005.
Concurrently with the license agreement, High Speed Access and Charter
Communications, Inc. entered into a services agreement, pursuant to which
Charter Communications, Inc. agreed to perform certain management services
formerly performed by High Speed Access. This agreement terminated on February
28, 2002, upon the closing of the asset purchase agreement.

In 2001, Charter Communications Holding Company was a party to a systems
access and investment agreement with Vulcan Ventures and High Speed Access and
a related network services agreement with High Speed Access. These agreements
provided High Speed Access with exclusive access to at least 750,000 of our
homes that had either an installed cable drop from our cable system or that
were eligible for a cable drop by virtue of our cable system passing the home.
The term of the network services agreement was, as to a particular cable
system, five years from the date revenue billing commenced for that cable
system. The programming content agreement provided each of Vulcan Ventures and
High Speed Access with a license to use certain content and materials of the
other on a non-exclusive, royalty-free basis. The revenues we earned from High
Speed Access for the year ended December 31, 2001 were
approximately $7.8
million.

Additionally, Charter Communications Holding Company, as the assignee of
Vulcan Ventures, held warrants that were amended and restated on May 12, 2000,
giving Charter Communications Holding Company the right to purchase up to
12,000,000 shares of High Speed Access common stock at an exercise price of
$3.23 per share. A portion of the warrants could be earned under the
agreements described above, and the other portion related to warrants that
could be earned under a network agreement entered into with High Speed Access
on May 12, 2000, described below. Warrants earned under the agreements
described above became vested at the time systems were committed by us and were
based upon the number of homes passed. Warrants under these agreements could
only be earned until July 31, 2003, and were earned at the rate of 1.55 shares
of common stock for each home passed in excess of 750,000. Warrants earned
under the agreements described above were exercisable until May 25, 2006. Such
warrants were subject to forfeiture in certain circumstances, generally if we
withdrew a committed system.

- 85 -


On May 12, 2000, Charter Communications, Inc. entered into a second
network services agreement with High Speed Access, which was assigned by
Charter Communications, Inc. to Charter Communications Holding Company on
August 1, 2000. Under the terms of the May 12, 2000 network services
agreement, we agreed to commit a total of 5,000,000 homes passed, including all
homes passed in systems previously committed by us, to High Speed Access (other
than full turnkey systems), on or prior to May 12, 2003. With respect to each
system launched or intended to be launched, we paid a per customer fee to High
Speed Access according to agreed pricing terms. In addition, we compensated
High Speed Access for services exceeding certain minimum thresholds. For the
year ended December 31, 2001, we paid High Speed Access approximately $12.9
million under this agreement and the 1998 network services agreement.

Warrants earned under the May 12, 2000 network services agreement vested
at the time we authorized High Speed Access to proceed with respect to a
system, and were based upon the number of homes passed in such system. With
respect to the initial total 5,000,000 homes passed, the warrant provided that
Charter Communications Holding Company would have the right to purchase 0.775
shares of common stock for every home passed. With respect to any additional
homes passed in excess of 5,000,000, the warrant provided that Charter
Communications Holding Company would have the right to purchase 1.55 shares of
common stock for every home passed. Warrants earned under the agreement were
exercisable until 7 1/2 years from the date they were earned, and generally
were not subject to forfeiture. High Speed Access had agreed to increase the
number of shares of common stock subject to the amended and restated warrant,
upon Charter Communications Holding Company’s request, if the number of
warrants earned exceeded 11,500,000. High Speed Access also granted Charter
Communications Holding Company certain registration rights with respect to
shares of common stock held by Charter Communications Holding Company and its
direct and indirect subsidiaries, including shares of common stock issuable
upon exercise of the amended and restated warrant. The May 2000 network
services agreement with High Speed Access had a term of five years starting in
May 2000. Charter Communications Holding Company had the option to renew the
agreement for additional successive five-year terms on similar terms. All of
the warrants earned under the network services agreements described above were
cancelled in connection with the closing of the asset purchase agreement on
February 28, 2002.

On December 5, 2000 pursuant to a preferred stock purchase agreement
entered into as of October 19, 2000, one of our subsidiaries, Charter
Communications Ventures, LLC, and Vulcan Ventures purchased 37,000 shares and
38,000 shares, respectively, of Series D convertible preferred stock of High
Speed Access for $37.0 million and $38.0 million, respectively. The preferred
stock had a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share plus declared but unpaid
dividends and generally shared in dividends on High Speed Access common stock
on an “as converted to common stock” basis. Each share of Series D preferred
stock was convertible into that number of shares of common stock of High Speed
Access calculated by dividing the liquidation preference by the conversion
price per share, which was $5.01875, subject to adjustments for certain events.
Each share of Series D preferred stock was therefore convertible into 199.25
shares of High Speed Access common stock, so long as no adjustments occurred
and there were no declared but unpaid dividends. In connection with their
acquisition of the Series D convertible preferred stock, Charter Communications
Ventures and Vulcan Ventures were granted certain preemptive, first refusal,
registration and significant board representation rights as part of the
transaction. At the closing on February 28, 2002 of the asset acquisition from
High Speed Access, CC Systems delivered to High Speed Access the 37,000 shares
of Series D convertible preferred stock acquired by Charter Communications
Ventures and High Speed Access purchased from Vulcan Ventures its Series D
convertible preferred stock.

Immediately prior to our acquisition from High Speed Access on February
28, 2001, Vulcan Ventures owned 20,222,139 shares of common stock and 38,000
shares of Series D convertible preferred stock of High Speed Access, Charter
Communications Ventures owned 37,000 shares of Series D convertible preferred
stock and Charter Communications Holding Company held warrants convertible into
2,650,659 shares of common stock. If all of the shares of preferred stock and
warrants were converted into common stock, then Mr. Allen, through his
affiliates, would have beneficially owned 48.5% of the common stock of High
Speed Access as of January 23, 2002. Following the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the asset purchase agreement with High Speed
Access and related agreements, neither we nor Vulcan Ventures beneficially
owned any securities of, or were otherwise affiliated with, High Speed Access.

WorldGate/TVGateway.

WorldGate Communications, Inc. is a provider of
Internet access through cable systems. Charter Communications, Inc. has an
affiliation agreement with WorldGate for an initial term which expires in
November 2002. The agreement automatically renews for additional successive
two-year periods upon expiration of the initial five-year term, unless
terminated by either party for failure of the other party to perform any of its
obligations or undertakings required under the agreement. We started offering
WorldGate service in 1998. Pursuant to the agreement, Charter Communications,
Inc. agreed to deploy the WorldGate Internet access service within a portion of
our cable systems and to

- 86 -


install the appropriate headend equipment in all of our major markets in
those systems. Major markets for purposes of this agreement include those in
which we have more than 25,000 customers. We incur the cost for the
installation of headend equipment. In addition, to the extent we determine
that it is economically practical, we have agreed to use our reasonable best
efforts to deploy such service in all non-major markets that are technically
capable of providing interactive pay-per-view service. When WorldGate has a
telephone return path service available, we will, if economically practical,
use all reasonable efforts to install the appropriate headend equipment and
deploy the WorldGate service in our remaining markets. Telephone return path
service is the usage of telephone lines to connect to the Internet to transmit
data or receive data. We have also agreed to market the WorldGate service
within our market areas. We pay a monthly subscriber access fee to WorldGate
based on the number of subscribers to the WorldGate service. We have the
discretion to determine what fees, if any, we will charge our subscribers for
access to the WorldGate service. For the year ended December 31, 2001, we paid
WorldGate approximately $1.729 million, consisting of $1.529 million for
equipment purchases and $199,470 for subscriber access fees. We charged our
subscribers approximately $342,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001.

On July 25, 2000, Charter Communications Holding Company entered into a
joint venture, named TVGateway, LLC, with WorldGate and several other cable
operators to develop and deploy a server-based interactive program guide.
Charter Communications Holding Company initially invested $850,000, providing
it a 16.25% ownership interest in the joint venture and through subsequent
investments of $1.0 million, $1.5 million and $1.5 million in December 2000,
July 2001 and December 2001, respectively, increased its ownership interest to
17.63% as of December 31, 2001. For the first four years after the formation
of TVGateway, Charter Communications Holding Company will earn additional
ownership units, up to a maximum of 750,000 ownership units, as the interactive
program guide is deployed to our customers. On August 15, 2000, in connection
with the formation of the joint venture, Charter Communications Holding Company
purchased 31,211 shares of common stock of WorldGate at $16.02 per share for a
total purchase price of $500,000. As a result of this purchase, Charter
Communications Holding Company received a $125,000 credit from WorldGate
against future equipment purchases relating to the deployment of its service.
Additionally, WorldGate granted Charter Communications Holding Company warrants
to purchase up to 500,000 shares of WorldGate common stock for a period of
seven years at a exercise price of $24.78 per share. For a period of three
years from the date of closing, Charter Communications Holding Company will
also be issued warrants to purchase common stock of WorldGate based on the
number of two-way digital homes passed in the systems in which Charter
Communications Holding Company has deployed WorldGate service. As of December
31, 2001, Charter Communications Holding Company had earned warrants to
purchase 27,853 shares, but has not yet received documentation evidencing them.
One of our subsidiaries holds additional warrants to purchase 263,353 shares
of WorldGate common stock for $10.65 per share, which expire on June 30, 2002
and also owns 107,554 shares of WorldGate common stock for which it paid a
total of $1.5 million. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, the carrying value of
our investment in WorldGate was approximately $183,000 and $529,000,
respectively, and the carrying value of our investment in TVGateway was
approximately $2.6 million and $1.1 million, respectively.

Charter Communications Holding Company is party to a June 7, 2001
cable affiliation agreement for a three year term with Wink, which was amended in October 2001 and in March 2002.
The agreement has three, one-year renewal options at our discretion. Pursuant to
the agreement, Wink granted us a non-exclusive license to use the Wink software
to deliver the enhanced broadcasting services to our cable systems. Charter
Communications Holding Company agreed to make commercially reasonable efforts
to deploy the Wink services to three million subscribers, for which it is
eligible to receive a launch fee for transactions generated by our customers.
Wink has also agreed to issue Charter Communications Holding Company one million shares of Wink common stock subject to finalization of a grant agreement. As a result of this stock grant, Charter Communications Holdings Company will

TechTV Inc. operates a cable television channel which broadcasts
shows about technology. Pursuant to a carriage agreement terminating in 2008,
TechTV has provided us with programming for broadcast via our cable television
systems. Carriage fee amounts per subscriber are determined based on the
percentage of subscribers in a particular system receiving the services. These
fees will be waived for systems with higher penetration levels until December
31, 2003, and

- 87 -


were waived for systems with lower penetration levels through April 30,
2001. In certain circumstances, we are entitled to a percentage of TechTV’s
net product revenues from infomercials and home shopping and attributed to our
carriage of the service. Additionally, we receive incentive payments for
channel launches through December 31, 2003. TechTV may not offer its services
to any other cable operator which serves the same or fewer number of customers
at a more favorable rate or on more favorable carriage terms. For the year
ended December 31, 2001, we received $9.4 million from TechTV under the
carriage agreement, which is included in other revenues in the accompanying

digeo, inc.

Vulcan Ventures, an entity controlled by Mr. Allen, owns an
approximate 67% interest in digeo, inc. We expect to launch digeo’s
television-based Internet access service in St. Louis in the second half of
2002. The digeoTM product is designed to blend the power of the Internet with
the convenience of the television. Through the use of an advanced digital
set-top terminal, customers will be able to access Internet-based streaming
media on the television, including both local and national news, sports and
entertainment. The Internet domain name of customers using this service will
be “Charter TV.” The digeoTM product is a “portal,” which is an Internet web
site that serves as a user’s initial point of entry to the World Wide Web. By
offering selected content, services and links to other web sites and a portal
guide, it directs users through the World Wide Web. In addition, the portal
generates revenues from advertising on its own web pages and by sharing
revenues generated by linked or featured web sites. digeo, inc. has a license
agreement with Microsoft for software used in the digeo set top companion.
Fees under this license agreement are passed on to us through our agreement
with digeo.

in digeo, inc. funded by Vulcan Ventures Incorporated’s contribution of
approximately $21.2 million, which is subject to a priority return of capital
to Vulcan up to the amount so funded. Vulcan also agreed to make, through
January 24, 2004, certain additional contributions through Digeo Broadband
Holdings, LLC to acquire digeo, inc. equity in order to maintain Charter
Venture’s pro rata interest in digeo, inc. in the event of certain future
digeo, inc. equity financings by the founders of digeo, inc. These additional
equity interests will also be subject to a priority return of capital to Vulcan
up to the amount so contributed. On September 27, 2001, Charter
Communications, Inc. and digeo, inc. amended the March 2001 carriage agreement.
Pursuant to the amendment, digeo interactive, a subsidiary of digeo, inc.,
will provide the content for enhanced Wink interactive television services,
known as Charter Interactive Channels (known as “i-channels”), to Charter
Communications, Inc. In order to provide the i-channels, digeo, inc.
sublicensed certain Wink technologies to Charter Communications, Inc. We will
share in the revenues generated by the i-channels. In November 2001, we made
this service available to our digital subscribers in Glendale, California, and
by March 1, 2002, the i-channels were available to an aggregate of 550,000
digital subscribers. As of March 1, 2002, over 20% of the digital

- 89 -


subscribers in these markets were active users of the i-channels, with a
per-user average of 12.5 screen views per week. We plan to deploy this service
aggressively in 2002 and intend to offer the service to over 1.0 million
customers by December 31, 2002. Currently, those digital subscribers receiving
i-channels receive the service at no additional charge. For the year ended
December 31, 2001, we did not receive any payments or shared revenues from
digeo. As of December 31, 2001, the carrying value of our investment in digeo
was approximately $599,000.

Messrs. Allen, Savoy and Vogel are directors of digeo, inc. Mr. Kent, our
former director, served on the board of digeo, inc. Mr. Savoy serves on the
compensation committee of digeo, inc. Each of Mr. Savoy and Mr. Vogel owns
options to purchase 10,000 shares of digeo, inc. common stock.

drugstore.com.

We are party to an advertising agreement with
drugstore.com pursuant to which we will carry advertising of drugstore.com.
Mr. Allen owns less than 5% of the outstanding equity of drugstore.com and Mr.
Savoy acts as a director for drugstore.com.

Microsoft Corporation/MSN.

In September 2001, Charter Communications
Holding Company entered into an agreement with Microsoft Corporation. Pursuant
to the agreement with Microsoft, Charter Communications Holding Company
introduced for our Charter Pipeline™ customers a custom start page that is
co-branded with Microsoft’s MSN network of websites, with content modules that
we provide, including, for example, movie trailers previewing movies on
pay-per-view and video-on-demand, as well as television listings. In the
second quarter of 2002 we expect to introduce a custom browser that will be
co-branded with the MSN browser, and charter.com e-mail. Under the agreement,
Microsoft developed the website and will develop the browser. The agreement
provides for the provision of an advertising package to Charter Communications
Holding Company by Microsoft on the MSN network, the purchase of advertising
time by Microsoft on our cable systems, and for certain payments from Microsoft
to Charter Communications Holding Company related to the marketing of the
product. Microsoft will receive payments from Charter Communications Holding
Company for e-mail services hosted by Microsoft and development costs for the
website and browser. The agreement also provides that Microsoft and Charter
Communications Holding Company will share in the revenue generated from the
co-branded site and portions of the browser. Mr. Allen owns approximately 2.1%

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To Charter Communications, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Charter
Communications, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the

and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2001. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We did not audit the financial statements of
Charter Communications VI Operating Company, LLC and subsidiaries, and CC VII
Holdings, LLC—Falcon Systems, for the periods from the dates of acquisition
through December 31, 1999, which statements on a combined basis reflect total
revenues of 6 percent, of the related consolidated totals of the Company. Those
statements were audited by other auditors whose reports have been furnished to
us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for those
entities, is based solely on the reports of the other auditors.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits and the reports of
other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, based on our audits and the reports of other auditors, the
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Charter Communications, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their

December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted

1. Organization and Basis of Presentation

Charter Communications, Inc.

On July 22, 1999, Charter Investment, Inc. (Charter Investment), a company
controlled by Paul G. Allen, formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Charter
Communications, Inc. (Charter), a Delaware corporation, with a nominal initial
investment.

On November 12, 1999, Charter sold 195.5 million shares of Class A common
stock in an initial public offering and 50,000 shares of high vote Class B
common stock to Mr. Allen. The net proceeds from the offerings of approximately
$3.55 billion were used to purchase membership units of Charter Communications
Holding Company, LLC (Charter Holdco), except for a portion of the proceeds
that were retained by Charter to acquire a portion of the equity interests of
Avalon Cable of Michigan Holdings, Inc. (Avalon). In exchange for the
contribution of the net proceeds from the offerings and equity interests of
Avalon, Charter received 195.5 million membership units of Charter Holdco
representing a 100% voting interest and an approximate 40.6% economic interest.
As of December 31, 2001, Charter owns a 46.5% economic interest in Charter
Holdco.

Prior to November 12, 1999, Charter Holdco was 100% owned by Charter
Investment and Vulcan Cable III Inc. (Vulcan Cable), both entities controlled
by Mr. Allen. Subsequent to November 12, 1999, Mr. Allen controls Charter
through his ownership of all of the high vote Class B common stock and Charter
controls Charter Holdco through its ownership of all the voting interests.
Charter’s purchase of 50,000 membership units of Charter Holdco was accounted
for as a reorganization of entities under common control similar to a pooling
of interests. Accordingly, beginning December 23, 1998, the date Mr. Allen
first controlled Charter Holdco, the assets and liabilities of Charter Holdco
are reflected in the consolidated financial statements of Charter at Mr.
Allen’s basis and minority interest is recorded representing that portion of
the economic interests not owned by Charter. For financial reporting purposes,
50,000 of the membership units previously issued by Charter Holdco to companies
controlled by Mr. Allen are considered held by Charter effective December 23,
1998, representing an economic interest of less than 1%.

Charter is a holding company whose sole asset is a controlling equity
interest in Charter Holdco, an indirect owner of cable systems. Charter and
Charter Holdco and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as the
Company.

The Company, operating through its subsidiaries, is the fourth largest
operator of cable systems in the United States. Through the Company’s
broadband network of coaxial and fiber optic cable, it provides video, data,
interactive and private business network services to approximately seven
million (unaudited) customers in 40 states. All of the Company’s systems offer
traditional analog cable television. The Company is steadily increasing the
availability of digital television, along with an array of advanced products
and services such as high-speed Internet access (data services), interactive
video programming and video-on-demand, in an increasing number of systems. In
2002, the Company expects to offer several new advanced products and services,
including a set-top terminal companion that enables digital video recorder
capability, home networking and internet-access over the television; wireless
home networking; and an enhanced customized internet portal, with a customized
browser and charter.com e-mail. In 2002, the Company began offering telephony
on a limited basis through its broadband network using switch technology and
will continue trials of voice-over Internet protocol telephony. The
introduction and roll-out of new products and services represents an important
step toward the realization of the Company’s Wired World™ vision, where cable’s
ability to transmit interactive video, data and voice at high-speeds enables it
to serve as the primary platform for the delivery of new services to the home
and workplace.

Charter Communications Holding Company, LLC

Charter Holdco, a Delaware limited liability company, was formed in
February 1999 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Charter Investment. Charter
Investment through its wholly owned subsidiary, Charter Communications
Properties Holdings, LLC (CCPH), commenced operations with the acquisition of a
cable system on September 30, 1995.

F-9


Effective December 23, 1998, through a series of transactions, Mr. Allen
acquired approximately 94% of Charter Investment for an aggregate purchase
price of $2.2 billion, excluding $2.0 billion in debt assumed (the “Paul Allen
Transaction”). In conjunction with the Paul Allen Transaction, Charter
Investment acquired, for fair value from unrelated third parties, all of the
interests it did not already own in CharterComm Holdings, LLC (CharterComm
Holdings) and CCA Group (comprised of CCA Holdings Corp., CCT Holdings Corp.
and Charter Communications Long Beach, Inc.), all cable television operating
companies, for $2.0 billion, excluding $1.8 billion in debt assumed. Charter
Investment previously managed and owned minority interests in these companies.
These acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting
and accordingly, results of operations of CharterComm Holdings and CCA Group
are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of
acquisition. In February 1999, Charter Investment transferred all of its cable
television operating subsidiaries to a wholly owned subsidiary of Charter
Communications Holdings, LLC (Charter Holdings). Charter Holdings is a wholly
owned subsidiary of Charter Holdco. This transfer was accounted for as a
reorganization of entities under common control similar to a pooling of
interests.

As a result of the change in ownership of CCPH, CharterComm Holdings and
CCA Group, Charter Holdco applied push-down accounting in the preparation of
its consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, on December 23, 1998,
Charter Holdco increased its members’ equity by $2.2 billion to reflect the
amounts paid by Mr. Allen and Charter Investment. The purchase price was
allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative
fair values, including amounts assigned to franchises of $3.6 billion.

On April 23, 1998, Mr. Allen and a company controlled by Mr. Allen,
(collectively, the “Mr. Allen Companies”) purchased substantially all of the
outstanding partnership interests in Marcus Cable Company, L.L.C. (Marcus
Cable) for $1.4 billion, excluding $1.8 billion in assumed liabilities. The
owner of the remaining partnership interest retained voting control of Marcus
Cable. In February 1999, Marcus Cable Holdings, LLC (Marcus Holdings) was
formed, and Mr. Allen’s interests in Marcus Cable were transferred to Marcus
Holdings on March 15, 1999. On March 31, 1999, Mr. Allen purchased the
remaining partnership interests in Marcus Cable and obtained voting control. On
April 7, 1999, Marcus Holdings was merged into Charter Holdings and Marcus
Cable was transferred to Charter Holdings. For financial reporting purposes,
the merger was accounted for as an acquisition of Marcus Cable effective March
31, 1999, the date Mr. Allen obtained voting control of Marcus Cable.
Accordingly, the results of operations of Marcus Cable have been included in
the consolidated financial statements from April 1, 1999. The assets and
liabilities of Marcus Cable have been recorded in the consolidated financial
statements using historical carrying values reflected in the accounts of the
Mr. Allen Companies. Total members’ equity of Charter Holdco increased by $1.3
billion as a result of the Marcus Cable acquisition. Previously, on April 23,
1998, the Mr. Allen Companies recorded the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed of Marcus Cable based on their relative fair values.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Consolidation and Presentation

The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts
of Charter and all of its wholly owned, majority owned or controlled
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions among
consolidated entities have been eliminated.

Certain amounts in the prior years’ consolidated financial statements have
been reclassified to conform with the 2001 presentation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United Sates requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. These investments
are carried at cost which approximates market value.

F-10


Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including all direct
and certain indirect costs associated with the construction of cable
transmission and distribution facilities and the cost of new customer
installations. The costs of disconnecting a customer are charged to expense in
the period incurred. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to
operating expense as incurred, while equipment replacement and betterments are
capitalized.

Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over management’s
estimate of the useful lives of the related assets as follows:

Cable distribution systems

3-15 years

Buildings and leasehold improvements

5-15 years

Vehicles and equipment

3-5 years

Franchises

Costs incurred in obtaining and renewing cable franchises are deferred and
amortized using the straight-line method over a period of 15 years. Franchise
rights acquired through the purchase of cable systems represent management’s
estimate of fair value and are generally amortized using the straight-line
method over a period of 15 years. The period of 15 years was management’s best
estimate of the useful lives of the franchises and assumed that substantially
all of those franchises that expired during the period would be renewed but not
indefinitely. Because substantially all of the Company’s franchise rights have
been acquired in the past several years (see Note 3), the Company did not have
sufficient experience with the local franchise authorities to conclude that
renewals of franchises could be accomplished indefinitely. In addition, because
the technological state of the Company’s cable systems, with many systems with
less than 550 megahertz bandwidths, could have resulted in demands from local
franchise authorities to upgrade those systems sooner than previously planned,
there was a risk that the franchises would not be renewed.

The Company believes that facts and circumstances have changed to enable
it to conclude that substantially all of its franchises will be renewed
indefinitely, with some portion of the franchises continuing to be amortized.
The Company has sufficiently upgraded the technological state of its cable
systems and now has sufficient experience with the local franchise authorities
where it acquired franchises to conclude substantially all franchises will be
renewed indefinitely. Any revisions to the estimated useful lives of franchises
will be reflected in the 2002 financial statements (see Note 22 regarding the
adoption of SFAS No. 142).

Accumulated amortization related to franchises was $3.2 billion and $1.9
billion, as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Amortization expense
related to franchises for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, was
$1.3 billion, $1.2 billion and $520.0 million, respectively.

Other Assets

Other assets primarily include deferred financing costs and investments in
equity securities. Costs related to borrowings are deferred and amortized to
interest expense using the effective interest method over the terms of the
related borrowings. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, other assets include
$238.9 million and $180.5 million of deferred financing costs, net of
accumulated amortization of $69.5 million and $35.9 million, respectively.

Investments in equity securities are accounted for at cost, under the
equity method of accounting or in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities.” Charter recognizes losses for any decline in value
considered to be other than temporary. Certain marketable equity securities are
classified as available-for-sale and reported at market value with unrealized
gains and losses recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss.
Comprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, was
$1.2 billion, $830.7 million and $64.8 million, respectively.

F-11


The following summarizes investment information as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2001:

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets

The Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of long-lived
assets, including property, plant and equipment and franchises for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of an asset may not be recoverable. If a review indicates that the carrying
value of such asset is not recoverable based on projected undiscounted net cash
flows related to the asset over its remaining life, a loss is recognized for
the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value.

Other Long-term Liabilities

The Company receives upfront payments from certain programmers related to
the launch of new cable television channels. Revenue is recognized to the
extent of the fair value of the advertising services provided to promote the
new channels. Such revenue is classified as advertising revenue and totaled
$99.7 million and $51.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively, and was insignificant during 1999. The remaining portion is
deferred and amortized as an offset to programming expense over the respective
terms of the program agreements, which range from one to 20 years. For the
years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, the Company amortized and
recorded as a reduction of programming costs $10.3 million, $6.9 million and
$3.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, the unamortized
portion of the deferred payments totaled $95.9 million and $104.2 million,
respectively, and is included in other long-term liabilities in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company uses interest rate risk management derivative instruments,
such as interest rate swap agreements, interest rate cap agreements and
interest rate collar agreements (collectively referred to herein as interest
rate agreements) as required under the terms of the credit facilities of the
Company’s subsidiaries. The Company’s policy is to manage interest costs using
a mix of fixed and variable rate debt. Using interest rate swap agreements, the
Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between
fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon
notional principal amount. Interest rate cap agreements are used to lock in a
maximum interest rate should variable rates rise, but enable the Company to
otherwise pay lower market rates. Interest rate collar agreements are used to
limit exposure to and benefits from interest rate fluctuations on variable rate
debt to within a certain range of rates. The Company does not hold or issue
any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

Revenue Recognition

Revenues from analog, digital and cable modem services are recognized when
the related services are provided. Advertising sales are recognized in the
period that the advertisements are broadcast.

Local governmental authorities impose franchise fees on the Company
ranging up to a federally mandated maximum of 5.0% of gross revenues. Such fees
are collected on a monthly basis from the Company’s customers and are
periodically remitted to local franchise authorities. Franchise fees collected
and paid are reported as revenues and expenses.

F-12


Stock-Based Compensation

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees,” and related interpretations, as permitted by SFAS No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” Compensation expense for stock
options is measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the
Company’s common stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee
must pay to acquire the common stock. Compensation expense for restricted
stock awards is recorded over the vesting period with an increase to additional
paid-in capital based on the quoted market price of the Company’s common stock
at the date of the grant.

Income Taxes

Substantially all of the taxable income, gains, losses, deductions and
credits of Charter Holdco are passed through to its members, Charter, Charter
Investment, Vulcan Cable, and the former owners of acquired companies. Charter
is responsible for its share of taxable income (loss) of Charter Holdco
allocated to it in accordance with the Charter Communications Holding Company
amended and restated limited liability company agreement and partnership tax
rules and regulations. Charter does not expect to pay any material income
taxes in the foreseeable future.

The amended and restated limited liability company agreement provides
that, through the end of 2003, tax losses of Charter Holdco that would
otherwise have been allocated to Charter based generally on the percentage of
outstanding common membership units (the cumulative amount of such losses is
approximately $1.7 billion through the period ended December 31, 2001, assuming
the other provisions of the amended and restated limited liability company
agreement were generally the same) will be allocated instead to the membership
units held by Vulcan Cable and Charter Investment. These special loss
allocation provisions will reduce Vulcan Cable’s and Charter Investment’s
rights to receive distributions upon a liquidation of Charter Holdco if over
time there are insufficient allocations to be made under the special profit
allocation provisions described below to restore these distribution rights.

The amended and restated limited liability company agreement further
provides that, beginning at the time Charter Holdco first becomes profitable
(as determined under the applicable federal income tax rules for determining
book profits), tax profits that would otherwise have been allocated to Charter
based generally on its percentage of outstanding common membership units will
instead be allocated to Vulcan Cable and Charter Investment. The special profit
allocations will also have the effect of restoring over time Vulcan Cable’s and
Charter Investment ‘s rights to receive distributions upon a liquidation of
Charter Holdco. These special profit allocations generally will continue until
such time as Vulcan Cable’s and Charter Investment ‘s rights to receive
distributions upon a liquidation of Charter Holdco that had been reduced as a
result of the special loss allocations have been fully restored. The Company
does not expect Charter Holdco to generate taxable income in the foreseeable
future.

In certain situations, the special loss allocations and special profit
allocations described above could result in Charter’s having to pay taxes in an
amount that is more or less than if Charter Holdco had allocated profits and
losses among its members based generally on the number of common membership
units owned by such members. However, management does not anticipate that the
special loss allocations and special profit allocations will result in Charter
having to pay taxes in an amount that is materially different on a present
value basis than the taxes that would be payable had profits and losses been
allocated among the members of Charter Holdco based generally on the number of
common membership units owned by such members, although there is no assurance
that a material difference will not result.

Minority Interest

Minority interest represents total members’ equity of Charter Holdco
multiplied by the ownership percentage of Charter Holdco not owned by Charter,
plus preferred equity in an indirect subsidiary of Charter held by certain
Bresnan sellers, less a portion of redeemable securities. Minority interest totaled $4.0 billion and $4.1 billion
as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively, on the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets. Gains (losses)
arising from issuances by Charter Holdco of its membership units are recorded
as capital transactions thereby increasing (decreasing) shareholders’ equity
and (decreasing) increasing minority interest on the consolidated balance
sheets. These gains (losses) totaled $(293.4) million, $55.5 million and
$(413.8) million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively, on the accompanying consolidated statements of changes in
shareholders’ equity. Operating losses are allocated to the minority
owners based on their ownership percentage, thereby reducing the Company’s net
loss.

F-13


Loss per Common Share

Basic loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss by
269,594,386 shares, 225,697,775 shares and 29,811,202 shares for 2001, 2000 and
1999, representing the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the
respective periods. Diluted loss per common share equals basic loss per common
share for the periods presented, as the effect of stock options is antidilutive
because the Company incurred net losses. All membership units of Charter Holdco
are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into common stock of Charter at the
option of the holders. Should the holders exchange units for shares, the effect
would not be dilutive.

Segments

SFAS No. 131, “Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information,” established standards for reporting information about operating
segments in annual financial statements and in interim financial reports issued
to shareholders. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise
about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated on a
regular basis by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group,
in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing
performance of the segment. Because the Company provides a variety of
broadband services over the same means of delivery, management has determined
the Company has one reportable segment, broadband services.

3. Acquisitions

During 2001, the Company acquired cable systems in two separate
transactions for an aggregate purchase price of $1.8 billion. In connection
with the acquisitions, Charter paid aggregate consideration of $1.76 billion in
cash, a cable system valued at $25.1 million, 505,664 shares of Charter Series
A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock valued at $50.6 million and additional
shares of Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock valued at $5.1
million to be issued to certain sellers subject to certain holdback provisions
of the acquisition agreement. The purchase prices were allocated to assets and
liabilities assumed based on relative fair values, including amounts assigned
to franchises of $1.4 billion.

During 2000, the Company acquired cable systems in five separate
transactions for an aggregate purchase price of $1.2 billion, net of cash
acquired, excluding debt assumed of $963.3 million. In connection with the
acquisitions, Charter issued shares of Class A common stock valued at
approximately $178.0 million, and Charter Holdco and an indirect subsidiary of
Charter Holdco issued equity interests totaling $384.6 million and $629.5
million, respectively. The purchase prices were allocated to assets and
liabilities assumed based on relative fair values, including amounts assigned
to franchises of $3.0 billion.

During 1999, the Company acquired cable systems in 11 separate
transactions for an aggregate purchase price of $7.6 billion, net of cash
acquired, excluding debt assumed of $2.5 billion. In connection with two of the
acquisitions, Charter Holdco issued equity interests totaling $683.3 million.
The purchase prices were allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed
based on their relative fair values, including amounts assigned to franchises
of $9.7 billion.

The above transactions were accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting, and, accordingly, the results of operations of the acquired assets
have been included in the consolidated financial statements from their
respective dates of acquisition. The purchase prices were allocated to assets
and liabilities assumed based on relative fair values. The allocation of the
purchase prices for the 2001 acquisitions is based, in part, on preliminary
information, which is subject to adjustment upon obtaining complete valuation
information. Management believes that finalization of the allocation of the
purchase prices will not have material impact on the consolidated results of
operations or financial position of the Company.

The summarized operating results of the Company which follow are presented
on a pro forma basis as if the following had occurred on January 1, 2000
(dollars in thousands, except per share data): all significant acquisitions and
dispositions completed during 2001 and 2000, the issuance of Charter Holdings
senior and senior discount notes in January 2001 and 2000, the issuance by
Charter of convertible senior notes in October and November 2000, the drawdown
of Charter Holdings’ 2000 senior bridge loan facility, the issuance of Charter
Holdings senior and senior discount notes in May 2001, and the issuance of and
sale by Charter of convertible senior notes and common stock in May 2001.
Adjustments have been made to give effect to amortization of franchises,
interest expense, minority interest, and certain other adjustments.

The unaudited pro forma financial information has been presented for
comparative purposes and does not purport to be indicative of the consolidated
results of operations had these transactions been completed as of the assumed
date or which may be obtained in the future.

On August 29, 2001, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries entered into an
agreement to purchase substantially all of the assets of certain Enstar
partnerships for which Charter is the manager for a purchase price of
approximately $63.0 million in cash.

On September 28, 2001, Charter Holdco and High-Speed Access Corp. (HSA)
entered into an asset purchase agreement pursuant to which Charter Holdco
agreed to purchase from HSA the contracts and associated assets, and assume
related liabilities, that served certain of the Company’s high-speed data
customers for $77.5 million in cash. The transaction is expected to close in
February 2002.

During the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company reduced the
estimated useful lives of certain depreciable assets expected to be abandoned
as a result of its rebuild and upgrade of cable distribution systems. As a
result, an additional $540.9 million and $508.5 million of depreciation expense
was recorded during the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
The Company periodically evaluates the estimated useful lives used to
depreciate its assets and the estimated amount of assets that will be abandoned

(Term C). The CC VII credit facilities also provide for a reducing revolving
facility of up to approximately $77.7 million (maturing in December 2006), a
reducing supplemental facility of up to $110.0 million (maturing in December
2007) and a second reducing revolving facility of up to $670.0 million
(maturing in June 2007). At the option of the lenders, supplemental credit
facilities in the amount of up to $486.4 million may also be available. Amounts
under the CC VII credit facilities bear interest at the base rate or the
Eurodollar rate, as defined, plus a margin of up to 2.5% for Eurodollar loans
(5.50% to 7.08% as of December 31, 2001) and up to 1.5% for base rate loans. A
quarterly commitment fee of between 0.25% and 0.375% per annum is payable on
the unborrowed balance of the revolving facilities.

As of December 31, 2001, outstanding borrowings were $582.0 million and
unused availability was $760.7 million. In January 2002, the Company repaid
$97.0 million under the CC VII revolving credit facilities with proceeds from
the issuance of the January 2002 Charter Holdings notes.

CC VIII Credit Facilities.

Upon the completion of the CC V Holdings
Combination in January 2001, the CC VIII credit facilities were amended and
restated to, among other things, increase borrowing availability by $555.0
million. The credit facilities were further amended and restated on January 3,
2002 and provide for borrowings of up to $1.55 billion. The CC VIII credit
facilities provide for three term facilities, two Term A facilities with an
aggregate principal amount of $500.0 million that mature in June 2007, and a
Term B facility with a principal amount of $500.0 million that matures in
February 2008. The CC VIII credit facilities also provide for two reducing
revolving credit facilities, in the aggregate amount of $550.0 million, which
will reduce quarterly beginning in March 2002 and September 2005, respectively,
with maturity dates in June 2007. At the option of the lenders, supplemental
facilities in the amount of $300.0 million may be available. Amounts under the
CC VIII credit facilities bear interest at the base rate or the Eurodollar
rate, as defined, plus a margin of up to 2.75% for Eurodollar loans (6.09% to
7.84% as of December 31, 2001) and up to 1.75% for base rate loans. A quarterly
commitment fee of between 0.250% and 0.375% is payable on the unborrowed
balance of the revolving credit facilities.

As of December 31, 2001, outstanding borrowings were $1.1 billion, and
unused availability was $368.0 million. After giving effect to the amendment to
the CC VIII credit facilities on January 3, 2002, unused availability would
have been $468.0 million as of December 31, 2001. In January 2002, the Company
repaid $107.0 million under the CC VIII revolving credit facilities with
proceeds from the issuance of the January 2002 Charter Holdings notes.

The indentures governing the debt agreements require issuers of the debt
and/or its subsidiaries to comply with various financial and other covenants,
including the maintenance of certain operating and financial ratios. These debt
instruments also contain substantial limitations on, or prohibitions of,
distributions, additional indebtedness, liens, asset sales and certain other
items. As a result of limitations and prohibitions of distributions,
substantially all of the net assets of the consolidated subsidiaries are
restricted for distribution to the Company, Charter Holdings and Charter
Holdco.

In the event of a default under the Company’s subsidiaries’ credit
facilities or public notes, the subsidiaries’ creditors could elect to declare
all amounts borrowed, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees,
to be due and payable. In such event, the subsidiaries’ credit facilities and
indentures will not permit our subsidiaries to distribute funds to Charter
Holdco or the Company to pay interest or principal on the public notes. If the
amounts outstanding under such credit facilities or public notes are
accelerated, all of the subsidiaries’ debt and liabilities would be payable
from the subsidiaries’ assets, prior to any distribution of the subsidiaries’
assets to pay the interest and principal amounts on the public notes and the
Company might not be able to repay or make any payments on its public notes.
Additionally, such a default would cause a cross-default in the indentures
governing the Charter Holdings notes and the convertible senior notes and would
trigger the cross-default provision of the Charter Operating Credit Agreement.
Any default under any of the subsidiaries’ credit facilities or public notes
might adversely affect the holders of the Company’s public notes and the
Company’s growth, financial condition and results of operations.

Based upon outstanding indebtedness as of December 31, 2001, giving effect
to the refinancing of certain of the Company’s credit facilities on January 3,
2002, the amortization of term loans, scheduled reductions in available
borrowings of the revolving credit facilities, and the maturity dates for all
senior and subordinated notes and debentures, aggregate future principal
payments on the total borrowings under all debt agreements as of December 31,
2001, are as follows:

8. Minority Interest and Equity Interests of Charter Holdco

Minority interest represents total members’ equity of Charter Holdco
multiplied by 53.5% and 59.2% as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively,
representing the ownership percentages of Charter Holdco not owned by Charter,
plus preferred equity in an indirect subsidiary of Charter held by certain
Bresnan sellers, less a portion of redeemable securities. Members’ equity of
Charter Holdco was $6.2 billion and $7.7 billion as of December 31, 2001 and
2000, respectively.

Changes to minority interest consist of the following for the periods
presented:

F-22


The preferred equity interests in Charter Holdco held by the Rifkin
sellers were exchangeable into Class A common stock of Charter at the option of
the Rifkin sellers only at the time of the initial public offering. In November
1999, preferred equity interests of $130.3 million were exchanged into common
stock of Charter. The membership units of Charter Holdco held by the Falcon
sellers were exchangeable into Class A common stock of Charter. In November
1999, membership units of $506.6 million were exchanged into the Class A common
stock of Charter.

Pursuant to a membership interests purchase agreement, as amended, Vulcan
Cable contributed $500.0 million in cash on August 10, 1999 to Charter Holdco,
contributed an additional $180.7 million in certain equity interests acquired
in connection with the acquisition of Rifkin in September 1999 to Charter
Holdco, and contributed $644.3 million in September 1999 to Charter Holdco. All
funds and equity interests were then contributed to Charter Holdings.
Concurrently with the closing of the initial public offering, Vulcan Cable
contributed $750.0 million in cash to Charter Holdco.

In February 2000, Charter Holdco and Charter Holdings completed the
acquisition of Bresnan. The Bresnan sellers obtained equity interests in
Charter Holdco and preferred equity interests in a subsidiary of Charter
Holdings. The holders of the preferred equity interests are entitled to a 2%
annual return. All of the membership units received by the sellers are
exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into shares of Class A common stock of
Charter.

9. Redeemable Securities

In connection with several acquisitions in 1999 and 2000, sellers who
acquired Charter Holdco membership units, additional equity interests in a
subsidiary of Charter Holdings or shares of Class A common stock in Charter’s
initial public offering received potential rescission rights against Charter
and Charter Holdco arising out of possible violations of Section 5 of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in connection with the offers and sales of
these equity interests. Accordingly, the maximum potential cash obligation
related to the rescission rights, estimated at $1.1 billion as of December 31,
2000, has been excluded from shareholders’ equity or minority interest and
classified as redeemable securities on the consolidated balance sheet.

In February 2001, all remaining rescission rights associated with the
redeemable securities expired without the security holders requesting
repurchase of their securities. Accordingly, the Company reclassified the
respective amounts to minority interest and shareholders’ equity, as
applicable.

10. Preferred Stock — Redeemable

On August 31, 2001, in connection with its acquisition of Cable USA, Inc.
and certain cable system assets from affiliates of Cable USA, Inc., the Company
issued 505,664 shares of Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock (the
Preferred Stock) valued at and with a liquidation preference of $50.6 million.
Holders of the Preferred Stock have no voting rights but are entitled to
receive cumulative cash dividends at an annual rate of 5.75%, payable
quarterly. If for any reason Charter fails to pay the dividends on the
Preferred Stock on a timely basis, the dividend rate on each share increases to
an annual rate of 7.75% until the payment is made. The Preferred Stock is
redeemable by Charter at its option on or after August 31, 2004 and must be
redeemed by Charter at any time upon a change of control, or if not previously
redeemed or converted, on August 31, 2008. The Preferred Stock is convertible,
in whole or in part, at the option of the holders from April 1, 2002 through
August 31, 2008, into shares of common stock at an initial conversion rate
equal to a conversion price of $24.71 per share of common stock, subject to
certain customary adjustments. The redemption price per share of Preferred
Stock is the Liquidation Preference of $100, subject to certain customary
adjustments.

11. Shareholders’ Equity

At December 31, 2001 and 2000, 1.75 billion shares of $.001 par value
Class A common stock, 750 million shares of $.001 par value Class B common
stock, and 250 million shares of $.001 par value preferred stock are
authorized. At December 31, 2001, 294.5 million shares of Class A common stock
and 50,000 of Class B common stock were issued and outstanding. At December 31,
2000, 233.8 million of Class A common stock, 50,000 shares of Class B common
stock and no shares of preferred stock, were issued and outstanding. The Class
A common stock includes 0.3 million shares classified as redeemable securities
at December 31, 2000 (see Note 9).

F-23


12. Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133 “Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” Interest rate agreements
are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2001 as either
an asset or liability measured at fair value. In connection with the adoption
of SFAS No. 133, the Company recorded a loss of $23.9 million for the
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle as other expense. The
effect of adoption was to increase other expense resulting in increased loss
before minority interest, net loss and loss per share by $23.9 million, $9.8
million and $0.04 per share, respectively, for the year ended December 31,
2001.

The Company has certain interest rate derivative instruments that have
been designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Such instruments are those
which effectively convert variable interest payments on debt instruments into
fixed payments. For qualifying hedges, SFAS No. 133 allows derivative gains and
losses to offset related results on hedged items in the consolidated statement
of operations. The Company has formally documented, designated and assessed the
effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting. For the year ended
December 31, 2001, other expense includes $2.5 million of losses, which
represent cash flow hedge ineffectiveness on interest rate hedge agreements
arising from differences between the critical terms of the agreements and the
related hedged obligations. Changes in the fair value of interest rate
agreements designated as hedging instruments of the variability of cash flows
associated with floating-rate debt obligations are reported in accumulated
other comprehensive loss. At December 31, 2001, a loss of $38.5 million related
to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges was recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive loss and minority interest. The amounts are
subsequently reclassified into interest expense as a yield adjustment in the
same period in which the related interest on the floating-rate debt obligations
affects earnings (losses).

Certain interest rate derivative instruments are not designated as hedges
as they do not meet the effectiveness criteria specified by SFAS No. 133.
However, management believes such instruments are closely correlated with the
respective debt, thus managing associated risk. Interest rate derivative
instruments not designated as hedges are marked to fair value with the impact
recorded as other income or expense. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the
Company recorded other expense of $48.8 million for interest rate derivative
instruments not designated as hedges.

As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company had outstanding $3.3 billion
and $1.9 billion, $0 and $15.0 million, and $520.0 million and $520.0 million,
respectively, in notional amounts of interest rate swaps, caps and collars,
respectively. The notional amounts of interest rate instruments do not
represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, thus, are not a measure of
exposure to credit loss. The amounts exchanged are determined by reference to
the notional amount and the other terms of the contracts.

13. Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Company has estimated the fair value of its financial instruments as
of December 31, 2001 and 2000 using available market information or other
appropriate valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment, however, is
required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value.
Accordingly, the estimates presented in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company would
realize in a current market exchange.

The carrying amounts of cash, receivables, payables and other current
assets and liabilities approximate fair value because of the short maturity of
those instruments. The Company is exposed to market price risk volatility with
respect to investments in publicly traded and privately held entities.

The fair value of interest rate agreements represents the estimated amount
the Company would receive or pay upon termination of the agreements.
Management believes that the sellers of the interest rate agreements will be
able to meet their obligations under the agreements. In addition, some of the
interest rate agreements are with certain of the participating banks under the
Company’s credit facilities, thereby reducing the exposure to credit loss. The
Company has policies regarding the financial stability and credit standing of
major counterparties. Nonperformance by the counterparties is not anticipated
nor would it have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated
financial position or results of operations.

F-24


The Company’s credit facilities bear interest at current market rates and,
thus, their carrying value approximates fair value at December 31, 2001 and
2000. The Company is exposed to interest rate volatility with respect to these
variable-rate instruments.

The estimated fair value of the Company’s notes and interest rate
agreements at December 31, 2001 and 2000 are based on quoted market prices or a
discounted cash flow analysis using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate
for similar types of borrowing arrangements and dealer quotations.

A summary of the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s debt and
related interest rate agreements at December 31, 2001 and 2000 is as follows:

The weighted average interest pay rate for the Company’s interest rate
swap agreements was 7.22% and 7.61% at December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. The Company’s interest rate collar agreements are structured so
that if LIBOR falls below 5.3%, the Company pays 6.7%. If the LIBOR rate is
between 5.3% and 8.0%, the Company pays LIBOR. The LIBOR rate is capped at 8.0%
if LIBOR is between 8.0% and 9.9%. If the LIBOR rate rises above 9.9%, the cap
is removed.

14. Revenues

Revenues consist of the following for the years presented:

F-25


15. Operating, General and Administrative Expenses

Operating, general and administrative expenses consist of the following
for the years presented:

16. Option Plans

The Company grants stock options, restricted stock and other incentive
compensation pursuant to two plans – the 1999 Option Plan of Charter Holdco
(the “1999 Plan”) and the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan of Charter (the “2001
Plan”). The 1999 Plan provided for the grant of options to purchase membership
units in Charter Holdco to current and prospective employees and consultants of
Charter Holdco and its affiliates and current and prospective non-employee
directors of Charter. Membership units received upon exercise of any options
are immediately exchanged for shares of Class A common stock of Charter on a
one-for-one basis. Options granted generally vest over five years from the
grant date, commencing 15 months after the date of grant. Options not exercised
accumulate and are exercisable, in whole or in part, in any subsequent period,
but not later than ten years from the date of grant. Membership units received
upon exercise of the options are automatically exchanged into Class A common
stock of Charter on a one-for-one basis.

The 2001 Plan provides for the grant of non-qualified stock options, stock
appreciation rights, dividend equivalent rights, performance units and
performance shares, share awards, phantom stock and/or shares of restricted
stock (not to exceed 3,000,000), as each term is defined in the 2001 Plan.
Employees, officers, consultants and directors of the Company and its
subsidiaries and affiliates are eligible to receive grants under the 2001 Plan.
Options granted generally vest over four years from the grant date, with 25%
vesting on each anniversary date following the grant date until options are
fully vested. Generally, options expire 10 years from the grant date.

Together, the plans allow for the issuance of up to an aggregate of
60,000,000 shares of Charter Class A common stock (or units convertible into
Charter Class A common stock). In 2001, any shares covered by options that
terminated under the 1999 Plan were transferred to the 2001 Plan, and no new
options were granted under the 1999 Plan. During September and October 2001, in
connection with new employment agreements and related option agreements entered
into by the Company, certain executives of the Company were awarded an
aggregate of 256,000 shares of restricted Class A common stock, of which 26,250
shares were subsequently cancelled. The shares vested 25% upon grant, with the
remaining shares vesting monthly over a three-year period beginning after the
first anniversary of the date of grant. As of December 31, 2001, deferred
compensation remaining to be recognized in future periods totaled $2.2 million.

In September 2001, when the Company’s former President and Chief Executive
Officer terminated his employment, he forfeited an option to purchase
approximately seven million Charter Holdco membership units, of which
approximately 4.8 million had vested. Accordingly, the Company recorded a
reversal of previously recorded compensation expense of $66.6 million.

F-26


A summary of the activity for the Company’s stock options, excluding
granted shares of restricted Class A common stock, for the years ended December
31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, is as follows (amounts not in thousands):

The Company uses the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB Opinion No.
25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” to account for the option
plans. Option compensation expense of $41.0 million and $80.0 million for the
years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively, was recorded in the
consolidated statements of operations since the exercise prices of certain
options were less than the estimated fair values of the underlying membership
interests on the date of grant. Option compensation income of $45.7 million for
the year ended December 31, 2001 was recorded in the consolidated statements of
operations primarily due to the reversal of expense previously recorded in
connection with approximately seven million options forfeited by the Company’s
former President and Chief Executive Officer as part of his September 2001
separation agreement. This was partially offset by expense recorded because
exercise prices on certain options were less than the estimated fair values of
the Company’s stock at the time of grant. Estimated fair values were
determined by the Company using the valuation inherent in the Paul Allen
Transaction and valuations of public companies in the cable television industry
adjusted for factors specific to the Company. Compensation expense is being
recorded over the vesting period of each grant that varies from four to five
years. As of December 31, 2001, deferred compensation remaining to be
recognized in future periods totaled $8.0 million. No stock option compensation
expense was recorded for the options granted after November 8, 1999, since the
exercise price was equal to the estimated fair value of the underlying
membership interests or shares of Class A common stock on the date of grant.
Since the membership units are exchangeable into Class A common stock of
Charter on a one-for-one basis, the estimated fair value was equal to the
quoted market values of Class A common stock.

F-27


SFAS No. 123 requires pro forma disclosure of the impact on earnings as if
the compensation expense for these plans had been determined using the fair
value method. The following table presents the Company’s net loss and loss per
share as reported and the pro forma amounts that would have been reported using
the fair value method under SFAS 123 for the years presented:

The fair value of each option granted is estimated on the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The following weighted average
assumptions were used for grants during the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000
and 1999, respectively: risk-free interest rates of 5.0%, 6.5%, and 5.5%;
expected volatility of 55.7%, 46.9% and 43.8%; and expected lives of 10 years.
The valuations assume no dividends are paid.

On July 25, 2001, the Company issued options to purchase 186,385 shares of
Charter Class A common stock to a consultant in consideration of services to be
rendered in the future, pursuant to an equity compensation plan not approved by
shareholders. The options are exercisable immediately, at an exercise price of
$20.46 per share and if not exercised prior to the tenth anniversary of the
grant date, will expire. The Company accounts for options granted to
consultants in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123 and recorded
option compensation expense of $2.6 million. The fair value of the options,
$13.95 per option, was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model and the following assumptions: risk-free interest rate of
5.7%; expected volatility of 49.8%; and an expected life of 10 years. The
valuation assumed no dividends are paid.

17. Special Charges

During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company recorded $17.6
million in special charges which represent costs associated with the transition
of approximately 145,000 (unaudited) data customers from the Excite@Home
Internet service to the Charter Pipeline Internet service, as well as certain
employee severance costs.

On September 28, 2001, Excite@Home Corporation filed for protection under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The Company undertook a transition
plan to convert all of its customers from the Excite@Home Internet service to
its own Charter Pipeline Internet service, successfully transitioning over 90%
of its customers served by Excite@Home by December 31, 2001. The remaining
customers were converted by March 1, 2002. The Company incurred $14.3 million
in operational expenses in connection with the transition, including a one-time
contract payment of $1.0 million to Excite@Home for the provision of services
through February 2002 to the 10% of customers that would not be transitioned by
December 31, 2001.

In December 2001, the Company implemented a restructuring plan to reduce
its workforce in certain markets and reorganize its operating divisions from
two to three and operating regions from twelve to ten. The restructuring plan
was completed during the first quarter of 2002, resulting in the termination of
approximately 360 employees and severance costs of $3.3 million.

18. Income Taxes

Certain indirect subsidiaries of Charter Holdings are corporations and
file separate federal and state income tax returns. Results of operations from
these subsidiaries are not material to the consolidated results of operations
of the Company. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 1999
represents taxes assessed by certain state jurisdictions. Deferred income tax
assets and liabilities related to these corporations are not material.

F-28


The Company files separate federal and state income tax returns and is
responsible for its share of taxable income (loss) of Charter Holdco as
determined by partnership tax rules and regulations and Charter Holdco’s
limited liability company agreement (see Note 2). Management does not expect
the Company to pay any income taxes in the foreseeable future.

The Company is required to record a valuation allowance when it is more
likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will
not be realized. Deferred income tax assets include net operating loss
carryforwards and a temporary difference attributable to the investment in
Charter Holdco of $48.5 million (generally expiring in years 2008 through 2021,
and $15.2 million of which are subject to certain limitations on the Company’s
ability to utilize) and $488.5 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2001.
The deferred income tax assets were offset entirely by a valuation allowance
because of current and expected future losses. While the Company believes its
share of taxable income (loss) has been allocated to Charter properly and in
accordance with partnership tax rules and regulations, management cannot
guarantee that such allocations will not be challenged by taxing authorities.
Any adjustments to the allocation of taxable income (loss) should not have a
material impact on future income tax expense.

19. Related Party Transactions

The following sets forth certain transactions in which the Company and its
directors, executive officers and affiliates are involved. Unless otherwise
disclosed, management believes that each of the transactions described below
was on terms no less favorable to the Company than could have been obtained
from independent third parties.

Management and Consulting Arrangements

Management Arrangements

Charter has entered into management arrangements with Charter Holdco and
certain of its subsidiaries. Under these agreements, Charter provides
management services for and operates the cable television systems owned or
acquired by its subsidiaries. The management agreements covering the CC VI and
CC VII companies limit management fees payable to Charter to 5% of gross
revenues. Under the arrangement covering all of Charter’s other operating
subsidiaries, there is no limit on the dollar amount or percentage of revenues
payable as management fees. However, the total amount paid by Charter Holdco
and all of its subsidiaries is limited to the amount necessary to reimburse
Charter for all of its expenses, costs, losses, liabilities and damages paid or
incurred by it in connection with the performance of its services under the
various management agreements. The expenses subject to reimbursement include
any fees Charter is obligated to pay under the mutual services agreement
described below. Payment of management fees by Charter’s operating
subsidiaries is subject to certain restrictions under the credit facilities of
such subsidiaries. In the event any portion of the management fee due and
payable is not paid, it is deferred by Charter and accrued as a liability of
such subsidiaries. Any deferred amount of the management fee will bear
interest at the rate of 10% per annum, compounded annually, from the date it
was due and payable until the date it is paid.

For the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, Charter received a
total of $6.2 million, $5.0 million and $0.8 million, respectively, as
management fees from Charter Holdco and its subsidiaries, exclusive of amounts
being paid to Charter Holdco pursuant to the mutual services agreement
described below. The accounts and balances related to these fees eliminate in
consolidation.

Mutual Services Agreement

During 2001, pursuant to a mutual services agreement between Charter,
Charter Holdco and Charter Investment, Charter Holdco leased the necessary
personnel and provided services on a cost-reimbursement basis to Charter to
manage its subsidiaries. The mutual services agreement provides that each
party shall provide rights and services to the other parties as may be
reasonably requested for the management of the entities involved and their
subsidiaries, including the cable systems owned by their subsidiaries. The
officers and employees of each party are available to the other parties to
provide these rights and services, and all expenses and costs incurred in
providing these rights and services are paid by Charter. Each of the parties
will indemnify and hold harmless the other parties and their directors,
officers and employees from and against any and all claims that may be made
against any of them in connection with the mutual services agreement except due
to its or their gross negligence or willful misconduct. The mutual services
agreement expires on November 12, 2009, and may be terminated at any time by
any party upon thirty days’ written notice to the other. For the years ended
December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, Charter paid $50.7 million, $50.3 million and
$50.7 million, respectively, to Charter Investment for services

F-29


rendered pursuant to the mutual services agreement. All such amounts are
reimbursable to Charter pursuant to a management arrangement with subsidiaries.
The accounts and balances related to these services eliminate in consolidation.

Consulting Agreement

Charter Holdco is a party to a consulting agreement with Vulcan Inc.
(f/k/a Vulcan Northwest) and Charter Investment. Pursuant to this consulting
agreement, Vulcan Inc. provides and, through January 2001, Charter Investment
provided, advisory, financial and other consulting services with respect to the
acquisitions by Charter Holdco of the business, assets or stock of other
companies. Such services include participation in the evaluation, negotiation
and implementation of these acquisitions. The original agreement had an
expiration date of December 31, 2000, but has and will continue to
automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless otherwise terminated.
The consulting agreement provides for a fee equal to 1% of the aggregate value
of any acquisition by Charter Holdco or any of its affiliates, for which Vulcan
provides services, as well as reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred and indemnification. For the years ended December 31, 2001,
2000 and 1999, no fees were incurred with respect to these consulting services.
Because Charter Investment personnel became employees of Charter Holdco
effective January 1, 2001, Charter Investment no longer provides services
pursuant to the terms of the agreement.

Previous Management Agreement with Charter Investment

Prior to November 12, 1999, Charter Investment provided management and
consulting services to the Company’s operating subsidiaries for a fee equal to
3% of the gross revenues of the systems then owned, plus reimbursement of
expenses. The balance of management fees payable under the previous management
agreement was accrued with payment at the discretion of Charter Investment,
with interest payable on unpaid amounts. For the year ended December 31, 2001,
the Company’s subsidiaries did not pay any fees to Charter Investment to reduce
management fees payable. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, total management
fees payable to Charter Investment were $13.8 million and $13.8 million,
respectively, exclusive of any interest that may be charged.

Allocation of Business Opportunities with Mr. Allen

Mr. Allen and a number of his affiliates have interests in various
entities that provide services or programming to the Company’s subsidiaries.
Given the diverse nature of Mr. Allen’s investment activities and interests,
and to avoid the possibility of future disputes as to potential business, the
Company and Charter Holdco, under the terms of their respective organizational
documents, may not, and may not allow their subsidiaries to, engage in any
business transaction outside the cable transmission business except for the
digeo, inc. joint venture; the joint venture to develop a digital video
recorder set-top terminal; the investment in HSA; the investment in Cable
Sports Southeast, LLC, a provider of regional sports programming; as an owner
and operator of the business of Interactive Broadcaster Services Corporation
(Chat TV); an investment in @Security Broadband Corp., a company developing
broadband security applications; and incidental businesses engaged in as of the
closing of the Company’s initial public offering in November 1999. This
restriction will remain in effect until all of the shares of the Company’s
high-vote Class B common stock have been converted into shares of Class A
common stock due to Mr. Allen’s equity ownership falling below specified
thresholds.

Should the Company or Charter Holdco or any of their subsidiaries wish to
pursue, or allow their subsidiaries to pursue, a business transaction outside
of this scope, it must first offer Mr. Allen the opportunity to pursue the
particular business transaction. If he decides not to pursue the business
transaction and consents to the Company or its subsidiaries engaging in the
business transaction, they will be able to do so. In any such case, the
restated certificate of incorporation of the Company and the amended and
restated limited liability company agreement of Charter Holdco would be amended
accordingly to modify the current restrictions on the ability of such entities
to engage in any business other than the cable transmission business. The
cable transmission business means the business of transmitting video, audio,
including telephony, and data over cable television systems owned, operated or
managed by the Company, Charter Holdco or any of their subsidiaries from time
to time.

Under Delaware corporate law, each director of the Company, including Mr.
Allen, is generally required to present to the Company, any opportunity he or
she may have to acquire any cable transmission business or any company whose
principal business is the ownership, operation or management of cable
transmission businesses, so that the Company may determine whether it wishes to
pursue such opportunities. However, Mr. Allen and the other directors
generally will not have

F-30


an obligation to present other types of business opportunities to the
Company and they may exploit such opportunities for their own account.

As described in Note 2, the amended and restated
limited liability company agreement of Charter Holdco
contains certain provisions regarding the allocation of tax losses and profits
among its members, including Vulcan Cable III, Charter Investment and the
Company that may result in different tax consequences than would otherwise
occur if Charter Holdco had allocated profits and losses among its members
based generally on the number of common membership units.

Other Relationships

David L. McCall, Senior Vice President — Operations — Eastern Division, is
a partner in a partnership that leases office space to the Company. The
partnership received approximately $0.1 million, $0.1 million and $0.2 million
pursuant to such lease and related agreements for the years ended December 31,
2001, 2000 and 1999. In addition, approximately $0.6 million, $0.5 million and
$0.6 million was paid to a construction company controlled by Mr. McCall’s
brother and $0.5 million, $0.3 million and $0 to a construction company
controlled by Mr. McCall’s son for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and
1999, respectively.

Mr. Wood resigned as a director in December 2001. A company controlled by
Mr. Wood that owned an airplane reimbursed the Company for the full annual cost
of two individuals qualified to operate the plane, who were otherwise available
to the Company in connection with its own flight operations. For each of the
years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, Mr. Wood’s affiliate owed the
Company $0.1 million for annual compensation to the pilots. In addition, Mr.
Wood also used the Company’s airplane for occasional personal use in 2001, the
value of which was insignificant.

Additionally in 1999, one of Mr. Wood’s daughters, who resigned as a Vice
President of Charter Holdco in February 2002, received a bonus in the form of a
three-year promissory note bearing interest at 7% per year. One-third of the
original outstanding principal amount of the note and interest were forgiven as
long as she remained employed by Charter Holdco at the end of each of the first
three anniversaries of the issue date in February 1999. The amount of
principal and interest forgiven on this note for the years ended December 31,
2001 and 2000 was $0.1 million , and the outstanding balance on the note was
forgiven effective as of February 22, 2002. Another daughter of Mr. Wood
received approximately $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2001 for
event planning services performed by her company.

Companies controlled by Mr. Nathanson, a director of the Company, leased
certain office space in Pasadena, California, and warehouse space in Riverside,
California, to the Company’s subsidiaries. For the Pasadena office lease,
which the Company terminated in April 2001 in exchange for a payment of $0.6
million, aggregate rent of $0.2 million was paid for the period from January
1, 2001 to April 2001 and $0.4 million was paid during the year ended December
31, 2000. For the Riverside warehouse space, aggregate rent paid for each of
the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 was $0.2 million.

Business Relationships

Mr. Allen or his affiliates own equity interests or warrants to purchase
equity interests in various entities with which the Company does business or
which provides it with services or programming. Among these entities are
Wink Communications, Inc. (Wink),
TechTV Inc. (TechTV), USA Networks, Inc. (USA Networks), Oxygen Media
Corporation (Oxygen Media), digeo, inc., Microsoft Corporation and HSA. Mr.
Allen owns 100% of the equity of Vulcan Ventures Incorporated (Vulcan Ventures)
and Vulcan Inc. and is the president of Vulcan Ventures. Mr. Savoy is also a
vice president and a director of Vulcan Ventures. The various cable, Internet
and telephony companies in which Mr. Allen has invested may mutually benefit
one another. The agreements governing the Company’s relationship with digeo,
inc. are an example of a cooperative business relationship among his affiliated
companies. The Company can give no assurance, nor should you expect, that any
of these business relationships will be successful, that the Company will
realize any benefits from these relationships or that the Company will enter
into any business relationships in the future with Mr. Allen’s affiliated
companies.

Mr. Allen and his affiliates have made, and in the future likely will
make, numerous investments outside of the Company and its business. The
Company cannot assure that, in the event that the Company or any of its
subsidiaries enter into transactions in the future with any affiliate of Mr.
Allen, such transactions will be on terms as favorable to the Company as terms
it might have obtained from an unrelated third party. Also, conflicts could
arise with respect to the allocation of corporate opportunities between the Company and Mr. Allen

F-31


and his
affiliates. The Company has not instituted any formal plan or arrangement to
address potential conflicts of interest.

Vulcan Ventures

Vulcan Ventures, the Company, Charter Investment and Charter Holdco are
parties to an agreement dated September 21, 1999 regarding the right of Vulcan
Ventures to use up to eight of the Company’s digital cable channels in
consideration of a capital contribution of $1.325 billion that was received
during 1999. Specifically, the Company will provide Vulcan Ventures with
exclusive rights for carriage of up to eight digital cable television
programming services or channels on each of the digital cable television
systems with local, and to the extent available, national control of the
digital product owned, operated, controlled or managed by the Company or Charter Holdco now or in
the future of 550 megahertz or more. If the system offers digital services but
has less than 550 megahertz of capacity, then the programming services will be
equitably reduced. Upon request of Vulcan Ventures, the Company will attempt
to reach a comprehensive programming agreement pursuant to which it will pay
the programmer, if possible, a fee per digital subscriber. If such fee
arrangement is not achieved, then the Company and the programmer shall enter
into a standard programming agreement. As of December 31, 2001, Vulcan Ventures
did not use any channels.

High-Speed Access

HSA has been a provider of high-speed Internet access services over cable
modems. During the period from 1997 to 2000, certain Charter Communications
entities entered into Internet-access related service agreements, and both
Vulcan Ventures and certain of the Company’s subsidiaries made equity
investments in HSA.

On September 28, 2001, Charter Holdco and HSA entered into an asset
purchase agreement pursuant to which Charter Holdco agreed to purchase from HSA
the contracts and associated assets, and assume related liabilities, that serve
the Company’s customers, including a customer contact center, network
operations center and provisioning software. On December 20, 2001, Charter
Holdco assigned certain of its rights under the asset purchase agreement and
certain related agreements to its subsidiary, CC Systems, LLC. The transaction
closed in the first quarter of 2002. At the closing, CC Systems wired funds in
the amount of $77.5 million to HSA and delivered 37,000 shares of HSA’s Series
D convertible preferred stock and all of the warrants to buy HSA common stock
owned by Charter Holdco and HSA purchased 38,000 shares of its Series D
convertible preferred stock from Vulcan Ventures for $8.0 million. Charter
Holdco obtained a fairness opinion from a qualified investment-banking firm
regarding the valuation of the assets purchased by CC Systems pursuant to the
asset purchase agreement. Concurrent with the transaction closing, HSA
purchased all of the stock held by Vulcan Ventures, and certain of the
agreements between the Company’s subsidiaries and HSA, including the
programming content agreement, the services agreement, the systems access
agreement, the 1998 network services agreement and the May 2000 network
services agreement, each as described in more detail below, were terminated.
As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, the carrying value of Charter’s investment in HSA,
including warrants and preferred stock, was zero and $38.2 million, respectively.

On September 28, 2001, in connection with the asset purchase agreement
with HSA, Charter Holdco and HSA entered into a license agreement pursuant to
which Charter Holdco granted HSA the right to use certain intellectual property
to be sold by HSA to Charter Holdco. HSA does not pay any fees under the
agreement. The domestic portion of the license terminates on June 30, 2002,
and the international portion of the license will expire on February 2, 2005.
Concurrently with the license agreement, HSA and the Company entered into a
services agreement, pursuant to which the Company agreed to perform certain
management services formerly performed by HSA. This agreement terminated at
closing.

In 2001, Charter Holdco was a party to a systems access and investment
agreement with Vulcan Ventures and HSA and a related network services agreement
with HSA. These agreements provided HSA with exclusive access to at least
750,000 of the Company’s homes that had either an installed cable drop from the
Company’s cable system or that were eligible for a cable drop by virtue of the
Company’s cable system passing the home. The term of the network services
agreement was, as to a particular cable system, five years from the date
revenue billing commenced for that cable system. The programming content
agreement provided each of Vulcan Ventures and HSA with a license to use
certain content and materials of the other on a non-exclusive, royalty-free
basis. The revenues the Company earned from HSA for the years ended December
31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 were approximately $7.8 million,
$1.6 million and $0.2
million, respectively.

F-32


Additionally, Charter Holdco, as the assignee of Vulcan Ventures, held
warrants that were amended and restated on May 12, 2000, giving Charter Holdco
the right to purchase up to 12,000,000 shares of HSA common stock at an
exercise price of $3.23 per share. A portion of the warrants could be earned
under the agreements described above, and the other portion related to warrants
that could be earned under a network agreement entered into with HSA on May 12,
2000, described below. Warrants earned under the agreements described above
became vested at the time systems were committed by the Company and were based
upon the number of homes passed. Warrants under these agreements could only be
earned until July 31, 2003, and were earned at the rate of 1.55 shares of
common stock for each home passed in excess of 750,000. Warrants earned under
the agreements described above were exercisable until May 25, 2006. Such
warrants were subject to forfeiture in certain circumstances, generally if the
Company withdrew a committed system.

On May 12, 2000, the Company entered into a second network services
agreement with HSA, which was assigned by the Company to Charter Holdco on
August 1, 2000. Under the terms of the May 12, 2000 network services
agreement, the Company agreed to commit a total of 5,000,000 homes passed,
including all homes passed in systems previously committed by the Company, to
HSA (other than full turnkey systems), on or prior to May 12, 2003. With
respect to each system launched or intended to be launched, the Company paid a
per customer fee to HSA according to agreed pricing terms. In addition, the
Company will also compensate HSA for services that exceed certain minimum
thresholds. For the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, the Company
paid HSA approximately $12.9 million, $5.3 million and $1.1 million,
respectively, under this agreement and the 1998 network services agreement.

Warrants earned under the May 12, 2000 network services agreement vested
at the time the Company authorized HSA to proceed with respect to a system, and
were based upon the number of homes passed in such system. With respect to the
initial total 5,000,000 homes passed, the warrant provided that Charter Holdco
would have the right to purchase 0.775 shares of common stock for every home
passed. With respect to any additional homes passed in excess of 5,000,000,
the warrant provided that Charter Holdco would have the right to purchase 1.55
shares of common stock for every home passed. Warrants earned under the
agreement were exercisable until seven and a half years from the date they were
earned, and generally were not subject to forfeiture. HSA had agreed to
increase the number of shares of common stock subject to the amended and
restated warrant, upon Charter Holdco’s request, if the number of warrants
earned exceeded 11,500,000. The May 2000 network services agreement with HSA
had a term of five years starting in May 2000. All of the warrants earned
under the network services agreements described above, were cancelled in
connection with the closing of the asset purchase agreement.

On December 5, 2000, pursuant to a preferred stock purchase agreement
entered into as of October 19, 2000, one of the Company’s subsidiaries, Charter
Communications Ventures, LLC, and Vulcan Ventures purchased 37,000 shares and
38,000 shares, respectively, of Series D convertible preferred stock of HSA for
$37.0 million and $38.0 million, respectively. In connection with their
acquisition of the Series D convertible preferred stock, Charter Communications
Ventures and Vulcan Ventures were granted certain preemptive, first refusal,
registration and significant board representation rights as part of the
transaction. At the closing of the asset acquisition from HSA, CC Systems
delivered to HSA the 37,000 shares of Series D convertible preferred stock
acquired by Charter Communications Ventures and HSA purchased from Vulcan
Ventures its Series D convertible preferred stock.

Immediately prior to the acquisition from HSA, Vulcan Ventures owned
20,222,139 shares of common stock and 38,000 shares of Series D convertible
preferred stock of HSA, Charter Communications Ventures owned 37,000 shares of
Series D convertible preferred stock and Charter Holdco held warrants
convertible into 2,650,659 shares of common stock. If all shares of preferred
stock and warrants owned by affiliates of Mr. Allen were converted into common
stock, then Mr. Allen, through such affiliates, would have beneficially own
48.5% of the common stock of HSA as of January 23, 2002. All equity interests
in HSA held by Charter Communications Ventures, Vulcan Ventures and Charter
Holdco were cancelled, pursuant to the closing of the asset purchase agreement.

WorldGate/TVGateway

WorldGate Communications, Inc. (WorldGate) is a provider of
Internet access through cable systems. The
Company has an affiliation agreement with WorldGate for an initial term which
expires in November 2002. The agreement automatically renews for additional
successive two-year periods upon expiration of the initial five-year term,
unless terminated by either party for failure of the other party to perform any
of its obligations or undertakings required under the agreement. The Company
started offering WorldGate service in 1998. Pursuant to the agreement, the
Company agreed to deploy the WorldGate Internet access service within a portion of its cable systems and to install

F-33


the appropriate
headend equipment in all of its major markets in those systems. Major markets
for purposes of this agreement include those in which the Company has more than
25,000 customers. The Company incurs the cost for the installation of headend
equipment. In addition, to the extent the Company determines that it is
economically practical, it has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to
deploy such service in all non-major markets that are technically capable of
providing interactive pay-per-view service. When WorldGate has a telephone
return path service available, the Company will, if economically practical, use
all reasonable efforts to install the appropriate headend equipment and deploy
the WorldGate service in its remaining markets. The Company has also agreed to
market the WorldGate service within its market areas. The Company pays a
monthly subscriber access fee to WorldGate based on the number of subscribers
to the WorldGate service. The Company has the discretion to determine what
fees, if any, it will charge its subscribers for access to the WorldGate
service. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company paid WorldGate
approximately $1.7 million, consisting of $1.5 million for equipment purchases
and $0.2 million for subscriber access fees. The Company charged its
subscribers approximately $0.3 million for Internet access for the year ended
December 31, 2001. For the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company paid
WorldGate approximately $5.1 million, consisting of $5.0 million for equipment
purchases and $0.1 million for subscriber access fees. The Company charged its
subscribers approximately $0.4 million for Internet access for the year ended
December 31, 2000. For the year ended December 31, 1999, the Company paid
WorldGate approximately $0.8 million, primarily pertaining to the purchase of
equipment. The Company charged its subscribers approximately $0.3 million for
the year ended December 31, 1999.

On July 25, 2000, Charter Holdco entered into a joint venture, named
TVGateway, LLC, with WorldGate and several other cable operators to develop and
deploy a server-based interactive program guide. Charter Holdco initially
invested $850,000, providing it a 16.25% ownership interest in the joint
venture and through subsequent investments of $1.0 million and $3.0 million in
2000 and 2001, respectively, increased its ownership interest to 17.63% as of
December 31, 2001. Charter Holdco’s investment in TVGateway totaled
approximately $2.6 million as of December 31, 2001. For the first four years
after the formation of TVGateway, Charter Holdco will earn additional ownership
units, up to a maximum of 750,000 ownership units, as the interactive program
guide is deployed to the Company’s customers. In August 2000, Charter Holdco
purchased 31,211 shares of common stock of WorldGate at $16.02 per share for a
total purchase price of $500,000. As a result of this purchase, Charter Holdco
received a $125,000 credit from WorldGate against future equipment purchases
relating to the deployment of its service. Additionally, WorldGate granted
Charter Holdco warrants to purchase up to 500,000 shares of WorldGate common
stock for a period of seven years at a exercise price of $24.78. For a period
of three years from the date of closing, Charter Holdco will also be issued
warrants to purchase common stock of WorldGate based on the number of two-way
digital homes passed in the systems in which Charter Holdco has deployed
WorldGate service. As of December 31, 2001, Charter Holdco had earned 27,853
warrants, but has not yet received documentation evidencing them. The Company
holds additional warrants to purchase 263,353 shares of WorldGate common stock
for $10.65 per share, which expire on June 30, 2002. The Company also owns
107,554 shares of WorldGate common stock for which it paid a total of $1.5
million. As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, the carrying value of the Company's
investment in WorldGate was approximately $183,000 and $529,000, respectively,
and the carrying value of the Company's investment in TVGateway was
approximately $2.6 million and $1.1 million, respectively.

Wink offers an enhanced broadcasting system that adds interactivity and
electronic commerce opportunities to traditional programming and advertising.
Viewers can, among other things, find news, weather and sports information
on-demand and order products through use of a remote control.

Charter Holdco is party to a June 7, 2001 cable
affiliation agreement for a three year term with Wink, which was amended in October 2001 and in March 2002.
The agreement has three one year renewal options at our discretion. Pursuant to the agreement, Wink
granted the Company a non-exclusive license to use the Wink software to deliver
the enhanced broadcasting services to its cable systems. Charter Holdco agreed
to make commercially reasonable efforts to deploy the Wink services to three
million subscribers, for which it is eligible to receive a launch fee for
transactions generated by the Company’s customers. Wink has also agreed to
issue Charter Holdco one million shares of Wink common
stock subject to finalization of a grant agreement. As a result of
this stock grant, Charter Holdco will
have an equity ownership in Wink that exceeds 5%. Under the amended agreement we agreed to pay a fee for the license grant and Wink
agreed to purchase an advertising package during 2002 and 2003. At December 31, 2001, Vulcan Ventures had an approximate 2% equity
interest in Wink.

TechTV operates a cable television channel which broadcasts shows about
technology and the Internet. Pursuant to a carriage agreement terminating in
2008, TechTV has provided the Company with programming for broadcast via its
cable television systems. Carriage fee amounts per subscriber are determined
based on the percentage of subscribers in a particular system receiving the
services. These fees will be waived for systems with higher penetration levels
until December 31, 2003, and were waived for systems with lower penetration
levels through April 30, 2001. In certain circumstances, the Company is
entitled to a percentage of TechTV’s net product revenues from infomercials and
home shopping and attributed to their carriage of the service. Additionally,
the Company receives incentive payments for channel launches through December
31, 2003. TechTV may not offer its services to any other cable operator which

Purchase of Certain Enstar Limited Partnership Systems

On August 29, 2001, Interlink Communications Partners, LLC, Rifkin
Acquisition Partners, LLC and Charter Communications Entertainment I, LLC, each
an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Charter Holdings, entered into an
agreement to purchase substantially all of the assets of Enstar Income Program
II-2, L.P., Enstar Income Program II-1, L.P., Enstar Income Program IV-3, L.P.,
Enstar Income/Growth Program Six-A, L.P. and Enstar Cable of Macoupin County
and certain assets of Enstar IV/PBD Systems Venture. Enstar Communications
Corporation, a direct subsidiary of Charter Holdco, is the general partner of
the Enstar limited partnerships. The cash sale price of approximately $63.0
million, subject to certain closing adjustments, was the highest bid received
by the Enstar limited partnerships following a broadly-based solicitation
process. The Company expects the transaction will close in the first half of
2002.

On March 5, 2001, the Company finalized an exclusive carriage agreement
with digeo interactive, LLC, which will function as its television-based
Internet portal for an initial six-year period. In connection with the
execution of the carriage agreement on March 5, 2001, the Company’s wholly
owned subsidiary, Charter Communications Ventures, LLC, received an equity
interest in digeo funded by Vulcan Ventures Incorporated’s contribution of
approximately $21.2 million, which is subject to a priority return of capital
to Vulcan up to the amount so funded. Vulcan also agreed to make, through
January 24, 2004, certain additional contributions through Digeo Broadband
Holdings, LLC to acquire digeo equity in order to maintain Charter Venture’s
pro rata interest in digeo in the event of certain future digeo equity
financings by the founders of digeo. These additional equity interests will
also be subject to a priority return of capital to Vulcan up to the amount so
contributed. On September 27, 2001, the Company and digeo amended the March
2001 carriage agreement. Pursuant to the amendment, digeo will provide the
content for enhanced Wink interactive television services to the Company (the
“digeo™ Basic Service”). In order to provide the digeo Basic Services, digeo
sublicensed certain Wink technologies to the Company. The Company will share in

Leases

The Company leases certain facilities and equipment under noncancellable
operating leases. Leases and rental costs charged to expense for the years
ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, were $22.7 million, $14.2 million and

and $14.3 million, respectively.

Litigation

The Company is party to lawsuits and claims that arose in the ordinary
course of conducting its business. In the opinion of management, after
consulting with legal counsel, and taking into account recorded liabilities,
the outcome of these lawsuits and claims will not have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

Regulation in the Cable Industry

The operation of a cable system is extensively regulated by the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC), some state governments and most local
governments. The FCC has the authority to enforce its regulations through the
imposition of substantial fines, the issuance of cease and desist orders and/or
the imposition of other administrative sanctions, such as the revocation of FCC
licenses needed to operate certain transmission facilities used in connection
with cable operations. The 1996 Telecom Act altered the regulatory structure
governing the nation’s communications providers. It removed barriers to
competition in both the cable television market and the local telephone market.
Among other things, it reduced the scope of cable rate regulation and
encouraged additional competition in the video programming industry by allowing
local telephone companies to provide video programming in their own telephone
service areas.

The 1996 Telecom Act required the FCC to undertake a host of implementing
rulemakings. Moreover, Congress and the FCC have frequently revisited the
subject of cable regulation. Future legislative and regulatory changes could
adversely affect the Company’s operations.

The 1992 Cable Act permits certified local franchising authorities to
order refunds of basic service tier rates paid in the previous twelve-month
period determined to be in excess of the maximum permitted rates. During 2001
and 2000, the amounts refunded by the Company have been insignificant. The
Company may be required to refund additional amounts in the future.

21. Employee Benefit Plan

The Company’s employees may participate in the Charter Communications,
Inc. 401(k) Plan. Employees that qualify for participation can contribute up to
15% of their salary, on a pre-tax basis, subject to a maximum contribution
limit as determined by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company matches 50% of
the first 5% of participant contributions. The Company made contributions to
the 401(k) plan totaling $8.5 million, $6.1 million and $2.9 million for the
years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

22. New Accounting Standards

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.
141, “Business Combinations”, No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”
and No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.” SFAS No. 141
requires all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and was adopted by the
company on July 1, 2001. Adoption of SFAS No. 141 did not have a significant
impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets
are no longer subject to amortization over their useful lives, rather, they are
subject to at least annual assessments for impairment. Also, under SFAS Nos.
141 and 142, an intangible asset should be recognized if the benefit of the
intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights or if
the intangible asset can be sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged.
Such intangibles will be amortized over their useful lives. The Company
believes that substantially all franchises will qualify for indefinite life
treatment under the new standard. While the analysis, including the impairment
testing of franchises required under the new standard, is not complete, the
Company expects to stop amortizing franchise intangible assets that meet the
indefinite life treatment beginning January 1, 2002. The Company will test
these assets for impairment at least annually. Other than during any periods in
which the Company may record a charge for impairment, the Company expects that
the adoption of SFAS No. 142 will result in a reduced loss as a result of
reduced amortization expense. If the new standard had been in effect for 2001,
amortization expense would have been reduced by approximately $1.2 billion to
$1.3 billion.

Under SFAS No. 143, the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement
obligation is required to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred
if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset
retirement costs are

F-38


capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. SFAS No.
143 will be implemented by the Company on January 1, 2002. Adoption of SFAS No.
143 will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of
the Company.

In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.
144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” SFAS No.
144 addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of
long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to be disposed of and supersedes
SFAS No. 121, “Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of.” SFAS No. 144 establishes a single
accounting model for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale and resolves
implementation issues related to SFAS No. 121. SFAS No. 144 will be implemented
by the Company on January 1, 2002. Adoption of SFAS No. 144 will not have a
material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

25. Subsequent Events

In January 2002, Charter Holdings and Charter Capital issued senior notes
with an aggregate principal amount at maturity of $1.1 billion. The January
2002 Charter Holdings notes are comprised of $350.0 million 9.625% senior notes
due 2009, $300.0 million 10.000% senior notes due 2011, and $450.0 principal
amount at maturity of 12.125% senior discount notes due 2012. The net proceeds
of approximately $872.8 million, were used to repay a portion of the amounts
outstanding under the revolving credit facilities of the Company’s
subsidiaries.
