Introduction

Charter
      Communications, Inc. ("Charter") is a broadband communications company operating
      in the United States, with approximately 6.16 million customers at December
      31,
      2005. Through our broadband network of coaxial and fiber optic cable, we offer
      our customers traditional cable video programming (analog and digital, which
      we
      refer to as "video" service), high-speed Internet access, advanced broadband
      cable services (such as video on demand ("VOD"), high definition television
      service and interactive television) and, in some of our markets, telephone
      service. See

"

for
      further description of these terms, including

"

customers.

"

At
      December 31, 2005, we served approximately 5.88 million analog video customers,
      of which approximately 2.80 million were also digital video customers. We also
      served approximately 2.20 million high-speed Internet customers (including
      approximately 253,400 who received only high-speed Internet services). We also
      provided telephone service to approximately 121,500 customers (including
      approximately 19,300 who received telephone service only.)

At
      December 31, 2005, our investment in cable properties, long-term debt,
      accumulated deficit and total shareholders’ deficit were $15.7 billion, $19.4
      billion, $10.2 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively. Our working capital
      deficit was $864 million at December 31, 2005. For the year ended
      December 31, 2005, our revenues, net loss applicable to common stock and
      loss per common share were approximately $5.3 billion, $970 million and $3.13,
      respectively.

We
      have a
      history of net losses. Further, we expect to continue to report net losses
      for
      the foreseeable future. Our net losses are principally attributable to
      insufficient revenue to cover the interest costs we incur because of our high
      level of debt, the depreciation expenses that we incur resulting from the
      capital investments we have made in our cable properties, and the impairment
      of
      our franchise intangibles. We expect that these expenses (other than impairment
      of franchises) will remain significant, and we therefore expect to continue
      to
      report net losses for the foreseeable future. Historically, a portion of the
      losses were allocated to minority interest. However, at December 31, 2003,
      the
      minority interest in Charter Communications Holding Company, LLC ("Charter
      Holdco") had been substantially eliminated by these loss allocations. Beginning
      in 2004, we absorb substantially all future losses before income taxes that
      otherwise would have been allocated to minority interest. Under our existing
      capital structure, future losses will continue to be absorbed by Charter. The
      remaining minority interest relates to CC VIII, LLC ("CC VIII") and the
      related profit and loss allocations for these interests have not had a
      significant impact on our statement of operations nor are they expected to
      have
      a significant impact in the future.

Charter
      was organized as a Delaware corporation in 1999 and completed an initial public
      offering of its Class A common stock in November 1999. Charter is a holding
      company whose principal assets are, for accounting purposes, an approximate
      48%
      equity interest and a 100% voting interest in Charter Holdco, the direct parent
      of CCHC, LLC, which is the direct parent of Charter Communications Holdings,
      LLC
      ("Charter Holdings"). Charter also holds certain preferred equity and
      indebtedness of Charter Holdco that mirror the terms of securities issued by
      Charter. Charter's only business is to act as the sole manager of Charter Holdco
      and its subsidiaries. As sole manager, Charter controls the affairs of Charter
      Holdco and most of its subsidiaries. Certain of our subsidiaries commenced
      operations under the "Charter Communications" name in 1994, and our growth
      through 2001 was primarily due to acquisitions and business combinations. We
      do
      not expect to make any significant acquisitions in the foreseeable future,
      but
      plan to evaluate opportunities to consolidate our operations through exchanges
      of cable systems with other cable operators, as they arise. We may also sell
      certain assets from time to time. Paul G. Allen owns 45% of Charter Holdco
      through affiliated entities. His membership units are convertible at any time
      for shares of our Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. Paul G. Allen
      controls Charter with an as-converted common equity interest of approximately
      49% and a voting control interest of 90% as of December 31, 2005.

Our
      principal executive offices are located at Charter Plaza, 12405 Powerscourt
      Drive, St. Louis, Missouri 63131. Our telephone number is (314) 965-0555 and
      we
      have a website accessible at www.charter.com. Since January 1, 2002, our
      annual reports, quarterly reports and current reports on Form 8-K, and all
      amendments thereto, have been made available on our website free of charge
      as
      soon as reasonably practicable after they have been filed. The information
      posted on our website is not incorporated into this annual report.


Certain
      Significant Developments in 2005 and 2006

We
      continue to pursue opportunities to improve our liquidity.

Our
      efforts in this regard have resulted in the completion of a number of financing
      transactions in 2005 and 2006, as follows:

·

the
                January 2006 sale by our subsidiaries, CCH II, LLC ("CCH II") and
                CCH II
                Capital Corp., of an additional $450 million principal amount of
                their
                10.250% senior notes due 2010;

the
                October 2005 entry by our subsidiaries, CCO Holdings, LLC ("CCO Holdings")
                and CCO Holdings Capital Corp., as guarantor thereunder, into a $600
                million senior bridge loan agreement with various lenders (which
                was
                reduced to $435 million as a result of the issuance of CCH II
                notes);

·

the
                September 2005 exchange by Charter Holdings, CCH I, LLC ("CCH I")
                and CCH
                I Holdings, LLC ("CIH") of approximately $6.8 billion in total principal
                amount of outstanding debt securities of Charter Holdings in a private
                placement for new debt securities;

·

the
                August 2005 sale by our subsidiaries, CCO Holdings and CCO Holdings
                Capital Corp., of $300 million of 8 ¾% senior notes due
                2013;

·

the
                March and June 2005 issuance of $333 million of Charter Communications
                Operating, LLC ("Charter Operating") notes in exchange for $346 million
                of
                Charter Holdings notes;

·

the
                repurchase during 2005 of $136 million of Charter’s 4.75% convertible
                senior notes due 2006 leaving $20 million in principal amount outstanding;
                and

·

the
                March 2005 redemption of all of CC V Holdings, LLC’s outstanding 11.875%
                senior discount notes due 2008 at a total cost of $122
                million.

Recent
      Events

Asset
      Sales

On
        February 28, 2006, Charter announced the signing of two separate definitive
        agreements to sell certain cable television systems serving a total of
        approximately 316,000 analog video customers, including 142,000 digital video
        customers and 91,000 high-speed Internet customers in West Virginia, Virginia,
        Illinois and Kentucky for a total of approximately $896 million. The closings
        of
        these transactions are expected to occur in the third quarter of 2006.

Under
        the
        terms of the bridge loan, bridge availability will be reduced by the proceeds
        of
        asset sales.

Appointment
      of New Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Jeffrey
      T. Fisher, 43, has been appointed to the position of Executive Vice President
      and Chief Financial Officer, effective February 6, 2006. Mr. Fisher succeeds
      the
      Interim Chief Financial Officer, Paul E. Martin, who has indicated his intention
      to continue as Charter’s Senior Vice President, Principal Accounting Officer and
      Corporate Controller until at least March 31, 2006.

CCH
      II, LLC Note Offering

On
      January 30, 2006, CCH II and CCH II Capital Corp. issued an additional $450
      million principal amount of their 10.250% senior notes due 2010, the proceeds
      of
      which will be provided, directly or indirectly, to Charter Operating, which
      will
      use such funds to reduce borrowings, but not commitments, under the revolving
      portion of its credit facilities. As a result of the offering of these notes,
      availability under the bridge loan has been reduced to $435 million.

Consummation
      of Share Borrow Transaction

On
      February 9, 2006, we issued 22.0 million shares of Class A common stock in
      a
      public offering. The shares were issued pursuant to a share lending agreement
      pursuant to which we had previously agreed to loan up to 150 million shares
      to
      Citigroup Global Markets Limited ("CGML"). To date, 116.9 million shares have
      been sold in share borrow transactions. Because less than the full 150 million
      shares covered by the share lending agreement were sold in the prior share
      borrow transactions, we remain obligated to issue, at CGML’s request, up to an
      additional 33.1 million loaned shares in up to two additional subsequent
      registered public offerings pursuant to the share lending
      agreement.

These
      transactions were conducted to facilitate transactions by which investors in
      Charter’s 5.875% convertible senior notes due 2009 issued on November 22, 2004,
      hedged their investments in those convertible senior notes.


Charter
      did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares in the share borrow
      transactions. However, under the share lending agreement, Charter received
      a
      loan fee of $.001 for each share that it lent to CGML.

Focus
      for



Our
      strategy is to leverage the capacity and the capabilities of our broadband
      network to become the premier provider of in-home entertainment and
      communications services in the communities we serve. By offering excellent
      value
      and variety to our customers through creative product bundles, strategic pricing
      and packaging of all our products and services, our goal is to increase
      profitable revenues that will enable us to maximize return on our invested
      capital.

Building
      on the foundation established throughout 2005, in 2006, we will strive
      toward:

·

improving
                the end-to-end customer experience and increasing customer
                loyalty;

·

growing
                sales and retention for all our products and services;
                and

·

driving
                operating and capital
                effectiveness.

The
      Customer Experience

Providing
      superior customer service is an essential element of our fundamental business
      strategy. We strive to continually improve the end-to-end customer experience
      and increase customer loyalty by effectively managing our customer care contact
      centers in alignment with technical operations. We are seeking to instill a
      customer-service-oriented culture throughout the organization and will continue
      to focus on excellence by pursuing further improvements in customer service,
      technical operations, sales and marketing.

We
      are
      dedicated to fostering strong relationships and making not only financial
      investments, but the investment of time and effort to strengthen the communities
      we serve. We have developed programs and initiatives that provide valuable
      television time to groups and organizations over our cable
      networks.

Sales
      and Retention

Providing
      desirable products and services and investing in profitable marketing programs
      are major components of our sales strategy.  Bundling services, combining
      two or more Charter services for one discounted price, is fundamental to our
      marketing strategy.  We believe that combining our products into bundled
      offerings provides value to our customers that distinguishes us from the
      competition.  We believe bundled offerings increase penetration of all our
      products and services and improves customer retention and perception. Through
      targeted marketing of bundled services, we will pursue growth in our customer
      base and improvements in customer satisfaction. Targeted marketing also promotes
      the appropriate matching of services with customer needs leading to improved
      retention of existing customers and lower bad debt expense.

Expanding
      telephone service to additional markets and achieving increased telephone
      service penetration will be a high priority in 2006 and will be important to
      revenue growth. We plan to add enhancements to our high-speed Internet service
      to provide customers the best possible Internet experience. Our digital video
      platform enables us to provide customers advanced video products and services
      such as VOD, high-definition television and digital video recorder ("DVR")
      service. We will also continue to explore additional product and service
      offerings to complement and enhance our existing offerings and generate
      profitable revenue growth.

In
      addition to the focus on our primary residential customer base, we will strive
      to expand the marketing of our video and high-speed Internet services to the
      business community and introduce telephone service, which we believe has growth
      potential.

Operating
      and Capital Effectiveness

We
      plan
      to further capitalize on initiatives launched during 2005 to continue to drive
      operating and capital effectiveness. Specifically, additional improvements
      in
      work force management will enhance the efficient operation of our customer
      care
      centers and technical operations functions. We will continue to place the
      highest priority for capital spending on revenue-generating initiatives such
      as
      telephone deployment.


With
      over
      92% of our homes passed having bandwidth of 550 megahertz or higher, we believe
      our broadband network provides the infrastructure to deliver the products and
      services today’s consumer desires. See " - Our Network Technology." In 2005 we
      invested in programs and initiatives to improve all aspects of operations,
      and
      going forward we will seek to capitalize on that solid foundation. We plan
      to
      leverage both our broadband network and prior investments in operational
      efficiencies to generate profitable revenue growth.

Through
      our targeted marketing strategy, we plan to meet the needs of our current
      customers and potential customers with desirable, value-based offerings. We
      will
      seek to capitalize on the capabilities of our broadband network in order to
      bring innovative products and services to the marketplace.  Our employees
      are dedicated to Charter’s customer-first philosophy, and we will strive to
      support their continued professional growth and development, providing the
      right
      tools and training necessary to accomplish our goals. We believe our strategy
      differentiates us from the competition and plan to enhance our ability to
      continue to grow our broadband operations in the communities we serve.


Organizational
      Structure

The
      chart
      below sets forth our organizational structure and that of our direct and
      indirect subsidiaries. This chart does not include all of our affiliates and
      subsidiaries and, in some cases, we have combined separate entities for
      presentation purposes. The equity ownership, voting percentages and indebtedness
      amounts shown below are approximations as of December 31, 2005 giving effect
      to
      the issuance and sale of $450 million principal amount of 10.250% CCH II notes
      in January 2006 and the use of such proceeds to pay down credit facilities
      and
      the issuance of 22.0 million shares on February 6, 2006 and do not give effect
      to any exercise, conversion or exchange of then outstanding options, preferred
      stock, convertible notes and other convertible or exchangeable securities.


Charter
      Communications, Inc.

Certain
      provisions of Charter’s certificate of incorporation and Charter Holdco’s
      limited liability company agreement effectively require that Charter’s
      investment in Charter Holdco replicate, on a "mirror" basis, Charter’s
      outstanding equity and debt structure. As a result of these coordinating
      provisions, whenever Charter issues equity or debt, Charter transfers the
      proceeds from such issuance to Charter Holdco, and Charter Holdco issues a
      "mirror" security to Charter that replicates the characteristics of the security
      issued by Charter. Consequently, Charter’s principal assets, for accounting
      purposes, are an approximate 48% common equity interest and a 100% voting
      interest in Charter Holdco, "mirror" notes that are payable by Charter Holdco
      to
      Charter that have the same principal amount and terms as Charter’s convertible
      senior notes and preferred units in Charter Holdco that mirror the terms and
      liquidation preferences of Charter’s outstanding preferred stock. Charter
      Holdco, through its subsidiaries, owns cable systems and certain strategic
      investments. As sole manager under applicable operating agreements, Charter
      controls the affairs of Charter Holdco and most of its subsidiaries. In
      addition, Charter also provides management services to Charter Holdco and its
      subsidiaries under a management services agreement.


The
      following table sets forth information as of December 31, 2005 with respect
      to
      the shares of common stock of Charter on an actual outstanding, "as converted"

Products
      and Services

We
      offer
      our customers traditional cable video programming (analog and digital) and
      in
      some areas advanced broadband services such as high definition television,
      VOD
      and interactive television as well as high-speed Internet services. We sell
      our
      video programming and high-speed Internet services on a subscription basis,
      with
      prices and related charges, that vary primarily based on the types of service
      selected, whether the services are sold as a "bundle" versus on an "à la carte"
      basis, and the equipment necessary to receive the services, with some variation
      in prices depending on geographic location. In addition, we offer telephone
      service to a portion of our homes passed.

The
      following table summarizes our customer statistics for analog and digital video,
      residential high-speed Internet and residential telephone approximate as of
      December 31, 2005 and 2004.


Non-Video
                Cable Services:

Residential
                high-speed Internet customers (e)

2,196,400

1,884,400

Residential
                telephone customers (f)

45,400

Included
      in the 107,000 net loss of analog video customers for the year ended December
      31, 2005 is approximately 8,200 of net losses related to systems impacted by
      hurricanes Katrina and Rita. We currently estimate additional analog video
      customer losses of approximately 10,000 to 15,000 related to hurricanes Katrina
      and Rita in the first quarter of 2006.

After
      giving effect to the sale of certain non-strategic cable systems in July 2005,
      December 31, 2004 analog video customers, digital video customers and high-speed
      Internet customers would have been 5,964,300, 2,663,200 and 1,883,800,
      respectively.

(a)

"Customers"
                include all persons our corporate billing records show as receiving
                service (regardless of their payment status), except for complimentary
                accounts (such as our employees). In addition, at December 31, 2005
                and
                2004, "customers" include approximately 50,500 and 44,700 persons
                whose
                accounts were over 60 days past due in payment, approximately 14,300
                and
                5,200 persons, whose accounts were over 90 days past due in payment
                and
                approximately 7,400 and 2,300 of which were over 120 days past due
                in
                payment, respectively

.

(b)

"Analog
                video customers" include all customers who receive video services
                (including those who also purchase high-speed Internet and telephone
                services) but excludes approximately 272,700 and 228,700 customers
                at
                December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, who receive high-speed
                Internet
                service only or telephone service only and who are only counted as
                high-speed Internet customers or telephone
                customers.

(c)

Included
                within "video customers" are those in commercial and multi-dwelling
                structures, which are calculated on an equivalent bulk unit ("EBU")
                basis.
                EBU is calculated for a system by dividing the bulk price charged
                to
                accounts in an area by the most prevalent price charged to non-bulk
                residential customers in that market for the comparable tier of service.
                The EBU method of estimating analog video customers is consistent
                with the
                methodology used in determining costs paid to programmers and has
                been
                used consistently. As we increase our effective analog video prices
                to
                residential customers without a corresponding increase in the prices
                charged to commercial service or multi-dwelling customers, our EBU
                count
                will decline even if there is no real loss in commercial service
                or
                multi-dwelling customers.

(d)

"Digital
                video customers" include all households that have one or more digital
                set-top terminals. Included in "digital video customers" on December
                31,
                2005 and 2004 are approximately 8,600 and 10,100 customers, respectively,
                that receive digital video service directly through satellite
                transmission.

(e)

"Residential
                high-speed Internet customers" represent those customers who subscribe
                to
                our high-speed Internet service.

(f)

"Residential
                telephone customers" include all households receiving telephone service.

Video
      Services

Our
      video
      service offerings include the following:


High-Speed
      Internet Services

We
      offer
      high-speed Internet services to our residential and commercial customers
      primarily via cable modems attached to personal computers. We generally offer
      our high-speed Internet service as Charter High-Speed Internet

TM

.
      We also
      offer traditional dial-up Internet access in a very limited number of our
      markets.

We
      ended
      2005 with 20% penetration of high-speed Internet homes passed, up from the
      18%
      penetration of high-speed Internet homes passed at year-end 2004. This gave
      us
      an annual percentage increase in high-speed Internet customers of 17% and an
      increase in high-speed Internet revenues of 23% in the year ended December
      31,
      2005.

Telephone
      Services

We
      provide voice communications services using voice over Internet protocol, or
      "VoIP", to transmit digital voice signals over our systems. At December 31,
      2005, telephone service was available to approximately 2.9 million homes passed,
      and we were marketing to approximately 77% of those homes. We will continue
      to
      prepare additional markets for telephone launches in 2006 and expect to have
      to 8 million homes passed by the end of 2006.

Commercial
      Services

We
      offer
      integrated network solutions to commercial and institutional customers. These
      solutions include high-speed Internet and video services. In addition, we offer
      high-speed Internet services to small businesses. We will continue to expand
      the
      marketing of our video and high-speed Internet services to the business
      community and intend to introduce telephone services.

Sale
      of Advertising

We
      receive revenues from the sale of local advertising on satellite-delivered
      networks such as MTV®, CNN® and ESPN®. In any particular market, we generally
      insert local advertising on up to 48 channels. We also provide cross-channel
      advertising to some programmers.

From
      time
      to time, certain of our vendors, including programmers and equipment vendors,
      have purchased advertising from us. For the years ending December 31, 2005,
      and 2003, we had advertising revenues from


programmers
      of approximately $15 million, $16 million, and $15 million, respectively. These
      revenues resulted from purchases at market rates pursuant to binding agreements.

Pricing
      of Our Products and Services

Our
      revenues are derived principally from the monthly fees our customers pay for
      the
      services we offer. A one-time installation fee, which is sometimes waived or
      discounted during certain promotional periods, is charged to new customers.
      The
      prices we charge vary based on the level of service the customer chooses and
      the
      geographic market. Most of our pricing is reviewed and adjusted on an annual
      basis.

In
      accordance with the Federal Communications Commission’s ("FCC") rules, the
      prices we charge for cable-related equipment, such as set-top terminals and
      remote control devices, and for installation services are based on actual costs
      plus a permitted rate of return.

Although
      our cable service offerings vary across the markets we serve because of various
      factors including competition and regulatory factors, our services, when offered
      on a stand-alone basis, are typically offered at monthly price ranges, excluding
      franchise fees and other taxes, as follows:

      during promotional periods in order to attract new customers. There is no
      assurance that these customers will remain as customers when the period of
      free
      service expires.

Our
      Network Technology

The
      following table sets forth the technological capacity of our systems as of
      December 31, 2005 based on a percentage of homes passed:

Approximately
      92% of our homes passed are served by systems that have bandwidth of 550
      megahertz or greater. This bandwidth capacity enables us to offer digital
      television, high-speed Internet services and other advanced services. It also
      enables us to offer up to 82 analog channels, and even more channels when our
      bandwidth is used for digital signal transmissions. Our increased bandwidth
      also
      permits two-way communication for Internet access, interactive services, and
      telephone services.

We
      have
      reduced the number of headends that serve our customers from 1,138 at
      January 1, 2001 to 720 at December 31, 2005. Because headends are the
      control centers of a cable system, where incoming signals are amplified,
      converted, processed and combined for transmission to the customer, reducing
      the
      number of headends reduces related equipment, service personnel and maintenance
      expenditures. We believe that the headend consolidation, together with our
      other
      upgrades, allows us to provide enhanced picture quality and greater system
      reliability. As of December 31, 2005, approximately 86% of our customers were
      served by headends serving at least 10,000 customers.


As
      of
      December 31, 2005, our cable systems consisted of approximately 222,100
      strand miles, including approximately 58,200 strand miles of fiber optic cable,
      passing approximately 12.5 million households and served approximately 6.2
      million customers.

We
      adopted the hybrid fiber coaxial cable ("HFC") architecture as the standard
      for
      our systems upgrades. HFC architecture combines the use of fiber optic cable
      with coaxial cable. Fiber optic cable is a communication medium that uses glass
      fibers to transmit signals over long distances with minimum signal loss or
      distortion. Fiber optic cable has excellent broadband frequency characteristics,
      noise immunity and physical durability and can carry hundreds of video, data
      and
      voice channels over extended distances. Coaxial cable is less expensive but
      requires a more extensive signal amplification in order to obtain the desired
      transmission levels for delivering channels. In most systems, we deliver our
      signals via fiber optic cable from the headend to a group of nodes, and use
      coaxial cable to deliver the signal from individual nodes to the homes passed
      served by that node. Our system design enables a maximum of 500 homes passed
      to
      be served by a single node. Currently, our average node serves approximately
      homes passed. Our system design provides for six strands of fiber to each node,
      with two strands activated and four strands reserved for spares and future
      services. We believe that this hybrid network design provides high capacity
      and
      superior signal quality. The design also provides reserve capacity for the
      addition of future services.

The
      primary advantages of HFC architecture over traditional coaxial-only cable
      networks include:

We
      currently maintain a national network operations center to monitor our data
      networks and to further our strategy of providing high quality service.
      Centralized monitoring is increasingly important as we increase the number
      of
      high-speed Internet customers utilizing two-way high-speed Internet service.
      Our
      local dispatch centers focus primarily on monitoring the HFC plant.

Management
      of Our Systems

Many
      of
      the functions associated with our financial and administrative management are
      centralized, including accounting, cash management, billing, finance and
      acquisitions, payroll, accounts payable and benefits administration, information
      system design and support, internal audit, purchasing, customer care, marketing,
      programming contract administration and Internet service, network and circuits
      administration. We operate with four divisions. Each division is supported
      by
      operational, financial, customer care, marketing and engineering functions.

Customer
      Care

Our
      customer care centers are managed centrally by Corporate Vice Presidents of
      Customer Care. This team oversees and administers the deployment and execution
      of care strategies and initiatives on a company-wide basis. We have 36 customer
      service locations, including 14 regional contact centers that serve
      approximately 97% of our customers. This reflects a substantial consolidation
      of
      our customer care facilities. We believe that this consolidation will continue
      to allow us to improve the consistency of our service delivery and customer
      satisfaction.

Specifically,
      through this consolidation, we are now able to service our customers 24 hours
      a
      day, seven days a week and utilize technologically advanced equipment that
      we
      believe enhances interactions with our customers through more intelligent call
      routing, data management, and forecasting and scheduling capabilities. We
      believe this consolidation also allows us to more effectively provide our
      customer care specialists with ongoing training intended to improve complaint
      resolution, equipment troubleshooting, sales of new and additional services,
      and
      customer retention.

We
      believe that, despite our consolidation, we still need to make improvements
      in
      the area of customer care, and that this has, in part, led to a continued loss
      of customers. Accordingly, we have begun an internal operational improvement
      initiative aimed at helping us gain new customers and retain existing customers,
      which is focused on customer care, among other areas. We have increased our
      efforts to focus management attention on instilling


a
      customer service oriented culture throughout the company and to give those
      areas
      of our operations increased priority of resources for staffing levels, training
      budgets and financial incentives for employee performance in those
      areas.

In
      a
      further effort to better serve our customers, we have also entered into
      outsource partnership agreements with two outsource providers. We believe the
      establishment of these relationships expands our ability to achieve our service
      objectives and increases our ability to support marketing activities by
      providing additional capacity available to support customer
      inquiries.

We
      also
      utilize our website to enhance customer care by enabling customers to view
      and
      pay their bills online, obtain useful information and perform various equipment
      troubleshooting procedures. We also offer chat and email functionality on-line
      to our customers.

Sales
      and Marketing

Our
      marketing infrastructure is intended to promote interaction, information flow
      and sharing of best practices between our corporate office and our field
      offices, which make local decisions as to when and how marketing programs will
      be implemented. In 2005, our primary strategic direction was focused on
      eliminating aggressive promotional pricing and implementing targeted marketing
      programs designed to offer the optimal combination of products to the most
      appropriate consumers to accelerate the growth of profitable
      revenues.

In
      2005,
      we increased our targeted marketing efforts and related expenditures, the
      long-term objective of which is to increase revenues through deeper market
      penetration of all of our services. Marketing expenditures increased 19% over
      the year ended December 31, 2004 to $145 million for the year ended December
      31,
      2005. We will continue to invest in targeted marketing efforts in 2006.

We
      monitor customer perception, competition, pricing and product preferences,
      among
      other factors, to increase our responsiveness to our customers. Our coordinated
      marketing strategies include door-to-door solicitation, telemarketing, media
      advertising, e-marketing, direct mail solicitation and retail locations. In
      2005, we increased our focus on marketing and selling our services through
      consumer electronics retailers and other retailers that sell televisions or
      cable modems.

Programming

General

We
      believe that offering a wide variety of programming is an important factor
      that
      influences a customer’s decision to subscribe to and retain our cable services.
      We rely on market research, customer demographics and local programming
      preferences to determine channel offerings in each of our markets. We obtain
      basic and premium programming from a number of suppliers, usually pursuant
      to a
      written contract. Our programming contracts generally continue for a fixed
      period of time, usually from three to ten years, and are subject to negotiated
      renewal. Some program suppliers offer financial incentives to support the launch
      of a channel and/or ongoing marketing support. We also negotiate volume discount
      pricing structures. Programming costs are usually payable each month based
      on
      calculations performed by us and are subject to audits by the programmers.

Costs

Programming
      is usually made available to us for a license fee, which is generally paid
      based
      on the number of customers to whom we make such programming available. Such
      license fees may include "volume" discounts available for higher numbers of
      customers, as well as discounts for channel placement or service penetration.
      Some channels are available without cost to us for a limited period of time,
      after which we pay for the programming. For home shopping channels, we receive
      a
      percentage of the revenue attributable to our customers’ purchases.

Our
      cable
      programming costs have increased, in every year we have operated, in excess
      of
      customary inflationary and cost-of-living type increases. We expect them to
      continue to increase due to a variety of factors, including annual increases
      imposed by programmers and additional programming being provided to customers
      as
      a result of system rebuilds and bandwidth reallocation, both of which increase
      channel capacity. In particular, sports programming costs have increased
      significantly over the past several years. In addition, contracts to purchase
      sports


programming
      sometimes provide for optional additional programming to be available on a
      surcharge basis during the term of the contract.

Over
      the
      past several years, we have not been able to increase prices sufficiently to
      offset increased programming costs and with the impact of competition and other
      marketplace factors, we will not be able to do so in the foreseeable future.
      In
      order to maintain or mitigate reductions of margins despite increasing
      programming costs, we plan to continue to migrate certain program services
      from
      our analog level of service to our digital tiers. As we migrate our programming
      to our digital tier packages, certain programming that was previously available
      to all of our customers via an analog signal, may be part of an elective digital
      tier package. As a result, the customer base upon which we pay programming
      fees
      will proportionately decrease, and the overall expense for providing that
      service would likewise decrease. Reductions in the size of certain programming
      customer bases may result in the loss of specific volume discount benefits.

As
      measured by programming costs, and excluding premium services (substantially
      all
      of which were renegotiated and renewed in 2003), as of December 31, 2005
      approximately 15% of our current programming contracts were expired, and
      approximately another 4% are scheduled to expire by the end of 2006.

We
      plan
      to seek to renegotiate the terms of our agreements with certain programmers
      as
      these agreements come due for renewal.

There
      can
      be no assurance that these agreements will be renewed on favorable or comparable
      terms. To the extent that we are unable to reach agreement with certain
      programmers on terms that we believe are reasonable, we may be forced to remove
      such programming channels from our line-up, which may result in a loss of
      customers. In addition, our

inability
      to fully pass these programming cost increases on to our customers has had
      an
      adverse impact on our cash flow and operating margins.

Franchises

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, our systems operated pursuant to a total of
      approximately 4,100 franchises, permits and similar authorizations issued by
      local and state governmental authorities. Each franchise, permit or similar
      authorization is awarded by a governmental authority and such governmental
      authority often must approve a transfer to another party. Most franchises are
      subject to termination proceedings in the event of a material breach. In
      addition, most franchises require us to pay the granting authority a franchise
      fee of up to 5.0% of revenues as defined in the various agreements, which is
      the
      maximum amount that may be charged under the applicable federal law. We are
      entitled to and generally do pass this fee through to the customer.

Prior
      to
      the scheduled expiration of most franchises, we initiate renewal proceedings
      with the granting authorities. This process usually takes three years but can
      take a longer period of time. The Communications Act of 1934, as amended ("the
      Communications Act"), which is the primary federal statute regulating interstate
      communications, provides for an orderly franchise renewal process in which
      granting authorities may not unreasonably withhold renewals. In connection
      with
      the franchise renewal process, many governmental authorities require the cable
      operator to make certain commitments. Historically we have been able to renew
      our franchises without incurring significant costs, although any particular
      franchise may not be renewed on commercially favorable terms or otherwise.
      Our
      failure to obtain renewals of our franchises, especially those in the major
      metropolitan areas where we have the most customers, could have a material
      adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations
      or
      our liquidity, including our ability to comply with our debt covenants.
      Approximately 11% of our franchises, covering approximately 13% of our analog
      video customers were expired at December 31, 2005. Approximately 7% of
      additional franchises, covering approximately 9% of additional analog video
      customers will expire on or before December 31, 2006, if not renewed prior
      to
      expiration. We expect to renew substantially all of these
      franchises.

Different
      legislative proposals have been introduced in the United States Congress and
      in
      some state legislatures that would greatly streamline cable franchising. This
      legislation is intended to facilitate entry by new competitors, particularly
      local telephone companies. Such legislation has already passed in at least
      one
      state but is now subject to court challenge. Although various legislative
      proposals provide some regulatory relief for incumbent cable operators, these
      proposals are generally viewed as being more favorable to new entrants due
      to a
      number of varying factors including efforts to withhold streamlined cable
      franchising from incumbents until after the expiration of their existing
      franchises and the potential for new entrants to serve only higher-income areas
      of a particular community. To the extent incumbent cable operators are not
      able
      to avail themselves of this streamlined franchising process, such operators
      may
      continue to be subject to more onerous franchise requirements at the local
      level
      than new entrants. The FCC recently initiated a proceeding to determine whether
      local franchising authorities are impeding the deployment of competitive cable
      services through unreasonable franchising requirements and whether any such


impediments
      should be preempted. At this time, we are not able to determine what impact
      such
      proceeding may have on us.

Competition

We
      face
      competition in the areas of price, service offerings, and service reliability.
      We compete with other providers of television signals and other sources of
      home
      entertainment. In addition, as we continue to expand into additional services
      such as high-speed Internet access and telephone, we face competition from
      other
      providers of each type of service. We operate in a very competitive business
      environment, which can adversely affect our business and operations.

In
      terms
      of competition for customers, we view ourselves as a member of the broadband
      communications industry, which encompasses multi-channel video for television
      and related broadband services, such as high-speed Internet, telephone and
      other
      interactive video services. In the broadband industry, our principal competitor
      for video services throughout our territory is direct broadcast satellite
      ("DBS"), our principal competitor for data services is digital subscriber line
      ("DSL") provided by telephone companies and our principal competitors for
      telephone services are established telephone companies and other carriers,
      including VoIP providers. Based on telephone companies’ entry into video service
      and the upgrade of their networks, they will likely increasingly become an
      even
      more significant competitor for both data and video services. We do not consider
      other cable operators to be significant one-on-one competitors in the market
      overall, as traditional overbuilds are infrequent and spotty geographically
      (although in any particular market, a cable operator overbuilder would likely
      be
      a significant competitor at the local level). As of December 31, 2005, we
      are aware of traditional overbuild situations in service areas covering
      approximately 6% of our total homes passed and potential overbuilds in areas
      servicing approximately an additional 4% of our total homes passed.

Although
      cable operators tend not to be direct competitors for customers, their relative
      size may affect the competitive landscape in terms of how a cable company
      competes against non-cable competitors in the market place as well as in
      relationships with vendors who deal with cable operators. For example, a larger
      cable operator might have better access to and pricing for the multiple types
      of
      services cable companies offer. Also, a larger entity might have different
      access to financial resources and acquisition opportunities.

Our
      key
      competitors include:

DBS

Direct
      broadcast satellite is a significant competitor to cable systems. The DBS
      industry has grown rapidly over the last several years, and now serves more
      than
      27 million subscribers nationwide. DBS service allows the subscriber to receive
      video services directly via satellite using a relatively small dish antenna.
      EchoStar and DirecTV both have entered into joint marketing agreements with
      major telecommunications companies to offer bundled packages combining phone,
      data and video services.

Video
      compression technology and high powered satellites allow DBS providers to offer
      more than 200 digital channels from a single satellite, thereby surpassing
      the
      typical analog cable system. In 2005, major DBS competitors offered a greater
      variety of channel packages, and were especially competitive at the lower end
      pricing, such as a monthly price of approximately $35 for 60 channels compared
      to approximately $45 for the closest comparable package in most of our markets.
      In addition, while we continue to believe that the initial investment by a
      DBS
      customer exceeds that of a cable customer, the initial equipment cost for DBS
      has decreased substantially, as the DBS providers have aggressively marketed
      offers to new customers of incentives for discounted or free equipment,
      installation and multiple units. DBS providers are able to offer service
      nationwide and are able to establish a national image and branding with
      standardized offerings, which together with their ability to avoid franchise
      fees of up to 5% of revenues and property tax, leads to greater efficiencies
      and
      lower costs in the lower tiers of service. We believe that cable-delivered
      VOD
      and SVOD service are superior to DBS service because cable headends can store
      thousands of titles which customers can access and control independently,
      whereas DBS technology can only make available a much smaller number of titles
      with DVR-like customer control. We also believe that our higher tier products,
      particularly our bundled premium packages, are price-competitive with DBS
      packages and that many consumers prefer our ability to economically bundle
      video
      packages with data packages. Further, cable providers have the potential in
      some
      areas to provide a more complete "whole house" communications package when
      combining video, high-speed Internet and telephone services. We believe that
      this ability to bundle, combined with the introduction of more new products
      that
      DBS cannot readily offer (local high definition television and local interactive
      television) differentiates us from DBS competitors and could enable us to


win
      back
      some of our former customers who migrated to satellite. However, joint marketing
      arrangements between DBS providers and telecommunications carriers allow similar
      bundling of services in certain areas and DBS providers are making investments
      to offer more high definition programming, including local high definition
      programming.

Competition
      from DBS service providers may also present greater challenges in areas of
      lower
      population density, and we believe that our systems serve a higher concentration
      of such areas than those of other major cable service providers.

DBS
      providers have made attempts at widespread deployment of high-speed Internet
      access services via satellite but those services have been technically
      constrained and of limited appeal. DBS providers continue to explore options,
      such as combining satellite communications with terrestrial wireless networks,
      to provide high-speed Internet and other services. DBS providers have entered
      into joint marketing arrangements with telecommunications carriers allowing
      them
      to offer terrestrial DSL services in many markets.

DSL
      and other Broadband Services

DSL
      service allows Internet access to subscribers at data transmission speeds
      greater than those available over conventional telephone lines. DSL service
      therefore is competitive with high-speed Internet access over cable systems.
      Most telephone companies which already have plant, an existing customer base,
      and other operational functions in place (such as, billing, service personnel,
      etc.) offer DSL service. DSL actively markets its service and many providers
      have offered promotional pricing with a one-year service agreement. The FCC
      has
      determined that DSL service is an "information service," and based on that
      classification removed DSL service from many traditional telecommunications
      regulations. Legislative action and the FCC's decisions and policies in this
      area are subject to change. We expect DSL to remain a significant competitor
      to
      our data services, particularly as we enter the telephone business and telephone
      companies aggressively bundle DSL with telephone service to discourage customers
      from switching. In addition, the continuing deployment of fiber by telephone
      companies into their networks will enable them to provide higher bandwidth
      Internet service than provided over traditional DSL lines.

DSL
      and
      other forms of high-speed Internet access provide competition to our high-speed
      Internet service. For example, as discussed above, satellite-based delivery
      options are in development. In addition, local wireless Internet services have
      recently begun to operate in many markets using available unlicensed radio
      spectrum. This service option, popularly known as "wi-fi", offers another
      alternative to cable-based Internet access.

High-speed
      Internet access facilitates the streaming of video into homes and businesses.
      As
      the quality and availability of video streaming over the Internet improves,
      video streaming likely will compete with the traditional delivery of video
      programming services over cable systems. It is possible that programming
      suppliers will consider bypassing cable operators and market their services
      directly to the consumer through video streaming over the Internet.

We
      believe that pricing for residential and commercial Internet services on our
      system is generally comparable to that for similar DSL services and that some
      residential customers prefer our ability to bundle Internet services with video
      services. However, DSL providers may currently be in a better position to offer
      data services to businesses since their networks tend to be more complete in
      commercial areas. They also have the ability to bundle telephone with Internet
      services for a higher percentage of their customers, and that ability is
      appealing to many consumers. Joint marketing arrangements between DSL providers
      and DBS providers may allow some additional bundling of services. Moreover,
      major telephone companies, such as AT&T and Verizon, are now deploying fiber
      deep into their networks that enables them in some areas to offer high bandwidth
      video services over their networks, in addition to established voice and
      Internet services.

Telephone
      Companies and Utilities

The
      competitive environment has been significantly affected by technological
      developments and regulatory changes enacted under the 1996 Telecom Act, which
      amended the Communications Act and which is designed to enhance competition
      in
      the cable television and local telephone markets. Federal cross-ownership
      restrictions historically limited entry by local telephone companies into the
      cable business. The 1996 Telecom Act modified this cross-ownership restriction,
      making it possible for local exchange carriers, who have considerable resources,
      to provide a wide variety of video services competitive with services offered
      by
      cable systems.

Telephone
        companies already provide facilities for the transmission and distribution
        of
        voice and data services, including Internet services, in competition with
        our
        existing or potential interactive services ventures and businesses. Telephone
        companies can lawfully enter the cable television business and some telephone
        companies have been


extensively
        deploying fiber in their networks, which enables them to provide video services,
        as well as telephone and Internet access service. At least one major telephone
        company plans to provide Internet protocol video over its upgraded network
        and
        contends that its use of this technology should allow it to provide video
        service without a cable franchise as required under Title VI of the
        Communications Act. Telephone companies deploying fiber more extensively
        are
        already providing video services in some communities. Although telephone
        companies have obtained franchises or alternative authorizations in some
        areas
        and are seeking them in others, they are attempting through various means
        (including federal and state legislation and through FCC rulemaking) to weaken
        or streamline the franchising requirements applicable to them. If telephone
        companies are successful in avoiding or weakening the franchise and other
        regulatory requirements that are applicable to cable operators like Charter,
        their competitive posture would be enhanced. We cannot predict the likelihood
        of
        success of the broadband services offered by our competitors or the impact
        on us
        of such competitive ventures. The large scale entry of major telephone companies
        as direct competitors in the video marketplace could adversely affect the
        profitability and valuation of established cable systems.

Charter
      provides telephone service over our broadband communications networks in a
      number of its service areas. Charter also provides traditional circuit-switched
      phone service in a few communities. In these areas, Charter competes directly
      with established telephone companies and other carriers, including VoIP
      providers, for voice service customers. As we expand our offerings to include
      voice services, we will be subject to considerable competition from telephone
      companies and other telecommunications providers. The telecommunications
      industry is highly competitive and includes competitors with greater financial
      and personnel resources, who have brand name recognition and long-standing
      relationships with regulatory authorities and customers. Moreover, mergers,
      joint ventures and alliances among franchise, wireless or private cable
      operators, local exchange carriers and others may result in providers capable
      of
      offering cable television, Internet, and telecommunications services in direct
      competition with us. For example, major local exchange carriers have entered
      into arrangements with EchoStar and DirecTV in which they will market packages
      combining phone service, DSL and DBS services.

Additionally,
      we are subject to competition from utilities which possess fiber optic
      transmission lines capable of transmitting signals with minimal signal
      distortion. Utilities are also developing broadband over power line technology,
      which will allow the provision of Internet and other broadband services to
      homes
      and offices. Utilities have deployed broadband over power line technology in
      a
      few limited markets.

Broadcast
      Television

Cable
      television has long competed with broadcast television, which consists of
      television signals that the viewer is able to receive without charge using
      an
      "off-air" antenna. The extent of such competition is dependent upon the quality
      and quantity of broadcast signals available through "off-air" reception compared
      to the services provided by the local cable system. Traditionally, cable
      television has provided a higher picture quality and more channel offerings
      than
      broadcast television. However, the recent licensing of digital spectrum by
      the
      FCC will provide traditional broadcasters with the ability to deliver high
      definition television pictures and multiple digital-quality program streams,
      as
      well as advanced digital services such as subscription video and data
      transmission.

Traditional
      Overbuilds

Cable
      systems are operated under non-exclusive franchises granted by local
      authorities. More than one cable system may legally be built in the same area.
      It is possible that a franchising authority might grant a second franchise
      to
      another cable operator and that such a franchise might contain terms and
      conditions more favorable than those afforded us. In addition, entities willing
      to establish an open video system, under which they offer unaffiliated
      programmers non-discriminatory access to a portion of the system’s cable system,
      may be able to avoid local franchising requirements. Well financed businesses
      from outside the cable industry, such as public utilities that already possess
      fiber optic and other transmission lines in the areas they serve, may over
      time
      become competitors. There are a number of cities that have constructed their
      own
      cable systems, in a manner similar to city-provided utility services. There
      also
      has been interest in traditional overbuilds by private companies. Constructing
      a
      competing cable system is a capital intensive process which involves a high
      degree of risk. We believe that in order to be successful, a competitor’s
      overbuild would need to be able to serve the homes and businesses in the
      overbuilt area on a more cost-effective basis than we can. Any such overbuild
      operation would require either significant access to capital or access to
      facilities already in place that are capable of delivering cable television
      programming.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, we are aware of overbuild situations impacting
      approximately 6% of our total homes passed and potential overbuild situations
      in
      areas servicing approximately an additional 4% of our total homes passed.
      Additional overbuild situations may occur in other systems.


Private
      Cable

Additional
      competition is posed by satellite master antenna television systems, or SMATV
      systems, serving multiple dwelling units, or MDUs, such as condominiums,
      apartment complexes, and private residential communities. These private cable
      systems may enter into exclusive agreements with such MDUs, which may preclude
      operators of franchise systems from serving residents of such private complexes.
      Private cable systems can offer both improved reception of local television
      stations and many of the same satellite-delivered program services that are
      offered by cable systems. SMATV systems currently benefit from operating
      advantages not available to franchised cable systems, including fewer regulatory
      burdens and no requirement to service low density or economically depressed
      communities. Exemption from regulation may provide a competitive advantage
      to
      certain of our current and potential competitors.

Wireless
      Distribution

Cable
      systems also compete with wireless program distribution services such as
      multi-channel multipoint distribution systems or "wireless cable," known as
      MMDS, which uses low-power microwave frequencies to transmit television
      programming over-the-air to paying customers. MMDS services, however, require
      unobstructed "line of sight" transmission paths and MMDS ventures have been
      quite limited to date.

The
      FCC
      has completed its auction of Multichannel Video Distribution & Data Service
      ("MVDDS") licenses. MVDDS is a new terrestrial video and data fixed wireless
      service that the FCC hopes will spur competition in the cable and DBS
      industries.

Regulation
      and Legislation

The
      following summary addresses the key regulatory and legislative developments
      affecting the cable industry. Cable system operations are extensively regulated
      by the FCC, some state governments and most local governments. A failure to
      comply with these regulations could subject us to substantial penalties. Our
      business can be dramatically impacted by changes to the existing regulatory
      framework, whether triggered by legislative, administrative, or judicial
      rulings. Congress and the FCC have expressed a particular interest in increasing
      competition in the communications field generally and in the cable television
      field specifically. The 1996 Telecom Act, which amended the Communications
      Act,
      altered the regulatory structure governing the nation's communications
      providers. It removed barriers to competition in both the cable television
      market and the local telephone market. At the same time, the FCC has pursued
      spectrum licensing options designed to increase competition to the cable
      industry by wireless multichannel video programming distributors. We could
      be
      materially disadvantaged in the future if we are subject to new regulations
      that
      do not equally impact our key competitors.

Congress
      and the FCC have frequently revisited the subject of communications regulation,
      and they are likely to do so in the future. For example, under the
      Communications Act, the FCC can establish rules "necessary to provide diversity
      of information sources" when cable systems with at least 36 channels are
      available to 70% of U.S. homes and 70% of those homes subscribe to cable
      service. The FCC has concluded that cable systems with at least 36 channels
      are
      available to 70% of U.S. homes and is now exploring whether the second part
      of
      the test has been met. In addition, franchise agreements with local governments
      must be periodically renewed, and new operating terms may be imposed. Future
      legislative, regulatory, or judicial changes could adversely affect our
      operations. We can provide no assurance that the already extensive regulation
      of
      our business will not be expanded in the future.

Cable
      Rate Regulation

The
      cable
      industry has operated under a federal rate regulation regime for more than
      a
      decade. The regulations currently restrict the prices that cable systems charge
      for the minimum level of video programming service, referred to as "basic
      service", and associated equipment. All other cable offerings are now
      universally exempt from rate regulation. Although basic rate regulation operates
      pursuant to a federal formula, local governments, commonly referred to as local
      franchising authorities, are primarily responsible for administering this
      regulation. The majority of our local franchising authorities have never been
      certified to regulate basic cable rates, but they retain the right to do so
      (and
      order rate reductions and refunds), except in those specific communities facing
      "effective competition," as defined under federal law. With increased DBS
      competition, our systems are increasingly likely to satisfy the effective
      competition standard. We have already secured FCC recognition of effective
      competition, and been rate deregulated, in many of our communities.


There
      have been frequent calls to impose expanded rate regulation on the cable
      industry. Confronted with rapidly increasing cable programming costs, it is
      possible that Congress may adopt new constraints on the retail pricing or
      packaging of cable programming. For example, there has been considerable
      legislative and regulatory interest in requiring cable offers to offer
      historically bundled programming services on an a la carte basis or to at least
      offer a separately available child-friendly "Family Tier." Such constraints
      could adversely affect our operations.

Federal
      rate regulations generally require cable operators to allow subscribers to
      purchase premium or pay-per-view services without the necessity of subscribing
      to any tier of service, other than the basic service tier. The applicability
      of
      this rule in certain situations remains unclear, and adverse decisions by the
      FCC could affect our pricing and packaging of services. As we attempt to respond
      to a changing marketplace with competitive pricing practices, such as targeted
      promotions and discounts, we may face additional legal restraints and challenges
      that impede our ability to compete.

Must
      Carry/Retransmission Consent

There
      are
      two alternative legal methods for carriage of local broadcast television
      stations on cable systems. Federal law currently includes "must carry"
      regulations, which require cable systems to carry certain local broadcast
      television stations that the cable operator would not select voluntarily.
      Alternatively, federal law includes "retransmission consent" regulations, by
      which popular commercial television stations can prohibit cable carriage unless
      the cable operator first negotiates for "retransmission consent," which may
      be
      conditioned on significant payments or other concessions. Either option has
      a
      potentially adverse effect on our business. The burden associated with must
      carry could increase significantly if cable systems were required to
      simultaneously carry both the analog and digital signals of each television
      station (dual carriage), as the broadcast industry transitions from an analog
      to
      a digital format.

The
      burden could also increase significantly if cable systems become required to
      carry multiple program streams included within a single digital broadcast
      transmission (multicast carriage).

Additional
      government-mandated broadcast carriage obligations could disrupt existing
      programming commitments, interfere with our preferred use of limited channel
      capacity and limit our ability to offer services that would maximize customer
      appeal and revenue potential. Although the FCC issued a decision in 2005
      confirming an earlier ruling against mandating either dual carriage or multicast
      carriage, that decision has been appealed. In addition, the FCC could reverse
      its own ruling or Congress could legislate additional carriage obligations.
      The
      President has signed into law legislation establishing February 2009 as the
      deadline to complete the broadcast transition to digital spectrum and to reclaim
      analog spectrum. Cable operators may need to take additional operational steps
      at that time to ensure that customers not otherwise equipped to receive digital
      programming, retain access to broadcast programming.

Access
      Channels

Local
      franchise agreements often require cable operators to set aside certain channels
      for public, educational and governmental access programming. Federal law also
      requires cable systems to designate a portion of their channel capacity for
      commercial leased access by unaffiliated third parties. Increased activity
      in
      this area could further burden the channel capacity of our cable systems.

Access
      to Programming

The
      Communications Act and the FCC’s "program access" rules generally prevent
      satellite video programmers affiliated with cable operators from favoring cable
      operators over competing multichannel video distributors, such as DBS, and
      limit
      the ability of such programmers to offer exclusive programming arrangements
      to
      cable operators. The FCC has extended the exclusivity restrictions through
      October 2007. Given the heightened competition and media consolidation that
      Charter faces, it is possible that we will find it increasingly difficult to
      gain access to popular programming at favorable terms. Such difficulty could
      adversely impact our business.

Ownership
      Restrictions

Federal
      regulation of the communications field traditionally included a host of
      ownership restrictions, which limited the size of certain media entities and
      restricted their ability to enter into competing enterprises. Through a series
      of legislative, regulatory, and judicial actions, most of these restrictions
      recently were eliminated or substantially relaxed. For example, historic
      restrictions on local exchange carriers offering cable service within their
      telephone service area, as well as those prohibiting broadcast stations from
      owning cable systems within their broadcast service area, no longer exist.
      Changes in this regulatory area, including some still subject to judicial
      review, could


alter
      the
      business landscape in which we operate, as formidable new competitors (including
      electric utilities, local exchange carriers, and broadcast/media companies)
      may
      increasingly choose to offer cable services.

The
      FCC
      previously adopted regulations precluding any cable operator from serving more
      than 30% of all domestic multichannel video subscribers and from devoting more
      than 40% of the activated channel capacity of any cable system to the carriage
      of affiliated national video programming services. These cable ownership
      restrictions were invalidated by the courts, and the FCC is now considering
      adoption of replacement regulations.

Internet
      Service

Over
      the
      past several years, proposals have been advanced at the FCC and Congress that
      would require cable operators offering Internet service to provide
      non-discriminatory access to its network to competing Internet service
      providers. In a 2005 ruling, commonly referred to as

Brand
      X

,
      the
      Supreme Court upheld an FCC decision making it less likely that any
      non-discriminatory "open access" requirements (which are generally associated
      with common carrier regulation of "telecommunications services") will be imposed
      on the cable industry by local, state or federal authorities. The Supreme Court
      held that the FCC was correct in classifying cable-provided Internet service
      as
      an "information service," rather than a "telecommunications service." This
      favorable regulatory classification limits the ability of various governmental
      authorities to impose open access requirements on cable-provided Internet
      service.

The
      FCC’s
      classification also means that it likely will not regulate Internet service
      as
      much as cable or telecommunications services. However, the FCC has set a
      deadline for broadband providers to accommodate law enforcement wiretaps and
      could impose further regulations in the future. The FCC also issued a
      non-binding policy statement in 2005 establishing four basic principles that
      the
      FCC says will inform its ongoing policymaking activities regarding
      broadband-related Internet services. Those principles state that consumers
      are
      entitled to access the lawful Internet content of their choice, consumers are
      entitled to run applications and services of their choice, subject to the needs
      of law enforcement, consumers are entitled to connect their choice of legal
      devices that do not harm the network, and consumers are entitled to competition
      among network providers, application and service providers and content
      providers. It is unclear what, if any, additional regulations the FCC might
      impose on our Internet service, and what, if any, impact, such regulations
      might
      have on our business.

As
      the
      Internet has matured, it has become the subject of increasing regulatory
      interest. Congress and federal regulators have adopted a wide range of measures
      directly or potentially affecting Internet use, including, for example, consumer
      privacy, copyright protections, (which afford copyright owners certain rights
      against us that could adversely affect our relationship with a customer accused
      of violating copyright laws), defamation liability, taxation, obscenity, and
      unsolicited commercial e-mail. State and local governmental organizations have
      also adopted Internet-related regulations. These various governmental
      jurisdictions are also considering additional regulations in these and other
      areas, such as pricing, service and product quality, and intellectual property
      ownership.

The
      adoption of new Internet regulations or the adaptation of existing laws to
      the
      Internet could adversely affect our business.

Phone
      Service

The
      Telecom Act, which amended the Communications Act, created a more favorable
      regulatory environment for us to provide telecommunications services. In
      particular, it limited the regulatory role of local franchising authorities
      and
      established requirements ensuring that we could interconnect with other
      telephone companies to provide a viable service. Many implementation details
      remain unresolved, and there are substantial regulatory changes being considered
      that could impact, in both positive and negative ways, our primary
      telecommunications competitors and our own entry into the field of phone
      service. The FCC and state regulatory authorities are considering, for example,
      whether common carrier regulation traditionally applied to incumbent local
      exchange carriers should be modified.

The
      FCC
      has concluded that alternative voice technologies, like certain types of VoIP,
      should be regulated only at the federal level, rather than by individual states.
      A legal challenge to that FCC decision is pending. While the FCC’s decision
      appears to be a positive development for VoIP offerings, it is unclear whether
      and how the FCC will apply certain types of common carrier regulations, such
      as
      intercarrier compensations and universal service obligations to alternative
      voice technology. The FCC has already determined that providers of phone
      services using Internet Protocol technology must comply with traditional 911
      emergency service obligations ("E911") and it has extended requirements for
      accommodating law enforcement wiretaps to such providers. It is unclear how
      these regulatory matters ultimately will be resolved and how they will affect
      our potential expansion into phone service.


Pole
      Attachments

The
      Communications Act requires most utilities to provide cable systems with access
      to poles and conduits and simultaneously subjects the rates charged for this
      access to either federal or state regulation. The Act specifies that
      significantly higher rates apply if the cable plant is providing
      telecommunications service, as well as traditional cable service. The FCC has
      clarified that a cable operator's favorable pole rates are not endangered by
      the
      provision of Internet access, and that determination was upheld by the United
      States Supreme Court.

It
      remains possible that the underlying pole attachment formula, or its application
      to Internet and telecommunications offerings, will be modified in a manner
      that
      substantially increases our pole attachment costs.

Cable
      Equipment

The
      FCC
      has undertaken several steps to promote competition in the delivery of cable
      equipment and compatibility with new digital technology. The FCC has expressly
      ruled that cable customers must be allowed to purchase set-top terminals from
      third parties and established a multi-year phase-in during which security
      functions (which would remain in the operator's exclusive control) would be
      unbundled from the basic converter functions, which could then be provided
      by
      third party vendors. The first phase of implementation has already passed.
      A
      prohibition on cable operators leasing digital set-top terminals that integrate
      security and basic navigation functions is currently scheduled to go into effect
      as of July 1, 2007.  Charter is among the cable operators challenging that
      provision in court.

The
      FCC
      has adopted rules implementing an agreement between major cable operators and
      manufacturers of consumer electronics on "plug and play" specifications for
      one-way digital televisions. The rules require cable operators to provide
      "CableCard" security modules and support to customer owned digital televisions
      and similar devices equipped with built-in set-top terminal functionality.
      Cable
      operators must support basic home recording rights and copy protection rules
      for
      digital programming content. The FCC’s plug and play rules are under appeal,
      although the appeal has been stayed pending the FCC
      reconsideration.

The
      FCC
      is conducting additional related rulemakings, and the cable and consumer
      electronics industries are currently negotiating an agreement that would
      establish additional specifications for two-way digital televisions. Congress
      is
      also considering companion "broadcast flag" legislation to provide copy
      protection for digital broadcast signals. It is unclear how this process will
      develop and how it will affect our offering of cable equipment and our
      relationship with our customers.

Other
      Communications Act Provisions and FCC Regulatory
      Matters

In
      addition to the Communications Act provisions and FCC regulations noted above,
      there are other statutory provisions and FCC regulations affecting our business.
      The Communications Act, for example, includes cable-specific privacy
      obligations. The Act carefully limits our ability to collect and disclose
      personal information.

FCC
      regulations include a variety of additional areas, including, among other
      things: (1) equal employment opportunity obligations; (2) customer service
      standards; (3) technical service standards; (4) mandatory blackouts of certain
      network, syndicated and sports programming; (5) restrictions on political
      advertising; (6) restrictions on advertising in children's programming; (7)
      restrictions on origination cablecasting; (8) restrictions on carriage of
      lottery programming; (9) sponsorship identification obligations; (10) closed
      captioning of video programming; (11) licensing of systems and facilities;
      (12)
      maintenance of public files;

and
      (13)
      emergency alert systems.

It
      is
      possible that Congress or the FCC will expand or modify its regulation of cable
      systems in the future, and we cannot predict at this time how that might impact
      our business. For example, there have been recent discussions about imposing
      "indecency" restrictions directly on cable programming.

Copyright

Cable
      systems are subject to federal copyright licensing covering carriage of
      television and radio broadcast signals. The possible modification or elimination
      of this compulsory copyright license is the subject of continuing legislative
      review and could adversely affect our ability to obtain desired broadcast
      programming. Moreover, the Copyright Office has not yet provided any guidance
      as
      to the how the compulsory copyright license should apply to newly offered
      digital broadcast signals.


Copyright
      clearances for non-broadcast programming services are arranged through private
      negotiations. Cable operators also must obtain music rights for locally
      originated programming and advertising from the major music performing rights
      organizations. These licensing fees have been the source of litigation in the
      past, and we cannot predict with certainty whether license fee disputes may
      arise in the future.

Franchise
      Matters

Cable
      systems generally are operated pursuant to nonexclusive franchises granted
      by a
      municipality or other state or local government entity in order to cross public
      rights-of-way. Cable franchises generally are granted for fixed terms and in
      many cases include monetary penalties for noncompliance and may be terminable
      if
      the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions.

The
      specific terms and conditions of cable franchises vary materially between
      jurisdictions. Each franchise generally contains provisions governing cable
      operations, franchise fees, system construction, maintenance, technical
      performance, and customer service standards. A number of states subject cable
      systems to the jurisdiction of centralized state government agencies, such
      as
      public utility commissions. Although local franchising authorities have
      considerable discretion in establishing franchise terms, there are certain
      federal protections. For example, federal law caps local franchise fees and
      includes renewal procedures designed to protect incumbent franchisees from
      arbitrary denials of renewal. Even if a franchise is renewed, however, the
      local
      franchising authority may seek to impose new and more onerous requirements
      as a
      condition of renewal. Similarly, if a local franchising authority's consent
      is
      required for the purchase or sale of a cable system, the local franchising
      authority may attempt to impose more burdensome requirements as a condition
      for
      providing its consent.

Different
      legislative proposals have been introduced in the United States Congress and
      in
      some state legislatures that would greatly streamline cable franchising. This
      legislation is intended to facilitate entry by new competitors, particularly
      local telephone companies. Such legislation has already passed in at least
      one
      state, but is now subject to court challenge. Although various legislative
      proposals provide some regulatory relief for incumbent cable operators, these
      proposals are generally viewed as being more favorable to new entrants due
      to a
      number of varying factors, including efforts to withhold streamlined cable
      franchising from incumbents until after the expiration of their existing
      franchises and the potential for new entrants to serve only higher-income areas
      of a particular community. To the extent incumbent cable operators are not
      able
      to avail themselves of this streamlined franchising process, such operators
      may
      continue to be subject to more onerous franchise requirements at the local
      level
      than new entrants. The FCC recently initiated a proceeding to determine whether
      local franchising authorities are impeding the deployment of competitive cable
      services through unreasonable franchising requirements and whether any such
      impediments should be preempted. At this time, we are not able to determine
      what
      impact such proceeding may have on us.

Employees

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, we had approximately 17,200 full-time equivalent employees.
      At December 31, 2005, approximately 100 of our employees were represented by
      collective bargaining agreements. We have never experienced a work stoppage.

The
      corporate office, which includes employees of Charter and Charter Holdco, is
      responsible for coordinating and overseeing our operations. The corporate office
      performs certain financial and administrative functions on a centralized basis
      such as accounting, taxes, billing, finance and acquisitions, payroll and
      benefit administration, information system design and support, internal audit,
      purchasing, customer care, marketing and programming contract administration
      and
      oversight and coordination of external auditors and consultants and related
      professional fees. The corporate office performs these services on a cost
      reimbursement basis pursuant to a management services agreement. See

Risks
      Related to Significant Indebtedness of Us and Our
      Subsidiaries

We
      may not generate (or, in general, have available to the applicable obligor)
      sufficient cash flow or access to additional external liquidity sources to
      fund
      our capital expenditures, ongoing operations and debt
      obligations.

Our
      ability to service our debt and to fund our planned capital expenditures and
      ongoing operations will depend on both our ability to generate cash flow and
      our
      access to additional external liquidity sources, and in general our ability
      to
      provide (by dividend or otherwise), such funds to the applicable issuer of
      the
      debt obligation. Our ability to generate cash flow is dependent on many factors,
      including:

·

our
                  future operating performance;

·

the
                    demand for our products and
                    services;

·

general
                economic conditions and conditions affecting customer and advertiser
                spending;

·

competition
                and our ability to stabilize customer losses;
                and

·

legal
                and regulatory factors affecting our
                business.

Some
      of
      these factors are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient
      cash flow and/or access additional external liquidity sources, we may not be
      able to service and repay our debt, operate our business, respond to competitive
      challenges or fund our other liquidity and capital needs. Although our
      subsidiaries, CCH II and CCH II Capital Corp., recently sold $450 million
      principal amount of 10.250% senior notes due 2010, we may not be able to access
      additional sources of external liquidity on similar terms, if at all. We believe
      that cash flows from operating activities and amounts available under our credit
      facilities and bridge loan will not be sufficient to fund our operations and
      satisfy our interest payment and principal repayment obligations in 2007 and
      beyond. See "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
      and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources."

Additionally,
      franchise valuations performed in accordance with the requirements of Statement
      of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142,

Goodwill
      and Other Intangible Assets

,
      are
      based on the projected cash flows derived by selling products and services
      to
      new customers in future periods. Declines in future cash flows could result
      in
      lower valuations which in turn may result in impairments to the franchise assets
      in our financial statements.

Charter
      Operating may not be able to access funds under its credit facilities or bridge
      loan if it fails to satisfy the covenant restrictions in its credit facilities,
      which could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to conduct
      our business.

Our
      subsidiaries have historically relied on access to credit facilities in order
      to
      fund operations and to service parent company debt, and we expect such reliance
      to continue in the future. Our total potential borrowing availability under
      the
      Charter Operating credit facilities was approximately $553 million as of
      December 31, 2005, none of which was limited by financial covenants that may
      from time to time in the future limit the availability of funds. Although as
      of
      January 2, 2006 we had additional borrowing availability of $600 million under
      the bridge loan (which was reduced to $435 million as a result of the issuance
      of the CCH II notes), such availability is subject to the satisfaction of
      certain conditions, including the satisfaction of certain of the conditions
      to
      borrowing under the credit facilities.

An
      event
      of default under the credit facilities, bridge loan or indentures, if not
      waived, could result in the acceleration of those debt obligations and,
      consequently, other debt obligations. Such acceleration could result in exercise
      of remedies by our creditors and could force us to seek the protection of the
      bankruptcy laws, which could materially adversely impact our ability to operate
      our business and to make payments under our debt instruments. In addition,
      an
      event of default under the credit facilities, such as the failure to maintain
      the applicable required financial ratios, would prevent additional borrowing
      under our credit facilities, which could materially adversely


affect
      our ability to operate our business and to make payments under our debt
      instruments. Likewise, the failure to satisfy the conditions to borrowing under
      the bridge loan would prevent any borrowing thereunder, which could materially
      adversely affect our ability to operate our business and to make payments under
      our debt instruments.

We
      and our subsidiaries have a significant amount of existing debt and may incur
      significant additional debt, including secured debt, in the future, which could
      adversely affect our financial health and our ability to react to changes in
      our
      business.

Charter
      and its subsidiaries have a significant amount of debt and may (subject to
      applicable restrictions in their debt instruments) incur additional debt in
      the
      future. As of December 31, 2005, our total debt was approximately $19.4 billion,
      our shareholders’ deficit was approximately $4.9 billion and the deficiency of
      earnings to cover fixed charges for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $853
      million. The maturities of these obligations are set forth in "Item 7.
      Description of Our Outstanding Debt."

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, Charter had outstanding approximately $883 million aggregate
      principal amount of convertible notes, $20 million of which mature in 2006.
      We
      will need to raise additional capital and/or receive distributions or payments
      from our subsidiaries in order to satisfy our debt obligations beyond
      2006.  However, because of our significant indebtedness, our ability to
      raise additional capital at reasonable rates or at all is uncertain, and the
      ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions or payments to us is subject
      to availability of funds and restrictions under our and our subsidiaries’
applicable debt instruments as more fully described in "Item 7. Description
      of
      Our Outstanding Debt." If we were to raise capital through the issuance of
      additional equity or to engage in a recapitalization or other similar
      transaction, our shareholders could suffer significant dilution.

Our
      significant amount of debt could have other important consequences.  For
      example, the debt will or could:

·

require
                us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operating
                activities to payments on our debt, which will reduce our funds available
                for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate
                expenses;

·

limit
                our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business,
                the cable and telecommunications industries and the economy at
                large;

·

place
                us at a disadvantage as compared to our competitors that have
                proportionately less debt;

·

make
                us vulnerable to interest rate increases, because a significant portion
                of
                our borrowings are, and will continue to be, at variable rates of
                interest;

·

expose
                us to increased interest expense as we refinance all existing lower
                interest rate instruments;

·

adversely
                affect our relationship with customers and
                suppliers;

·

limit
                our ability to borrow additional funds in the future, if we need
                them, due
                to applicable financial and restrictive covenants in our debt;
                and

·

make
                it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to the holders
                of our
                notes and for our subsidiaries to satisfy their obligations to their
                lenders under their credit facilities and to their
                noteholders.

A
      default
      by one of our subsidiaries under its debt obligations could result in the
      acceleration of those obligations, the obligations of our other subsidiaries
      and
      our obligations under our convertible notes. We and our subsidiaries may incur
      substantial additional debt in the future. If current debt levels increase,
      the
      related risks that we now face will intensify.

The
      agreements and instruments governing our debt and the debt of our subsidiaries
      contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our ability
      to operate our business, as well as significantly affect our
      liquidity.

The
      Charter Operating credit facilities, the bridge loan and the indentures
      governing our and our subsidiaries’ debt contain a number of significant
      covenants that could adversely affect our ability to operate our business,
      as
      well as


significantly
      affect our liquidity, and therefore could adversely affect our results of
      operations and the price of our Class A common stock. These covenants will
      restrict, among other things, our and our subsidiaries’ ability to:

·

incur
                    additional debt;

·

repurchase
                  or redeem equity interests and
                  debt;

·

issue
                equity;

·

make
                certain investments or
                acquisitions;

·

pay
                  dividends or make other
                  distributions;

·

dispose
                of assets or merge;

·

enter
                  into related party transactions;

·

grant
                liens and pledge assets.

Furthermore,
      Charter Operating’s credit facilities require our subsidiaries to, among other
      things, maintain specified financial ratios, meet specified financial tests
      and
      provide audited financial statements, with an unqualified opinion from our
      independent auditors. See "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
      Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources
      and Description of Our Outstanding Debt" for a summary of our outstanding
      indebtedness and a description of our credit facilities and other indebtedness
      and for details on our debt covenants and future liquidity. Charter Operating’s
      ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our
      control.

The
      breach of any covenants or obligations in the foregoing indentures, bridge
      loan
      or credit facilities, not otherwise waived or amended, could result in a default
      under the applicable debt agreement or instrument and could trigger acceleration
      of the related debt, which in turn could trigger defaults under other agreements
      governing our long-term indebtedness. See "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and
      Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and
      Capital Resources." In addition, the secured lenders under the Charter Operating
      credit facilities and the holders of the Charter Operating senior second-lien
      notes could foreclose on their collateral, which includes equity interests
      in
      our subsidiaries, and exercise other rights of secured creditors. Any default
      under those credit facilities, the bridge loan, the indentures governing our
      convertible notes or our subsidiaries’ debt could adversely affect our growth,
      our financial condition and our results of operations and our ability to make
      payments on our notes, the bridge loan, and Charter Operating’s credit
      facilities and other debt of our subsidiaries. See "Item 7. Management’s
      Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
Description of Our Outstanding Debt" for a summary of outstanding indebtedness
      and a description of credit facilities and other indebtedness.

All
      of our and our subsidiaries’ outstanding debt is subject to change of control
      provisions. We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to fulfill
      our obligations under our indebtedness following a change of control, which
      would place us in default under the applicable debt
      instruments.

We
      may
      not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to fulfill our obligations
      under our and our subsidiaries’ notes, the bridge loan, and credit facilities
      following a change of control. Under the indentures governing our and our
      subsidiaries’ notes, upon the occurrence of specified change of control events,
      we are required to offer to repurchase all of these notes. However, Charter
      and
      our subsidiaries may not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of
      control event to make the required repurchase of these notes, and our
      subsidiaries are limited in their ability to make distributions or other
      payments to fund any required repurchase. In addition, a change of control
      under
      our subsidiaries’ credit facilities and bridge loan would result in a default
      under those credit facilities and bridge loan. Because such credit facilities,
      bridge loan and our subsidiaries’ notes are obligations of our subsidiaries, the
      credit facilities, bridge loan and our subsidiaries’ notes would have to be
      repaid by our subsidiaries before their assets could be available to us to
      repurchase our convertible senior notes. Our failure to make or complete a
      change of control offer would place us in default under our convertible senior
      notes. The failure of our


subsidiaries
      to make a change of control offer or repay the amounts accelerated under their
      credit facilities and bridge loan would place them in default.

Risks
      Related to Our Business

We
      operate in a very competitive business environment, which affects our ability
      to
      attract and retain customers and can adversely affect our business and
      operations. We have lost a significant number of video customers to direct
      broadcast satellite competition and further loss of video customers could have
      a
      material negative impact on our business.

The
      industry in which we operate is highly competitive and has become more so in
      recent years. In some instances, we compete against companies with fewer
      regulatory burdens, easier access to financing, greater personnel resources,
      greater brand name recognition and long-established relationships with
      regulatory authorities and customers. Increasing consolidation in the cable
      industry and the repeal of certain ownership rules may provide additional
      benefits to certain of our competitors, either through access to financing,
      resources or efficiencies of scale.

Our
      principal competitor for video services throughout our territory is DBS.
      Competition from DBS, including intensive marketing efforts and aggressive
      pricing has had an adverse impact on our ability to retain customers. DBS has
      grown rapidly over the last several years and continues to do so. The cable
      industry, including us, has lost a significant number of subscribers to DBS
      competition, and we face serious challenges in this area in the future. We
      believe that competition from DBS service providers may present greater
      challenges in areas of lower population density, and that our systems service
      a
      higher concentration of such areas than those of other major cable service
      providers.

Local
      telephone companies and electric utilities can offer video and other services
      in
      competition with us and they increasingly may do so in the future. Certain
      telephone companies have begun more extensive deployment of fiber in their
      networks that enable them to begin providing video services, as well as
      telephone and high bandwidth Internet access services, to residential and
      business customers and they are now offering such service in limited areas.
      Some
      of these telephone companies have obtained, and are now seeking, franchises
      or
      operating authorizations that are less burdensome than existing Charter
      franchises.

The
      subscription television industry also faces competition from free broadcast
      television and from other communications and entertainment media. Further loss
      of customers to DBS or other alternative video and Internet services could
      have
      a material negative impact on the value of our business and its performance.

With
      respect to our Internet access services, we face competition, including
      intensive marketing efforts and aggressive pricing, from telephone companies
      and
      other providers of DSL and "dial-up". DSL service is competitive with high-speed
      Internet service over cable systems. In addition, DBS providers have entered
      into joint marketing arrangements with Internet access providers to offer
      bundled video and Internet service, which competes with our ability to provide
      bundled services to our customers. Moreover, as we expand our telephone
      offerings, we will face considerable competition from established telephone
      companies and other carriers, including VoIP providers.

In
      order
      to attract new customers, from time to time we make promotional offers,
      including offers of temporarily reduced-price or free service. These promotional
      programs result in significant advertising, programming and operating expenses,
      and also require us to make capital expenditures to acquire additional digital
      set-top terminals. Customers who subscribe to our services as a result of these
      offerings may not remain customers for any significant period of time following
      the end of the promotional period. A failure to retain existing customers and
      customers added through promotional offerings or to collect the amounts they
      owe
      us could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.


Mergers,
      joint ventures and alliances among franchised, wireless or private cable
      operators, satellite television providers, local exchange carriers and others,
      may provide additional benefits to some of our competitors, either through
      access to financing, resources or efficiencies of scale, or the ability to
      provide multiple services in direct competition with us.

We
      cannot
      assure you that our cable systems will allow us to compete effectively.
      Additionally, as we expand our offerings to include other telecommunications
      services, and to introduce new and enhanced services, we will be subject to
      competition from other providers of the services we offer. We cannot predict
      the
      extent to which competition may affect our business and operations in the
      future. See "Item 1. Business — Competition."

We
      have a history of net losses and expect to continue to experience net losses.
      Consequently, we may not have the ability to finance future
      operations.

We
      have
      had a history of net losses and expect to continue to report net losses for
      the
      foreseeable future. Our net losses are principally attributable to insufficient
      revenue to cover the interest costs on our debt, the depreciation expenses
      that
      we incur resulting from the capital investments we have made in our cable
      properties, and the amortization and impairment of our franchise intangibles.
      We
      expect that these expenses (other than amortization and impairment of
      franchises) will remain significant, and we expect to continue to report net
      losses for the foreseeable future. We reported losses before cumulative effect
      of accounting change of $2.3 billion for 2002, $238 million for 2003, $3.6
      billion for 2004 and $967 million for 2005. Continued losses would reduce our
      cash available from operations to service our indebtedness, as well as limit
      our
      ability to finance our operations.

We
      may not have the ability to pass our increasing programming costs on to our
      customers, which would adversely affect our cash flow and operating
      margins.

Programming
      has been, and is expected to continue to be, our largest operating expense
      item.
      In recent years, the cable industry has experienced a rapid escalation in the
      cost of programming, particularly sports programming. We expect programming
      costs to continue to increase because of a variety of factors, including
      inflationary or negotiated annual increases, additional programming being
      provided to customers and increased costs to purchase programming. The inability
      to fully pass these programming cost increases on to our customers has had
      an
      adverse impact on our cash flow and operating margins. As measured by
      programming costs, and excluding premium services (substantially all of which
      were renegotiated and renewed in 2003), as of December 31, 2005, approximately
      15% of our current programming contracts were expired, and approximately another
      4% were scheduled to expire at or before the end of 2006. There can be no
      assurance that these agreements will be renewed on favorable or comparable
      terms. Our programming costs increased by approximately 7% in 2005 and we expect
      our programming costs in 2006 to increase at a higher rate than in 2005. To
      the
      extent that we are unable to reach agreement with certain programmers on terms
      that we believe are reasonable we may be forced to remove such programming
      channels from our line-up, which could result in a further loss of customers.

If
      our required capital expenditures exceed our projections, we may not have
      sufficient funding, which could adversely affect our growth, financial condition
      and results of operations.

During
      the year ended December 31, 2005, we spent approximately $1.1 billion on capital
      expenditures. During 2006, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately
      $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion. The actual amount of our capital expenditures
      depends on the level of growth in high-speed Internet and telephone customers
      and in the delivery of other advanced services, as well as the cost of
      introducing any new services. We may need additional capital if there is
      accelerated growth in high-speed Internet customers, telephone customers or
      in
      the delivery of other advanced services. If we cannot obtain such capital from
      increases in our cash flow from operating activities, additional borrowings
      or
      other sources, our growth, financial condition and results of operations could
      suffer materially.

Our
      inability to respond to technological developments and meet customer demand
      for
      new products and services could limit our ability to compete
      effectively.

Our
      business is characterized by rapid technological change and the introduction
      of
      new products and services. We cannot assure you that we will be able to fund
      the
      capital expenditures necessary to keep pace with unanticipated technological
      developments, or that we will successfully anticipate the demand of our
      customers for products and services requiring new technology. Our inability
      to
      maintain and expand our upgraded systems and provide advanced services in a
      timely manner, or to anticipate the demands of the marketplace, could materially
      adversely


affect
      our ability to attract and retain customers. Consequently, our growth, financial
      condition and results of operations could suffer materially.

We
      may not be able to carry out our strategy to improve operating results by
      standardizing and streamlining operations and
      procedures.

In
      prior
      years, we experienced rapid growth through acquisitions of a number of cable
      operators and the rapid rebuild and rollout of advanced services. Our future
      success will depend in part on our ability to standardize and streamline our
      operations. The failure to implement a consistent corporate culture and
      management, operating or financial systems or procedures necessary to
      standardize and streamline our operations and effectively operate our enterprise
      could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations
      and
      financial condition.

Malicious
      and abusive Internet practices could impair our high-speed Internet
      services

Our
      high-speed Internet customers utilize our network to access the Internet and,
      as
      a consequence, we or they may become victim to common malicious and abusive
      Internet activities, such as unsolicited mass advertising (i.e., "spam") and
      dissemination of viruses, worms and other destructive or disruptive software.
      These activities could have adverse consequences on our network and our
      customers, including degradation of service, excessive call volume to call
      centers and damage to our or our customers’ equipment and data. Significant
      incidents could lead to customer dissatisfaction and, ultimately, loss of
      customers or revenue, in addition to increased costs to us to service our
      customers and protect our network. Any significant loss of high-speed Internet
      customers or revenue or significant increase in costs of serving those customers
      could adversely affect our growth, financial condition and results of
      operations.

We
      could be deemed an "investment company" under the Investment Company Act of
      1940. This would impose significant restrictions on us and would be likely
      to
      have a material adverse impact on our growth, financial condition and results
      of
      operation.

Our
      principal assets are our equity interests in Charter Holdco and certain
      indebtedness of Charter Holdco. If our membership interest in Charter Holdco
      were to constitute less than 50% of the voting securities issued by Charter
      Holdco, then our interest in Charter Holdco could be deemed an "investment
      security" for purposes of the Investment Company Act. This may occur, for
      example, if a court determines that the Class B common stock is no longer
      entitled to special voting rights and, in accordance with the terms of the
      Charter Holdco limited liability company agreement, our membership units in
      Charter Holdco were to lose their special voting privileges. A determination
      that such interest was an investment security could cause us to be deemed to
      be
      an investment company under the Investment Company Act, unless an exemption
      from
      registration were available or we were to obtain an order of the Securities
      and
      Exchange Commission excluding or exempting us from registration under the
      Investment Company Act.

If
      anything were to happen which would cause us to be deemed an investment company,
      the Investment Company Act would impose significant restrictions on us,
      including severe limitations on our ability to borrow money, to issue additional
      capital stock and to transact business with affiliates. In addition, because
      our
      operations are very different from those of the typical registered investment
      company, regulation under the Investment Company Act could affect us in other
      ways that are extremely difficult to predict. In sum, if we were deemed to
      be an
      investment company it could become impractical for us to continue our business
      as currently conducted and our growth, our financial condition and our results
      of operations could suffer materially.

If
      a court determines that the Class B common stock is no longer entitled to
      special voting rights, we would lose our rights to manage Charter Holdco. In
      addition to the investment company risks discussed above, this could materially
      impact the value of the Class A common stock.

If
      a
      court determines that the Class B common stock is no longer entitled to special
      voting rights, Charter would no longer have a controlling voting interest in,
      and would lose its right to manage, Charter Holdco. If this were to occur:

·

we
                would retain our proportional equity interest in Charter Holdco but
                would
                lose all of our powers to direct the management and affairs of Charter
                Holdco and its subsidiaries; and


·

we
                would become strictly a passive investment vehicle and would be treated
                under the Investment Company Act as an investment
                company.

This
      result, as well as the impact of being treated under the Investment Company
      Act
      as an investment company, could materially adversely impact:

Risks
      Related to Mr. Allen’s Controlling Position

The
      failure by Mr. Allen to maintain a minimum voting and economic interest in
      us
      could trigger a change of control default under our subsidiary’s credit
      facilities.

The
      Charter Operating credit facilities provide that the failure by Mr. Allen to
      maintain a 35% direct or indirect voting interest in the applicable borrower
      would result in a change of control default. Such a default could result in
      the
      acceleration of repayment of our and our subsidiaries’ indebtedness, including
      borrowings under the Charter Operating credit facilities.

Mr.
      Allen controls our stockholder voting and may have interests that conflict
      with
      your interests.

Mr.
      Allen
      has the ability to control us. Through his control as of December 31, 2005
      of
      approximately 90% of the voting power of our capital stock, Mr. Allen is
      entitled to elect all but one of our board members and effectively has the
      voting power to elect the remaining board member as well. Mr. Allen thus has
      the
      ability to control fundamental corporate transactions requiring equity holder
      approval, including, but not limited to, the election of all of our directors,
      approval of merger transactions involving us and the sale of all or
      substantially all of our assets.

Mr.
      Allen
      is not restricted from investing in, and has invested in, and engaged in, other
      businesses involving or related to the operation of cable television systems,
      video programming, high-speed Internet service, telephone or business and
      financial transactions conducted through broadband interactivity and Internet
      services. Mr. Allen may also engage in other businesses that compete or may
      in
      the future compete with us.

Mr.
      Allen’s control over our management and affairs could create conflicts of
      interest if he is faced with decisions that could have different implications
      for him, us and the holders of our Class A common stock. Further, Mr. Allen
      could effectively cause us to enter into contracts with another entity in which
      he owns an interest or to decline a transaction into which he (or another entity
      in which he owns an interest) ultimately enters.

Current
      and future agreements between us and either Mr. Allen or his affiliates may
      not
      be the result of arm’s-length negotiations. Consequently, such agreements may be
      less favorable to us than agreements that we could otherwise have entered into
      with unaffiliated third parties. See "Item 13.

—

Certain
      Relationships and Related Transactions."

We
      are not permitted to engage in any business activity other than the cable
      transmission of video, audio and data unless Mr. Allen authorizes us to pursue
      that particular business activity, which could adversely affect our ability
      to
      offer new products and services outside of the cable transmission business
      and
      to enter into new businesses, and could adversely affect our growth, financial
      condition and results of operations.

Our
      certificate of incorporation and Charter Holdco’s limited liability company
      agreement provide that Charter and Charter Holdco and our subsidiaries, cannot
      engage in any business activity outside the cable transmission business


except
      for specified businesses. This will be the case unless Mr. Allen consents
      to our engaging in the business activity. The cable transmission business means
      the business of transmitting video, audio (including telephone services), and
      data over cable television systems owned, operated or managed by us from time
      to
      time. These provisions may limit our ability to take advantage of attractive
      business opportunities.

The
      loss of Mr. Allen’s services could adversely affect our ability to manage our
      business.

Mr.
      Allen
      is Chairman of our board of directors and provides strategic guidance and other
      services to us. If we were to lose his services, our growth, financial condition
      and results of operations could be adversely impacted.

The
      special tax allocation provisions of the Charter Holdco limited liability
      company agreement may cause us in some circumstances to pay more taxes than
      if
      the special tax allocation provisions were not in
      effect.

Charter
      Holdco’s limited liability company agreement provided that through the end of
      2003, net tax losses (such net tax losses being determined under the federal
      income tax rules for determining capital accounts) of Charter Holdco that would
      otherwise have been allocated to us based generally on our percentage ownership
      of outstanding common membership units of Charter Holdco would instead be
      allocated to the membership units held by Vulcan Cable III Inc. ("Vulcan Cable")
      and Charter Investment, Inc. ("CII"). The purpose of these special tax
      allocation provisions was to allow Mr. Allen to take advantage, for tax
      purposes, the losses generated by Charter Holdco during such period. In some
      situations, these special tax allocation provisions could result in our having
      to pay taxes in an amount that is more or less than if Charter Holdco had
      allocated net tax losses to its members based generally on the percentage of
      outstanding common membership units owned by such members. For further
      discussion on the details of the tax allocation provisions see "Item 7.
      Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
      Operations — Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates — Income Taxes."

The
      recent issuance of our Class A common stock, as well as possible future
      conversions of our convertible notes, significantly increase the risk that
      we
      will experience an ownership change in the future for tax purposes, resulting
      in
      a material limitation on the use of a substantial amount of our existing net
      operating loss carryforwards.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, we had approximately $5.9 billion of tax net operating losses
      (resulting in a gross deferred tax asset of approximately $2.4 billion) expiring
      in the years 2006 through 2025. Due to uncertainties in projected future taxable
      income, valuation allowances have been established against the gross deferred
      tax assets for book accounting purposes except for deferred benefits available
      to offset certain deferred tax liabilities. Currently, such tax net operating
      losses can accumulate and be used to offset any of our future taxable income.
      An
      "ownership change" as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of
      1986, as amended, would place significant limitations, on an annual basis,
      on
      the use of such net operating losses to offset any future taxable income we
      may
      generate. Such limitations, in conjunction with the net operating loss
      expiration provisions, could effectively eliminate our ability to use a
      substantial portion of our net operating losses to offset future taxable income.

The
      issuance of up to a total of 150 million shares of our Class A common stock
      (of
      which a total of 116.9 million have been issued through February 2006) offered
      pursuant to a share lending agreement executed by Charter in connection with
      the
      issuance of the 5.875% convertible senior notes in November 2004, as well as
      possible future conversions of our convertible notes, significantly increases
      the risk that we will experience an ownership change in the future for tax
      purposes, resulting in a material limitation on the use of a substantial amount
      of our existing net operating loss carryforwards. As of December 31, 2005,
      the
      issuance of shares associated with the share lending agreement did not result
      in
      our experiencing an ownership change. However, future transactions and the
      timing of such transactions could cause an ownership change. Such transactions
      include additional issuances of common stock by us (including but not limited
      to
      issuances upon future conversion of our 5.875% convertible senior notes or
      as
      issued in the settlement of derivative class action litigation), reacquisitions
      of the borrowed shares by us, or acquisitions or sales of shares by certain
      holders of our shares, including persons who have held, currently hold, or
      accumulate in the future five percent or more of our outstanding stock
      (including upon an exchange by Mr. Allen or his affiliates, directly or
      indirectly, of membership units of Charter Holdco into our Class A common
      stock). Many of the foregoing transactions are beyond our control.

Risks
      Related to Regulatory and Legislative Matters

Our
      business is subject to extensive governmental legislation and regulation, which
      could adversely affect our business.

Regulation
      of the cable industry has increased cable operators’ administrative and
      operational expenses and limited their revenues. Cable operators are subject
      to,
      among other things:


·

rules
                governing the provision of cable equipment and compatibility with
                new
                digital technologies;

·

rules
                and regulations relating to subscriber
                privacy;

·

limited
                rate regulation;

·

requirements
                governing when a cable system must carry a particular broadcast station
                and when it must first obtain consent to carry a broadcast
                station;

·

rules
                for franchise renewals and transfers;
                and

·

other
                requirements covering a variety of operational areas such as equal
                employment opportunity, technical standards and customer service
                requirements.

Additionally,
      many aspects of these regulations are currently the subject of judicial
      proceedings and administrative or legislative proposals. There are also ongoing
      efforts to amend or expand the federal, state and local regulation of some
      of
      our cable systems, which may compound the regulatory risks we already face.
      Certain states and localities are considering new telecommunications taxes
      that
      could increase operating expenses.

Our
      cable systems are operated under franchises that are subject to non-renewal
      or
      termination. The failure to renew a franchise in one or more key markets could
      adversely affect our business.

Our
      cable
      systems generally operate pursuant to franchises, permits and similar
      authorizations issued by a state or local governmental authority controlling
      the
      public rights-of-way. Many franchises establish comprehensive facilities and
      service requirements, as well as specific customer service standards and
      monetary penalties for non-compliance. In many cases, franchises are terminable
      if the franchisee fails to comply with significant provisions set forth in
      the
      franchise agreement governing system operations. Franchises are generally
      granted for fixed terms and must be periodically renewed. Local franchising
      authorities may resist granting a renewal if either past performance or the
      prospective operating proposal is considered inadequate. Franchise authorities
      often demand concessions or other commitments as a condition to renewal. In
      some
      instances, franchises have not been renewed at expiration, and we have operated
      and are operating under either temporary operating agreements or without a
      license while negotiating renewal terms with the local franchising authorities.
      Approximately 11% of our franchises, covering approximately 13% of our analog
      video customers, were expired as of December 31, 2005. Approximately 7% of
      additional franchises, covering approximately an additional 9% of our analog
      video customers, will expire on or before December 31, 2006, if not renewed
      prior to expiration.

We
      cannot
      assure you that we will be able to comply with all significant provisions of
      our
      franchise agreements and certain of our franchisors have from time to time
      alleged that we have not complied with these agreements. Additionally, although
      historically we have renewed our franchises without incurring significant costs,
      we cannot assure you that we will be able to renew, or to renew as favorably,
      our franchises in the future. A termination of or a sustained failure to renew
      a
      franchise in one or more key markets could adversely affect our business in
      the
      affected geographic area.

Our
      cable systems are operated under franchises that are non-exclusive. Accordingly,
      local franchising authorities can grant additional franchises and create
      competition in market areas where none existed previously, resulting in
      overbuilds, which could adversely affect results of
      operations.

Our
      cable
      systems are operated under non-exclusive franchises granted by local franchising
      authorities. Consequently, local franchising authorities can grant additional
      franchises to competitors in the same geographic area or operate their own
      cable
      systems. In addition, certain telephone companies are seeking authority to
      operate in local communities without first obtaining a local franchise. As
      a
      result, competing operators may build systems in areas in which we hold
      franchises. In some cases municipal utilities may legally compete with us
      without obtaining a franchise from the local franchising authority.

Different
      legislative proposals have been introduced in the United States Congress and
      in
      some state legislatures that would greatly streamline cable franchising. This
      legislation is intended to facilitate entry by new competitors,


particularly
      local telephone companies. Such legislation has already passed in at least
      one
      state but is now subject to court challenge. Although various legislative
      proposals provide some regulatory relief for incumbent cable operators, these
      proposals are generally viewed as being more favorable to new entrants due
      to a
      number of varying factors including efforts to withhold streamlined cable
      franchising from incumbents until after the expiration of their existing
      franchises. To the extent incumbent cable operators are not able to avail
      themselves of this streamlined franchising process, such operators may continue
      to be subject to more onerous franchise requirements at the local level than
      new
      entrants. The FCC recently initiated a proceeding to determine whether local
      franchising authorities are impeding the deployment of competitive cable
      services through unreasonable franchising requirements and whether such
      impediments should be preempted. At this time, we are not able to determine
      what
      impact such proceeding may have on us.

The
      existence of more than one cable system operating in the same territory is
      referred to as an overbuild. These overbuilds could adversely affect our growth,
      financial condition and results of operations by creating or increasing
      competition. As of December 31, 2005, we are aware of overbuild situations
      impacting approximately 6% of our estimated homes passed, and potential
      overbuild situations in areas servicing approximately an additional 4% of our
      estimated homes passed. Additional overbuild situations may occur in other
      systems.

Local
      franchise authorities have the ability to impose additional regulatory
      constraints on our business, which could further increase our
      expenses.

In
      addition to the franchise agreement, cable authorities in some jurisdictions
      have adopted cable regulatory ordinances that further regulate the operation
      of
      cable systems. This additional regulation increases the cost of operating our
      business. We cannot assure you that the local franchising authorities will
      not
      impose new and more restrictive requirements. Local franchising authorities
      also
      have the power to reduce rates and order refunds on the rates charged for basic
      services.

Further
      regulation of the cable industry could cause us to delay or cancel service
      or
      programming enhancements or impair our ability to raise rates to cover our
      increasing costs, resulting in increased losses.

Currently,
      rate regulation is strictly limited to the basic service tier and associated
      equipment and installation activities. However, the FCC and the U.S. Congress
      continue to be concerned that cable rate increases are exceeding inflation.
      It
      is possible that either the FCC or the U.S. Congress will again restrict the
      ability of cable system operators to implement rate increases. Should this
      occur, it would impede our ability to raise our rates. If we are unable to
      raise
      our rates in response to increasing costs, our losses would increase.

There
      has
      been considerable legislative and regulatory interest in requiring cable
      operators to offer historically bundled programming services on an á la carte
      basis or to at least offer a separately available child-friendly "Family Tier."
      It is possible that new marketing restrictions could be adopted in the future.
      Such restrictions could adversely affect our operations.

Actions
      by pole owners might subject us to significantly increased pole attachment
      costs.

Pole
      attachments are cable wires that are attached to poles. Cable system attachments
      to public utility poles historically have been regulated at the federal or
      state
      level, generally resulting in favorable pole attachment rates for attachments
      used to provide cable service. The FCC clarified that a cable operator’s
      favorable pole rates are not endangered by the provision of Internet access,
      and
      that approach ultimately was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States.
      Despite the existing regulatory regime, utility pole owners in many areas are
      attempting to raise pole attachment fees and impose additional costs on cable
      operators and others. In addition, the favorable pole attachment rates afforded
      cable operators under federal law can be increased by utility companies if
      the
      operator provides telecommunications services, as well as cable service, over
      cable wires attached to utility poles. Any significant increased costs could
      have a material adverse impact on our profitability and discourage system
      upgrades and the introduction of new products and services.

We
      may be required to provide access to our networks to other Internet service
      providers, which could significantly increase our competition and adversely
      affect our ability to provide new products and
      services.

A
      number
      of companies, including independent Internet service providers, or ISPs, have
      requested local authorities and the FCC to require cable operators to provide
      non-discriminatory access to cable’s broadband infrastructure, so that these
      companies may deliver Internet services directly to customers over cable
      facilities. In a June 2005 ruling, commonly referred to as

Brand
      X

,
      the
      Supreme Court upheld an FCC decision (and overruled a conflicting Ninth


Circuit
      opinion) making it much less likely that any nondiscriminatory "open access"
      requirements (which are generally associated with common carrier regulation
      of
      "telecommunications services") will be imposed on the cable industry by local,
      state or federal authorities. The Supreme Court held that the FCC was correct
      in
      classifying cable provided Internet service as an "information service," rather
      than a "telecommunications service." This favorable regulatory classification
      limits the ability of various governmental authorities to impose open access
      requirements on cable-provided Internet service. Given how recently

Brand
      X

was
      decided, however, the nature of any legislative or regulatory response remains
      uncertain. The imposition of open access requirements could materially affect
      our business.

If
      we
      were required to allocate a portion of our bandwidth capacity to other Internet
      service providers, we believe that it would impair our ability to use our
      bandwidth in ways that would generate maximum revenues.

Changes
      in channel carriage regulations could impose significant additional costs on
      us.

Cable
      operators also face significant regulation of their channel carriage. They
      currently can be required to devote substantial capacity to the carriage of
      programming that they would not carry voluntarily, including certain local
      broadcast signals, local public, educational and government access programming,
      and unaffiliated commercial leased access programming. This carriage burden
      could increase in the future, particularly if cable systems were required to
      carry both the analog and digital versions of local broadcast signals (dual
      carriage) or to carry multiple program streams included with a single digital
      broadcast transmission (multicast carriage). Additional government-mandated
      broadcast carriage obligations could disrupt existing programming commitments,
      interfere with our preferred use of limited channel capacity and limit our
      ability to offer services that would maximize customer appeal and revenue
      potential. Although the FCC issued a decision in February 2005, confirming
      an
      earlier ruling against mandating either dual carriage or multicast carriage,
      that decision has been appealed. In addition, the FCC could reverse its own
      ruling or Congress could legislate additional carriage obligations.

Offering
      voice communications service may subject us to additional regulatory burdens,
      causing us to incur additional costs.

In
      2002,
      we began to offer voice communications services on a limited basis over our
      broadband network. We continue to explore development and deployment of Voice
      over Internet Protocol or VoIP services. The regulatory requirements applicable
      to VoIP service are unclear although the FCC has declared that certain VoIP
      services are not subject to traditional state public utility regulation. The
      full extent of the FCC preemption of VoIP services is not yet clear. Expanding
      our offering of these services may require us to obtain certain authorizations,
      including federal, state and local licenses. We may not be able to obtain such
      authorizations in a timely manner, or conditions could be imposed upon such
      licenses or authorizations that may not be favorable to us. Furthermore,
      telecommunications companies generally are subject to significant regulation,
      including payments to the Federal Universal Service Fund and the intercarrier
      compensation regime. In addition, pole attachment rates are higher for providers
      of telecommunications services than for providers of cable service. If there
      were to be a final legal determination by the FCC, a state Public Utility
      Commission, or appropriate court that VoIP services are subject to these higher
      rates, our pole attachment costs could increase significantly, which could
      adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Properties.

Our
      principal physical assets consist of cable distribution plant and equipment,
      including signal receiving, encoding and decoding devices, headend reception
      facilities, distribution systems and customer drop equipment for each of our
      cable systems.

Our
      cable
      plant and related equipment are generally attached to utility poles under pole
      rental agreements with local public utilities and telephone companies, and
      in
      certain locations are buried in underground ducts or trenches. We own or lease
      real property for signal reception sites and own most of our service
      vehicles.

Historically,
      our subsidiaries have owned the real property and buildings for our data
      centers, customer contact centers and our divisional administrative offices.
      Since early 2003 we have reduced our total real estate portfolio square footage
      by approximately 17% and have decreased our operating annual lease costs by
      approximately 30%.


In
      addition, Charter has sold $15 million worth of surplus land and buildings.
      We
      plan to continue to reduce costs and excess capacity in this area through
      consolidation of sites within our system footprints. Our subsidiaries generally
      have leased space for business offices throughout our operating divisions.
      Our
      headend and tower locations are located on owned or leased parcels of land,
      and
      we generally own the towers on which our equipment is located. Charter Holdco
      owns the real property and building for our principal executive offices.

The
      physical components of our cable systems require maintenance as well as periodic
      upgrades to support the new services and products we introduce. See
      "Item 1. Business - Our Network Technology." We believe that our properties
      are generally in good operating condition and are suitable for our business
      operations.

Item 3.

Legal
      Proceedings.

Charter
      is a party to lawsuits and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of
      conducting its business. In the opinion of management, after taking into account
      recorded liabilities, the outcome of these lawsuits and claims are not expected
      to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition,
      results of operations or our liquidity.

Holders

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, there were 4,516 holders of record of our Class A common
      stock, one holder of our Class B common stock, and 4 holders of record of our
      Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock.

(C)

Dividends

Charter
      has not paid stock or cash dividends on any of its common stock, and we do
      not
      intend to pay cash dividends on common stock for the foreseeable future. We
      intend to retain future earnings, if any, to finance our business.

Charter
      Holdco may make pro rata distributions to all holders of its common membership
      units, including Charter. Covenants in the indentures and credit agreements
      governing the debt obligations of Charter Communications Holdings and its
      subsidiaries restrict their ability to make distributions to us, and
      accordingly, limit our ability to declare or pay cash dividends. See
      "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
      Results of Operations."

(D) Recent
      Sales of Unregistered Securities

During
      2005, there were no unregistered sales of securities of the registrant other
      than those previously reported on a Form 10-Q or Form 8-K.

For
      information regarding securities issued under our equity compensation plans,

In
                2002, we restated our consolidated financial statements for 2001
                and prior
                years. The restatements were primarily related to the following
                categories: (i) launch incentives from programmers;
                (ii) customer incentives and inducements; (iii) capitalized
                labor and overhead costs; (iv) customer acquisition costs;
                (v) rebuild and upgrade of cable systems; (vi) deferred tax
                liabilities/franchise assets; and (vii) other adjustments. These
                adjustments reduced revenue for the year ended December 31, 2001 by
                $146 million. Our consolidated net loss decreased by $11 million
                for the year ended December 31, 2001.

(c)

Minority
                interest represents the percentage of Charter Holdco not owned by
                Charter,
                plus preferred membership interests in CC VIII. Reported losses allocated
                to minority interest on the statement of operations are limited to
                the
                extent of any remaining minority interest on the balance sheet related
                to
                Charter Holdco. Because minority interest in Charter Holdco was
                substantially eliminated at December 31, 2003, beginning in 2004,
                Charter
                began to absorb substantially all losses before income taxes that
                otherwise would have been allocated to minority interest, resulting
                in an
                approximate additional $454 million and $2.4 billion of net losses
                for the
                years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Under our existing
                capital structure, Charter will absorb all future losses. Paul G.
                Allen
                indirectly holds the preferred membership units in CC VIII. There
                was an
                issue regarding the ultimate ownership of the CC VIII membership
                interest
                and this dispute was settled October 31, 2005. See "Item 13. Certain
                Relationships and Related Transactions — Transactions Arising Out of Our
                Organizational Structure and Mr. Allen’s Investment in Charter and Its

Introduction

We
      continue to pursue opportunities to improve our liquidity.

Our
      efforts in this regard have resulted in the completion of a number of financing
      transactions in 2005 and 2006, as follows:

·

the
                January 2006 sale by our subsidiaries, CCH II, LLC ("CCH II") and
                CCH II
                Capital Corp., of an additional $450 million principal amount of
                their
                10.250% senior notes due 2010;

·

the October 2005 entry by our subsidiaries, CCO
              Holdings
              and CCO Holdings Capital Corp.,

as
              guarantor thereunder, into a $600 million senior bridge loan agreement
              with various lenders (which was reduced to $435 million as a result
              of the
              issuance of CCH II notes);

·

the
                September 2005 exchange by Charter Holdings, CCH I and CIH of
                approximately $6.8 billion in total principal amount of outstanding
                debt
                securities of Charter Holdings in a private placement for new debt
                securities;

·

the
                August 2005 sale by our subsidiaries, CCO Holdings and CCO Holdings
                Capital Corp., of $300 million of 8 3/4% senior notes due
                2013;

·

the
                March and June 2005 issuance of $333 million of Charter Operating
                notes in
                exchange for $346 million of Charter Holdings
                notes;

·

the repurchase during 2005 of $136 million of Charter’s
              4.75% convertible senior notes due 2006 leaving $20 million in principal
              amount outstanding; and

·

the
                March 2005 redemption of all of CC V Holdings, LLC’s outstanding 11.875%
                senior discount notes due 2008 at a total cost of $122
                million.


During
      the years 1999 through 2001, we grew significantly, principally through
      acquisitions of other cable businesses financed by debt and, to a lesser extent,
      equity. We have no current plans to pursue any significant acquisitions.
      However, we may pursue exchanges of non-strategic assets or divestitures, such
      as the sale of cable systems to Atlantic Broadband Finance, LLC. We therefore
      do
      not believe that our historical growth rates are accurate indicators of future
      growth.

The
      industry's and our most significant operational challenges include competition
      from DBS providers and DSL service providers. See "Item 1. Business —
Competition.'' We believe that competition from DBS has resulted in net analog
      video customer losses and decreased growth rates for digital video customers.
      Competition from DSL providers combined with limited opportunities to expand
      our
      customer base now that approximately 33% of our analog video customers subscribe
      to our high-speed Internet services has resulted in decreased growth rates
      for
      high-speed Internet customers. In the recent past, we have grown revenues by
      offsetting video customer losses with price increases and sales of incremental
      advanced services such as high-speed Internet, video on demand, digital video
      recorders and high definition television. We expect to continue to grow revenues
      through price increases and through continued growth in high-speed Internet
      and
      incremental new services including telephone, high definition television, VOD
      and DVR service.

Historically,
      our ability to fund operations and investing activities has depended on our
      continued access to credit under our credit facilities. We expect we will
      continue to borrow under our credit facilities from time to time to fund cash
      needs. The occurrence of an event of default under our credit facilities could
      result in borrowings from these facilities being unavailable to us and could,
      in
      the event of a payment default or acceleration, trigger events of default under
      our outstanding notes and would have a material adverse effect on us.
      Approximately $30 million of indebtedness under our credit facilities is
      scheduled to mature during 2006. We expect to fund payment of such indebtedness
      through borrowings under our revolving credit facilities.

Overview
      of Operations

Approximately
      86% of our revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
      respectively, are attributable to monthly subscription fees charged to customers
      for our video, high-speed Internet, telephone and commercial services provided
      by our cable systems. Generally, these customer subscriptions may be
      discontinued by the customer at any time. The remaining 14% of revenue is
      derived primarily from advertising revenues, franchise fee revenues, which
      are
      collected by us but then paid to local franchising authorities, pay-per-view
      and
      VOD programming where users are charged a fee for individual programs viewed,
      installation or reconnection fees charged to customers to commence or reinstate
      service, and commissions related to the sale of merchandise by home shopping
      services. We have increased revenues during the past three years, primarily
      through the sale of digital video and high-speed Internet services to new and
      existing customers and price increases on video services offset in part by
      dispositions of systems. Going forward, our goal is to increase revenues by
      offsetting video customer losses with price increases and sales of incremental
      advanced services such as telephone, high-speed Internet, video on demand,
      digital video recorders and high definition television. See "Item 1. Business
—
Sales and Marketing" for more details.

Our
      success in our efforts to grow revenues and improve margins will be impacted
      by
      our ability to compete against companies with easier access to financing,
      greater personnel resources, greater brand name recognition, long-established
      relationships with regulatory authorities and customers, and, often fewer
      regulatory burdens. Additionally, controlling our cost of operations is
      critical, particularly cable programming costs, which have historically
      increased at rates in excess of inflation and are expected to continue to
      increase. See "Item 1. Business — Programming" for more details. We are
      attempting to control our costs of operations by maintaining strict controls
      on
      expenses. More specifically, we are focused on managing our cost structure
      by
      managing our workforce to control cost increases and improve productivity,
      and
      leveraging our size in purchasing activities.

Our
      expenses primarily consist of operating costs, selling, general and
      administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization expense and interest
      expense. Operating costs primarily include programming costs, the cost of our
      workforce, cable service related expenses, advertising sales costs, franchise
      fees and expenses related to customer billings. Our loss from operations
      decreased from $2.0 billion for year ended December 31, 2004 to income of $343
      million for the year ended December 31, 2005. We had a positive operating margin
      (defined as income (loss) from operations divided by revenues) of 7% and a
      negative operating margin of 41% for the years ended December 31, 2005 and
      2004,
      respectively. The improvement from a loss from operations and negative operating
      margin to income from operations and positive operating margin for the year
      end
      December 31, 2005 is principally due to the impairment of franchises of $2.4
      billion recorded in the third quarter of 2004 which did not recur in 2005.
      For
      the year ended December 31, 2003, income from operations was $516 million and
      for the year ended December 31,


2004,
      our
      loss from operations was $2.0 billion. We had a negative operating margin of
      41%
      for the year ended December 31, 2004, whereas for the year ending December
      31,
      2003, we had positive operating margin of 11%. The decline in income from
      operations and operating margin for the year end December 31, 2004 is
      principally due to the impairment of franchises of $2.4 billion recorded in
      the
      third quarter of 2004. The year ended December 31, 2004 also includes a gain
      on
      the sale of certain cable systems to Atlantic Broadband Finance, LLC which
      is
      substantially offset by an increase in option compensation expense and special
      charges when compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. Although we do not
      expect charges for impairment in the future of comparable magnitude, potential
      charges could occur due to changes in market conditions.

We
          have a
          history of net losses. Further, we expect to continue to report net losses
          for
          the foreseeable future. Our net losses are principally attributable to
          insufficient revenue to cover the interest costs we incur because of our
          high
          level of debt, the depreciation expenses that we incur resulting from the
          capital investments we have made in our cable properties, and the amortization
          and impairment of our franchise intangibles. We expect that these expenses
          (other than impairment of franchises) will remain significant, and we therefore
          expect to continue to report net losses for the foreseeable future.
          Historically, a portion of the losses were allocated to minority interest,
          however, at December 31, 2003, the minority interest in Charter Holdco
          was
          substantially eliminated by these loss allocations. Beginning in 2004,
          we absorb
          substantially all future losses before income taxes that otherwise would
          have
          been allocated to minority interest, resulting in an additional $454 million
          and
          $2.4 billion of net losses for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
          respectively. Under our existing capital structure, future losses will
          continue
          to be absorbed by Charter. The remaining minority interest relates to CC
          VIII
          and the related profit and loss allocations for the CC VIII interests.

Critical
      Accounting Policies and Estimates

Certain
      of our accounting policies require our management to make difficult, subjective
      or complex judgments. Management has discussed these policies with the Audit
      Committee of Charter’s board of directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed
      the following disclosure. We consider the following policies to be the most
      critical in understanding the estimates, assumptions and judgments that are
      involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could
      affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows:

·

Capitalization
                of labor and overhead costs;

·

Useful
                lives of property, plant and
                equipment;

·

Impairment
                of property, plant, and equipment, franchises, and
                goodwill;

·

Income
                taxes; and

·

Litigation.

In
      addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require
      estimates or judgment but are not deemed critical, such as the allowance for
      doubtful accounts, but changes in judgment, or estimates in these other items
      could also have a material impact on our financial statements.

Capitalization
      of labor and overhead costs.

The
      cable
      industry is capital intensive, and a large portion of our resources are spent
      on
      capital activities associated with extending, rebuilding, and upgrading our
      cable network. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the net carrying amount of
      our property, plant and equipment (consisting primarily of cable network assets)
      was approximately $5.8 billion (representing 36% of total assets) and $6.3
      billion (representing 36% of total assets), respectively. Total capital
      expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were
      approximately $1.1 billion, $924 million and $854 million, respectively.

Costs
      associated with network construction, initial customer installations (including
      initial installations of new or advanced services), installation refurbishments
      and the addition of network equipment necessary to provide new or advanced
      services are capitalized.  While our capitalization is based on specific
      activities, once capitalized, we track these costs by fixed asset category
      at
      the cable system level and not on a specific asset basis.  Costs
      capitalized as part of initial customer installations include materials, direct
      labor, and certain indirect costs ("overhead"). These indirect costs are
      associated with the activities of personnel who assist in connecting and
      activating the new service and consist of compensation and overhead costs
      associated with these support functions. The costs of disconnecting service
      at a
      customer’s dwelling or reconnecting service to a previously installed dwelling
      are charged to operating expense in the period incurred. Costs for repairs
      and
      maintenance are charged to operating expense as incurred, while equipment
      replacement and betterments, including replacement of cable drops from the
      pole
      to the dwelling, are capitalized.


We
      make
      judgments regarding the installation and construction activities to be
      capitalized. We capitalize direct labor and overhead using standards developed
      from actual costs and applicable operational data. We calculate standards for
      items such as the labor rates, overhead rates and the actual amount of time
      required to perform a capitalizable activity. For example, the standard amounts
      of time required to perform capitalizable activities are based on studies of
      the
      time required to perform such activities. Overhead rates are established based
      on an analysis of the nature of costs incurred in support of capitalizable
      activities and a determination of the portion of costs that is directly
      attributable to capitalizable activities. The impact of changes that resulted
      from these studies were not significant in the periods presented.

Labor
      costs directly associated with capital projects are capitalized. We capitalize
      direct labor costs associated with personnel based upon the specific time
      devoted to network construction and customer installation activities.
      Capitalizable activities performed in connection with customer installations
      include such activities as:

·

Dispatching
                a "truck roll" to the customer’s dwelling for service
                connection;

·

Verification
                of serviceability to the customer’s dwelling (i.e., determining whether
                the customer’s dwelling is capable of receiving service by our cable
                network and/or receiving advanced or Internet
                services);

·

Customer
                premise activities performed by in-house field technicians and third-party
                contractors in connection with customer installations, installation
                of
                network equipment in connection with the installation of expanded
                services
                and equipment replacement and betterment;
                and

·

Verifying
                the integrity of the customer’s network connection by initiating test
                signals downstream from the headend to the customer’s digital set-top
                terminal.

Judgment
      is required to determine the extent to which overhead is incurred as a result
      of
      specific capital activities, and therefore should be capitalized. The primary
      costs that are included in the determination of the overhead rate are
      (i) employee benefits and payroll taxes associated with capitalized direct
      labor, (ii) direct variable costs associated with capitalizable activities,
      consisting primarily of installation and construction vehicle costs,
      (iii) the cost of support personnel, such as dispatch, that directly assist
      with capitalizable installation activities, and (iv) indirect costs
      directly attributable to capitalizable activities.

While
      we
      believe our existing capitalization policies are appropriate, a significant
      change in the nature or extent of our system activities could affect
      management’s judgment about the extent to which we should capitalize direct
      labor or overhead in the future. We monitor the appropriateness of our
      capitalization policies, and perform updates to our internal studies on an
      ongoing basis to determine whether facts or circumstances warrant a change
      to
      our capitalization policies. We capitalized internal direct labor and overhead
      of $190 million, $164 million and $174 million, respectively, for the years
      ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Capitalized internal direct labor
      and overhead costs have increased in 2005 as a result of the use of more
      internal labor for capitalizable installations rather than third party
      contractors.

Useful
      lives of property, plant and equipment.

We
      evaluate the appropriateness of estimated useful lives assigned to our property,
      plant and equipment, based on annual analyses of such useful lives, and revise
      such lives to the extent warranted by changing facts and circumstances. Any
      changes in estimated useful lives as a result of these analyses, which were
      not
      significant in the periods presented, will be reflected prospectively beginning
      in the period in which the study is completed. The effect of a one-year decrease
      in the weighted average remaining useful life of our property, plant and
      equipment would be an increase in depreciation expense for the year ended
      December 31, 2005 of approximately $232 million. The effect of a one-year
      increase in the weighted average useful life of our property, plant and
      equipment would be a decrease in depreciation expense for the year ended
      December 31, 2005 of approximately $172 million.

Depreciation
      expense related to property, plant and equipment totaled $1.5 billion, $1.5
      billion and $1.5 billion, representing approximately 31%, 21% and 34% of costs
      and expenses, for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
      respectively. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line composite method
      over management’s estimate of the estimated useful lives of the related assets

Impairment
      of property, plant and equipment, franchises and goodwill.

As
      discussed above, the net carrying value of our property, plant and equipment
      is
      significant. We also have recorded a significant amount of cost related to
      franchises, pursuant to which we are granted the right to operate our cable
      distribution network throughout our service areas. The net carrying value of
      franchises as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 was approximately $9.8 billion
      (representing 60% of total assets) and $9.9 billion (representing 56% of total
      assets), respectively. Furthermore, our noncurrent assets include approximately
      $52 million of goodwill.

We
      adopted SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill
      and Other Intangible Assets,

on
      January 1, 2002. SFAS No. 142 requires that franchise intangible
      assets that meet specified indefinite-life criteria no longer be amortized
      against earnings, but instead must be tested for impairment annually based
      on
      valuations, or more frequently as warranted by events or changes in
      circumstances. In determining whether our franchises have an indefinite-life,
      we
      considered the exclusivity of the franchise, the expected costs of franchise
      renewals, and the technological state of the associated cable systems with
      a
      view to whether or not we are in compliance with any technology upgrading
      requirements. We have concluded that as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003
      more
      than 99% of our franchises qualify for indefinite-life treatment under SFAS
      No. 142, and that less than one percent of our franchises do not qualify
      for indefinite-life treatment due to technological or operational factors that
      limit their lives. Costs of finite-lived franchises, along with costs associated
      with franchise renewals, are amortized on a straight-line basis over 10 years,
      which represents management’s best estimate of the average remaining useful
      lives of such franchises. Franchise amortization expense was $4 million, $4
      million and $9 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and
      2003, respectively. We expect that amortization expense on franchise assets
      will
      be approximately $2 million annually for each of the next five years. Actual
      amortization expense in future periods could differ from these estimates as
      a
      result of new intangible asset acquisitions or divestitures, changes in useful
      lives and other relevant factors. Our goodwill is also deemed to have an
      indefinite life under SFAS No. 142.

SFAS
      No. 144,

Accounting
      for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

,
      requires that we evaluate the recoverability of our property, plant and
      equipment and franchise assets which did not qualify for indefinite-life
      treatment under SFAS No. 142 upon the occurrence of events or changes in
      circumstances which indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
      recoverable. Such events or changes in circumstances could include such factors
      as the impairment of our indefinite-life franchises under SFAS No. 142, changes
      in technological advances, fluctuations in the fair value of such assets,
      adverse changes in relationships with local franchise authorities, adverse
      changes in market conditions or a deterioration of operating results. Under
      SFAS
      No. 144, a long-lived asset is deemed impaired when the carrying amount of
      the
      asset exceeds the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with
      the
      asset. No impairments of long-lived assets to be held and used were recorded
      in
      the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 or 2003, however, approximately $39
      million of impairment on assets held for sale was recorded for the year ended
      December 31, 2005. We were also required to evaluate the recoverability of
      our
      indefinite-life franchises, as well as goodwill, as of January 1, 2002 upon
      adoption of SFAS No. 142, and on an annual basis or more frequently as
      deemed necessary.

Under
      both SFAS No. 144 and SFAS No. 142, if an asset is determined to be impaired,
      it
      is required to be written down to its estimated fair market value. We determine
      fair market value based on estimated discounted future cash flows, using
      reasonable and appropriate assumptions that are consistent with internal
      forecasts. Our assumptions include these and other factors: penetration rates
      for analog and digital video, high-speed Internet and telephone, revenue growth
      rates, expected operating margins and capital expenditures. Considerable
      management judgment is necessary to estimate future cash flows, and such
      estimates include inherent uncertainties, including those relating to the timing
      and amount of future cash flows and the discount rate used in the calculation.

Based
      on
      the guidance prescribed in

Emerging
      Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 02-7,

Unit
      of Accounting for Testing of Impairment of Indefinite-Lived Intangible
      Assets

,

franchises
      were aggregated into essentially inseparable asset groups to conduct the
      valuations. The asset groups generally represent geographic clustering of our
      cable systems into groups by which such systems are managed. Management believes
      such groupings represent the highest and best use of those assets.

Our
      valuations, which are based on the present value of projected after tax cash
      flows, result in a value of property, plant and equipment, franchises, customer
      relationships and our total entity value. The value of goodwill is the
      difference between the total entity value and amounts assigned to the other
      assets. The use of different valuation assumptions or definitions of franchises
      or customer relationships, such as our inclusion of the value of selling
      additional services to our current customers within customer relationships
      versus franchises, could significantly impact our valuations and any resulting
      impairment.


Franchises,
      for valuation purposes, are defined as the future economic benefits of the
      right
      to solicit and service potential customers (customer marketing rights), and
      the
      right to deploy and market new services such as interactivity and telephone
      to
      the potential customers (service marketing rights). Fair value is determined
      based on estimated discounted future cash flows using assumptions consistent
      with internal forecasts. The franchise after-tax cash flow is calculated as
      the
      after-tax cash flow generated by the potential customers obtained and the new
      services added to those customers in future periods. The sum of the present
      value of the franchises’ after-tax cash flow in years 1 through 10 and the
      continuing value of the after-tax cash flow beyond year 10 yields the fair
      value
      of the franchise. Prior to the adoption of EITF Topic D-108,

Use
      of the Residual Method to Value Acquired Assets Other than
      Goodwill

,
      discussed below, we followed a residual method of valuing our franchise assets,
      which had the effect of including goodwill with the franchise
      assets.

We
      follow
      the guidance of EITF Issue 02-17,

Recognition
      of Customer Relationship Intangible Assets Acquired in a Business Combination,

in
      valuing customer relationships. Customer relationships, for valuation purposes,
      represent the value of the business relationship with our existing customers
      and
      are calculated by projecting future after-tax cash flows from these customers
      including the right to deploy and market additional services such as
      interactivity and telephone to these customers. The present value of these
      after-tax cash flows yields the fair value of the customer relationships.
      Substantially all our acquisitions occurred prior to January 1, 2002. We
      did not record any value associated with the customer relationship intangibles
      related to those acquisitions. For acquisitions subsequent to January 1,
      2002, we did assign a value to the customer relationship intangible, which
      is
      amortized over its estimated useful life.

In
      September 2004, EITF Topic D-108,

Use
      of the Residual Method to Value Acquired Assets Other than
      Goodwill

,
      was
      issued, which requires the direct method of separately valuing all intangible
      assets and does not permit goodwill to be included in franchise assets. We
      performed an impairment assessment as of September 30, 2004, and adopted Topic
      D-108 in that assessment resulting in a total franchise impairment of
      approximately $3.3 billion. We recorded a cumulative effect of accounting change
      of $765 million (approximately $875 million before tax effects of $91 million
      and minority interest effects of $19 million) for the year ended December 31,
      2004 representing the portion of our total franchise impairment attributable
      to
      no longer including goodwill with franchise assets. The effect of the adoption
      was to increase net loss and loss per share by $765 million and $2.55,
      respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2004. The remaining $2.4 billion
      of the total franchise impairment was attributable to the use of lower projected
      growth rates and the resulting revised estimates of future cash flows in our
      valuation and was recorded as impairment of franchises in our consolidated
      statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004. Sustained analog
      video customer losses by us and our industry peers in the third quarter of
      primarily as a result of increased competition from DBS providers and decreased
      growth rates in our and our industry peers’ high-speed Internet customers in the
      third quarter of 2004, in part as a result of increased competition from DSL
      providers, led us to lower our projected growth rates and accordingly revise
      our
      estimates of future cash flows from those used at October 1, 2003. See "Item
      1.
      Business — Competition."

The
      valuations completed at October 1, 2003 and October 1, 2005 showed franchise
      values in excess of book value and thus resulted in no impairment.

The
      valuations used in our impairment assessments involve numerous assumptions
      as
      noted above. While economic conditions, applicable at the time of the valuation,
      indicate the combination of assumptions utilized in the valuations are
      reasonable, as market conditions change so will the assumptions with a resulting
      impact on the valuation and consequently the potential impairment
      charge.

Income
      Taxes.

All
      operations are held through Charter Holdco and its direct and indirect
      subsidiaries. Charter Holdco and the majority of its subsidiaries are not
      subject to income tax. However, certain of these subsidiaries are corporations
      and are subject to income tax. All of the taxable income, gains, losses,
      deductions and credits of Charter Holdco are passed through to its members:
      Charter, CII and Vulcan Cable III Inc. Charter is responsible for its share
      of
      taxable income or loss of Charter Holdco allocated to it in accordance with
      the
      Charter Holdco limited liability company agreement ("LLC Agreement") and
      partnership tax rules and regulations.

The
      LLC
      Agreement provides for certain special allocations of net tax profits and net
      tax losses (such net tax profits and net tax losses being determined under
      the
      applicable federal income tax rules for determining capital accounts). Under
      the
      LLC Agreement, through the end of 2003, net tax losses of Charter Holdco that
      would otherwise have been allocated to Charter based generally on its percentage
      ownership of outstanding common units were allocated instead to membership
      units
      held by Vulcan Cable III Inc. and CII (the "Special Loss Allocations") to the
      extent of their respective capital account balances. After 2003, under the
      LLC
      Agreement, net tax losses of Charter Holdco are allocated to Charter, Vulcan
      Cable III Inc. and CII based generally on their respective percentage ownership
      of outstanding common units to the extent of their respective capital account
      balances. Allocations of net tax losses in excess of the members’ aggregate
      capital account balances are allocated under the rules governing Regulatory
      Allocations, as described below. Subject to the Curative Allocation Provisions
      described below, the LLC Agreement further provides that, beginning at the
      time
      Charter Holdco generates net tax profits, the net tax profits that would
      otherwise have been allocated to Charter based generally on its percentage
      ownership of outstanding common membership units will instead generally be
      allocated to Vulcan Cable III Inc. and CII (the "Special Profit Allocations").
      The Special Profit Allocations to Vulcan Cable III Inc. and CII will generally
      continue until the cumulative amount of the Special Profit Allocations offsets
      the cumulative amount of the Special Loss Allocations. The amount and timing
      of
      the Special Profit Allocations are subject to the potential application of,
      and
      interaction with, the Curative Allocation Provisions described in the following
      paragraph. The LLC Agreement generally provides that any additional net tax
      profits are to be allocated among the members of Charter Holdco based generally
      on their respective percentage ownership of Charter Holdco common membership
      units.

Because
      the respective capital account balance of each of Vulcan Cable III Inc. and
      CII
      was reduced to zero by December 31, 2002, certain net tax losses of Charter
      Holdco that were to be allocated for 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005, to Vulcan Cable
      III Inc. and CII instead have been allocated to Charter (the "Regulatory
      Allocations").

As
      a
      result of the allocation of net tax losses to Charter in 2005, Charter’s capital
      account balance was reduced to zero during 2005. The LLC Agreement provides
      that
      once the capital account balances of all members have been reduced to zero,
      net
      tax losses are to be allocated to Charter, Vulcan Cable III Inc. and CII based
      generally on their respective percentage ownership of outstanding common units.
      Such allocations are also considered to be Regulatory Allocations.

The
      LLC
      Agreement further provides that, to the extent possible, the effect of the
      Regulatory Allocations is to be offset over time pursuant to certain curative
      allocation provisions (the "Curative Allocation Provisions") so that, after
      certain offsetting adjustments are made, each member's capital account balance
      is equal to the capital account balance such member would have had if the
      Regulatory Allocations had not been part of the LLC Agreement. The cumulative
      amount of the actual tax losses allocated to Charter as a result of the
      Regulatory Allocations through the year ended December 31, 2005 is approximately
      $4.1 billion.

As
        a
        result of the Special Loss Allocations and the Regulatory Allocations referred
        to above (and their interaction with the allocations related to assets
        contributed to Charter Holdco with differences between book and tax basis),
        the
        cumulative amount of losses of Charter Holdco allocated to Vulcan Cable III
        Inc.
        and

CII

is in
        excess of the amount that would have been allocated to such entities if the
        losses of Charter Holdco had been allocated among its members in proportion
        to
        their respective percentage ownership of Charter Holdco common membership
        units.
        The cumulative amount of such excess losses was approximately $977 million
        through December 31, 2005.

In
      certain situations, the Special Loss Allocations, Special Profit Allocations,
      Regulatory Allocations and Curative Allocation Provisions described above could
      result in Charter paying taxes in an amount that is more or less than if Charter
      Holdco had allocated net tax profits and net tax losses among its members based
      generally on the number of common membership units owned by such members. This
      could occur due to differences in (i) the character of the allocated income
      (e.g., ordinary versus capital), (ii) the allocated amount and timing of
      tax depreciation and tax amortization expense due to the application of section
      704(c) under the Internal Revenue Code, (iii) the potential interaction
      between the Special Profit Allocations and the Curative Allocation Provisions,
      (iv) the amount and timing of alternative minimum taxes paid by Charter, if
      any,
      (v) the apportionment of the allocated income or loss among the states in
      which Charter Holdco does business, and (vi) future federal and state tax
      laws. Further, in the event


of
      new
      capital contributions to Charter Holdco, it is possible that the tax effects
      of
      the Special Profit Allocations, Special Loss Allocations, Regulatory Allocations
      and Curative Allocation Provisions will change significantly pursuant to the
      provisions of the income tax regulations or the terms of a contribution
      agreement with respect to such contributions. Such change could defer the actual
      tax benefits to be derived by Charter with respect to the net tax losses
      allocated to it or accelerate the actual taxable income to Charter with respect
      to the net tax profits allocated to it. As a result, it is possible under
      certain circumstances, that Charter could receive future allocations of taxable
      income in excess of its currently allocated tax deductions and available tax
      loss carryforwards. The ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards
      is
      potentially subject to certain limitations as discussed below.

In
      addition, under their exchange agreement with Charter, Vulcan Cable III Inc.
      and
      CII may exchange some or all of their membership units in Charter Holdco for
      Charter’s Class B common stock, be merged with Charter, or be acquired by
      Charter in a non-taxable reorganization. If such an exchange were to take place
      prior to the date that the Special Profit Allocation provisions had fully offset
      the Special Loss Allocations, Vulcan Cable III Inc. and CII could elect to
      cause
      Charter Holdco to make the remaining Special Profit Allocations to Vulcan Cable
      III Inc. and CII immediately prior to the consummation of the exchange. In
      the
      event Vulcan Cable III Inc. and CII choose not to make such election or to
      the
      extent such allocations are not possible, Charter would then be allocated tax
      profits attributable to the membership units received in such exchange pursuant
      to the Special Profit Allocation provisions. Mr. Allen has generally agreed
      to reimburse Charter for any incremental income taxes that Charter would owe
      as
      a result of such an exchange and any resulting future Special Profit Allocations
      to Charter. The ability of Charter to utilize net operating loss carryforwards
      is potentially subject to certain limitations (See "Item 13. Certain Trends
      and
      Uncertainties — Utilization of Net Operating Loss Carryforwards".) If Charter
      were to become subject to such limitations (whether as a result of an exchange
      described above or otherwise), and as a result were to owe taxes resulting
      from
      the Special Profit Allocations, then Mr. Allen may not be obligated to reimburse
      Charter for such income taxes.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005 and 2004, we have recorded net deferred income tax
      liabilities of $326 million and $216 million, respectively. Additionally, as
      of
      December 31, 2005 and 2004, we have deferred tax assets of $4.2 billion and
      $3.8 billion, respectively, which primarily relate to financial and tax losses
      allocated to Charter from Charter Holdco. We are required to record a valuation
      allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
      deferred income tax assets will not be realized. Given the uncertainty
      surrounding our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, these items have
      been offset with a corresponding valuation allowance of $3.7 billion and $3.5
      billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Charter
      Holdco is currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for the
      tax years ending December 31, 2002 and 2003. Our results (excluding Charter
      and
      our indirect corporate subsidiaries) for these years are subject to this
      examination. Management does not expect the results of this examination to
      have
      a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results
      of
      operations or our liquidity, including our ability to comply with our debt
      covenants.

Litigation.

Legal
      contingencies have a high degree of uncertainty. When a loss from a contingency
      becomes estimable and probable, a reserve is established. The reserve reflects
      management's best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the
      matter and is revised accordingly as facts and circumstances change and,
      ultimately when the matter is brought to closure. We have established reserves
      for certain matters and if any of these matters are resolved unfavorably
      resulting in payment obligations in excess of management's best estimate of
      the
      outcome, such resolution could have a material adverse effect on our
      consolidated financial condition, results of operations or our
      liquidity.

Year
      Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31,

Revenues.

The
      overall increase in revenues in 2005 compared to 2004 is principally the result
      of an increase of 312,000 and 121,900 high-speed Internet customers and digital
      video customers, respectively, as well as price increases for video and
      high-speed Internet services, and is offset partially by a decrease of 107,000
      analog video customers and $12 million of credits issued to hurricane Katrina
      and Rita impacted customers related to service outages. We have restored service
      to our impacted customers.

Included
      in the reduction in analog video customers and reducing the increase in digital
      video and high-speed Internet customers are 26,800 analog video customers,


12,000
      digital video customers and 600 high-speed Internet customers sold in the cable
      system sales in Texas and West Virginia, which closed in July 2005. The cable
      system sales to Atlantic Broadband Finance, LLC, which closed in March and
      April
      2004 and the cable system sales in Texas and West Virginia, which closed in
      July
      2005 (collectively referred to in this section as the "Systems Sales") reduced
      the increase in revenues by approximately $38 million. Our goal is to increase
      revenues by improving customer service which we believe will stabilize our
      analog video customer base and increase the number of our customers who purchase
      bundled services including high-speed Internet, digital video and telephone
      services, in addition to VOD, high-definition television and DVR services.
      In
      addition, we intend to increase revenues by expanding marketing of our services
      to our commercial customers.

Average
      monthly revenue per analog video customer

increased
      from $68.02 for the year ended December 31, 2004 to $73.68 for the year ended
      December 31, 2005 primarily as a result of price increases and incremental
      revenues from advanced services. Average monthly revenue per analog video
      customer represents total annual revenue, divided by twelve, divided by the
      average number of analog video customers during the respective
      period.

Revenues
      by service offering were as follows (dollars in millions):

Video
      revenues consist primarily of revenues from analog and digital video services
      provided to our non-commercial customers. Approximately $108 million of the
      increase in video revenues was the result of price increases and incremental
      video revenues from existing customers and approximately $17 million was the
      result of an increase in digital video customers. The increases were offset
      by
      decreases of approximately $59 million related to a decrease in analog video
      customers, approximately $29 million resulting from the System Sales and
      approximately $9 million of credits issued to hurricanes Katrina and Rita
      impacted customers related to service outages.

Approximately
      $138 million of the increase in revenues from high-speed Internet services
      provided to our non-commercial customers related to the increase in the average
      number of customers receiving high-speed Internet services, whereas
      approximately $35 million related to the increase in average price of the
      service. The increase was offset by approximately $3 million of credits issued
      to hurricanes Katrina and Rita impacted customers related to service outages
      and
      $3 million resulting from the System Sales.

Revenues
      from telephone services increased primarily as a result of an increase of 76,100
      telephone customers in 2005.

Advertising
      sales revenues consist primarily of revenues from commercial advertising
      customers, programmers and other vendors. Advertising sales revenues increased
      primarily as a result of an increase in local advertising sales and offset
      by a
      decline in national advertising sales. In addition, the increase was offset
      by a
      decrease of $1 million as a result of the System Sales. For the years ended
      December 31, 2005 and 2004, we received $15 million and $16 million,
      respectively, in advertising sales revenues from programmers.

Commercial
      revenues consist primarily of revenues from cable video and high-speed Internet
      services provided to our commercial customers. Commercial revenues increased
      primarily as a result of an increase in commercial high-speed Internet revenues.
      The increase was reduced by approximately $3 million as a result of the System
      Sales.


Other
      revenues consist of revenues from franchise fees, equipment rental, customer
      installations, home shopping, dial-up Internet service, late payment fees,
      wire
      maintenance fees and other miscellaneous revenues. For the years ended December
      31, 2005 and 2004, franchise fees represented approximately 54% and 52%,
      respectively, of total other revenues. The increase in other revenues was
      primarily the result of an increase in franchise fees of $14 million and
      installation revenue of $8 million offset by a decrease of $2 million in
      equipment rental and $2 million in processing fees. In addition, other revenues
      were offset by approximately $2 million as a result of the System Sales.

Operating
      expenses

.

The
      overall increase in operating expenses was reduced by approximately $15 million
      as a result of the System Sales. Programming costs were $1.4 billion and $1.3
      billion, representing 62% and 63% of total operating expenses for the years
      ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Key expense components as a
      percentage of revenues were as follows (dollars in millions):

Programming
      costs consist primarily of costs paid to programmers for analog, premium,
      digital channels and pay-per-view programming. The increase in programming
      was a
      result of price increases, particularly in sports programming, partially offset
      by a decrease in analog video customers.

Additionally,
      the increase in programming costs was reduced by $11 million as a result of
      the
      Systems Sales.

Programming
      costs were offset by the amortization of payments received from programmers
      in
      support of launches of new channels of $42 million and $62 million for the
      year
      ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Programming costs for the
      year ended December 31, 2004 also include a $5 million reduction related to
      the
      settlement of a dispute with TechTV, Inc., a related party. See Note 25 to
      the
      accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "Item 8.
      Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

Our
      cable
      programming costs have increased in every year we have operated in excess of
      customary inflationary and cost-of-living increases. We expect them to continue
      to increase due to a variety of factors, including annual increases imposed
      by
      programmers and additional programming being provided to customers as a result
      of system rebuilds and bandwidth reallocation, both of which increase channel
      capacity. In 2006, we expect programming costs to increase at a higher rate
      than
      in 2005. These costs will be determined in part on the outcome of programming
      negotiations in 2006 and will likely be subject to offsetting events or
      otherwise affected by factors similar to the ones mentioned in the preceding
      paragraph. Our increasing programming costs have resulted in declining operating
      margins for our video services because we have been unable to pass on cost
      increases to our customers. We expect to partially offset any resulting margin
      compression from our traditional video services with revenue from advanced
      video
      services, increased telephone revenues, high-speed Internet revenues,
      advertising revenues and commercial service revenues.

Service
      costs consist primarily of service personnel salaries and benefits, franchise
      fees, system utilities, cost of providing high-speed Internet and telephone
      service, maintenance and pole rental expense. The increase in service costs
      resulted primarily from increased labor and maintenance costs to support
      improved service levels and our advanced products, increased costs of providing
      high-speed Internet and telephone service as a result of the increase in these
      customers and higher fuel prices. The increase in service costs was reduced
      by
      $4 million as a result of the System Sales. Advertising sales expenses consist
      of costs related to traditional advertising services provided to advertising
      customers, including salaries, benefits and commissions. Advertising sales
      expenses increased primarily as a result of increased salary, benefit and
      commission costs.

Selling,
      general and administrative expenses.

The
      overall increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was reduced
      by
      $6 million as a result of the System Sales. Key components of expense as a
      percentage of revenues were as follows (dollars in millions):


General
          and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits,
          rent
          expense, billing costs, call center costs, internal network costs, bad
          debt
          expense and property taxes. The increase in general and administrative
          expenses
          resulted primarily from increases in salaries and benefits of $43 million
          and
          professional fees associated with consulting services of $18 million both
          related to investments to improve service levels in our customer care centers
          as
          well as an increase of $13 million in legal and other professional fees
          offset
          by decreases in bad debt expense of $17 million related to a reduction
          in the
          use of discounted pricing, property taxes of $6 million, property and casualty
          insurance of $6 million and the System Sales of $6 million.

Marketing
      expenses increased as a result of an increased investment in targeted marketing
      campaigns.

Depreciation
      and amortization.

Depreciation
      and amortization expense increased by $4 million in 2005. The increase in
      depreciation is related to an increase in capital expenditures, which was
      partially offset by lower depreciation as the result of the Systems Sales and
      certain assets becoming fully depreciated.

Impairment
      of franchises.

We
      performed an impairment assessment during the third quarter of 2004. The use
      of
      lower projected growth rates and the resulting revised estimates of future
      cash
      flows in our valuation, primarily as a result of increased competition, led
      to
      the recognition of a $2.4 billion impairment charge for the year ended December
      31, 2004. Our annual assessment in 2005 did not result in an
      impairment.

Asset
      impairment charges.

Asset
      impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2005 represent the write-down
      of assets related to cable asset sales to fair value less costs to sell. See
      Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "Item
      8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

(Gain)
      loss on sale of assets, net.

Loss
      on
      sale of assets for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily represents the
      loss recognized on the disposition of plant and equipment. Gain on sale of
      assets for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily represents the pretax
      gain
      of $106 million realized on the sale of systems to Atlantic Broadband Finance,
      LLC which closed in March and April 2004 offset by losses recognized on the
      disposition of plant and equipment.

Option
      compensation expense, net.

Option
      compensation expense decreased $17 million, or 55%, for the year ended December
      31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. Option compensation
      expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily represents options
      expensed in accordance with SFAS No. 123,

Accounting
      for Stock-Based Compensation

(SFAS
      No.
      123)

.

Option
      compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily represents
      $22 million related to options expensed in accordance with SFAS No.

.

The
      decrease in option compensation expense is primarily the result of a decrease
      in
      the fair value of options granted related to a decrease in the price of our
      Class A common stock combined with a decrease in the number of options granted.
      Additionally,

during
      the year ended December 31, 2004, we expensed approximately $8 million related
      to a stock option exchange program, under which our employees were offered
      the
      right to exchange all stock options (vested and unvested) issued under the
      Charter Communications Option Plan and 2001 Stock Incentive Plan that had an
      exercise price over $10 per share for shares of restricted Charter Class A
      common stock or, in some instances, cash.

See
      Note
      21 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in
      "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for more information
      regarding our option compensation plans.

Hurricane
      asset retirement loss.

Hurricane asset retirement loss represents the loss associated with the
      write-off of the net book value of assets destroyed by hurricanes Katrina and
      Rita in the third quarter of 2005.

Special
      charges, net

.

Special
      charges for the year ended December 31, 2005 represent approximately $6 million
      of severance and related costs of our management realignment

and
      $1
      million related to legal settlements

.
      Special


charges
      for the year ended December 31, 2004 represents approximately $85 million as
      part of a settlement of the consolidated federal class actions, state derivative
      actions and federal derivative action lawsuits, approximately $10 million of
      litigation costs related to the settlement of a 2004 national class action
      suit
      (see Note 26 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained
      in
      "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data") and approximately $12
      million of severance and related costs of our workforce reduction and
      realignment. Special charges for the year ended December 31, 2004 were offset
      by
      $3 million received from a third party in settlement of a dispute.

Unfavorable
      contracts and other settlements

.

Unfavorable
      contracts and other settlements for the year ended December 31, 2004 relates
      to
      changes in estimated legal reserves established in connection with prior
      business combinations, which based on an evaluation of current facts and
      circumstances, are no longer required.

Interest
      expense, net.

Net
      interest expense increased by $119 million, or 7%, for the year ended December
      31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in net
      interest expense was a result of an increase in our average borrowing rate
      from
      8.66% in the year ended December 31, 2004 to 9.04% in the year ended December
      31, 2005 and an increase of $612 million in average debt outstanding from $18.6
      billion in 2004 to $19.2 billion in 2005 combined with approximately $11 million
      of liquidated damages on our 5.875% convertible senior notes. The increase
      was
      offset partially by $29 million in gains related to embedded derivatives in
      Charter’s 5.875% convertible senior notes. See Note 16 to the accompanying
      consolidated financial statements contained in "Item 8. Financial Statements
      and
      Supplementary Data."

Gain
      on derivative instruments and hedging activities, net.

Net
      gain
      on derivative instruments and hedging activities decreased $19 million in the
      year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004.
      The
      decrease is primarily the result of a decrease in gains on interest rate
      agreements that do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133,

Accounting
      for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,

which
      decreased from a gain of $65 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 to
      $47
      million for the year ended December 31, 2005. This was coupled with a decrease
      in gains on interest rate agreements, as a result of hedge ineffectiveness
      on
      designated hedges, which decreased from $4 million for the year ended December
      31, 2004 to $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005.

Loss
      on debt to equity conversions

.

Loss on
      debt to equity conversions for the year ended December 31, 2004 represents
      the
      loss recognized from privately negotiated exchanges of a total of $30 million
      principal amount of Charter’s 5.75% convertible senior notes held by two
      unrelated parties for shares of Charter Class A common stock. The exchange
      resulted in the issuance of more shares in the exchange transaction than would
      have been issuable under the original terms of the convertible senior notes.

Gain
      (loss) on extinguishment of debt and preferred stock.

Gain
      on
      extinguishment of debt and preferred stock for the year ended December 31,
      represents $490 million related to the exchange of approximately
      $6.8 billion total principal amount of outstanding debt securities of
      Charter Holdings for new CCH I and CIH debt securities, approximately $10
      million related to the issuance of Charter Operating notes in exchange for
      Charter Holdings notes, approximately $3 million related to the repurchase
      of
      $136 million principal amount of our 4.75% convertible senior notes due 2006
      and
      $23 million of gain realized on the repurchase of 508,546 shares of Series
      A
      convertible redeemable preferred stock. These gains were offset by approximately
      $5 million of losses related to the redemption of our subsidiary’s CC V
      Holdings, LLC 11.875% notes due 2008. See Note 9 to the accompanying
      consolidated financial statements contained in "Item 8. Financial Statements
      and
      Supplementary Data." Loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December
      31, 2004 represents the write-off of deferred financing fees and third party
      costs related to the Charter Communications Operating refinancing in April
      and the redemption of our 5.75% convertible senior notes due 2005 in December
      2004.

Other,
      net.

Net
      other
      income for the year ended December 31, 2005 represents the gain realized on
      an
      exchange of our interest in an equity investee for an investment in a larger
      enterprise. Net other income for the year ended December 31, 2004 represents
      gains realized on equity investments.

Minority
      interest.

Minority
      interest represents the 2% accretion of the preferred membership interests
      in
      our indirect subsidiary, CC VIII, LLC, and the pro rata share of the profits
      and
      losses of CC VIII, LLC. See "Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related
      Transactions — Transactions Arising Out of

Our
      Organizational Structure and

Mr. Allen’s
      Investment in Charter Communications, Inc. and Its Subsidiaries — Equity Put
      Rights — CC VIII."

Income
      tax benefit (expense).

Income
      tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 was recognized through
      increases in deferred tax liabilities related to our investment in Charter
      Holdco, as well as through current federal


and
      state
      income tax expense and increases in the deferred tax liabilities of certain
      of
      our indirect corporate subsidiaries. Income tax benefit for the year ended
      December 31, 2004 was realized as a result of decreases in certain deferred
      tax
      liabilities related to our investment in Charter Holdco as well as decreases
      in
      the deferred tax liabilities of certain of our indirect corporate subsidiaries,
      attributable to the write-down of franchise assets for financial statement
      purposes and not for tax purposes. We do not expect to recognize a similar
      benefit associated with the impairment of franchises in future periods. However,
      the actual tax provision calculations in future periods will be the result
      of
      current and future temporary differences, as well as future operating results.

Cumulative
      effect of accounting change, net of tax.

Cumulative
      effect of accounting change of $765 million (net of minority interest effects
      of
      $19 million and tax effects of $91 million) in 2004 represents the impairment
      charge recorded as a result of our adoption of Topic D-108.

Net
      loss.

Net
      loss
      decreased by $3.4 billion in 2005 compared to 2004 as a result of the factors
      described above. The impact to net loss in 2005 of the asset impairment charges,
      extinguishment of debt and preferred stock was to decrease net loss by
      approximately $482 million. The impact to net loss in 2004 of the impairment
      of
      franchises, cumulative effect of accounting change and the reduction in losses
      allocated to minority interest was to increase net loss by approximately $3.7
      billion.

Preferred
      stock dividends.

On
      August
      31, 2001, Charter issued 505,664 shares (and on February 28, 2003 issued an
      additional 39,595 shares) of Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred
      Stock in connection with the Cable USA acquisition, on which Charter pays or
      accrues a quarterly cumulative cash dividend at an annual rate of 5.75% if
      paid
      or 7.75% if accrued on a liquidation preference of $100 per share. Beginning
      January 1, 2005, Charter accrued the dividend on its Series A Convertible
      Redeemable Preferred Stock. In November 2005, we repurchased 508,546 shares
      of
      our Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock. Following the repurchase,
      36,713 shares or preferred stock remain outstanding. In addition, the
      Certificate of Designation governing the Series A Convertible Redeemable
      Preferred Stock was amended to (i) delete the dividend rights of the remaining
      shares outstanding and (ii) increase the liquidation preference and redemption
      price from $100 to $105.4063 per share, which amount shall further increase
      at
      the rate of 7.75% per annum, compounded quarterly, from September 30,
      2005.

Loss
      per common share.

The
      loss
      per common share decreased by $11.34, or 78%, as a result of the factors
      described above.

Year
      Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31,

Revenues.

The
      overall increase in revenues in 2004 compared to 2003 is principally the result
      of an increase of 318,800 and 2,800 high-speed Internet customers and digital
      video customers, respectively, as well as price increases for video and
      high-speed Internet services, and is offset partially by a decrease of 439,800
      analog video customers. Included in the reduction in analog video customers
      and
      reducing the increase in digital video and high-speed Internet customers are
      230,800 analog video customers, 83,300 digital video customers and 37,800
      high-speed Internet customers sold in the cable system sales to Atlantic
      Broadband Finance, LLC, which closed in March and April 2004 (collectively,
      with
      the cable system sale to WaveDivision Holdings, LLC in October 2003, referred
      to
      in this section as the "Systems Sales"). The Systems Sales reduced the increase
      in revenues by $160 million.

Average
      monthly revenue per analog video customer increased from $61.92 for the year
      ended December 31, 2003 to $68.02 for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily
      as a result of price increases and incremental revenues from advanced services.
      Average monthly revenue per analog video customer represents total annual
      revenue, divided by twelve, divided by the average number of analog video
      customers during the respective period.

Revenues

Video
      revenues consist primarily of revenues from analog and digital video services
      provided to our non-commercial customers. Approximately $116 million of the
      decrease in video revenues was the result of the Systems Sales and approximately
      an additional $65 million related to a decline in analog video customers. These
      decreases were offset by increases of approximately $66 million resulting from
      price increases and incremental video revenues from existing customers and
      approximately $27 million resulting from an increase in digital video
      customers.

Approximately
      $163 million of the increase in revenues from high-speed Internet services
      provided to our non-commercial customers related to the increase in the average
      number of customers receiving high-speed Internet services, whereas
      approximately $35 million related to the increase in average price of the
      service. The increase in high-speed Internet revenues was reduced by
      approximately $12 million as a result of the Systems Sales.

Revenues
      from telephone services increased primarily as a result of an increase of 20,500
      telephone customers.

Advertising
      sales revenues consist primarily of revenues from commercial advertising
      customers, programmers and other vendors. Advertising sales revenues increased
      primarily as a result of an increase in national advertising campaigns and
      election related advertising. The increase was offset by a decrease of $7
      million as a result of the System Sales. For the years ended December 31,
      2004 and 2003, we received $16 million and $15 million, respectively, in
      advertising revenue from programmers.

Commercial
      revenues consist primarily of revenues from cable video and high-speed Internet
      services to our commercial customers. Commercial revenues increased primarily
      as
      a result of an increase in commercial high-speed Internet revenues. The increase
      was reduced by approximately $14 million as a result of the Systems
      Sales.

Other
      revenues consist of revenues from franchise fees, equipment rental, customer
      installations, home shopping, dial-up Internet service, late payment fees,
      wire
      maintenance fees and other miscellaneous revenues. For the year ended December
      31, 2004 and 2003, franchise fees represented approximately 52% and 50%,
      respectively, of total other revenues. Approximately $11 million of the decrease
      in other revenues was the result of the Systems Sales offset by an increase
      in
      home shopping and infomercial revenue.

Operating
      expenses

.

The
      overall increase in operating expenses was reduced by approximately $59 million
      as a result of the System Sales. Programming costs were $1.3 billion and $1.2
      billion, representing 63% and 64% of total operating expenses for the years
      ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Key expense components as a
      percentage of revenues were as follows (dollars in millions):

Programming
        costs consist primarily of costs paid to programmers for analog, premium
        and
        digital channels and pay-per-view programming. The increase in programming
        costs
        was a result of price increases, particularly in sports programming, an
        increased number of channels carried on our systems, and an increase in digital
        video customers, partially offset by a decrease in analog video customers.

Additionally,
        the increase in programming costs was reduced by $42 million as a result
        of the
        Systems Sales.

Programming
        costs were offset by the amortization of payments received from programmers
        in
        support of launches of new channels of $62 million and $64 million for the
        year
        ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Programming costs for the
        year ended December 31, 2004 also include a $5 million reduction related
        to the
        settlement of a dispute with TechTV, Inc., a related party. See


Note
        to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in "Item 8.
        Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."

Service
      costs consist primarily of service personnel salaries and benefits, franchise
      fees, system utilities, Internet service provider fees, maintenance and pole
      rental expense. The increase in service costs resulted primarily from additional
      activity associated with ongoing infrastructure maintenance. The increase in
      service costs was reduced by $15 million as a result of the System Sales.
      Advertising sales expenses consist of costs related to traditional advertising
      services provided to advertising customers, including salaries, benefits and
      commissions. Advertising sales expenses increased primarily as a result of
      increased salary, benefit and commission costs. The increase in advertising
      sales expenses was reduced by $2 million as a result of the System Sales.

Selling,
      general and administrative expenses.

The
      overall increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was reduced
      by
      $22 million as a result of the System Sales. Key components of expense as a
      percentage of revenues were as follows (dollars in millions):

General
          and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits,
          rent
          expense, billing costs, call center costs, internal network costs, bad
          debt
          expense and property taxes. The increase in general and administrative
          expenses
          resulted primarily from increases in costs associated with our commercial
          business of $21 million, third party call center costs resulting from increased
          emphasis on customer service of $10 million and bad debt expense of $10
          million
          offset by decreases in costs associated with salaries and benefits of $21
          million and rent expense of $3 million.

Marketing
      expenses increased as a result of an increased investment in marketing and
      branding campaigns.

Depreciation
      and amortization.

Depreciation
      and amortization expense increased by $42 million, or 3%. The increase in
      depreciation related to an increase in capital expenditures, which was partially
      offset by lower depreciation as the result of the Systems Sales.

Impairment
      of franchises.

We
      performed an impairment assessment during the third quarter of 2004. The use
      of
      lower projected growth rates and the resulting revised estimates of future
      cash
      flows in our valuation, primarily as a result of increased competition, led
      to
      the recognition of a $2.4 billion impairment charge for the year ended December
      31, 2004.

(Gain)
      loss on sale of assets, net.

Gain
      on
      sale of assets for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily represents the
      pretax gain of $106 million realized on the sale of systems to Atlantic
      Broadband Finance, LLC which closed in March and April 2004 offset by losses
      recognized on the disposition of plant and equipment. Loss on sale of assets
      for
      the year ended December 31, 2003 represents the loss recognized on the
      disposition of plant and equipment offset by a gain of $21 million recognized
      on
      the sale of cable systems in Port Orchard, Washington which closed on October
      1,
      2003.

Option
      compensation expense, net.

Option
      compensation expense of $31 million for the year ended December 31, 2004
      primarily represents $22 million related to options granted and expensed in
      accordance with SFAS No. 123

.

Additionally,

during
      the year ended December 31, 2004, we expensed approximately $8 million related
      to a stock option exchange program, under which our employees were offered
      the
      right to exchange all stock options (vested and unvested) issued under the
      Charter Communications Option Plan and 2001 Stock Incentive Plan that had an
      exercise price over $10 per share for shares of restricted Charter Class A
      common stock or, in some instances, cash. The exchange offer closed in February
      2004.

Option
      compensation expense of $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003
      primarily represents options expensed in accordance with SFAS No.

.

See
      Note
      21 to the


accompanying
      consolidated financial statements contained in "Item 8. Financial
      Statements and Supplementary Data" for more information regarding our option
      compensation plans.

Special
      charges, net

.

Special
      charges for the year ended December 31, 2004 represents approximately $85
      million as part of a settlement of the consolidated federal class actions,
      state
      derivative actions and federal derivative action lawsuits, approximately $10
      million of litigation costs related to the settlement of a 2004 national class
      action suit (see Note 26 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements
      contained in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data") and
      approximately $12 million of severance and related costs of our workforce
      reduction and realignment. Special charges for the year ended December 31,
      were offset by $3 million received from a third party in settlement of a
      dispute. Special charges for the year ended December 31, 2003 represents
      approximately $26 million of severance and related costs of our workforce
      reduction partially offset by a $5 million credit from a settlement from the
      Internet service provider Excite@Home related to the conversion of about 145,000
      high-speed Internet customers to our Charter Pipeline service in 2001.

Unfavorable
      contracts and other settlements

.

Unfavorable
      contracts and other settlements for the year ended December 31, 2004 relates
      to
      changes in estimated legal reserves established in connection with prior
      business combinations, which based on an evaluation of current facts and
      circumstances, are no longer required.

Unfavorable
      contracts and other settlements for the year ended December 31, 2003 represents
      the settlement of estimated liabilities recorded in connection with prior
      business combinations. The majority of this benefit (approximately $52 million)
      is due to the renegotiation in 2003 of a major programming contract, for which
      a
      liability had been recorded for the above market portion of that agreement
      in
      conjunction with the Falcon acquisition in 1999 and the Bresnan acquisition
      in
      2000. The remaining benefit relates to the reversal of previously recorded
      liabilities, which are no longer required.

Interest
      expense, net.

Net
      interest expense increased by $113 million, or 7%, for the year ended December
      31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in net
      interest expense was a result of an increase in our average borrowing rate
      from
      7.99% in the year ended December 31, 2003 to 8.66% in the year ended December
      31, 2004 partially offset by a decrease of $306 million in average debt
      outstanding from $18.9 billion in 2003 to $18.6 billion in 2004.

Gain
      (loss) on derivative instruments and hedging activities, net.

Net
      gain
      on derivative instruments and hedging activities increased $4 million in the
      year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003.
      The
      increase is primarily the result of an increase in gains on interest rate
      agreements that do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133,

Accounting
      for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,

which
      increased from a gain of $57 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to
      a
      gain of $65 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. This was coupled
      with
      a decrease in gains on interest rate agreements, as a result of hedge
      ineffectiveness on designated hedges, which increased from $8 million for the
      year ended December 31, 2003 to $4 million for the year ended December 31,
      2004.

Loss
      on debt to equity conversions

.

Loss on
      debt to equity conversions for the year ended December 31, 2004 represents
      the
      loss recognized from privately negotiated exchanges of a total of $30 million
      principal amount of Charter’s 5.75% convertible senior notes held by two
      unrelated parties for shares of Charter Class A common stock. The exchange
      resulted in the issuance of more shares in the exchange transaction than would
      have been issuable under the original terms of the convertible senior notes.

Gain
      (loss) on extinguishment of debt.

Loss
      on
      extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2004 represents the
      write-off of deferred financing fees and third party costs related to the
      Charter Communications Operating refinancing in April 2004 and the redemption
      of
      our 5.75% convertible senior notes due 2005 in December 2004. Gain on
      extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2003 represents the
      gain
      realized on the purchase of an aggregate $609 million principal amount of our
      outstanding convertible senior notes and $1.3 billion principal amount of
      Charter Holdings’ senior notes and senior discount notes in consideration for an
      aggregate of $1.6 billion principal amount of 10.25% notes due 2010 issued
      by
      our indirect subsidiary, CCH II. The gain is net of the write-off of deferred
      financing costs associated with the retired debt of $27 million.

Other,
      net.

Net
      other
      expense decreased by $19 million from expense of $16 million in 2003 to income
      of $3 million in 2004. Other expense in 2003 included $11 million associated
      with amending a revolving credit facility of our subsidiaries and costs
      associated with terminated debt transactions that did not recur in 2004. In
      addition, gains on equity investments increased $7 million in 2004 over
      2003.


Minority
      interest.

Minority
      interest represents the 2% accretion of the preferred membership interests
      in
      our indirect subsidiary, CC VIII, LLC, and since June 6, 2003, the pro rata
      share of the profits and losses of CC VIII, LLC. See "Item 13. Certain
      Relationships and Related Transactions — Transactions Arising Out of

Our
      Organizational Structure and

Mr. Allen’s
      Investment in Charter Communications, Inc. and Its Subsidiaries — Equity Put
      Rights — CC VIII." Reported losses allocated to minority interest on the
      statement of operations are limited to the extent of any remaining minority
      interest on the balance sheet related to Charter Holdco. Because minority
      interest in Charter Holdco was substantially eliminated at December 31, 2003,
      beginning in the first quarter of 2004, Charter began to absorb substantially
      all future losses before income taxes that otherwise would have been allocated
      to minority interest. For the year ended December 31, 2003, 53.5% of our losses
      were allocated to minority interest. As a result of negative equity at Charter
      Holdco during the year ended December 31, 2004, no additional losses were
      allocated to minority interest, resulting in an additional $2.4 billion of
      net
      losses. Under our existing capital structure, future losses will be
      substantially absorbed by Charter.

Income
      tax benefit.

Income
      tax benefits were realized for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 as
      a
      result of decreases in certain deferred tax liabilities related to our
      investment in Charter Holdco as well as decreases in the deferred tax
      liabilities of certain of our indirect corporate subsidiaries.

The
      income tax benefit recognized in the year ended December 31, 2004 was directly
      related to the impairment of franchises as discussed above because the deferred
      tax liabilities decreased as a result of the write-down of franchise assets
      for
      financial statement purposes and not for tax purposes. We do not expect to
      recognize a similar benefit associated with the impairment of franchises in
      future periods. However, the actual tax provision calculations in future periods
      will be the result of current and future temporary differences, as well as
      future operating results.

The
      income tax benefit recognized in the year ended December 31, 2003 was directly
      related to the tax losses allocated to Charter from Charter Holdco. In the
      second quarter of 2003, Charter started receiving tax loss allocations from
      Charter Holdco. Previously, the tax losses had been allocated to Vulcan Cable
      III Inc. and CII in accordance with the Special Loss Allocations provided under
      the Charter Holdco limited liability company agreement. We do not expect to
      recognize a similar benefit related to our investment in Charter Holdco after
      2003 related to tax loss allocations received from Charter Holdco, due to
      limitations associated with our ability to offset future tax benefits against
      the remaining deferred tax liabilities. However, the actual tax provision
      calculations in future periods will be the result of current and future
      temporary differences, as well as future operating results.

Cumulative
      effect of accounting change, net of tax.

Cumulative
      effect of accounting change of $765 million (net of minority interest effects
      of
      $19 million and tax effects of $91 million) in 2004 represents the impairment
      charge recorded as a result of our adoption of Topic D-108.

Net
      loss.

Net
      loss
      increased by $4.1 billion in 2004 compared to 2003 as a result of the factors
      described above. The impact to net loss in 2004 of the impairment of franchises,
      cumulative effect of accounting change and the reduction in losses allocated
      to
      minority interest was to increase net loss by approximately $3.7 billion. The
      impact to net loss in 2003 of the gain on the sale of systems, unfavorable
      contracts and settlements and gain on debt exchange, net of income tax impact,
      was to decrease net loss by $168 million.

Preferred
      stock dividends.

On
      August
      31, 2001, in connection with the Cable USA acquisition, Charter issued 505,664
      shares (and on February 28, 2003 issued an additional 39,595 shares) of
      Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock, on which it pays a
      quarterly cumulative cash dividend at an annual rate of 5.75% on a liquidation
      preference of $100 per share.

Loss
      per common share.

The
      loss
      per common share increased by $13.65 as a result of the factors described above.

Liquidity
      and Capital Resources

Introduction

This
      section contains a discussion of our liquidity and capital resources, including
      a discussion of our cash position, sources and uses of cash, access to credit
      facilities and other financing sources, historical financing activities, cash
      needs, capital expenditures and outstanding debt.


Overview

We
      have a
      significant level of debt. In 2006, $50 million of our debt matures, and in
      2007, an additional $385 million matures. In 2008 and beyond, significant
      additional amounts will become due under our remaining long-term debt
      obligations.

Recent
      Financing Transactions

On
      January 30, 2006, CCH II and CCH II Capital Corp. issued $450 million in debt
      securities, the proceeds of which were provided, directly or indirectly, to
      Charter Operating, which used such funds to reduce borrowings, but not
      commitments, under the revolving portion of its credit facilities.

In
      October 2005, CCO Holdings and CCO Holdings Capital Corp., as guarantor
      thereunder, entered into a senior bridge loan agreement with JPMorgan Chase
      Bank, N.A., Credit Suisse, Cayman Islands Branch and Deutsche Bank AG Cayman
      Islands Branch (the "Lenders") whereby the Lenders committed to make loans
      to
      CCO Holdings in an aggregate amount of $600 million. Upon the issuance of $450
      million of CCH II notes discussed above, the commitment under the bridge loan
      was reduced to $435 million. CCO Holdings may draw upon the facility between
      January 2, 2006 and September 29, 2006 and the loans will mature on the sixth
      anniversary of the first borrowing under the bridge loan.

In
      September 2005, Charter Holdings and its wholly owned subsidiaries, CCH I and
      CIH, completed the exchange of approximately $6.8 billion total principal amount
      of outstanding debt securities of Charter Holdings in a private placement for
      new debt securities. Holders of Charter Holdings notes due in 2009 and 2010
      exchanged $3.4 billion principal amount of notes for $2.9 billion principal
      amount of new 11% CCH I notes due 2015. Holders of Charter Holdings notes due
      2011 and 2012 exchanged $845 million principal amount of notes for $662 million
      principal amount of 11% CCH I notes due 2015. In addition, holders of Charter
      Holdings notes due 2011 and 2012 exchanged $2.5 billion principal amount of
      notes for $2.5 billion principal amount of various series of new CIH notes.
      Each
      series of new CIH notes has the same interest rate and provisions for payment
      of
      cash interest as the series of old Charter Holdings notes for which such CIH
      notes were exchanged. In addition, the maturities for each series were extended
      three years.

Our
      business requires significant cash to fund debt service costs, capital
      expenditures and ongoing operations. We have historically funded these
      requirements through cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under
      our
      credit facilities, sales of assets, issuances of debt and equity securities
      and
      cash on hand. However, the mix of funding sources changes from period to period.
      For the year ended December 31, 2005, we generated $260 million of net cash
      flows from operating activities after paying cash interest of $1.5 billion.

In
      addition, the Company used $1.1 billion for purchases of property, plant and
      equipment.

Finally,
      we had net cash flows from financing activities of $136 million. We expect
      that
      our mix of sources of funds will continue to change in the future based on
      overall needs relative to our cash flow and on the availability of funds under
      the credit facilities of our subsidiaries, our access to the debt and equity
      markets, the timing of possible asset sales and our ability to generate cash
      flows from operating activities. We continue to explore asset dispositions
      as
      one of several possible actions that we could take in the future to improve
      our
      liquidity, but we do not presently consider unannounced future asset sales
      as a
      significant source of liquidity.

We
      expect
      that cash on hand, cash flows from operating activities and the amounts
      available under our credit facilities and bridge loan will be adequate to meet
      our cash needs in 2006. We believe that cash flows from operating activities
      and
      amounts available under our credit facilities and bridge loan will not be
      sufficient to fund our operations and satisfy our interest and principal
      repayment obligations in 2007 and beyond. We are working with our financial
      advisors to address these funding requirements. However, there can be no
      assurance that such funding will be available to us. In addition, Mr. Allen
      and
      his affiliates are not obligated to purchase equity from, contribute to or
      loan
      funds to us.

Debt
      Covenants

Our
      ability to operate depends upon, among other things, our continued access to
      capital, including credit under the Charter Operating credit facilities and
      bridge loan. The Charter Operating credit facilities, along with our and our
      subsidiaries’ indentures and bridge loan, contain certain restrictive covenants,
      some of which require us to maintain specified financial ratios and meet
      financial tests and to provide audited financial statements with an unqualified
      opinion from our independent auditors. As of December 31, 2005, we are in
      compliance with the covenants under our indentures, bridge loan and credit
      facilities, and we expect to remain in compliance with those covenants for
      the


next
      twelve months. As of December 31, 2005, our potential availability under our
      credit facilities totaled approximately $553 million, none of which was limited
      by covenants. In addition, as of January 2, 2006 we have additional borrowing
      availability of $600 million under the bridge loan (which was reduced to $435
      million as a result of the issuance of the CCH II notes). Continued access
      to
      our credit facilities and bridge loan is subject to our remaining in compliance
      with these covenants, including covenants tied to our operating performance.
      If
      any events of non-compliance occur, funding under the credit facilities and
      bridge loan may not be available and defaults on some or potentially all of
      our
      debt obligations could occur. An event of default under any of our debt
      instruments could result in the acceleration of our payment obligations under
      that debt and, under certain circumstances, in cross-defaults under our other
      debt obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
      financial condition and results of operations.

Specific
      Limitations

Our
      ability to make interest payments on our convertible senior notes, and, in
      and 2009, to repay the outstanding principal of our convertible senior notes
      of
      $20 million and $863 million, respectively, will depend on our ability to raise
      additional capital and/or on receipt of payments or distributions from Charter
      Holdco and its subsidiaries. During 2005, Charter Holdings distributed $60
      million to Charter Holdco. As of December 31, 2005, Charter Holdco was owed
      $22
      million in intercompany loans from its subsidiaries, which were available to
      pay
      interest and principal on our convertible senior notes. In addition, Charter
      has
      $98 million of governmental securities pledged as security for the next four
      scheduled semi-annual interest payments on Charter’s 5.875% convertible senior
      notes.

Distributions
      by Charter’s subsidiaries to a parent company (including Charter, CCHC and
      Charter Holdco)

for
      payment of principal on parent company notes

are
      restricted under the indentures governing the CIH notes, CCH I notes, CCH II
      notes, CCO Holdings notes and Charter Operating notes

unless
      there is no default, each applicable subsidiary’s leverage ratio test is met at
      the time of such distribution and, in the case of our convertible senior notes,
      other specified tests are met.

For
      the
      quarter ended December 31, 2005, there was no default under any of these
      indentures and each such subsidiary met its applicable leverage ratio tests
      based on December 31, 2005 financial results.

Such
      distributions would be restricted, however, if any such subsidiary fails to
      meet
      these tests. In the past, certain subsidiaries have from time to time failed
      to
      meet their leverage ratio test. There can be no assurance that they will satisfy
      these tests at the time of such distribution.

Distributions
      by Charter Operating and CCO Holdings for payment of principal on parent company
      notes are further restricted by the covenants in the credit facilities and
      bridge loan, respectively.

Distributions
      by CIH, CCH I, CCH II, CCO Holdings and Charter Operating to a parent company
      for payment of parent company interest are permitted if there is no default
      under the aforementioned indentures. However, distributions for payment of
      interest on our convertible senior notes are further limited to when each
      applicable subsidiary’s leverage ratio test is met and other specified tests are
      met. There can be no assurance that they will satisfy these tests at the time
      of
      such distribution.

The
      indentures governing the Charter Holdings notes permit Charter Holdings to
      make
      distributions to Charter Holdco for payment of interest or principal on the
      convertible senior notes, only if, after giving effect to the distribution,
      Charter Holdings can incur additional debt under the leverage ratio of 8.75
      to
      1.0, there is no default under Charter Holdings’ indentures and other specified
      tests are met. For the quarter ended

December
      31, 2005, there was no default under Charter Holdings’ indentures and Charter
      Holdings met its leverage ratio test based on December 31, 2005 financial
      results

.
      Such
      distributions would be restricted, however, if Charter Holdings fails to meet
      these tests. In the past, Charter Holdings has from time to time failed to
      meet
      this leverage ratio test. There can be no assurance that Charter Holdings will
      satisfy these tests at the time of such distribution.

During

periods
      in which distributions are restricted,

the
      indentures governing the Charter Holdings notes permit Charter Holdings and
      its
      subsidiaries to make specified investments (that are not restricted payments)
      in
      Charter Holdco or Charter up to an amount determined by a formula, as long
      as
      there is no default under the indentures.

Our
      significant amount of debt could negatively affect our ability to access
      additional capital in the future. Additionally, our ability to incur additional
      debt may be limited by the restrictive covenants in our indentures, bridge
      loan
      and credit facilities. No assurances can be given that we will not experience
      liquidity problems if we do not obtain sufficient additional financing on a
      timely basis as our debt becomes due or because of adverse market conditions,
      increased competition or other unfavorable events. If, at any time, additional
      capital or borrowing capacity is required beyond amounts internally generated
      or
      available under our credit facilities and bridge loan or through additional
      debt
      or equity financings, we would consider:


If
      the
      above strategies are not successful, we could be forced to restructure our
      obligations or seek protection under the bankruptcy laws. In addition, if we
      need to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity or find it
      necessary to engage in a recapitalization or other similar transaction, our
      shareholders could suffer significant dilution and our noteholders might not
      receive principal and interest payments to which they are contractually
      entitled.

Issuance
      of Charter Operating Notes in Exchange for Charter Holdings Notes; Repurchase
      of
      Convertible Notes

In
      March
      and June 2005, our subsidiary, Charter Operating, consummated exchange
      transactions with a small number of institutional holders of Charter Holdings
      8.25% senior notes due 2007 pursuant to which Charter Operating issued, in
      private placement transactions, approximately $333 million principal amount
      of
      its 8.375% senior second lien notes due 2014 in exchange for approximately
      $346
      million of the Charter Holdings 8.25% senior notes due 2007. In addition, during
      the year ended December 31, 2005, we repurchased, in private transactions,
      from
      a small number of institutional holders, a total of $136 million principal
      amount of our 4.75% convertible senior notes due 2006. Approximately $20 million
      principal amount of these notes remain outstanding.

Sale
      of Assets

In
      July
      2005, we closed the sale of certain cable systems in Texas and West Virginia
      and
      closed the sale of an additional cable system in Nebraska in October 2005 for
      a
      total sales price of approximately $37 million, representing a total of 33,000
      analog video customers.

In
      March
      2004, we closed the sale of certain cable systems in Florida, Pennsylvania,
      Maryland, Delaware and West Virginia to Atlantic Broadband Finance, LLC. We
      closed the sale of an additional cable system in New York to Atlantic Broadband
      Finance, LLC in April 2004. The total net proceeds from the sale of all of
      these
      systems were approximately $735 million. The proceeds were used to repay a
      portion of our revolving credit facilities.

Acquisition

In
      January 2006, we closed the purchase of certain cable systems in Minnesota
      from
      Seren Innovations, Inc. We acquired approximately 18,900 analog video customers
      and 14,800 telephone customers for a total purchase price of approximately
      $43
      million.

Summary
      of Outstanding Contractual Obligations

The
      following table summarizes our payment obligations as of December 31, 2005
      under
      our long-term debt and certain other contractual obligations and commitments
      (dollars in millions).

The
      following items are not included in the contractual obligations table because
      the obligations are not fixed and/or determinable due to various factors
      discussed below. However, we incur these costs as part of our
      operations:

·

We
                also rent utility poles used in our operations. Generally, pole rentals
                are cancelable on short notice, but we anticipate that such rentals
                will
                recur. Rent expense incurred for pole rental attachments for the
                years
                ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, was $46 million, $43 million
                and $40 million, respectively.

·

We
                pay franchise fees under multi-year franchise agreements based on
                a
                percentage of revenues earned from video service per year. We also
                pay
                other franchise related costs, such as public education grants under
                multi-year agreements. Franchise fees and other franchise-related
                costs
                included in the accompanying statement of operations were $170 million,
                $164 million and $162 million for the years ended December 31, 2005,
                and 2003, respectively.

·

We
                also have $165 million in letters of credit, primarily to our various
                worker’s compensation, property casualty and general liability carriers
                as
                collateral for reimbursement of claims. These letters of credit reduce
                the
                amount we may borrow under our credit facilities.

Historical
      Operating, Financing and Investing Activities

We
      held
      $21 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2005 compared to
      $650 million as of December 31, 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2005,
      we
      generated $260 million of net cash flows from operating activities after paying
      cash interest of $1.5 billion. In addition, we used approximately $1.1 billion
      for purchases of property, plant and equipment. Finally, we had net cash flows
      from financing activities of $136 million.

Operating
      Activities.

Net
      cash
      provided by operating activities decreased $212 million, or 45%, from $472
      million for the year ended December 31, 2004 to $260 million for the year ended
      December 31, 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2005, net cash provided
      by
      operating activities decreased primarily as a result of an increase in cash
      interest expense of $189 million over the corresponding prior period and changes
      in operating assets and liabilities that used $45 million more cash during
      the
      year ended December 31, 2005 than the corresponding period in 2004.


The
      change in operating assets and liabilities is primarily the result of the
      finalization of the class action settlement in the third quarter of
      2005.

Net
      cash
      provided by operating activities decreased $293 million, or 38%, from $765
      million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $472 million for the year ended
      December 31, 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2004, net cash provided
      by
      operating activities decreased primarily as a result of an increase in cash
      interest expense of $203 million over the corresponding prior period and changes
      in operating assets and liabilities that provided $83 million less cash during
      the year ended December 31, 2004 than the corresponding period in 2003. The
      change in operating assets and liabilities is primarily the result of the
      benefit in the year ended December 31, 2003 from collection of receivables
      from
      programmers related to network launches, while accounts receivable remained
      essentially flat in the year ended December 31, 2004.

Investing
      Activities.

Net
      cash
      used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004
      was
      $1.0 billion and $243 million, respectively. Investing activities used $782
      million more cash during the year ended December 31, 2005 than the corresponding
      period in 2004 primarily as a result of cash provided by proceeds from the
      sale
      of certain cable systems to Atlantic Broadband Finance, LLC in 2004 which did
      not recur in 2005 combined with increased cash used for capital expenditures.

Net
      cash
      used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003
      was
      $243 million and $817 million, respectively. Investing activities used $574
      million less cash during the year ended December 31, 2004 than the corresponding
      period in 2003 primarily as a result of cash provided by proceeds from the
      sale
      of certain cable systems to Atlantic Broadband Finance, LLC offset by increased
      cash used for capital expenditures.

Financing
      Activities.

Net
      cash
      provided by financing activities was $136 million and $294 million for the
      years
      ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in cash provided
      during the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the corresponding period
      in 2004, was primarily the result of an decrease in borrowings of long-term
      debt
      and proceeds from issuance of debt offset by a decrease in repayments of
      long-term debt.

Net
      cash
      provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $294
      million and the net cash used in financing activities for the year ended
      December 31, 2003 was $142 million. The increase in cash provided during the
      year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to the corresponding period in 2003,
      was primarily the result of an increase in borrowings of long-term debt and
      proceeds from issuance of debt reduced by repayments of long-term debt.

Capital
      Expenditures

We
      have
      significant ongoing capital expenditure requirements. Capital expenditures
      were
      $1.1 billion, $924 million and $854 million for the years ended December 31,
      2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The majority of the capital expenditures
      in
      2005, 2004 and 2003 related to our customer premise equipment costs. See the
      table below for more details.

Our
      capital expenditures are funded primarily from cash flows from operating
      activities, the issuance of debt and borrowings under credit facilities. In
      addition, during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, our
      liabilities related to capital expenditures increased $8 million and decreased
      $43 million and $33 million, respectively.

The
      increase in capital expenditures for 2005 compared to 2004 is the result of
      expected increases in scalable infrastructure costs related to telephone
      services, deployment of advanced digital set-top terminals and capital
      expenditures to replace plant and equipment destroyed by hurricanes Katrina
      and
      Rita.

During
      2006, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $1.0 billion to $1.1
      billion. We expect that the nature of these expenditures will continue to be
      composed primarily of purchases of customer premise equipment related to
      telephone and other advanced services, support capital and for scalable
      infrastructure costs. We expect to fund capital expenditures for 2006 primarily
      from cash flows from operating activities and borrowings under our credit
      facilities.

We
      have
      adopted capital expenditure disclosure guidance, which was developed by eleven
      publicly traded cable system operators, including Charter, with the support
      of
      the National Cable & Telecommunications Association ("NCTA"). The disclosure
      is intended to provide more consistency in the reporting of operating statistics
      in capital expenditures and customers among peer companies in the cable
      industry. These disclosure guidelines are not required disclosure under GAAP,
      nor do they impact our accounting for capital expenditures under
      GAAP.


The
      following table presents our major capital expenditures categories in accordance
      with NCTA disclosure guidelines for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004
      and 2003 (dollars in millions):

                vehicles).


Description
      of Our Outstanding Debt

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, our actual total debt was approximately $19.4 billion,
      as summarized below (dollars in millions):

(a)

The
        accreted value presented above generally represents the principal amount
        of the
        notes less the original issue discount at the time of sale plus the accretion
        to
        the balance sheet date except as follows. The accreted value of the CIH notes
        issued in exchange for Charter Holdings notes and the CCH I notes issued
        in
        exchange for the 8.625% Charter Holdings notes due 2009 are recorded at the
        historical book values of the Charter Holdings notes for financial reporting
        purposes as opposed to the current accreted value for legal purposes and
        notes
        indenture purposes (which, for both purposes, is the amount that would become
        payable if the debt becomes


immediately due). As of December 31, 2005, the accreted value of our debt
        for
        legal purposes and notes and indentures purposes is $18.8 billion.

(b)

In
                  general, the obligors have the right to redeem all of the notes
                  set forth
                  in the above table (except with respect to the 5.875% convertible
                  senior
                  notes due 2009, the 8.25% Charter Holdings notes due 2007, the
                  10.000% Charter Holdings notes due 2009, the 10.75% Charter Holdings
                  notes
                  due 2009 and the 9.625% Charter Holdings notes due 2009) in whole
                  or part
                  at their option, beginning at various times prior to their stated
                  maturity
                  dates, subject to certain conditions, upon the payment of the outstanding
                  principal amount (plus a specified redemption premium) and all
                  accrued and
                  unpaid interest. The 5.875% convertible senior notes are redeemable
                  if the
                  closing price of our Class A common stock exceeds the conversion
                  price by
                  certain percentages as described below. For additional information.
                  See
                  Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained
                  in
                  "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
                  Data."

(c)

The
                4.75% convertible senior notes and the 5.875% convertible senior
                notes are
                convertible at the option of the holders into shares of Class A
                common stock at a conversion rate, subject to certain adjustments,
                of
                38.0952 and 413.2231 shares, respectively, per $1,000 principal amount
                of
                notes, which is equivalent to a price of $26.25 and $2.42 per share,
                respectively. Certain anti-dilutive provisions cause adjustments
                to occur
                automatically upon the occurrence of specified events. Additionally,
                the
                conversion ratio may be adjusted by us when deemed
                appropriate.

(d)

In
                January 2006, our subsidiaries, CCH II and CCH II Capital Corp.,
                issued
                $450 million principal amount of 10.250% senior notes due 2010, the
                proceeds of which were used to pay down credit facilities.

(e)

Not
                included within total long-term debt is the $49 million CCHC note,
                which
                is included in note payable-related party on our accompanying consolidated
                balance sheets. See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial
                statements contained in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
                Data."

As
      of
      December 31, 2005 and 2004, our long-term debt totaled approximately $19.4
      billion and $19.5 billion, respectively. This debt was comprised of
      approximately $5.7 billion and $5.5 billion of credit facility debt, $12.8
      billion and $13.0 billion accreted amount of high-yield notes and $863 million
      and $990 million accreted amount of convertible senior notes at December 31,
      2005 and 2004, respectively.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005 and 2004, the weighted average interest rate on the credit
      facility debt was approximately 7.8% and 6.8%, the weighted average interest
      rate on our high-yield notes was approximately 10.2% and 9.2%, and the weighted
      average interest rate on the convertible senior notes was approximately 6.3%
      and
      5.7%, respectively, resulting in a blended weighted average interest rate of
      9.3% and 8.8%, respectively. The interest rate on approximately 77% and 83%
      of
      the total principal amount of our debt was effectively fixed, including the
      effects of our interest rate hedge agreements as of December 31, 2005 and 2004,
      respectively. The fair value of our high-yield notes was $10.4 billion and
      $12.2
      billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The fair value of our
      convertible senior notes was $647 million and $1.1 billion at December 31,
      and 2004, respectively. The fair value of our credit facilities is $5.7 billion
      and $5.5 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The fair value
      of
      high-yield and convertible notes is based on quoted market prices, and the
      fair
      value of the credit facilities is based on dealer quotations.

Charter
      Operating Credit Facilities - General

The
      Charter Operating credit facilities were amended and restated concurrently
      with
      the sale of $1.5 billion senior second-lien notes in April 2004, among other
      things, to defer maturities and increase availability under these facilities
      and
      to enable Charter Operating to acquire the interests of the lenders under the
      CC
      VI Operating, CC VIII Operating and Falcon credit facilities, thereby
      consolidating all credit facilities under one amended and restated Charter
      Operating credit agreement.

The
      Charter Operating credit facilities provide borrowing availability of up to
      $6.5
      billion as follows:

·

two
      term
      facilities:

(i)

a Term A facility with a total principal amount
              of $2.0
              billion, of which 12.5% matures in 2007, 30% matures in 2008, 37.5%
              matures in 2009 and 20% matures in 2010; and

(ii)

a
                Term B facility with a total principal amount of $3.0 billion, which
                shall
                be repayable in 27 equal quarterly installments aggregating in each
                loan
                year to 1% of the original amount of the Term B facility, with the
                remaining balance due at final maturity in 2011;
                and

·

a
      revolving credit facility, in a total amount of $1.5 billion, with a maturity
      date in 2010.


Amounts
      outstanding under the Charter Operating credit facilities bear interest, at
      Charter Operating’s election, at a base rate or the Eurodollar rate, as defined,
      plus a margin for Eurodollar loans of up to 3.00% for the Term A facility and
      revolving credit facility, and up to 3.25% for the Term B facility, and for
      base
      rate loans of up to 2.00% for the Term A facility and revolving credit facility,
      and up to 2.25% for the Term B facility. A quarterly commitment fee of up to
      .75% is payable on the average daily unborrowed balance of the revolving credit
      facilities.

The
      obligations of our subsidiaries under the Charter Operating credit facilities
      (the "Obligations") are guaranteed by Charter Operating’s immediate parent
      company, CCO Holdings, and the subsidiaries of Charter Operating, except for
      immaterial subsidiaries and subsidiaries precluded from guaranteeing by reason
      of the provisions of other indebtedness to which they are subject (the
      "non-guarantor subsidiaries," primarily Renaissance and its subsidiaries).
      The
      Obligations are also secured by (i) a lien on all of the assets of Charter
      Operating and its subsidiaries (other than assets of the non-guarantor
      subsidiaries), to the extent such lien can be perfected under the Uniform
      Commercial Code by the filing of a financing statement, and (ii) a pledge by
      CCO
      Holdings of the equity interests owned by it in Charter Operating or any of
      Charter Operating's subsidiaries, as well as intercompany obligations owing
      to
      it by any of such entities.

Upon
      the
      Charter Holdings Leverage Ratio (as defined in the indenture governing the
      Charter Holdings senior notes and senior discount notes) being under 8.75 to
      1.0, the Charter Operating credit facilities require that the 11.875% notes
      due
      2008 issued by CC V Holdings, LLC be redeemed. Because such Leverage Ratio
      was
      determined to be under 8.75 to 1.0, CC V Holdings, LLC redeemed such notes
      in
      March 2005, and CC V Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries (other than
      non-guarantor subsidiaries) became guarantors of the Obligations and have
      granted a lien on all of their assets as to which a lien can be perfected under
      the Uniform Commercial Code by the filing of a financing statement.

Charter
      Operating Credit Facilities — Restrictive Covenants

The
      Charter Operating credit facilities contain representations and warranties,
      and
      affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type. The
      financial covenants measure performance against standards set for leverage,
      debt
      service coverage, and interest coverage, tested as of the end of each quarter.
      The maximum allowable leverage ratio is 4.25 to 1.0, the minimum allowable
      interest coverage ratio is 1.25 to 1.0 and the minimum allowable debt service
      coverage ratio is 1.05 to 1.0. Additionally, the Charter Operating credit
      facilities contain provisions requiring mandatory loan prepayments under
      specific circumstances, including when significant amounts of assets are sold
      and the proceeds are not reinvested in assets useful in the business of the
      borrower within a specified period, and upon the incurrence of certain
      indebtedness when the ratio of senior first lien debt to operating cash flow
      is
      greater than 2.0 to 1.0.

The
      Charter Operating credit facilities permit Charter Operating and its
      subsidiaries to make distributions to pay interest on the CCO Holdings senior
      notes, the CCH II senior notes, the CCH I senior notes, the CIH senior notes,
      the Charter Holdings senior notes and the Charter convertible senior notes,
      provided that, among other things, no default has occurred and is continuing
      under the Charter Operating credit facilities. The Charter Operating credit
      facilities restrict the ability of Charter Operating and its subsidiaries to
      make distributions for the purpose of repaying indebtedness of their parent
      companies, except for repayments of certain indebtedness which was existing
      at
      the time the credit facilities were amended and restated, provided that certain
      conditions are met, including the satisfaction of a 1.5 to 1.0 interest coverage
      ratio test and a minimum available liquidity requirement of $250 million.
      Conditions to future borrowings include absence of a default or an event of
      default under the Charter Operating credit facilities and the continued accuracy
      in all material respects of the representations and warranties, including the
      absence since December 31, 2003 of any event, development or circumstance that
      has had or could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
      our
      business.

The
      events of default under the Charter Operating credit facilities include, among
      other things:

(i)

the failure to make payments when due or within
              the
              applicable grace period,

(ii)

the
                failure to comply with specified covenants, including but not limited
                to a
                covenant to deliver audited financial statements with an unqualified
                opinion from our independent
                auditors,

(iii)

the
                failure to pay or the occurrence of events that cause or permit the
                acceleration of other indebtedness owing by CCO Holdings, Charter
                Operating or Charter Operating’s subsidiaries in amounts in excess of $50
                million in aggregate principal amount,


(iv)

the
                failure to pay or the occurrence of events that result in the acceleration
                of other indebtedness owing by certain of CCO Holdings’ direct and
                indirect parent companies in amounts in excess of $200 million in
                aggregate principal amount,

(v)

Paul
                Allen and/or certain of his family members and/or their exclusively
                owned
                entities (collectively, the "Paul Allen Group") ceasing to have the
                power,
                directly or indirectly, to vote at least 35% of the ordinary voting
                power
                of Charter Operating,

(vi)

the
                consummation of any transaction resulting in any person or group
                (other
                than the Paul Allen Group) having power, directly or indirectly,
                to vote
                more than 35% of the ordinary voting power of Charter Operating,
                unless
                the Paul Allen Group holds a greater share of ordinary voting power
                of
                Charter Operating,

(vii)

certain
                of Charter Operating’s indirect or direct parent companies having
                indebtedness in excess of $500 million aggregate principal amount
                which
                remains undefeased three months prior to the final maturity of such
                indebtedness, and

(viii)

Charter
                Operating ceasing to be a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of CCO Holdings,
                except in certain very limited circumstances.

Outstanding
      Notes

Charter
      Communications, Inc. Notes

4.75%
      Charter Convertible Notes due 2006

In
      May
      2001, Charter issued 4.75% convertible senior notes with a total principal
      amount at maturity of $633 million. As of December 31, 2005, there was $20
      million in total principal amount of these notes outstanding. The 4.75%
      convertible notes rank equally with any of our future unsubordinated and
      unsecured indebtedness, but are structurally subordinated to all existing and
      future indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries.

The
      4.75%
      convertible notes are convertible at the option of the holder into shares of
      Class A common stock at a conversion rate of 38.0952 shares per $1,000 principal
      amount of notes, which is equivalent to a price of $26.25 per share, subject
      to
      certain adjustments. Specifically, the adjustments include anti-dilutive
      provisions, which automatically occur based on the occurrence of specified
      events to provide protection rights to holders of the notes. Additionally,
      Charter may adjust the conversion ratio under certain circumstances when deemed
      appropriate. These notes are redeemable at our option at amounts decreasing
      from
      101.9% to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest
      beginning on June 4, 2004, to the date of redemption.

Interest
      is payable semiannually on December 1 and June 1, beginning December 1, 2001,
      until maturity on June 1, 2006.

Upon
      a
      change of control, subject to certain conditions and restrictions, Charter
      may
      be required to repurchase the notes, in whole or in part, at 100% of their
      principal amount plus accrued interest at the repurchase date.

Charter
      5.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2009

In
      November 2004, Charter issued 5.875% convertible senior notes due 2009 with
      a
      total original principal amount of $862.5 million. The 5.875% convertible senior
      notes are unsecured (except with respect to the collateral as described below)
      and rank equally with our existing and future unsubordinated and unsecured
      indebtedness (except with respect to the collateral described below), but are
      structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other
      liabilities of our subsidiaries. Interest is payable semi-annually in
      arrears.

The
      5.875% convertible senior notes are convertible at any time at the option of
      the
      holder into shares of Class A common stock at an initial conversion rate of
      413.2231 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to
      a
      conversion price of approximately $2.42 per share, subject to certain
      adjustments. Specifically, the adjustments include anti-dilutive provisions,
      which cause adjustments to occur automatically based on the occurrence of
      specified events to provide protection rights to holders of the notes. The
      conversion rate may also be increased (but not to exceed 462 shares per $1,000
      principal amount of notes) upon a specified change of control transaction.
      Additionally, Charter may elect to increase the conversion rate under certain
      circumstances when deemed appropriate and subject to applicable limitations
      of
      the NASDAQ stock market. Holders who convert their notes prior to November
      16,
      2007 will receive an early conversion make whole amount in respect of their
      notes based on a proportional share of the portfolio of pledged securities
      described below, with specified adjustments.

No
      holder
      of notes will be entitled to receive shares of our Class A common stock on
      conversion to the extent that receipt of the shares would cause the converting
      holder to become, directly or indirectly, a "beneficial holder''


(within
      the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
      promulgated thereunder) of more than 4.9% of the outstanding shares of our
      Class
      A common stock if such conversion would take place prior to November 16, 2008,
      or more than 9.9% thereafter.

If
      a
      holder tenders a note for conversion, we may direct that holder (unless we
      have
      called those notes for redemption) to a financial institution designated by
      us
      to conduct a transaction with that institution, on substantially the same terms
      that the holder would have received on conversion. But if any such financial
      institution does not accept such notes or does not deliver the required
      conversion consideration, we remain obligated to convert the notes.

Charter
        Holdco used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the notes to purchase
        a
        portfolio of U.S. government securities in an amount which we believe will
        be
        sufficient to make the first six interest payments on the notes. These
        government securities were pledged to us as security for a mirror note issued
        by
        Charter Holdco to Charter and pledged to the trustee under the indenture
        governing the notes as security for our obligations thereunder. We expect
        to use
        such securities to fund the first six interest payments under the notes,
        two of
        which were funded in 2005. The fair value of the pledged securities was $97
        million at December 31, 2005.

Upon
      a
      change of control and certain other fundamental changes, subject to certain
      conditions and restrictions, Charter may be required to repurchase the notes,
      in
      whole or in part, at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued interest at
      the
      repurchase date.

We
      may
      redeem the notes in whole or in part for cash at any time at a redemption price
      equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid
      interest, deferred interest and liquidated damages, if any, but only if for
      any
      20 trading days in any 30 consecutive trading day period the closing price
      has
      exceeded 180% of the conversion price, if such 30 trading day period begins
      prior to November 16, 2007 or 150% of the conversion price, if such 30 trading
      period begins thereafter. Holders who convert notes that we have called for
      redemption shall receive, in addition to the early conversion make whole amount,
      if applicable, the present value of the interest on the notes converted that
      would have been payable for the period from the later of November 17, 2007
      and
      the redemption date through the scheduled maturity date for the notes, plus
      any
      accrued deferred interest.

CCHC,
      LLC Note

In
            October 2005, Charter, acting through a Special Committee of Charter’s Board of
            Directors, and Mr. Allen, settled a dispute that had arisen between the
            parties
            with regard to the ownership of CC VIII. As part of that settlement,
            CCHC issued
            the CCHC note to CII. The CCHC note has a 15-year maturity. The CCHC
            note has an
            initial accreted value of $48 million accreting at the rate of 14% per
            annum
            compounded quarterly, except that from and after February 28, 2009, CCHC
            may pay
            any increase in the accreted value of the CCHC note in cash and the accreted
            value of the CCHC note will not increase to the extent such amount is
            paid in
            cash. The CCHC note is exchangeable at CII’s option, at any time, for Charter
            Holdco Class A Common units at a rate equal to the then accreted value,
            divided
            by $2.00 (the "Exchange Rate"). Customary anti-dilution protections have
            been
            provided that could cause future changes to the Exchange Rate. Additionally,
            the
            Charter Holdco Class A Common units received will be exchangeable by
            the holder
            into Charter common stock in accordance with existing agreements between
            CII,
            Charter and certain other parties signatory thereto. Beginning February
            28,
            2009, if the closing price of Charter common stock is at or above the
            Exchange
            Rate for a certain period of time as specified in the Exchange Agreement,
            Charter Holdco may require the exchange of the CCHC note for Charter
            Holdco
            Class A Common units at the Exchange Rate. Additionally, CCHC has the
            right to
            redeem the CCHC note under certain circumstances for cash in an amount
            equal to
            the then accreted value, such amount, if redeemed prior to February 28,
            2009,
            would also include a make whole up to the accreted value through February
            28,
            2009. CCHC must redeem the CCHC note at its maturity for cash in an amount
            equal
            to the initial stated value plus the accreted return through maturity.
            The
            accreted value of the CCHC note is $49 million as of December 31, 2005
            and is
            recorded in Notes Payable - Related Party in the accompanying consolidated
            financial statements contained in "Item 8. Financial Statements and
            Supplementary Data."

Charter
      Communications Holdings, LLC Notes

March
      1999 Charter Holdings Notes

The
      March
      1999 Charter Holdings notes were issued under three separate indentures, each
      dated as of March 17, 1999, among Charter Holdings and Charter Capital, as
      the
      issuers, and BNY Midwest Trust Company, as trustee.


Charter
      Holdings and Charter Capital exchanged these notes for new notes with
      substantially similar terms, except that the new notes are registered under
      the
      Securities Act.

The
      March
      1999 Charter Holdings notes are general unsecured obligations of Charter
      Holdings and Charter Capital. Cash interest on the March 1999 9.920% Charter
      Holdings notes began to accrue on April 1, 2004.

The
      March
      1999 Charter Holdings notes are senior debt obligations of Charter Holdings
      and
      Charter Capital. They rank equally with all other current and future
      unsubordinated obligations of Charter Holdings and Charter Capital. They are

structurally
      subordinated

to
      the
      obligations of Charter Holdings' subsidiaries, including the CIH notes, the
      CCH
      I notes, CCH II notes, the CCO Holdings notes, the Renaissance notes, the
      Charter Operating notes and the Charter Operating credit facilities.

Charter
      Holdings and Charter Capital will not have the right to redeem the March 1999
      8.250% Charter Holdings notes prior to their maturity date on April 1, 2007.
      Charter Holdings and Charter Capital may redeem some or all of the March 1999
      8.625% Charter Holdings notes and the March 1999 9.920% Charter Holdings notes
      at any time, in each case, at a premium. The optional redemption price declines
      to 100% of the principal amount of March 1999 Charter Holdings notes redeemed,
      plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, for redemption on or after April
      1,
      2007.

In
      the
      event that a specified change of control event occurs, Charter Holdings and
      Charter Capital must offer to repurchase any then outstanding March 1999 Charter
      Holdings notes at 101% of their principal amount or accreted value, as
      applicable, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.

The
      indentures governing the March 1999 Charter Holdings notes contain restrictive
      covenants that limit certain transactions or activities by Charter Holdings
      and
      its restricted subsidiaries. Substantially all of Charter Holdings' direct
      and
      indirect subsidiaries are currently restricted subsidiaries. See " — Summary of
      Restrictive Covenants under Charter Holdings High-Yield Notes."

      each dated as of January 12, 2000, among Charter Holdings and Charter Capital,
      as the issuers, and BNY Midwest Trust Company, as trustee. In June 2000, Charter
      Holdings and Charter Capital exchanged these notes for new notes with

      the
      Charter Operating credit facilities.

      Holdings and Charter Capital will not have the right to redeem the January
      10.00% Charter Holdings notes prior to their maturity on April 1, 2009. Charter

      Charter Holdings notes and the January 2000 11.75% Charter Holdings notes at

      15,
      2008.

      covenants as those contained in the indentures governing the March 1999 Charter
      Holdings notes. See " — Summary of Restrictive Covenants under Charter Holdings
      High-Yield Notes."

      2001 Charter Holdings notes were issued under three separate indentures, each
      among Charter Holdings and Charter Capital, as the issuers, and BNY Midwest
      Trust Company, as trustee. In September 2001, Charter Holdings and Charter
      Capital exchanged substantially all of these notes for new notes with

Charter
      Holdings and Charter Capital will not have the right to redeem the May 2001
      9.625% Charter Holdings notes prior to their maturity on November 15, 2009.
      On

      all of the May 2001 10.000% Charter Holdings notes and the May 2001 11.750%

January
      2002 Charter Holdings Notes

The
      January 2002 Charter Holdings notes were issued under three separate indentures,
      each among Charter Holdings and Charter Capital, as the issuers, and BNY Midwest
      Trust Company, as trustee, two of which were supplements to the indentures
      for
      the May 2001 Charter Holdings notes. In July 2002, Charter Holdings and Charter
      Capital exchanged substantially all of these notes for new notes, with
      substantially similar terms, except that the new notes are registered under
      the
      Securities Act.

The
      January 2002 Charter Holdings notes are general unsecured obligations of Charter
      Holdings and Charter Capital. Cash interest on the January 2002 12.125% Charter
      Holdings notes will not accrue prior to January 15, 2007.

The
      January 2002 Charter Holdings notes are senior debt obligations of Charter
      Holdings and Charter Capital. They rank equally with the current and future
      unsecured and unsubordinated debt of Charter Holdings and Charter Capital.
      They
      are

structurally
      subordinated

to
      the
      obligations of Charter Holdings' subsidiaries, including the CIH notes, the
      CCH
      I notes, the CCH II notes, the CCO Holdings notes, the Renaissance notes, the
      Charter Operating notes and the Charter Operating

credit
      facilities

.

The
      Charter Holdings 12.125% senior discount notes are redeemable at the option
      of
      the issuers at amounts decreasing from 106.063% to 100% of accreted value
      beginning January 15, 2007.

In
      the
      event that a specified change of control event occurs, Charter Holdings and
      Charter Capital must offer to repurchase any then outstanding January 2002
      Charter Holdings notes at 101% of their total principal amount or accreted
      value, as applicable, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.

The
      indentures governing the January 2002 Charter Holdings notes contain
      substantially identical events of default, affirmative covenants and negative
      covenants as those contained in the indentures governing the March 1999, January
      2000, January 2001 and May 2001 Charter Holdings notes. See " — Summary of
      Restrictive Covenants under Charter Holdings High-Yield Notes."

Summary
      of Restrictive Covenants under Charter Holdings High-Yield
      Notes.

The
      limitations on incurrence of debt and issuance of preferred stock contained
      in
      Charter Holdings' indentures permit Charter Holdings and its subsidiaries to
      incur additional debt or issue preferred stock, so long as there is no default
      under the Charter Holdings indentures. These limitations restrict the incurrence
      of debt unless,

after
      giving pro forma effect to the incurrence, the Charter Holdings Leverage Ratio
      would be below 8.75 to 1.0. In addition, regardless of whether the leverage
      ratio could be met, so long as no default exists or would result from the
      incurrence or issuance, Charter Holdings and its restricted subsidiaries are
      permitted to issue:

·

up
                to $3.5 billion of debt under credit
                facilities,

·

up
                to $75 million of debt incurred to finance the purchase or capital
                lease
                of new assets,

·

up
                to $300 million of additional debt for any
                purpose,

·

additional
                debt in an amount equal to 200% of proceeds of new cash equity proceeds
                received by Charter Holdings and its restricted subsidiaries since
                March
                1999, the date of our first indenture, and not allocated for restricted
                payments or permitted investments, and

·

other
                items of indebtedness for specific purposes such as intercompany
                debt,
                refinancing of existing debt, and interest rate swaps to provide
                protection against fluctuation in interest
                rates.


Indebtedness
      under a single facility or agreement may be incurred in part under one of the
      categories listed above and in part under another. Accordingly, indebtedness
      under our credit facilities is incurred under a combination of the categories
      of
      permitted indebtedness listed above.

The
      restricted subsidiaries of Charter Holdings are generally not permitted to
      issue
      debt securities contractually subordinated in right of payment to other debt
      of
      the issuing subsidiary or preferred stock, in either case in any public or
      Rule
      144A offering.

The
      Charter Holdings indentures permit Charter Holdings and its restricted
      subsidiaries to incur debt under one category, and later reclassify that debt
      into another category. The Charter Operating credit facilities generally impose
      more restrictive limitations on incurring new debt than Charter Holdings'
      indentures, so our subsidiaries that are subject to the Charter Operating credit
      facilities may not be permitted to utilize the full debt incurrence that would
      otherwise be available under the Charter Holdings indenture
      covenants.

Generally,
      under Charter Holdings' high-yield indentures:

·

Charter
                Holdings and its restricted subsidiaries are generally permitted
                to pay
                dividends on equity interests, repurchase interests, or make other
                specified restricted payments only if, Charter Holdings can incur
                $1.00 of
                new debt under the Charter Holdings leverage ratio test which requires
                8.75 to 1.0 leverage ratio after giving effect to the transaction
                and if
                no default exists or would exist as a consequence of such incurrence.
                If
                those conditions are met, restricted payments in a total amount of
                up to
                100% of Charter Holding's consolidated EBITDA, as defined, minus
                1.2 times
                its consolidated interest expense, plus 100% of new cash and non-cash
                equity proceeds received by Charter Holdings and not allocated to
                the debt
                incurrence covenant or to permitted investments, all cumulatively
                from
                March 1999, the date of the first Charter Holdings indenture, plus
                $100
                million.

In
      addition, Charter Holdings may make distributions or restricted payments, so
      long as no default exists or would be caused by transactions:

·

to
                repurchase management equity interests in amounts not to exceed $10
                million per fiscal year,

·

regardless
                of the existence of any default, to pay pass-through tax liabilities
                in
                respect of ownership of equity interests in Charter Holdings or its
                restricted subsidiaries, or

·

to
                make other specified restricted payments including merger fees up
                to 1.25%
                of the transaction value, repurchases using concurrent new issuances,
                and
                certain dividends on existing subsidiary preferred equity
                interests.

Charter
      Holdings and its restricted subsidiaries may not make investments except
      permitted investments if there is a default under the indentures or if, after
      giving effect to the transaction, the Charter Holdings Leverage Ratio would
      be
      above 8.75 to 1.0.

Permitted
      investments include:

·

investments
                by Charter Holdings in restricted subsidiaries or by restricted
                subsidiaries in Charter Holdings,

·

investments
                in productive assets (including through equity investments) aggregating
                up
                to $150 million since March 1999,

·

investments
                aggregating up to 100% of new cash equity proceeds received by Charter
                Holdings since March 1999 and not allocated to the debt incurrence
                or
                restricted payments covenant, and

·

other
                investments aggregating up to $50 million since March
                1999.

Charter
      Holdings is not permitted to grant liens on its assets other than specified
      permitted liens. Permitted liens include liens securing debt and other
      obligations incurred under our subsidiaries' credit facilities, liens securing
      the purchase price of new assets, liens securing indebtedness of up to $50
      million and other specified liens incurred in the ordinary course of business.
      The lien covenant does not restrict liens on assets of subsidiaries of Charter
      Holdings.


Charter
      Holdings and Charter Capital, its co-issuer, are generally not permitted to
      sell
      all or substantially all of their assets or merge with or into other companies
      unless their leverage ratio after any such transaction would be no greater
      than
      their leverage ratio immediately prior to the transaction, or unless after
      giving effect to the transaction, the Charter Holdings Leverage Ratio would
      be
      below 8.75 to 1.0, no default exists, and the surviving entity is a U.S. entity
      that assumes the Charter Holdings notes.

Charter
      Holdings and its restricted subsidiaries may generally not otherwise sell assets
      or, in the case of restricted subsidiaries, issue equity interests, unless
      they
      receive consideration at least equal to the fair market value of the assets
      or
      equity interests, consisting of at least 75% in cash, assumption of liabilities,
      securities converted into cash within 60 days or productive assets. Charter
      Holdings and its restricted subsidiaries are then required within 365 days
      after
      any asset sale either to commit to use the net cash proceeds over a specified
      threshold to acquire assets, including current assets, used or useful in their
      businesses or use the net cash proceeds to repay debt, or to offer to repurchase
      the Charter Holdings notes with any remaining proceeds.

Charter
      Holdings and its restricted subsidiaries may generally not engage in sale and
      leaseback transactions unless, at the time of the transaction, Charter Holdings
      could have incurred secured indebtedness in an amount equal to the present
      value
      of the net rental payments to be made under the lease, and the sale of the
      assets and application of proceeds is permitted by the covenant restricting
      asset sales.

Charter
      Holdings' restricted subsidiaries may generally not enter into restrictions
      on
      their ability to make dividends or distributions or transfer assets to Charter
      Holdings on terms that are materially more restrictive than those governing
      their debt, lien, asset sale, lease and similar agreements existing when they
      entered into the indentures, unless those restrictions are on customary terms
      that will not materially impair Charter Holdings' ability to repay the
      high-yield notes.

The
      restricted subsidiaries of Charter Holdings are generally not permitted to
      guarantee or pledge assets to secure debt of Charter Holdings, unless the
      guaranteeing subsidiary issues a guarantee of the notes of comparable priority
      and tenor, and waives any rights of reimbursement, indemnity or subrogation
      arising from the guarantee transaction for at least one year.

The
      indentures also restrict the ability of Charter Holdings and its restricted
      subsidiaries to enter into certain transactions with affiliates involving
      consideration in excess of $15 million without a determination by the board
      of
      directors of Charter Holdings

that
      the
      transaction is on terms no less favorable than arms length, or transactions
      with
      affiliates involving over $50 million without receiving an independent opinion
      as to the fairness of the transaction addressed to the holders of the Charter
      Holdings notes.

CCH
      I Holdings, LLC Notes

In
      September 2005, CIH and CCH I Holdings Capital Corp. jointly issued $2.5 billion
      total principal amount of 9.92% to 13.50% senior accreting notes due 2014 and
      2015 in exchange for an aggregate amount of $2.4 billion of Charter Holdings
      notes due 2011 and 2012, spread over six series of notes and with varying
      interest rates as set forth in the table above under "Description of Our
      Outstanding Debt." The notes are guaranteed by Charter Holdings.

The
      CIH
      notes are senior debt obligations of CIH and CCH I Holdings Capital Corp. They
      rank equally with all other current and future unsecured, unsubordinated
      obligations of CIH and CCH I Holdings Capital Corp. The CIH notes are
      structurally subordinated to all obligations of subsidiaries of CIH, including
      the CCH I notes, the CCH II notes, the CCO Holdings notes, the Renaissance
      notes, the Charter Operating notes and the Charter Operating credit facilities.

The
      CIH
      notes may not be redeemed at the option of the issuers until September 30,
      2007.
      On or after such date, the CIH notes may be redeemed in accordance with the

In
      the
      event that a specified change of control event happens, CIH and CCH I Holdings
      Capital Corp. must offer to repurchase any outstanding notes at a price equal
      to
      the sum of the accreted value of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest
      plus
      a premium that varies over time.

The
      indenture governing the CIH notes contains restrictive covenants similar to
      those contained in the indenture governing the Charter Holdings notes with
      the
      following exceptions:

·

The
                debt incurrence covenant permits up to $9.75 billion (rather than
                $3.5
                billion) of debt under credit facilities (less the amount of net
                proceeds
                of asset sales applied to repay such debt as required by the asset
                sale
                covenant).

·

CIH
                and its restricted subsidiaries are generally permitted to pay dividends
                on equity interests, repurchase interests, or make other specified
                restricted payments only if, after giving pro forma effect to the
                transaction, the CIH Leverage Ratio would be below 8.75 to 1.0 and
                if no
                default exists or would exist as a consequence of such transaction.
                If
                those conditions are met, restricted payments are permitted in a
                total
                amount of up to the sum of (1) the greater of (a) $500 million or
                (b) 100%
                of CIH’s consolidated EBITDA, as defined, minus 1.2 times its consolidated
                interest expense each for the period from September 28, 2005 to the
                end of
                CIH’s most recently ended full fiscal quarter for which internal financial
                statements are available, plus (2) 100% of new cash and non-cash
                equity
                proceeds received by CIH and not allocated to the debt incurrence
                covenant
                or to permitted investments, all cumulatively from September 28,
                2005.

·

Instead
                of the $150 million and $50 million permitted investment baskets
                described
                above, there is a $750 million permitted investment
                basket.

CCH
      I, LLC Notes

In
      September 2005, CCH I and CCH I Capital Corp. jointly issued $3.5 billion total
      principal amount of 11% senior secured notes due October 2015 in exchange for
      an
      aggregate amount of $4.2 billion of certain Charter Holdings notes. The notes
      are guaranteed by Charter Holdings and are secured by a pledge of 100% of the
      equity interest of CCH I’s wholly owned direct subsidiary, CCH II. Such pledge
      is subject to significant limitations as described in the related pledge
      agreement. Interest on the CCH I notes accrues at 11% per annum and is payable
      semi-annually in arrears on each April 1 and October 1, commencing on April
      1,
      2006.

The
      CCH I
      notes are senior debt obligations of CCH I and CCH I Capital Corp. To the extent
      of the value of the collateral, they rank senior to all of CCH I’s future
      unsecured senior indebtedness. The CCH I notes are structurally


subordinated
      to all obligations of subsidiaries of CCH I, including the CCH II notes, CCO
      Holdings notes, the Renaissance notes, the Charter Operating notes and the
      Charter Operating credit facilities.

CCH
      I and
      CCH I Capital Corp. may, prior to October 1, 2008 in the event of a qualified
      equity offering providing sufficient proceeds, redeem up to 35% of the aggregate
      principal amount of the CCH I notes at a redemption price of 111% of the
      principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Aside from this provision,
      CCH I and CCH I Capital Corp. may not redeem at their option any of the notes
      prior to October 1, 2010. On or after October 1, 2010, CCH I and CCH I Capital
      Corp. may redeem, in whole or in part, CCH I notes at the applicable prices
      (expressed as percentages of principal amount) listed below, plus accrued and
      unpaid interest if redeemed during the twelve month period beginning on October
      1 of the years listed below.

If
      a
      change of control occurs, each holder of the CCH I notes will have the right
      to
      require the repurchase of all or any part of that holder’s CCH I notes at 101%
      of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.

The
      indenture governing the CCH I notes contains restrictive covenants that limit
      certain transactions or activities by CCH I and its restricted subsidiaries,
      including the covenants summarized below. Substantially all of CCH I’s direct
      and indirect subsidiaries are currently restricted subsidiaries.

The
      covenant in the indenture governing the CCH I notes that restricts incurrence
      of
      debt and issuance of preferred stock permits CCH I and its subsidiaries to
      incur
      or issue specified amounts of debt or preferred stock, if, after giving pro
      forma effect to the incurrence or issuance, CCH I could meet a leverage ratio
      (ratio of consolidated debt to four times EBITDA, as defined, from the most
      recent fiscal quarter for which internal financial reports are available) of
      7.5
      to 1.0.

In
      addition, regardless of whether the leverage ratio could be met, so long as
      no
      default exists or would result from the incurrence or issuance, CCH I and its
      restricted subsidiaries are permitted to incur or issue:

·

up
                to $9.75 billion of debt under credit facilities (less the amount
                of net
                proceeds of asset sales applied to repay such debt as required by
                the
                asset sale covenant);

·

up
                to $75 million of debt incurred to finance the purchase or capital
                lease
                of new assets;

·

up
                to $300 million of additional debt for any purpose;
                and

·

other
                items of indebtedness for specific purposes such as intercompany
                debt,
                refinancing of existing debt, and interest rate swaps to provide
                protection against fluctuation in interest
                rates.

The
      restricted subsidiaries of CCH I are generally not permitted to issue debt
      securities contractually subordinated to other debt of the issuing subsidiary
      or
      preferred stock, in either case in any public offering or private placement.

The
      CCH I
      indenture generally permits CCH I and its restricted subsidiaries to incur
      debt
      under one category, and later reclassify that debt into another category. The
      Charter Operating credit facilities generally impose more restrictive
      limitations on incurring new debt than those in the CCH I indenture, so our
      subsidiaries that are subject to credit facilities are not permitted to utilize
      the full debt incurrence that would otherwise be available under the CCH I
      indenture covenants.

Generally,
      under the CCH I indenture:

·

CCH
                I and its restricted subsidiaries are permitted to pay dividends
                on equity
                interests, repurchase interests, or make other specified restricted
                payments only if CCH I can incur $1.00 of new debt under the leverage
                ratio test, which requires that CCH I meet a 7.5 to 1.0 leverage
                ratio
                after giving effect to the transaction, and if no default exists
                or would
                exist as a consequence of such incurrence. If those conditions are
                met,


restricted payments are permitted in a total amount
              of up
              to 100% of CCH I’s consolidated EBITDA, as defined, for the period from
              September 28, 2005 to the end of CCH I’s most recently ended full fiscal
              quarter for which financial statements are available minus 1.3 times
              its
              consolidated interest expense for such period, plus 100% of new cash
              and
              appraised non-cash equity proceeds received by CCH I and not allocated
              to
              certain investments, from and after September 28, 2005, plus $100
              million.

In
      addition, CCH I and its restricted subsidiaries may make distributions or
      restricted payments, so long as no default exists or would be caused by the
      transaction:

·

to
                repurchase management equity interests in amounts not to exceed $10
                million per fiscal year;

·

to
                pay, regardless of the existence of any default, pass-through tax
                liabilities in respect of ownership of equity interests in CCH I
                or its
                restricted subsidiaries;

·

to
                enable certain of its parents to pay interest on certain of their
                indebtedness;

·

to
                enable certain of its parents to purchase, redeem or refinance certain
                indebtedness, so long as CCH I could incur $1.00 of indebtedness
                under the
                7.5 to 1.0 leverage ratio test referred to above;
                or

·

to
                make other specified restricted payments including merger fees up
                to 1.25%
                of the transaction value, repurchases using concurrent new issuances,
                and
                certain dividends on existing subsidiary preferred equity
                interests.

The
      indenture governing the CCH I notes restricts CCH I and its restricted
      subsidiaries from making investments, except specified permitted investments,
      or
      creating new unrestricted subsidiaries, if there is a default under the
      indenture or if CCH I could not incur $1.00 of new debt under the 7.5 to 1.0
      leverage ratio test described above after giving effect to the transaction.

Permitted
      investments include:

·

investments
                by CCH I and its restricted subsidiaries in CCH I and in other restricted
                subsidiaries, or entities that become restricted subsidiaries as
                a result
                of the investment,

·

investments
                aggregating up to 100% of new cash equity proceeds received by CCH
                I since
                September 28, 2005 to the extent the proceeds have not been allocated
                to
                the restricted payments covenant described
                above,

·

other
                investments up to $750 million outstanding at any time,
                and

·

certain
                specified additional investments, such as investments in customers
                and
                suppliers in the ordinary course of business and investments received
                in
                connection with permitted asset
                sales.

CCH
      I is
      not permitted to grant liens on its assets other than specified permitted liens.
      Permitted liens include liens securing the purchase price of new assets, liens
      securing obligations up to $50 million and other specified liens. The lien
      covenant does not restrict liens on assets of subsidiaries of CCH I.

CCH
      I and
      CCH I Capital Corp., its co-issuer, are generally not permitted to sell all
      or
      substantially all of their assets or merge with or into other companies unless
      their leverage ratio after any such transaction would be no greater than their
      leverage ratio immediately prior to the transaction, or unless CCH I and its
      subsidiaries could incur $1.00 of new debt under the 7.50 to 1.0 leverage ratio
      test described above after giving effect to the transaction, no default exists,
      and the surviving entity is a U.S. entity that assumes the CCH I notes.

CCH
      I and
      its restricted subsidiaries may generally not otherwise sell assets or, in
      the
      case of restricted subsidiaries, issue equity interests, unless they receive
      consideration at least equal to the fair market value of the assets or equity
      interests, consisting of at least 75% in cash, assumption of liabilities,
      securities converted into cash within 60 days or productive assets. CCH I and
      its restricted subsidiaries are then required within 365 days after any asset
      sale either to commit to use the net cash proceeds over a specified threshold
      to
      acquire assets, including current assets, used or useful in their businesses
      or
      use the net cash proceeds to repay certain debt, or to offer to repurchase
      the
      CCH I notes with any remaining proceeds.


CCH
      I and
      its restricted subsidiaries may generally not engage in sale and leaseback
      transactions unless, at the time of the transaction, CCH I could have incurred
      secured indebtedness in an amount equal to the present value of the net rental
      payments to be made under the lease, and the sale of the assets and application
      of proceeds is permitted by the covenant restricting asset sales.

With
      certain exceptions, CCH I’s restricted subsidiaries may generally not enter into
      restrictions on their ability to make dividends or distributions or transfer
      assets to CCH I.

The
      restricted subsidiaries of CCH I are generally not permitted to guarantee or
      pledge assets to secure other debt of CCH I, except in respect of credit
      facilities unless the guarantying subsidiary issues a guarantee of the CCH
      I
      notes and waives any rights of reimbursement, indemnity or subrogation arising
      from the guarantee transaction for at least one year.

The
      indenture also restricts the ability of CCH I and its restricted subsidiaries
      to
      enter into certain transactions with affiliates involving consideration in
      excess of $15 million without a determination by the board of directors that
      the
      transaction is on terms no less favorable than arms-length, or transactions
      with
      affiliates involving over $50 million without receiving an independent opinion
      as to the fairness of the transaction to the holders of the CCH I notes.

CCH
      II, LLC Notes

In
      September 2003, CCH II and CCH II Capital Corp. jointly issued approximately
      $1.6 billion total principal amount of 10.25% senior notes due 2010 and in
      January 2006, they issued an additional $450 million principal amount of these
      notes. The CCH II notes are general unsecured obligations of CCH II and CCH
      II
      Capital Corp. They rank equally with all other current or future unsubordinated
      obligations of CCH II and CCH II Capital Corp. The CCH II notes are

structurally
      subordinated

to
      all
      obligations of subsidiaries of CCH II, including the CCO Holdings notes, the
      Renaissance notes, the Charter Operating notes and the Charter Operating credit
      facilities.

Interest
      on the CCH II notes accrues at 10.25% per annum and is payable semi-annually
      in
      arrears on each March 15 and September 15, commencing on March 15,
      2004.

At
      any
      time prior to September 15, 2006, the issuers of the CCH II notes may redeem
      up
      to 35% of the total principal amount of the CCH II notes on a pro rata basis
      at
      a redemption price equal to 110.25% of the principal amount of CCH II notes
      redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest.

On
      or
      after September 15, 2008, the issuers of the CCH II notes may redeem all or
      a
      part of the notes at a redemption price that declines ratably from the initial
      redemption price of 105.125% to a redemption price on or after September 15,
      2009 of 100.0% of the principal amount of the CCH II notes redeemed, plus,
      in
      each case, any accrued and unpaid interest.

In
      the
      event of specified change of control events, CCH II must offer to purchase
      the
      outstanding CCH II notes from the holders at a purchase price equal to 101%
      of
      the total principal amount of the notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest.

The
      indenture governing the CCH II notes contains restrictive covenants that limit
      certain transactions or activities by CCH II and its restricted subsidiaries,
      including the covenants summarized below. Substantially all of CCH II's direct
      and indirect subsidiaries are currently restricted subsidiaries.

The
      covenant in the indenture governing the CCH II notes that restricts incurrence
      of debt and issuance of preferred stock permits CCH II and its subsidiaries
      to
      incur or issue specified amounts of debt or preferred stock, if, after giving
      effect to the incurrence, CCH II could meet a leverage ratio (ratio of
      consolidated debt to four times EBITDA from the most recent fiscal quarter
      for
      which internal financial reports are available) of 5.5 to 1.0.

In
      addition, regardless of whether the leverage ratio could be met, so long as
      no
      default exists or would result from the incurrence or issuance, CCH II and
      its
      restricted subsidiaries are permitted to incur or issue:

·

up
                to $9.75 billion of debt under credit facilities, including debt
                under
                credit facilities outstanding on the issue date of the CCH II
                notes,


·

up
                to $75 million of debt incurred to finance the purchase or capital
                lease
                of new assets,

·

up
                to $300 million of additional debt for any purpose,
                and

·

other
                items of indebtedness for specific purposes such as intercompany
                debt,
                refinancing of existing debt, and interest rate swaps to provide
                protection against fluctuation in interest rates.

The
      restricted subsidiaries of CCH II are generally not permitted to issue debt
      securities contractually subordinated to other debt of the issuing subsidiary
      or
      preferred stock, in either case in any public or Rule 144A offering.

The
      CCH
      II indenture permits CCH II and its restricted subsidiaries to incur debt under
      one category, and later reclassify that debt into another category. Our and
      our
      subsidiaries' credit agreements generally impose more restrictive limitations
      on
      incurring new debt than the CCH II indenture, so we and our subsidiaries that
      are subject to credit agreements are not permitted to utilize the full debt
      incurrence that would otherwise be available under the CCH II indenture
      covenants.

Generally,
      under the CCH II indenture, CCH II and its restricted subsidiaries are permitted
      to pay dividends on equity interests, repurchase interests, or make other
      specified restricted payments only if CCH II can incur $1.00 of new debt under
      the leverage ratio test, which requires that CCH II meet a 5.5 to 1.0 leverage
      ratio after giving effect to the transaction, and if no default exists or would
      exist as a consequence of such incurrence. If those conditions are met,
      restricted payments are permitted in a total amount of up to 100% of CCH II's
      consolidated EBITDA, as defined, minus 1.3 times its consolidated interest
      expense, plus 100% of new cash and non-cash equity proceeds received by CCH
      II
      and not allocated to the debt incurrence covenant, all cumulatively from the
      fiscal quarter commenced July 1, 2003, plus $100 million.

In
      addition, CCH II may make distributions or restricted payments, so long as
      no
      default exists or would be caused by transactions:

·

to
                repurchase management equity interests in amounts not to exceed $10
                million per fiscal year,

·

regardless
                of the existence of any default, to pay pass-through tax liabilities
                in
                respect of ownership of equity interests in CCH II or its restricted
                subsidiaries,

·

regardless
                of the existence of any default, to pay interest when due on Charter
                Holdings notes, CIH notes and CCH I notes,

·

to
                purchase, redeem or refinance, so long as CCH II could incur $1.00
                of
                indebtedness under the 5.5 to 1.0 leverage ratio test referred to
                above
                and there is no default, Charter Holdings notes, CIH notes, CCH I
                notes,
                Charter convertible notes, and other direct or indirect parent company
                notes,

·

to
                make distributions in connection with the private exchanges pursuant
                to
                which the CCH II notes were issued,
                and

·

other
                specified restricted payments including merger fees up to 1.25% of
                the
                transaction value, repurchases using concurrent new issuances, and
                certain
                dividends on existing subsidiary preferred equity
                interests.

The
      indenture governing the CCH II notes restricts CCH II and its restricted
      subsidiaries from making investments, except specified permitted investments,
      or
      creating new unrestricted subsidiaries, if there is a default under the
      indenture or if CCH II could not incur $1.00 of new debt under the 5.5 to 1.0
      leverage ratio test described above after giving effect to the
      transaction.

Permitted
      investments include:

·

investments
                by CCH II and its restricted subsidiaries in CCH II and in other
                restricted subsidiaries, or entities that become restricted subsidiaries
                as a result of the investment,

                since September 23, 2003 to the extent the proceeds have not been
                allocated to the restricted payments covenant described
                above,


·

investments
                resulting from the private exchanges pursuant to which the CCH II

                in
                connection with permitted asset sales.

CCH
      II is
      not permitted to grant liens on its assets other than specified permitted liens.
      Permitted liens include liens securing debt and other obligations incurred
      under
      our subsidiaries' credit facilities, liens securing the purchase price of new
      assets, and liens securing indebtedness up to $50 million and other specified
      liens incurred in the ordinary course of business. The lien covenant does not
      restrict liens on assets of subsidiaries of CCH II.

CCO
      Holdings, LLC Notes

¾%
      Senior Notes due 2013

In
      November 2003 and August 2005, CCO Holdings and CCO Holdings Capital Corp.
      jointly issued $500 million and $300 million, respectively, total principal
      amount of 8¾% senior notes due 2013.

Interest
      on the CCO Holdings senior notes accrues at 8¾% per year and is payable
      semi-annually in arrears on each May 15 and November 15.

At
      any
      time prior to November 15, 2006, the issuers of the CCO Holdings senior notes
      may redeem up to 35% of the total principal amount of the CCO Holdings senior
      notes to the extent of public equity proceeds they have received on a pro rata
      basis at a redemption price equal to 108.75% of the principal amount of CCO
      Holdings senior notes redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest.

On
      or
      after November 15, 2008, the issuers of the CCO Holdings senior notes may redeem

      the
      initial redemption price of 104.375% to a redemption price on or after November

Senior
      Floating Rate Notes Due 2010

In
      December 2004, CCO Holdings and CCO Holdings Capital Corp. jointly issued $550
      million total principal amount of senior floating rate notes due 2010.

The

      June

      of one or more public equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 100%
      of
      the principal amount, plus a premium equal to the interest rate per annum
      applicable to the notes on the date notice of redemption is given, plus accrued

      101%
      of the principal amount and from and after December 15, 2008, at par, in each
      case, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

Additional
      terms of the CCO Holdings Senior Notes and Senior Floating Rate
      Notes

The
      CCO
      Holdings notes are general unsecured obligations of CCO Holdings and CCO
      Holdings Capital Corp. They rank equally with all other current or future
      unsubordinated obligations of CCO Holdings and CCO Holdings Capital Corp. The
      CCO Holdings notes are structurally subordinated to all obligations of
      subsidiaries of CCO Holdings, including the Renaissance notes, the Charter
      Operating notes and the Charter Operating credit facilities.


In
      the
      event of specified change of control events, CCO Holdings must offer to purchase
      the outstanding CCO Holdings senior notes from the holders at a purchase price
      equal to 101% of the total principal amount of the notes, plus any accrued
      and
      unpaid interest.

The
      indenture governing the CCO Holdings senior notes contains restrictive covenants
      that limit certain transactions or activities by CCO Holdings and its restricted
      subsidiaries, including the covenants summarized below. Substantially all of
      CCO
      Holdings' direct and indirect subsidiaries are currently restricted
      subsidiaries.

The
      covenant in the indenture governing the CCO Holdings senior notes that restricts
      incurrence of debt and issuance of preferred stock permits CCO Holdings and
      its
      subsidiaries to incur or issue specified amounts of debt or preferred stock,
      if,
      after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence or issuance, CCO Holdings could
      meet a leverage ratio (ratio of consolidated debt to four times EBITDA, as
      defined, from the most recent fiscal quarter for which internal financial
      reports are available) of 4.5 to 1.0.

In
      addition, regardless of whether the leverage ratio could be met, so long as
      no
      default exists or would result from the incurrence or issuance, CCO Holdings
      and
      its restricted subsidiaries are permitted to incur or issue:

·

up
                to $9.75 billion of debt under credit facilities, including debt
                under
                credit facilities outstanding on the issue date of the CCO Holdings
                senior
                notes,

·

up
                to $75 million of debt incurred to finance the purchase or capital
                lease
                of new assets,

·

up
                to $300 million of additional debt for any purpose,
                and

·

other
                items of indebtedness for specific purposes such as intercompany
                debt,
                refinancing of existing debt, and interest rate swaps to provide
                protection against fluctuation in interest
                rates.

The
      restricted subsidiaries of CCO Holdings are generally not permitted to issue
      debt securities contractually subordinated to other debt of the issuing
      subsidiary or preferred stock, in either case in any public or Rule 144A
      offering.

The
      CCO
      Holdings indenture permits CCO Holdings and its restricted subsidiaries to
      incur
      debt under one category, and later reclassify that debt into another category.
      The Charter Operating credit facilities generally impose more restrictive
      limitations on incurring new debt than CCO Holdings' indenture, so our
      subsidiaries that are subject to credit facilities are not permitted to utilize
      the full debt incurrence that would otherwise be available under the CCO
      Holdings indenture covenants.

Generally,
      under CCO Holdings' indenture:

·

CCO
                Holdings and its restricted subsidiaries are permitted to pay dividends
                on
                equity interests, repurchase interests, or make other specified restricted
                payments only if CCO Holdings can incur $1.00 of new debt under the
                leverage ratio test, which requires that CCO Holdings meet a 4.5
                to 1.0
                leverage ratio after giving effect to the transaction, and if no
                default
                exists or would exist as a consequence of such incurrence. If those
                conditions are met, restricted payments are permitted in a total
                amount of
                up to 100% of CCO Holdings' consolidated EBITDA, as defined, minus
                1.3
                times its consolidated interest expense, plus 100% of new cash and
                appraised non-cash equity proceeds received by CCO Holdings and not
                allocated to the debt incurrence covenant, all cumulatively from
                the
                fiscal quarter commenced October 1, 2003, plus $100
                million.

In
      addition, CCO Holdings may make distributions or restricted payments, so long
      as
      no default exists or would be caused by the transaction:

·

to
                repurchase management equity interests in amounts not to exceed $10
                million per fiscal year;

·

to
                pay, regardless of the existence of any default, pass-through tax
                liabilities in respect of ownership of equity interests in Charter
                Holdings or its restricted subsidiaries;


·

to
                pay, regardless of the existence of any default, interest when due
                on the
                Charter convertible notes, Charter Holdings notes, CIH notes, CCH
                I notes
                and the CCH II notes;

·

to
                purchase, redeem or refinance Charter Holdings notes, CIH notes,
                CCH I
                notes, CCH II notes, Charter notes, and other direct or indirect
                parent
                company notes, so long as CCO Holdings could incur $1.00 of indebtedness
                under the 4.5 to 1.0 leverage ratio test referred to above and there
                is no
                default; or

·

to
                make other specified restricted payments including merger fees up
                to 1.25%
                of the transaction value, repurchases using concurrent new issuances,
                and
                certain dividends on existing subsidiary preferred equity
                interests.

The
      indenture governing the CCO Holdings senior notes restricts CCO Holdings and
      its
      restricted subsidiaries from making investments, except specified permitted
      investments, or creating new unrestricted subsidiaries, if there is a default
      under the indenture or if CCO Holdings could not incur $1.00 of new debt under
      the 4.5 to 1.0 leverage ratio test described above after giving effect to the
      transaction.

Permitted
      investments include:

·

investments
                by CCO Holdings and its restricted subsidiaries in CCO Holdings and
                in
                other restricted subsidiaries, or entities that become restricted
                subsidiaries as a result of the
                investment,

·

investments
                aggregating up to 100% of new cash equity proceeds received by CCO
                Holdings since November 10, 2003 to the extent the proceeds have
                not been
                allocated to the restricted payments covenant described
                above,

·

other
                investments up to $750 million outstanding at any time, and

·

certain
                specified additional investments, such as investments in customers
                and
                suppliers in the ordinary course of business and investments received
                in
                connection with permitted asset
                sales.

CCO
      Holdings is not permitted to grant liens on its assets other than specified
      permitted liens. Permitted liens include liens securing debt and other
      obligations incurred under our subsidiaries' credit facilities, liens securing
      the purchase price of new assets, liens securing indebtedness up to $50 million
      and other specified liens incurred in the ordinary course of business. The
      lien
      covenant does not restrict liens on assets of subsidiaries of CCO
      Holdings.

CCO
      Holdings and CCO Holdings Capital, its co-issuer, are generally not permitted
      to
      sell all or substantially all of their assets or merge with or into other
      companies unless their leverage ratio after any such transaction would be no
      greater than their leverage ratio immediately prior to the transaction, or
      unless CCO Holdings and its subsidiaries could incur $1.00 of new debt under
      the
      4.50 to 1.0 leverage ratio test described above after giving effect to the
      transaction, no default exists, and the surviving entity is a U.S. entity that
      assumes the CCO Holdings senior notes.

CCO
      Holdings and its restricted subsidiaries may generally not otherwise sell assets
      or, in the case of restricted subsidiaries, issue equity interests, unless
      they
      receive consideration at least equal to the fair market value of the assets
      or
      equity interests, consisting of at least 75% in cash, assumption of liabilities,
      securities converted into cash within 60 days or productive assets. CCO Holdings
      and its restricted subsidiaries are then required within 365 days after any
      asset sale either to commit to use the net cash proceeds over a specified
      threshold to acquire assets, including current assets, used or useful in their
      businesses or use the net cash proceeds to repay debt, or to offer to repurchase
      the CCO Holdings senior notes with any remaining proceeds.

CCO
      Holdings and its restricted subsidiaries may generally not engage in sale and
      leaseback transactions unless, at the time of the transaction, CCO Holdings
      could have incurred secured indebtedness in an amount equal to the present
      value
      of the net rental payments to be made under the lease, and the sale of the
      assets and application of proceeds is permitted by the covenant restricting
      asset sales.

CCO
      Holdings' restricted subsidiaries may generally not enter into restrictions
      on
      their ability to make dividends or distributions or transfer assets to CCO
      Holdings on terms that are materially more restrictive than those governing
      their debt, lien, asset sale, lease and similar agreements existing when they
      entered into the indenture, unless those restrictions are on customary terms
      that will not materially impair CCO Holdings' ability to repay its
      notes.


The
      restricted subsidiaries of CCO Holdings are generally not permitted to guarantee
      or pledge assets to secure debt of CCO Holdings, unless the guarantying
      subsidiary issues a guarantee of the notes of comparable priority and tenor,
      and
      waives any rights of reimbursement, indemnity or subrogation arising from the
      guarantee transaction for at least one year.

The
      indenture also restricts the ability of CCO Holdings and its restricted
      subsidiaries to enter into certain transactions with affiliates involving
      consideration in excess of $15 million without a determination by the board
      of
      directors that the transaction is on terms no less favorable than arms-length,
      or transactions with affiliates involving over $50 million without receiving
      an
      independent opinion as to the fairness of the transaction to the holders of
      the
      CCO Holdings notes.

Bridge
      Loan

In
      October 2005, CCO Holdings and CCO Holdings Capital Corp., as guarantor
      thereunder, entered into the bridge loan with the Lenders whereby the Lenders
      have committed to make loans to CCO Holdings in an aggregate amount of $600
      million. In January 2006, upon the issuance of $450 million principal amount
      CCH
      II notes, the commitment under the bridge loan agreement was reduced to $435
      million. CCO Holdings may, subject to certain conditions, including the
      satisfaction of certain of the conditions to borrowing under the credit
      facilities, draw upon the facility between January 2, 2006 and September 29,
      2006 and the loans will mature on the sixth anniversary of the first borrowing
      under the bridge loan. Each loan will accrue interest at a rate equal to an
      adjusted LIBOR rate plus a spread. The spread will initially be 450 basis points
      and will increase (a) by an additional 25 basis points at the end of the
      six-month period following the date of the first borrowing, (b) by an additional
      25 basis points at the end of each of the next two subsequent three month
      periods and (c) by 62.5 basis points at the end of each of the next two
      subsequent three-month periods.

Beginning
      on the first anniversary of the first date that CCO Holdings borrows under
      the
      bridge loan and at any time thereafter, any Lender will have the option to
      receive "exchange notes" (the terms of which are described below, the "Exchange
      Notes") in exchange for any loan that has not been repaid by that date. Upon
      the
      earlier of (x) the date that at least a majority of all loans that have been
      outstanding have been exchanged for Exchange Notes and (y) the date that is
      months after the first date that CCO Holdings borrows under the bridge loan,
      the
      remainder of loans will be automatically exchanged for Exchange Notes.

As
      conditions to each draw, (i) there shall be no default under the bridge loan,
      (ii) all the representations and warranties under the bridge loan shall be
      true
      and correct in all material respects and (iii) all conditions to borrowing
      under
      the Charter Operating credit facilities (with certain exceptions) shall be
      satisfied.

The
      aggregate unused commitment will be reduced by 100% of the net proceeds from
      certain asset sales, to the extent such net proceeds have not been used to
      prepay loans or Exchange Notes. However, asset sales that generate net proceeds
      of less than $75 million will not be subject to such commitment reduction
      obligation, unless the aggregate net proceeds from such asset sales exceed
      $200
      million, in which case the aggregate unused commitment will be reduced by the
      amount of such excess.

CCO
      Holdings will be required to prepay loans (and redeem or offer to repurchase
      Exchange Notes, if issued) from the net proceeds from (i) the issuance of equity
      or incurrence of debt by Charter and its subsidiaries, with certain exceptions,
      and (ii) certain asset sales (to the extent not used for purposes permitted
      under the bridge loan).

The
      covenants and events of default applicable to CCO Holdings under the bridge
      loan
      are similar to the covenants and events of default in the indenture for the
      senior secured notes of CCH I with various additional limitations.

The
      Exchange Notes will mature on the sixth anniversary of the first borrowing
      under
      the bridge loan. The Exchange Notes will bear interest at a rate equal to the
      rate that would have been borne by the loans. The same mandatory redemption
      provisions will apply to the Exchange Notes as applied to the loans, except
      that
      CCO Holdings will be required to make an offer to redeem upon the occurrence
      of
      a change of control at 101% of principal amount plus accrued and unpaid
      interest.

The
      Exchange Notes will, if held by a person other than an initial lender or an
      affiliate thereof, be (a) non-callable for the first three years after the
      first
      borrowing date and (b) thereafter, callable at par plus accrued interest plus
      a
      premium equal to 50% of the coupon in effect on the first anniversary of the
      first borrowing date, which premium shall decline to 25% of such coupon in
      the
      fourth year and to zero thereafter. Otherwise, the Exchange Notes will be
      callable at any time at 100% of the amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid
      interest.


Charter
      Communications Operating, LLC Notes

On
      April
      27, 2004, Charter Operating and Charter Communications Operating Capital Corp.
      jointly issued $1.1 billion of 8% senior second-lien notes due 2012 and $400
      million of 8 3/8% senior second-lien notes due 2014, for total gross proceeds
      of
      $1.5 billion. In March and June 2005, Charter Operating consummated exchange
      transactions with a small number of institutional holders of Charter Holdings
      8.25% senior notes due 2007 pursuant to which Charter Operating issued, in
      private placement transactions, approximately $333 million principal amount
      of
      its 8 3/8% senior second-lien notes due 2014 in exchange for approximately
      $346
      million of the Charter Holdings 8.25% senior notes due 2007. Interest on the
      Charter Operating notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on each April 30
      and
      October 30.

The
      Charter Operating notes were sold in a private transaction that was not subject
      to the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. The Charter
      Operating notes are not expected to have the benefit of any exchange or other
      registration rights, except in specified limited circumstances.

On
      the
      issue date of the Charter Operating notes, because of restrictions contained
      in
      the Charter Holdings indentures, there were no Charter Operating note
      guarantees, even though Charter Operating’s immediate parent, CCO Holdings, and
      certain of our subsidiaries were obligors and/or guarantors under the Charter
      Operating credit facilities. Upon the occurrence of the guarantee and pledge
      date (generally, the fifth business day after the Charter Holdings leverage
      ratio was certified to be below 8.75 to 1.0), CCO Holdings and those
      subsidiaries of Charter Operating that were then guarantors of, or otherwise
      obligors with respect to, indebtedness under the Charter Operating credit
      facilities and related obligations were required to guarantee the Charter
      Operating notes. The note guarantee of each such guarantor is:

·

a
                senior obligation of such
                guarantor;

·

structurally
                senior to the outstanding CCO Holdings notes (except in the case
                of CCO
                Holdings’ note guarantee, which is structurally

pari
                passu

with
                such senior notes), the outstanding CCH II notes, the outstanding
                CCH I
                notes, the outstanding CIH notes, the outstanding Charter Holdings
                notes
                and the outstanding Charter convertible senior notes (but subject
                to
                provisions in the Charter Operating indenture that permit interest
                and,
                subject to meeting the 4.25 to 1.0 leverage ratio test, principal
                payments
                to be made thereon); and

·

senior
                in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness of such
                guarantor.

As
      a
      result of the above leverage ratio test being met, CCO Holdings and certain
      of
      its subsidiaries provided the additional guarantees described above during
      the
      first quarter of 2005.

All
      the
      subsidiaries of Charter Operating (except CCO NR Sub, LLC, and certain other
      subsidiaries that are not deemed material and are designated as nonrecourse
      subsidiaries under the Charter Operating credit facilities) are restricted
      subsidiaries of Charter Operating under the Charter Operating notes.
      Unrestricted subsidiaries generally will not be subject to the restrictive
      covenants in the Charter Operating indenture.

In
      the
      event of specified change of control events, Charter Operating must offer to
      purchase the Charter Operating notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the
      total principal amount of the Charter Operating notes repurchased plus any
      accrued and unpaid interest thereon.

The
      limitations on incurrence of debt contained in the indenture governing the
      Charter Operating notes permit Charter Operating and its restricted subsidiaries
      that are guarantors of the Charter Operating notes to incur additional debt
      or
      issue shares of preferred stock if, after giving pro forma effect to the
      incurrence, Charter Operating could meet a leverage ratio test (ratio of
      consolidated debt to four times EBITDA, as defined, from the most recent fiscal
      quarter for which internal financial reports are available) of 4.25 to 1.0.

In
      addition, regardless of whether the leverage ratio test could be met, so long
      as
      no default exists or would result from the incurrence or issuance, Charter
      Operating and its restricted subsidiaries are permitted to incur or issue:

·

up
                to $6.5 billion of debt under credit facilities (but such incurrence
                is
                permitted only by Charter Operating and its restricted subsidiaries
                that
                are guarantors of the Charter Operating notes, so long as there are
                such
                guarantors), including debt under credit facilities outstanding on
                the
                issue date of the Charter Operating
                notes;


·

up
                to $75 million of debt incurred to finance the purchase or capital
                lease
                of assets;

·

up
                to $300 million of additional debt for any purpose;
                and

·

other
                items of indebtedness for specific purposes such as refinancing of
                existing debt and interest rate swaps to provide protection against
                fluctuation in interest rates and, subject to meeting the leverage
                ratio
                test, debt existing at the time of acquisition of a restricted
                subsidiary.

The
      indenture governing the Charter Operating notes permits Charter Operating to
      incur debt under one of the categories above, and later reclassify the debt
      into
      a different category. The Charter Operating credit facilities generally impose
      more restrictive limitations on incurring new debt than the Charter Operating
      indenture, so our subsidiaries that are subject to the Charter Operating credit
      facilities are not permitted to utilize the full debt incurrence that would
      otherwise be available under the Charter Operating indenture covenants.

Generally,
      under Charter Operating’s indenture Charter Operating and its restricted
      subsidiaries are permitted to pay dividends on equity interests, repurchase
      interests, or make other specified restricted payments only if Charter Operating
      could incur $1.00 of new debt under the leverage ratio test, which requires
      that
      Charter Operating meet a 4.25 to 1.0 leverage ratio after giving effect to
      the
      transaction, and if no default exists or would exist as a consequence of such
      incurrence. If those conditions are met, restricted payments are permitted
      in a
      total amount of up to 100% of Charter Operating’s consolidated EBITDA, as
      defined, minus 1.3 times its consolidated interest expense, plus 100% of new
      cash and appraised non-cash equity proceeds received by Charter Operating and
      not allocated to the debt incurrence covenant, all cumulatively from the fiscal
      quarter commenced April 1, 2004, plus $100 million.

In
      addition, Charter Operating may make distributions or restricted payments,
      so
      long as no default exists or would be caused by the transaction:

·

to
                repurchase management equity interests in amounts not to exceed $10
                million per fiscal year;

·

regardless
                of the existence of any default, to pay pass-through tax liabilities
                in
                respect of ownership of equity interests in Charter Operating or
                its
                restricted subsidiaries;

·

to
                pay, regardless of the existence of any default, interest when due
                on the
                Charter convertible notes, Charter Holdings notes, the CIH notes,
                the CCH
                I notes, the CCH II notes and the CCO Holdings
                notes;

·

to
                purchase, redeem or refinance the Charter Holdings notes, the CIH
                notes,
                the CCH I notes, the CCH II notes, the CCO Holdings notes, the Charter
                convertible notes, and other direct or indirect parent company notes,
                so
                long as Charter Operating could incur $1.00 of indebtedness under
                the 4.25
                to 1.0 leverage ratio test referred to above and there is no default,
                or

·

to
                make other specified restricted payments including merger fees up
                to 1.25%
                of the transaction value, repurchases using concurrent new issuances,
                and
                certain dividends on existing subsidiary preferred equity
                interests.

The
      indenture governing the Charter Operating notes restricts Charter Operating
      and
      its restricted subsidiaries from making investments, except specified permitted
      investments, or creating new unrestricted subsidiaries, if there is a default
      under the indenture or if Charter Operating could not incur $1.00 of new debt
      under the 4.25 to 1.0 leverage ratio test described above after giving effect
      to
      the transaction.

Permitted
      investments include:

·

investments
                by Charter Operating and its restricted subsidiaries in Charter Operating
                and in other restricted subsidiaries, or entities that become restricted
                subsidiaries as a result of the
                investment,

·

investments
                aggregating up to 100% of new cash equity proceeds received by Charter
                Operating since April 27, 2004 to the extent the proceeds have not
                been
                allocated to the restricted payments covenant described
                above,

·

other
                investments up to $750 million outstanding at any time,
                and

·

certain
                specified additional investments, such as investments in customers
                and
                suppliers in the ordinary course of business and investments received
                in
                connection with permitted asset
                sales.

Charter
      Operating and its restricted subsidiaries are not permitted to grant liens
      senior to the liens securing the Charter Operating notes, other than permitted
      liens, on their assets to secure indebtedness or other obligations, if, after
      giving effect to such incurrence, the senior secured leverage ratio (generally,
      the ratio of obligations secured by first priority liens to four times EBITDA,
      as defined, from the most recent fiscal quarter for which internal financial
      reports are available) would exceed 3.75 to 1.0. Permitted liens include liens
      securing indebtedness and other


obligations
      under permitted credit facilities, liens securing the purchase price of new
      assets, liens securing indebtedness of up to $50 million and other specified
      liens incurred in the ordinary course of business.

Charter
      Operating and Charter Communications Operating Capital Corp., its co-issuer,
      are
      generally not permitted to sell all or substantially all of their assets or
      merge with or into other companies unless their leverage ratio after any such
      transaction would be no greater than their leverage ratio immediately prior
      to
      the transaction, or unless Charter Operating and its subsidiaries could incur
      $1.00 of new debt under the 4.25 to 1.0 leverage ratio test described above
      after giving effect to the transaction, no default exists, and the surviving
      entity is a U.S. entity that assumes the Charter Operating notes.

Charter
      Operating and its restricted subsidiaries generally may not otherwise sell
      assets or, in the case of restricted subsidiaries, issue equity interests,
      unless they receive consideration at least equal to the fair market value of
      the
      assets or equity interests, consisting of at least 75% in cash, assumption
      of
      liabilities, securities converted into cash within 60 days or productive assets.
      Charter Operating and its restricted subsidiaries are then required within
      days after any asset sale either to commit to use the net cash proceeds over
      a
      specified threshold to acquire assets, including current assets, used or useful
      in their businesses or use the net cash proceeds to repay debt, or to offer
      to
      repurchase the Charter Operating notes with any remaining proceeds.

Charter
      Operating and its restricted subsidiaries may generally not engage in sale
      and
      leaseback transactions unless, at the time of the transaction, Charter Operating
      could have incurred secured indebtedness in an amount equal to the present
      value
      of the net rental payments to be made under the lease, and the sale of the
      assets and application of proceeds is permitted by the covenant restricting
      asset sales.

Charter
      Operating’s restricted subsidiaries may generally not enter into restrictions on
      their ability to make dividends or distributions or transfer assets to Charter
      Operating on terms that are materially more restrictive than those governing
      their debt, lien, asset sale, lease and similar agreements existing when Charter
      Operating entered into the indenture governing the Charter Operating senior
      second-lien notes unless those restrictions are on customary terms that will
      not
      materially impair Charter Operating’s ability to repay the Charter Operating
      notes.

The
      restricted subsidiaries of Charter Operating are generally not permitted to
      guarantee or pledge assets to secure debt of Charter Operating, unless the
      guarantying subsidiary issues a guarantee of the notes of comparable priority
      and tenor, and waives any rights of reimbursement, indemnity or subrogation
      arising from the guarantee transaction for at least one year.

The
      indenture also restricts the ability of Charter Operating and its restricted
      subsidiaries to enter into certain transactions with affiliates involving
      consideration in excess of $15 million without a determination by the board
      of
      directors that the transaction is on terms no less favorable than arms-length,
      or transactions with affiliates involving over $50 million without receiving
      an
      independent opinion as to the fairness of the transaction to the holders of
      the
      Charter Operating notes.

Charter
      Operating and its restricted subsidiaries are generally not permitted to
      transfer equity interests in restricted subsidiaries unless the transfer is
      of
      all of the equity interests in the restricted subsidiary or the restricted
      subsidiary remains a restricted subsidiary and net proceeds of the equity sale
      are applied in accordance with the asset sales covenant.

Until
      the
      guarantee and pledge date, the Charter Operating notes are secured by a
      second-priority lien on all of Charter Operating’s assets that secure the
      obligations of Charter Operating under the Charter Operating credit facility
      and
      specified related obligations. The collateral secures the obligations of Charter
      Operating with respect to the 8% senior second-lien notes due 2012 and the
      3/8% senior second-lien notes due 2014 on a ratable basis. The collateral
      consists of substantially all of Charter Operating’s assets in which security
      interests may be perfected under the Uniform Commercial Code by filing a
      financing statement (including capital stock and intercompany obligations),
      including, but not limited to:

·

all
                of the capital stock of all of Charter Operating’s direct subsidiaries,
                including, but not limited to, CCO NR Holdings, LLC;
                and

·

all
                intercompany obligations owing to Charter Operating including, but
                not
                limited to, intercompany notes from CC VI Operating, CC VIII Operating
                and
                Falcon, which notes are supported by the same guarantees and collateral
                that supported these subsidiaries’ credit facilities prior to the
                amendment and restatement of the Charter Operating credit
                facilities.


Since
      the
      occurrence of the guarantee and pledge date, the collateral for the Charter
      Operating notes consists of all of Charter Operating’s and its subsidiaries’
assets that secure the obligations of Charter Operating or any subsidiary of
      Charter Operating with respect to the Charter Operating credit facilities and
      the related obligations. The collateral currently consists of the capital stock
      of Charter Operating held by CCO Holdings, all of the intercompany obligations
      owing to CCO Holdings by Charter Operating or any subsidiary of Charter
      Operating, and substantially all of Charter Operating’s and the guarantors’
assets (other than the assets of CCO Holdings) in which security interests
      may
      be perfected under the Uniform Commercial Code by filing a financing statement
      (including capital stock and intercompany obligations), including, but not
      limited to:

·

with
                certain exceptions, all capital stock (limited in the case of capital
                stock of foreign subsidiaries, if any, to 66% of the capital stock
                of
                first tier foreign Subsidiaries) held by Charter Operating or any
                guarantor; and

·

with
                certain exceptions, all intercompany obligations owing to Charter
                Operating or any guarantor.

In
      March
      2005, CC V Holdings, LLC redeemed in full the notes outstanding under the CC
      V
      indenture. Following that redemption CC V Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries
      guaranteed the Charter Operating credit facilities and the related obligations
      and secured those guarantees with first-priority liens, and guaranteed the
      notes
      and secured the Charter Operating senior second lien notes with second-priority
      liens, on substantially all of their assets in which security interests may
      be
      perfected under the Uniform Commercial Code by filing a financing statement
      (including capital stock and intercompany obligations).

In
      addition, if Charter Operating or its subsidiaries exercise any option to redeem
      in full the notes outstanding under the Renaissance indenture, then, provided
      that the Leverage Condition remains satisfied, the Renaissance entities will
      be
      required to provide corresponding guarantees of the Charter Operating credit
      facilities and related obligations and note guarantees and to secure the Charter
      Operating notes and the Charter Operating credit facilities and related
      obligations with corresponding liens.

In
      the
      event that additional liens are granted by Charter Operating or its subsidiaries
      to secure obligations under the Charter Operating credit facilities or the
      related obligations, second priority liens on the same assets will be granted
      to
      secure the Charter Operating notes, which liens will be subject to the
      provisions of an intercreditor agreement (to which none of Charter Operating
      or
      its affiliates are parties). Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, no such
      second priority liens need be provided if the time such lien would otherwise
      be
      granted is not during a guarantee and pledge availability period (when the
      Leverage Condition is satisfied), but such second priority liens will be
      required to be provided in accordance with the foregoing sentence on or prior
      to
      the fifth business day of the commencement of the next succeeding guarantee
      and
      pledge availability period.

Renaissance
      Media Notes

The
      10%
      senior discount notes due 2008 were issued by Renaissance Media (Louisiana)
      LLC,
      Renaissance Media (Tennessee) LLC and Renaissance Media Holdings Capital
      Corporation, with Renaissance Media Group LLC as guarantor and the United States
      Trust Company of New York as trustee. Renaissance Media Group LLC, which is
      the
      direct or indirect parent company of these issuers, is a subsidiary of Charter
      Operating. The Renaissance 10% notes and the Renaissance guarantee are
      unsecured, unsubordinated debt of the issuers and the guarantor, respectively.
      In October 1998, the issuers of the Renaissance notes exchanged $163 million
      of
      the original issued and outstanding Renaissance notes for an equivalent value
      of
      new Renaissance notes. The form and terms of the new Renaissance notes are
      the
      same in all material respects as the form and terms of the original Renaissance
      notes except that the issuance of the new Renaissance notes was registered
      under
      the Securities Act.

Interest
      on the Renaissance notes is payable semi-annually in arrears in cash at a rate
      of 10% per year. The Renaissance notes are redeemable at the option of the
      issuers thereof, in whole or in part, initially at 105% of their principal
      amount at maturity, plus accrued interest, declining to 100% of the principal
      amount at maturity, plus accrued interest, on or after April 15, 2006.

Our
      acquisition of Renaissance triggered change of control provisions of the
      Renaissance notes that required us to offer to purchase the Renaissance notes
      at
      a purchase price equal to 101% of their accreted value on the date of the
      purchase, plus accrued interest, if any. In May 1999, we made an offer to
      repurchase the Renaissance notes, and holders of Renaissance notes representing
      30% of the total principal amount outstanding at maturity tendered their
      Renaissance notes for repurchase.


The
      limitations on incurrence of debt contained in the indenture governing the
      Renaissance notes permit Renaissance Media Group and its restricted subsidiaries
      to incur additional debt, so long as they are not in default under the
      indenture:

·

if,
                after giving effect to the incurrence, Renaissance Media Group could
                meet
                a leverage ratio (ratio of consolidated debt to four times consolidated
                EBITDA, as defined, from the most recent quarter) of 6.75 to 1.0,
                and,
                regardless of whether the leverage ratio could be
                met,

·

up
                to the greater of $200 million or 4.5 times Renaissance Media Group's
                consolidated annualized EBITDA, as
                defined,

·

up
                to an amount equal to 5% of Renaissance Media Group's consolidated
                total
                assets to finance the purchase of new
                assets,

·

up
                to two times the sum of (a) the net cash proceeds of new equity issuances
                and capital contributions, and (b) 80% of the fair market value of
                property received by Renaissance Media Group or an issuer as a capital
                contribution, in each case received after the issue date of the
                Renaissance notes and not allocated to make restricted payments,
                and

·

other
                items of indebtedness for specific purposes such as intercompany
                debt,
                refinancing of existing debt and interest rate swaps to provide protection
                against fluctuation in interest
                rates.

The
      indenture governing the Renaissance notes permits us to incur debt under one
      of
      the categories above, and reclassify the debt into a different
      category.

Under
      the
      indenture governing the Renaissance notes, Renaissance Media Group and its
      restricted subsidiaries are permitted to pay dividends on equity interests,
      repurchase interests, make restricted investments, or make other specified
      restricted payments only if Renaissance Media Group could incur $1.00 of
      additional debt under the debt incurrence test, which requires that Renaissance
      Media Group meet the 6.75 to 1.0 leverage ratio after giving effect to the
      transaction of the indebtedness covenant and that no default exists or would
      occur as a consequence thereof. If those conditions are met, Renaissance Media
      Group and its restricted subsidiaries are permitted to make restricted payments
      in a total amount not to exceed the result of 100% of Renaissance Media Group's
      consolidated EBITDA, as defined, minus 130% of its consolidated interest
      expense, plus 100% of new cash equity proceeds received by Renaissance Media
      Group and not allocated to the indebtedness covenant, plus returns on certain
      investments, all cumulatively from June 1998. Renaissance Media Group and its
      restricted subsidiaries may make permitted investments up to $2 million in
      related businesses and other specified permitted investments, restricted
      payments up to $10 million, dividends up to 6% each year of the net cash
      proceeds of public equity offerings, and other specified restricted payments
      without meeting the foregoing test.

Renaissance
      Media Group and its restricted subsidiaries are not permitted to grant liens
      on
      their assets other than specified permitted liens, unless corresponding liens
      are granted to secure the Renaissance notes. Permitted liens include liens
      securing debt permitted to be incurred under credit facilities, liens securing
      debt incurred under the incurrence of indebtedness test, in amounts up to the
      greater of $200 million or 4.5 times Renaissance Media Group's consolidated
      EBITDA, as defined, liens as deposits for acquisitions up to 10% of the
      estimated purchase price, liens securing permitted financings of new assets,
      liens securing debt permitted to be incurred by restricted subsidiaries, and
      specified liens incurred in the ordinary course of business.

Renaissance
      Media Group and the issuers of the Renaissance notes are generally not permitted
      to sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets or
      merge with or into other companies unless their consolidated net worth after
      any
      such transaction would be equal to or greater than their consolidated net worth
      immediately prior to the transaction, or unless Renaissance Media Group could
      incur $1.00 of additional debt under the debt incurrence test, which would
      require them to meet a leverage ratio of 6.75 to 1.00 after giving effect to
      the
      transaction.

Renaissance
      Media Group and its subsidiaries may generally not otherwise sell assets or,
      in
      the case of subsidiaries, equity interests, unless they receive consideration
      at
      least equal to the fair market value of the assets, consisting of at least
      75%
      cash, temporary cash investments or assumption of debt. Charter Holdings and
      its
      restricted subsidiaries are then required within 12 months after any asset
      sale
      either to commit to use the net cash proceeds over a specified


threshold
      either to acquire assets used in their own or related businesses or use the
      net
      cash proceeds to repay debt, or to offer to repurchase the Renaissance notes
      with any remaining proceeds.

Renaissance
      Media Group and its restricted subsidiaries may generally not engage in sale
      and
      leaseback transactions unless the lease term does not exceed three years or
      the
      proceeds are applied in accordance with the covenant limiting asset sales.

Renaissance
      Media Group's restricted subsidiaries may generally not enter into restrictions
      on their abilities to make dividends or distributions or transfer assets to
      Renaissance Media Group except those not more restrictive than is customary
      in
      comparable financings.

The
      restricted subsidiaries of Renaissance Media Group are not permitted to
      guarantee or pledge assets to secure debt of the Renaissance Media Group or
      its
      restricted subsidiaries, unless the guarantying subsidiary issues a guarantee
      of
      the Renaissance notes of comparable priority and tenor, and waives any rights
      of
      reimbursement, indemnity or subrogation arising from the guarantee
      transaction.

Renaissance
      Media Group and its restricted subsidiaries are generally not permitted to
      issue
      or sell equity interests in restricted subsidiaries, except sales of common
      stock of restricted subsidiaries so long as the proceeds of the sale are applied
      in accordance with the asset sale covenant, and issuances as a result of which
      the restricted subsidiary is no longer a restricted subsidiary and any remaining
      investment in that subsidiary is permitted by the covenant limiting restricted
      payments.

The
      indenture governing the Renaissance notes also restricts the ability of
      Renaissance Media Group and its restricted subsidiaries to enter into certain
      transactions with affiliates involving consideration in excess of $2 million
      without a determination by the disinterested members of the board of directors
      that the transaction is on terms no less favorable than arms length, or
      transactions with affiliates involving over $4 million with affiliates without
      receiving an independent opinion as to the fairness of the transaction to
      Renaissance Media Group.

All
      of
      these covenants are subject to additional specified exceptions. In general,
      the
      covenants of our subsidiaries' credit agreements are more restrictive than
      those
      of our indentures.

Cross-Defaults

Our
      indentures and those of certain of our subsidiaries include various events
      of
      default, including cross-default provisions. Under these provisions, a failure
      by any of the issuers or any of their restricted subsidiaries to pay at the
      final maturity thereof the principal amount of other indebtedness having a
      principal amount of $100 million or more (or any other default under any such
      indebtedness resulting in its acceleration) would result in an event of default
      under the indenture governing the applicable notes.

The
      Renaissance indenture contains a similar cross-default provision with a $10
      million threshold that applies to the issuers of the Renaissance notes and
      their
      restricted subsidiaries.

As
      a
      result, an event of default related to the failure to repay principal at
      maturity or the acceleration of the indebtedness under the Charter Holdings
      notes, CIH notes, CCH I notes, CCH II notes, CCO Holdings notes, Charter
      Operating notes, the Charter Operating credit facilities or the Renaissance
      notes could cause cross-defaults under our subsidiaries’ indentures.

Related
      Party Transactions

See
      "Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions — Business
      Relationships" for information regarding related party transactions and
      transactions with other parties with whom we or our related parties may have
      a
      relationship that enables the parties to negotiate terms of material
      transactions that may not be available from other, more clearly independent
      parties, on an arms length basis.

Interest
      Rate Risk

We
      use
      interest rate risk management derivative instruments, such as interest rate
      swap
      agreements and interest rate collar agreements (collectively referred to herein
      as interest rate agreements) as required under the terms of the credit
      facilities of our subsidiaries. Our policy is to manage interest costs using
      a
      mix of fixed and variable rate debt. Using interest rate swap agreements, we
      agree to exchange, at specified intervals through 2007, the difference between
      fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon
      notional principal amount. Interest rate collar agreements are used to limit
      our
      exposure to, and to derive benefits from, interest rate fluctuations


on
      variable rate debt to within a certain range of rates. Interest rate risk
      management agreements are not held or issued for speculative or trading
      purposes.

At
      December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had outstanding $1.8 billion and
      $2.7 billion and $20 million and $20 million, respectively, in
      notional amounts of interest rate swaps and collars, respectively. The notional
      amounts of interest rate instruments do not represent amounts exchanged by
      the
      parties and, thus, are not a measure of our exposure to credit loss. See
      "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk," for
      further information regarding the fair values and contract terms of our interest
      rate agreements.

Recently
      Issued Accounting Standards

In
      November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS
      No.
      153,

Exchanges
      of Non-monetary Assets — An Amendment of APB No. 29

.
      This
      statement eliminates the exception to fair value for exchanges of similar
      productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchange
      transactions that do not have commercial substance — that is, transactions that
      are not expected to result in significant changes in the cash flows of the
      reporting entity. We adopted this pronouncement effective April 1, 2005. The
      exchange transaction discussed in Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated
      financial statements contained in "Item 8. Financial Statements and
      Supplementary Data", was accounted for under this standard.

In
      December 2004, the FASB issued the revised SFAS No. 123,

Share-Based
      Payment

,
      which
      addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions in which a company
      receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of that
      company or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company’s
      equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity
      instruments. This statement will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2006.
      Because we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 on
      January 1, 2003, we do not expect this revised standard to have a material
      impact on our financial statements.

In
      March
      2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47,

Accounting
      for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations

.
      This
      interpretation clarifies that the term "conditional asset retirement obligation"
      as used in FASB Statement No. 143,

Accounting
      for Asset Retirement Obligations,

refers
      to
      a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing
      and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may
      not be within the control of the entity. This pronouncement is effective for
      fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. The adoption of this interpretation
      did not have a material impact on our financial statements.

We
      do not
      believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting
      pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on our accompanying
      financial statements.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
      and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Interest
      Rate Risk

We
      are
      exposed to various market risks, including fluctuations in interest rates.
      We
      use interest rate risk management derivative instruments, such as interest
      rate
      swap agreements and interest rate collar agreements (collectively referred
      to
      herein as interest rate agreements) as required under the terms of the credit
      facilities of our subsidiaries. Our policy is to manage interest costs using
      a
      mix of fixed and variable rate debt. Using interest rate swap agreements, we
      agree to exchange, at specified intervals through 2007, the difference between
      fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon
      notional principal amount. Interest rate collar agreements are used to limit
      our
      exposure to, and to derive benefits from, interest rate fluctuations on variable
      rate debt to within a certain range of rates. Interest rate risk management
      agreements are not held or issued for speculative or trading purposes.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005 and 2004, our long-term debt totaled approximately $19.4
      billion and $19.5 billion, respectively. This debt was comprised of
      approximately $5.7 billion and $5.5 billion of credit facilities debt, $12.8
      billion and $13.0 billion accreted amount of high-yield notes and $863 million
      and $990 million accreted amount of convertible senior notes, respectively.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005 and 2004, the weighted average interest rate on the credit
      facility debt was approximately 7.8% and 6.8%, the weighted average interest
      rate on the high-yield notes was approximately 10.2% and 9.2%, and the weighted
      average interest rate on the convertible senior notes was approximately 6.3%
      and
      5.7%, respectively, resulting in a blended weighted average interest rate of
      9.3% and 8.8%, respectively. The interest rate on approximately 77% and 83%
      of
      the total principal amount of our debt was effectively fixed, including the
      effects of


our
      interest rate hedge agreements as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
      The fair value of our high-yield notes was $10.4 billion and $12.2 billion
      at
      December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The fair value of our convertible
      senior notes was $647 million and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
      respectively. The fair value of our credit facilities is $5.7 billion and $5.5
      billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The fair value of
      high-yield and convertible notes is based on quoted market prices, and the
      fair
      value of the credit facilities is based on dealer quotations.

We
      do not
      hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. We do, however,
      have
      certain interest rate derivative instruments that have been designated as cash
      flow hedging instruments. Such instruments effectively convert variable interest
      payments on certain debt instruments into fixed payments. For qualifying hedges,
      SFAS No. 133 allows derivative gains and losses to offset related results on
      hedged items in the consolidated statement of operations. We have formally
      documented, designated and assessed the effectiveness of transactions that
      receive hedge accounting. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
      net gain (loss) on derivative instruments and hedging activities includes gains
      of $3 million, $4 million and $8 million, respectively, which represent cash
      flow hedge ineffectiveness on interest rate hedge agreements arising from
      differences between the critical terms of the agreements and the related hedged
      obligations. Changes in the fair value of interest rate agreements designated
      as
      hedging instruments of the variability of cash flows associated with
      floating-rate debt obligations that meet the effectiveness criteria of SFAS
      No.
      133 are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss. For the years ended
      December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, a gain of $16 million, $42 million and $48
      million, respectively, related to derivative instruments designated as cash
      flow
      hedges, was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and minority
      interest. The amounts are subsequently reclassified into interest expense as
      a
      yield adjustment in the same period in which the related interest on the
      floating-rate debt obligations affects earnings (losses).

Certain
      interest rate derivative instruments are not designated as hedges as they do
      not
      meet the effectiveness criteria specified by SFAS No. 133. However, management
      believes such instruments are closely correlated with the respective debt,
      thus
      managing associated risk. Interest rate derivative instruments not designated
      as
      hedges are marked to fair value, with the impact recorded as gain (loss) on
      derivative instruments and hedging activities in our statements of operations.
      For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, net gain (loss) on
      derivative instruments and hedging activities includes gains of $47 million,
      $65
      million and $57 million, respectively, for interest rate derivative instruments
      not designated as hedges.

The
      table
      set forth below summarizes the fair values and contract terms of financial
      instruments subject to interest rate risk maintained by us as of December 31,
      2005 (dollars in millions):

The
      notional amounts of interest rate instruments do not represent amounts exchanged
      by the parties and, thus, are not a measure of our exposure to credit loss.
      The
      amounts exchanged are determined by reference to the notional amount and the
      other terms of the contracts. The estimated fair value approximates the costs
      (proceeds) to settle the outstanding contracts. Interest rates on variable
      debt
      are estimated using the average implied forward London Interbank Offering Rate
      (LIBOR) rates for the year of maturity based on the yield curve in effect
      at December 31, 2005.

At
      December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had outstanding $1.8 billion and $2.7 billion
      and
      $20 million and $20 million, respectively, in notional amounts of interest
      rate swaps and collars, respectively. The notional amounts of interest rate
      instruments do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, thus, are
      not
      a measure of exposure to credit


loss.

Conclusion
      Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and
      Procedures

As
      of the
      end of the period covered by this report, management, including our Chief
      Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness
      of
      the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures with respect
      to the information generated for use in this annual report. The evaluation
      was
      based in part upon reports and affidavits provided by a number of executives.
      Based upon, and as of the date of that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer
      and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and
      procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurances that information
      required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities
      Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
      the
      time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms.

There
      was
      no change in our internal control over financial reporting during 2005 that
      has
      materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
      control over financial reporting.

In
      designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management
      recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and
      operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving
      the
      desired control objectives and management necessarily was required to apply
      its
      judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and
      procedures. Based upon the above evaluation, Charter’s management believes that
      its controls provide such reasonable assurances.

Management’s
      Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Charter’s
      management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
      control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the
      Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Our internal control system was
      designed to provide reasonable assurance to Charter’s management and board of
      directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial
      statements.

Charter’s
      management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
      reporting as of December 31, 2005. In making this assessment, we used the
      criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
      Commission (COSO) in

Internal
      Control

—
      Integrated Framework

.

Based
      on
      management’s assessment utilizing these criteria we believe that, as of December
      31, 2005, our internal control over financial reporting was
      effective

.

Our
      independent auditors, KPMG, LLP have audited management’s assessment of our
      internal control over financial reporting as stated in their report on page
      F-3.

Compensation
      Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation

At
      the
      beginning of 2005, Mr. Lillis and Mr. Merritt served as the Option Plan
      Committee which administered the 1999 Charter Communications Option Plan and
      the
      Charter Communications, Inc. 2001 Stock Incentive Plan and the Compensation
      Committee consisted of Messrs. Allen, Lillis and Nathanson. The Option Plan
      Committee and the Compensation Committee merged in February 2005 and the
      committee then consisted of Messrs. Allen, Merritt and Nathanson. Mr. May joined
      the committee in August 2005. The Compensation Committee is currently comprised
      of Messrs. Allen, May, Merritt and Nathanson.

No
      member
      of the Compensation Committee or the Option Plan Committee was an officer or
      employee of Charter or any of its subsidiaries during 2005, except for
      Mr. Allen, who served as a non-employee chairman of the Compensation
      Committee and Mr. May who served in a non-employee capacity as Interim President
      and Chief Executive Officer from January 2005 until August 2005. Mr. May joined
      the Compensation Committee in August 2005 after his service as Interim President
      and Chief Executive Officer. Also, Mr. Nathanson was an officer of certain
      subsidiaries of Charter prior to their acquisition by Charter in 1999 and held
      the title of Vice Chairman of Charter’s board of directors, a non-executive,
      non-salaried position in 2005. Mr. Allen is the 100% owner and a director
      of Vulcan Inc. and certain of its affiliates, which employs Mr. Conn and Ms.
      Patton as executive officers. Mr. Allen also was a director of and
      indirectly owned 98% of TechTV, of which Mr. Wangberg, one of our directors,
      was
      a director until the sale of TechTV to an unrelated third party in May 2004.
      Transactions between Charter and members of the Compensation Committee are
      more
      fully described in "— Director Compensation" and in "Item 13. Certain
      Relationships and Related Transactions — Other Miscellaneous Relationships."

During
      2005, (1) none of our executive officers served on the compensation committee
      of
      any other company that has an executive officer currently serving on the board
      of directors, Compensation Committee or Option Plan Committee and (2) none
      of
      our executive officers served as a director of another entity, one of whose
      executive officers served on the Compensation Committee or Option Plan
      Committee, except for Carl Vogel who served as a director of Digeo, Inc., an
      entity of which Paul Allen is a director and by virtue of his position as
      Chairman of the board of directors of Digeo, Inc. is also a non-employee
      executive officer. Mr. Lovett was appointed a director of Digeo, Inc. in
      December 2005

Section 16(a)
      Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance

Section 16
      of the Exchange Act requires our directors and certain of our officers, and
      persons who own more than 10% of our common stock, to file initial reports
      of
      ownership and reports of changes in ownership with the SEC. Such persons are
      required by SEC regulation to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms
      they file. Based


solely
      on
      our review of the copies of such forms furnished to us and written
      representations from these officers and directors, we believe that all
      Section 16(a) filing requirements were met in 2005.

Code
      of Ethics

Charter
        has adopted a Code of Conduct that constitutes a Code of Ethics within the
        meaning of federal securities regulations for our employees, including all
        executive officers, and established a hotline and website for reporting alleged
        violations of the code of conduct, established procedures for processing
        complaints and implemented educational programs to inform our employees
        regarding the Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct is posted on Charter’s
        website at www.charter.com.

      Option Grants

The
      following table shows individual grants of options made to individuals named
      in
      the Summary Compensation Table during 2005. All such grants were made under
      the
      2001 Stock Incentive Plan and the exercise price was based upon the fair market
      value of Charter’s Class A common stock on the respective grant
      dates.

(1)

Options
                are transferable under limited conditions, primarily to accommodate
                estate
                planning purposes. These options generally vest in four equal installments
                commencing on the first anniversary following the grant
                date.

(2)

This
                column shows the hypothetical gains on the options granted based
                on
                assumed annual compound price appreciation of 5% and 10% over the
                full
                ten-year term of the options. The assumed rates of 5% and 10% appreciation
                are mandated by the SEC and do not represent our estimate or projection
                of
                future prices.

      Aggregated Option Exercises and Option Value

The
      following table sets forth, for the individuals named in the Summary
      Compensation Table, (i) information concerning options exercised during 2005,
      (ii) the number of shares of our Class A common stock underlying unexercised
      options at year-end 2005, and (iii) the value of unexercised "in-the-money''
      options (i.e., the positive spread between the exercise price of outstanding
      options and the market value of our Class A common stock) on December 31,
      2005.

(1)

Options
                granted prior to 2001 and under the 1999 Charter Communications Option
                Plan, when vested, are exercisable for membership units of Charter
                Holdco
                which are immediately exchanged on a one-for-one basis for shares
                of our
                Class A common stock upon exercise of the option. Options granted
                under
                the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan and after 2000 are exercisable for
                shares of
                our Class A common stock.

(2)

Based
                on a per share market value (closing price) of $1.22 as of December
                31,
                2005 for our Class A common stock.


(3)

Mr.
                Vogel’s employment terminated on January 17, 2005. Under the terms of the
                separation agreement, his options will continue to vest until December
                31,
                2005, and all vested options are exercisable until sixty (60) days
                thereafter.

Option/Stock
      Incentive Plans

The
      Plans.

We
      have
      granted stock options, restricted stock and other incentive compensation under
      two plans — the 1999 Charter Communications Option Plan and the 2001 Stock
      Incentive Plan. The 1999 Charter Communications Option Plan provided for the
      grant of options to purchase membership units in Charter Holdco to current
      and
      prospective employees and consultants of Charter Holdco and its affiliates
      and
      to our current and prospective non-employee directors. Membership units received
      upon exercise of any options are immediately exchanged for shares of Charter
      Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis.

The
      Stock Incentive Plan provides for the grant of non-qualified stock options,
      stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalent rights, performance units and
      performance shares, share awards, phantom stock and/or shares of restricted
      stock (not to exceed 20,000,000 shares) as each term is defined in the 2001
      Stock Incentive Plan. Employees, officers, consultants and directors of Charter
      and its subsidiaries and affiliates are eligible to receive grants under the
      2001 Stock Incentive Plan. Generally, options expire 10 years from the
      grant date. Unless sooner terminated by our board of directors, the 2001 Stock
      Incentive Plan will terminate on February 12, 2011, and no option or award
      can be granted thereafter.

Together,
      the plans allow for the issuance of up to a total of 90,000,000 shares of our
      Class A common stock (or units exchangeable for our Class A common stock).
      Any
      shares covered by options that are terminated under the 1999 Charter
      Communications Option Plan will be transferred to the 2001 Stock Incentive
      Plan,
      and no new options will be granted under the 1999 Charter Communications Option
      Plan. At December 31, 2005, 1,317,520 shares had been issued under the plans
      upon exercise of options, 825,725 had been issued upon vesting of restricted
      stock granted under the plans, and 4,252,570 shares were subject to future
      vesting under restricted stock agreements. Of the remaining 83,604,185 shares
      covered by the plans, as of December 31, 2005, 29,126,744 were subject to
      outstanding options (34% of which were vested), and there were 11,719,032
      performance shares granted under Charter's Long-Term Incentive Program as of
      December 31, 2005, to vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant
      conditional upon Charter's performance against certain financial targets
      approved by Charter's board of directors at the time of the award. As of
      December 31, 2005, 42,758,409 shares remained available for future grants under
      the plans. As of December 31, 2005, there were 5,341 participants in the
      plans.

The
      plans
      authorize the repricing of options, which could include reducing the exercise
      price per share of any outstanding option, permitting the cancellation,
      forfeiture or tender of outstanding options in exchange for other awards or
      for
      new options with a lower exercise price per share, or repricing or replacing
      any
      outstanding options by any other method.


Long-Term
      Incentive Plan.

In
      January 2004, the Compensation Committee of our board of directors approved
      our
      Long-Term Incentive Program, or LTIP, which is a program administered under
      the
      2001 Stock Incentive Plan. Under the LTIP, employees of Charter and its
      subsidiaries whose pay classifications exceed

a
      certain
      level are eligible to receive stock options, and more senior level employees
      were eligible to receive stock options and performance shares. The stock options
      vest 25% on each of the first four anniversaries of the date of grant. The
      performance shares vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant shares
      at
      the end of a three-year performance cycle and shares of Class A common stock
      are
      issued, conditional upon our performance against financial performance measures
      established by our management and approved by the board of directors or
      Compensation Committee as of the time of the award. We granted 3.2 million
      performance shares in 2005 under this program except that the 2005 performance
      share grants are based on a one-year performance cycle. We recognized expense
      of
      $1 million in the first three quarters of 2005. However, in the fourth quarter
      of 2005, we reversed the entire $1 million of expense based on our assessment
      of
      the probability of achieving the financial performance measures established
      by
      management and required to be met for the performance shares to vest. In
      February 2006, the Compensation Committee approved a modification to the
      financial performance measures required to be met for the performance shares
      to
      vest after which management believes that approximately 2.5 million of the
      performance shares are likely to vest. As such, expense of approximately $3
      will
      be amortized over the remaining two year service period.

The
      Stock Incentive Plan must be administered by, and grants and awards to eligible
      individuals must be approved by our board of directors or a committee thereof
      consisting solely of nonemployee directors as defined in Section 16b-3 under
      the
      Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The board of directors or such
      committee determines the terms of each stock option grant, restricted stock
      grant or other award at the time of grant, including the exercise price to
      be
      paid for the shares, the vesting schedule for each option, the price, if any,
      to
      be paid by the grantee for the restricted stock, the restrictions placed on
      the
      shares, and the time or times when the restrictions will lapse. The board of
      directors or such committee also has the power to accelerate the vesting of
      any
      grant or extend the term thereof.

Upon
      a
      change of control of Charter, the board of directors or the administering
      committee can shorten the exercise period of any option, have the survivor
      or
      successor entity assume the options with appropriate adjustments, or cancel
      options and pay out in cash. If an optionee’s or grantee’s employment is
      terminated without "cause" or for "good reason" following a "change in control"
      (as those terms are defined in the plans), unless otherwise provided in an
      agreement, with respect to such optionee’s or grantee’s awards under the plans,
      all outstanding options will become immediately and fully exercisable, all
      outstanding stock appreciation rights will become immediately and fully
      exercisable, the restrictions on the outstanding restricted stock will lapse,
      and all of the outstanding performance shares will vest and the restrictions
      on
      all of the outstanding performance shares will lapse as if all performance
      objectives had been satisfied at the maximum level.

February
      2004 Option Exchange.

In
      January 2004, we offered employees of Charter and its subsidiaries the right
      to
      exchange all stock options (vested and unvested) under the 1999 Charter
      Communications Option Plan and 2001 Stock Incentive Plan that had an exercise
      price over $10 per share for shares of restricted Charter Class A common stock
      or, in some instances, cash.

Based
      on
      a sliding exchange ratio, which varied depending on the exercise price of an
      employee’s outstanding options, if an employee would have received more than 400
      shares of restricted stock in exchange for tendered options, we issued to that
      employee shares of restricted stock in the exchange. If, based on the exchange
      ratios, an employee would have received 400 or fewer shares of restricted stock
      in exchange for tendered options, we instead paid to the employee cash in an
      amount equal to the number of shares the employee would have received multiplied
      by $5.00.

The
      offer
      applied to options to purchase a total of 22,929,573 shares of Class A common
      stock, or approximately 48% of our 47,882,365 total options (vested and
      unvested) issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2003. Participation by
      employees was voluntary. Non-employee members of the board of directors of
      Charter or any of its subsidiaries were not eligible to participate in the
      exchange offer.

In
      the
      closing of the exchange offer on February 20, 2004, we accepted for cancellation
      eligible options to purchase approximately 18,137,664 shares of our Class A
      common stock. In exchange, we granted approximately 1,966,686 shares of
      restricted stock, including 460,777 performance shares to eligible employees
      of
      the rank of senior vice president and above, and paid a total cash amount of
      approximately $4 million (which amount includes applicable withholding taxes)
      to
      those employees who received cash rather than shares of restricted stock. The
      restricted stock was granted on February 25, 2004. Employees tendered
      approximately 79% of the options eligible to be exchanged under the program.


The
      cost
      of the stock option exchange program was approximately $10 million, with a
      cash compensation expense of approximately $4 million and a non-cash
      compensation expense of approximately $6 million to be expensed ratably over
      the
      three-year vesting period of the restricted stock issued in the
      exchange.

      Executive Cash Award Plan

In
      June
      2005, Charter adopted the 2005 Executive Cash Award Plan to provide additional
      incentive to, and retain the services of, certain officers of Charter and its
      subsidiaries, to achieve the highest level of individual performance and
      contribute to the success of Charter. Eligible participants are employees of
      Charter or any of its subsidiaries who have been recommended by the CEO and
      designated and approved as Plan participants by the Compensation Committee
      of
      Charter’s board of directors. At the time the Plan was adopted, the interim CEO
      recommended and the Compensation Committee designated and approved as Plan
      participants the permanent President and Chief Executive Officer position,
      Executive Vice President positions and selected Senior Vice President
      positions.

The
      Plan
      provides that each participant be granted an award which represents an
      opportunity to receive cash payments in accordance with the Plan. An award
      will
      be credited in book entry format to a participant’s account in an amount equal
      to 100% of a participant’s base salary on the date of Plan approval in 2005 and
      20% of participant’s base salary in each year 2006 through 2009, based on that
      participant’s base salary as of May 1 of the applicable year. The Plan awards
      will vest at the rate of 50% of the plan award balance at the end of 2007 and
      100% of the plan award balance at the end of 2009. Participants will be entitled
      to receive payment of the vested portion of the


award
      if
      the participant remains employed by Charter continuously from the date of the
      participant’s initial participation through the end of the calendar year in
      which his or her award becomes vested, subject to payment of pro-rated award
      balances to a participant who terminates due to death or disability or in the
      event Charter elects to terminate the Plan.

A
      participant’s eligibility for, and right to receive, any payment under the Plan
      (except in the case of intervening death) is conditioned upon the participant
      first executing and delivering to Charter an agreement releasing and giving
      up
      all claims that participant may have against Charter and related parties arising
      out of or based upon any facts or conduct occurring prior to the payment date,
      and containing additional restrictions on post-employment use of confidential
      information, non-competition and nonsolicitation and recruitment of customers
      and employees.

Employment
      Arrangements

and
      Related Agreements

Charter
      and Neil Smit entered into an agreement as of August 9, 2005 whereby Mr. Smit
      will serve as Charter’s President and Chief Executive Officer (the "Employment
      Agreement") for a term expiring on December 31, 2008, and Charter may extend
      the
      agreement for an additional two years by giving Mr. Smit written notice of
      its
      intent to extend not less than six months prior to the expiration of the
      contract (Mr. Smit has the right to reject the extension within a certain time
      period as set forth defined in the contract). Under the Employment Agreement,
      Mr. Smit will receive a $1,200,000 base salary per year, through the third
      anniversary of the agreement, and thereafter $1,440,000 per year for the
      remainder of the Employment Agreement. Mr. Smit shall be eligible to receive
      a
      performance-based target bonus of 125% of annualized salary, with a maximum
      bonus of 200% of annualized salary, as determined by the Compensation Committee
      of Charter’s Board of Directors. However, for 2005 only, he will receive a
      minimum bonus of $1,200,000, provided that he is employed by Charter on December
      31, 2005. Under Charter’s Long-Term Incentive Plan he will receive options to
      purchase 3,333,333 shares of Class A common stock, exercisable for 10 years,
      with annual vesting of one-third of the grant in each of the three years from
      the employment date; a performance share award for a maximum of 4,123,720 shares
      of Class A common stock, to be earned during a three-year performance cycle
      starting January 2006; and a restricted stock award of 1,562,500 shares of
      Class
      A common stock, with annual vesting over three years following employment date.
      In addition, Mr. Smit will receive another restricted stock award for 1,250,000
      shares of Class A common stock vesting on the first anniversary of employment
      date.

Mr.
      Smit
      will receive full reimbursement for his relocation expenses and employee
      benefits consistent with those made generally available to other senior
      executives. In the event that Mr. Smit is terminated by Charter without "cause"
      or for "good reason termination," as those terms are defined in the Employment
      Agreement, he will receive the greater of two times base salary or salary
      through the remainder to the term of the Employment Agreement; a pro rata bonus
      for the year of termination; full vesting of options and restricted shares;
      vesting of performance stock if targets are achieved; and a lump sum payment
      equal to twelve months of COBRA payments. The Employment Agreement contains
      non-compete provisions from six months to two years, depending on the type
      of
      termination. Charter will gross up federal taxes in the event that Mr. Smit
      is
      subject to any additional tax under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue
      Code.

Charter
      entered into an agreement with Mr. May, effective January 17, 2005, whereby
      Mr.
      May served as Charter's Interim President and Chief Executive Officer (the
      "May
      Executive Services Agreement''). Under the May Executive Services Agreement,
      Mr.
      May received a $1,250,000 base fee per year. Mr. May continued to receive the
      compensation and reimbursement of expenses to which he was entitled in his
      capacity as a member of Charter’s board of directors Mr. May’s employment
      agreement provided that Charter would provide equity incentives commensurate
      with his position and responsibilities, as determined by Charter’s board of
      directors. Accordingly, Mr. May was granted 100,000 shares of restricted stock
      under Charter’s 2001 Stock Incentive Plan. The 100,000 restricted shares vested
      on the date on which Mr. May’s interim service as President and Chief Executive
      Officer terminated, August 22, 2005. Mr. May served as an independent contractor
      and was not entitled to any vacation or eligible to participate in any employee
      benefit programs of Charter. Charter reimbursed Mr. May for reasonable
      transportation costs from Mr. May’s residence in Florida or other locations to
      Charter’s offices and provided temporary living quarters or reimbursed expenses
      related thereto. The May Executive Services Agreement was terminated effective
      December 31, 2005 and upon termination of the Agreement, Mr. May was eligible
      for a bonus payment. On January 5, 2006, Charter paid him a bonus of $750,000,
      with the possibility that such bonus would be increased by an additional
      percentage. In February 2006, Charter’s Compensation Committee approved an
      additional bonus of approximately $88,900 for Mr. May.

On
      April
      1, 2005, Charter entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Lovett, pursuant
      to which he will be employed as Charter’s Executive Vice President and Chief
      Operating Officer for a term commencing April 1, 2005


and
      expiring on April 1, 2008. The contract will be reviewed every 18 months
      thereafter and may be extended pursuant to such reviews. Under the agreement,
      Mr. Lovett will receive an annual base salary of $575,000 and will be eligible
      to receive an annual bonus targeted at 80% of his base salary under our senior
      management bonus plan. Charter agreed to provide Mr. Lovett with equity
      incentives commensurate with his position and responsibilities, as determined
      by
      Charter’s board of directors in its discretion. Accordingly, Mr. Lovett has been
      granted 75,000 shares of restricted stock under Charter’s 2001 Stock Incentive
      Plan. The 75,000 restricted shares will vest one third on each of the first
      three anniversaries of the date of grant (unless there is an earlier termination
      event for Cause, as defined in Charter’s 2001 Stock Incentive Plan). If his
      employment is terminated without cause or if he terminates his employment due
      to
      a change in control or for good reason (as defined in the agreement), Charter
      will pay Mr. Lovett an amount equal to the aggregate base salary due to Mr.
      Lovett during the remainder of the term, within fifteen days of termination.
      In
      addition, if Charter terminates his employment without cause, Mr. Lovett will
      be
      entitled to receive a pro rated bonus for the fiscal year in which he is
      terminated based upon financial results through the month of termination. Mr.
      Lovett’s agreement includes a covenant not to compete for the balance of the
      term and for two years thereafter. The agreement further provides that Mr.
      Lovett is entitled to receive certain relocation expenses and to participate
      in
      any benefit plan generally afforded to, and to receive vacation and sick pay
      on
      such terms as are offered to, Charter’s other senior executive
      officers.

As
      of
      January 20, 2006, Charter entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Fisher,
      Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer (the "Employment
      Agreement"). The Employment Agreement provides that Mr. Fisher will serve in
      an
      executive capacity as its Executive Vice President at a salary of $500,000,
      to

      or
      delegated by President and/or Chief Executive Officer, including but not limited

      Long-Term Incentive Plan and to receive such other employee benefits as are
      available to other senior executives. Mr. Fisher will participate in the 2005
      Executive Cash Award Plan commencing in 2006 and, in addition, Charter will
      provide the same additional benefit to Mr. Fisher that he would have been
      entitled to receive under the Cash Award Plan if he had participated in the
      Plan
      at the time of the inception of the Plan in 2005. He will also receive a grant
      of 50,000 restricted shares of Charter's Class A common stock, vesting in equal
      installments over a three-year period from employment date; an award of options
      to purchase 1,000,000 shares of Charter's Class A common stock under terms
      of
      the Stock Incentive Plan on the effective date of the Employment Agreement;
      and
      in the first quarter of 2006, an award of additional options to purchase 145,800
      shares of Charter's Class A common stock under the stock incentive plan. Those
      options shall vest in equal installments over a four-year time period from

      grant date. In addition, in the first quarter of 2006, he will receive 83,700
      performance shares under the Stock Incentive Plan and will be eligible to earn
      these shares over a three-year performance cycle from January 2006 to December
      2008.

Mr.
      Fisher will receive relocation assistance pursuant to Charter's executive
      homeowner relocation plan and the costs for temporary housing.  In the
      event that Mr. Fisher is terminated by Charter without "cause'' or for "good
      reason,'' as those terms are defined in the Employment Agreement, Mr. Fisher
      will receive his salary for the remainder of the term of the agreement or twelve
      months' salary, whichever is greater; a pro rata bonus for the year of
      termination; a lump sum payment equal to payments due under COBRA for the
      greater of twelve months or the number of full months remaining in the term
      of

      as
      severance payments are made. The Employment Agreement contains a one-year
      non-compete provision (or until the end of the term of the agreement, if longer)
      and a two-year non-solicitation clause.

On
      September 7, 2005, Charter entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Davis,
      Executive Vice President and Chief Technical Officer. The agreement provides
      that Mr. Davis shall be employed in an executive capacity to perform such duties

      designee thereof, at a salary of $450,000. The term of this agreement is two
      years from the date of the agreement. Mr. Davis shall be eligible to participate
      in Charter’s Long-Term Incentive Plan, Stock Option Plan and to receive such

      are defined in the agreement, he will receive his salary for the remainder
      of
      the term of the agreement or twelve months’ salary, whichever is greater; a pro
      rata bonus for the year of termination; a lump sum payment equal to payments

      purchase of a home in the St. Louis area or August 16, 2006, whichever occurs
      first.

On
      December 9, 2005, Charter executed an employment agreement with Mr. Quigley.
      The
      agreement provides that Mr. Quigley shall be employed in an executive capacity
      to perform such executive, managerial and administrative duties as are assigned
      or delegated by the President and Chief Executive Officer or the designee
      thereof, at a salary of $450,000. He shall be eligible to participate in the
      incentive bonus plan, stock option plan and to receive such other employee
      benefits as are available to other senior executives. The term of this agreement
      is two years from the effective date of the agreement. In the event that Mr.
      Quigley is terminated by Charter without "cause'' or by Mr. Quigley for "good
      reason,'' as those terms are defined in the employment agreement, Mr. Quigley
      will receive his salary for the remainder of the term of the agreement or twelve
      months' salary, whichever is greater; a pro rata bonus for the year of
      termination; a lump sum payment equal to payments due under COBRA for the
      greater of twelve months or the number of full months remaining in the term
      of
      the agreement; and the vesting of options and restricted stock for as long
      as
      severance payments are made. The employment agreement contains a one-year
      non-compete provision (or until the end of the term of the agreement, if longer)
      in a Competitive Business, as such term is defined in the agreements, and
      two-year non-solicitation clauses. In addition, at the time of his employment,
      Charter agreed to pay him a signing bonus of $200,000 deferred until January
      2006; grant options to purchase 145,800 shares of Class A common stock under
      our
      2001 Stock Incentive Plan; 83,700 performance shares under our 2001 Stock
      Incentive Plan; and 50,000 shares of restricted stock which will vest over
      a
      three year period.

Until
      his
      resignation in January 2005, Mr. Vogel was employed as President and Chief
      Executive Officer, earning a base annual salary of $1,000,000 and was eligible
      to receive an annual bonus of up to $500,000, a portion of which was based
      on
      personal performance goals and a portion of which was based on company
      performance measured against criteria established by the board of directors
      of
      Charter with Mr. Vogel. Pursuant to his employment agreement, Mr. Vogel was
      granted 3,400,000 options to purchase Class A common stock and 50,000 shares
      of
      restricted stock under our 2001 Stock Incentive Plan. In the February 2004
      option exchange, Mr. Vogel exchanged his 3,400,000 options for 340,000 shares
      of
      restricted stock and 340,000 performance shares. Mr. Vogel's initial 50,000
      restricted shares vested 25% on the grant date, with the remainder vesting
      in 36
      equal monthly installments beginning December 2002. The 340,000 shares of
      restricted stock were to vest over a three-year period, with one-third of the
      shares vesting on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date.
      The
      340,000 performance shares were to vest at the end of a three-year period if
      certain financial criteria were met. Mr. Vogel's agreement provided that, if
      Mr.
      Vogel is terminated without cause or if Mr. Vogel terminated the agreement
      for
      good reason, he is entitled to his aggregate base salary due during the
      remainder of the term and full prorated benefits and bonus for the year in
      which
      termination occurs. Mr. Vogel's agreement included a covenant not to compete
      for
      the balance of the initial term or any renewal term, but no more than one year
      in the event of termination without cause or by Mr. Vogel with good reason.
      Mr.
      Vogel's agreement entitled him to participate in any disability insurance,
      pensions or other benefit plans afforded to employees generally or to our
      executives, including our LTIP. We agreed to reimburse Mr. Vogel annually for
      the cost of term life insurance in the amount of $5 million, although he
      declined this reimbursement in 2003, 2004 and 2005. Mr. Vogel was entitled
      to
      reimbursement of fees and dues for his membership in a country club of his
      choice, which he declined in 2003, 2004 and 2005, and reimbursement for up
      to
      $10,000 per year for tax, legal and financial planning services. His agreement
      also provided for a car and associated expenses for Mr. Vogel's use. Mr. Vogel's
      agreement provided for automatic one-year renewals and also provided that we
      would cause him to be elected to our board of directors without any additional
      compensation.


In
      February 2005, Charter entered into an agreement with Mr. Vogel setting forth
      the terms of his resignation. Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Vogel
      received in February 2005 all accrued and unpaid base salary and vacation pay
      through the date of resignation and a lump sum payment equal to the remainder
      of
      his base salary during 2005 (totaling $953,425). In addition, he received a
      lump
      sum cash payment of approximately $358,000 in January 2006, which represented
      the agreed upon payment of $500,000 reduced to the extent of compensation
      attributable to certain competitive activities.

Mr.
      Vogel
      continued to receive certain health benefits during 2005 and will receive COBRA
      premiums for such health insurance coverage for 18 months thereafter. All of
      his
      outstanding stock options, as well as his restricted stock granted in 2004
      (excluding 340,000 shares of restricted stock granted as "performance units",
      which were automatically forfeited), continued to vest through December 31,
      2005. In addition, one-half of the remaining unvested portion of his 2001
      restricted stock grant vested upon the effectiveness of the agreement and the
      other half was forfeited. Mr. Vogel has 60 days after December 31, 2005 to
      exercise any outstanding vested stock options. Under the agreement, Mr. Vogel
      waived any further right to any bonus or incentive plan participation and
      provided certain releases of claims against Charter and its subsidiaries from
      any claims arising out of or based upon any facts occurring prior to the date
      of
      the agreement, but Charter will continue to provide Mr. Vogel certain
      indemnification rights and to include Mr. Vogel in its director and officer
      liability insurance for a period of six years. Charter and its subsidiaries
      also
      agreed to provide releases of certain claims against Mr. Vogel with certain
      exceptions reserved. Mr. Vogel has also agreed, with limited exceptions that
      he
      will continue to be bound by the covenant not to compete, confidentiality and
      non-disparagement provisions contained in his 2001 employment agreement.

In
      addition to the indemnification provisions which apply to all employees under
      our bylaws, Mr. Vogel’s agreement provides that we will indemnify and hold him
      harmless to the maximum extent permitted by law from and against any claims,
      damages, liabilities, losses, costs or expenses in connection with or arising
      out of the performance by him of his duties. The above agreement also contains
      confidentiality and non-solicitation provisions.

We
      have
      established separation guidelines which generally apply to all employees in
      situations where management determines that an employee is entitled to severance
      benefits. Severance benefits are granted solely in management’s discretion and
      are not an employee entitlement or guaranteed benefit. The guidelines provide
      that persons employed at the level of Senior Vice President may be eligible
      to
      receive between six and fifteen months of severance benefits. Currently, all
      Executive Vice Presidents have employment agreements with Charter which provide
      for specific separation arrangements ranging from the payment of twelve to
      twenty-four months of severance benefits. Separation benefits are contingent
      upon the signing of a separation agreement containing certain provisions
      including a release of all claims against us. Severance amounts paid under
      these
      guidelines are distinct and separate from any one-time, special or enhanced
      severance programs that may be approved by us from time to time.

Our
      senior executives are eligible to receive bonuses according to our 2005
      Executive Bonus Plan. Under this plan, our executive officers and certain other
      management and professional employees are eligible to receive an annual bonus.
      Each participating employee would receive his or her target bonus if Charter
      (or
      such employee’s division) meets specified performance measures for revenues,
      operating cash flow, un-levered free cash flow and customer
      satisfaction.

Limitation
      of Directors' Liability and Indemnification Matters

Our
      certificate of incorporation limits the liability of directors to the maximum
      extent permitted by Delaware law. The Delaware General Corporation Law provides
      that a corporation may eliminate or limit the personal liability of a director
      for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for
      liability for:

(1)
      any
      breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the corporation and its
      shareholders;

(2)
      acts
      or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a
      knowing violation of law;

(3)
      unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock purchases or redemptions;
      or

(4)
      any
      transaction from which the director derived an improper personal
      benefit.


Our
      bylaws provide that we will indemnify all persons whom we may indemnify pursuant
      thereto to the fullest extent permitted by law.

Insofar
      as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be
      permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling us pursuant to the
      foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC,
      such
      indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act
      and
      is therefore unenforceable.

We
      have
      reimbursed certain of our current and former directors, officers and employees
      in connection with their defense in certain legal actions. See "Item 13. Certain
      Relationships and Related Transactions — Other Miscellaneous Relationships —
Indemnification Advances.''

                2006.

With

                units in Charter Holdco held by such holder and its affiliates are
                exchangeable.

Securities
      authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans

The
      following information is provided as of December 31, 2005 with respect to equity
      compensation plans:

_________

(1)

This
                total does not include 4,252,570 shares issued pursuant to restricted
                stock grants made under our 2001 Stock Incentive Plan, which were
                subject
                to vesting based on continued employment or 11,258,256 performance
                shares
                issued under our LTIP plan, which are subject to vesting based on
                continued employment and Charter’s achievement of certain performance
                criteria.

(2)

Includes
                shares of Class A common stock to be issued upon exercise of options
                granted pursuant to an individual compensation agreement with a
                consultant.


Item 13.

Certain
      Relationships and Related Transactions.

The
      following sets forth certain transactions in which we are involved and in which
      the directors, executive officers and affiliates of Charter have or may have
      a
      material interest. The transactions fall generally into three broad categories:

·

Transactions
                in which Mr. Allen has an interest that arise directly out of
                Mr. Allen’s investment in Charter and Charter
                Holdco

.

A
                large number of the transactions described below arise out of
                Mr. Allen’s direct and indirect (through CII, or the Vulcan entities,
                each of which Mr. Allen controls) investment in Charter and its
                subsidiaries, as well as commitments made as consideration for the
                investments themselves.

·

Transactions
                with third party providers of products, services and content in which
                Mr. Allen has or had a material interest

.

Mr. Allen has had numerous investments in the areas of technology and
                media. We have a number of commercial relationships with third parties
                in
                which Mr. Allen has or had an
                interest.

·

Other
                Miscellaneous Transactions

.

We
                have a limited number of transactions in which certain of the officers,
                directors and principal shareholders of Charter and its subsidiaries,
                other than Mr. Allen, have an
                interest.

A
      number
      of our debt instruments and those of our subsidiaries require delivery of
      fairness opinions for transactions with Mr. Allen or his affiliates involving
      more than $50 million. Such fairness opinions have been obtained whenever
      required. All of our transactions with Mr. Allen or his affiliates have been
      considered for approval either by the board of directors of Charter or a
      committee of the board of directors. All of our transactions with Mr. Allen
      or
      his affiliates have been deemed by the board of directors or a committee of
      the
      board of directors to be in our best interest. Related party transactions are
      approved by our Audit Committee or another independent body of the board of
      directors in compliance with the listing requirements applicable to NASDAQ
      National Market listed companies. Except where noted below, we do not believe
      that these transactions present any unusual risks for us that would not be
      present in any similar commercial transaction.

The
      chart
      below summarizes certain information with respect to these transactions.
      Additional information regarding these transactions is provided following the
      chart.


The
      following sets forth additional information regarding the transactions
      summarized above.

Transactions
      Arising Out of Our Organizational Structure and Mr. Allen’s Investment in
      Charter Communications, Inc. and Its Subsidiaries

As
      noted
      above, a number of our related party transactions arise out of Mr. Allen’s
      investment in Charter and its subsidiaries. Some of these transactions are
      with
      CII and Vulcan Ventures (both owned 100% by Mr. Allen), Charter (controlled
      by Mr. Allen) and Charter Holdco (approximately 55% owned by us and
      45% owned by other affiliates of Mr. Allen). See "Item 1.
      Business - Organizational Chart" for more information regarding the ownership
      by
      Mr. Allen and certain of his affiliates.


Intercompany
      Management Arrangements

Charter
      is a party to management arrangements with Charter Holdco and certain of its
      subsidiaries. Under these agreements, Charter provides management services
      for
      the cable systems owned or operated by its subsidiaries. These management
      agreements provide for reimbursement to Charter for all costs and expenses
      incurred by it for activities relating to the ownership and operation of the
      managed cable systems, including corporate overhead, administration and salary
      expense.

The
      total
      amount paid by Charter Holdco and all of its subsidiaries is limited to the
      amount necessary to reimburse Charter for all of its expenses, costs, losses,
      liabilities and damages paid or incurred by it in connection with the
      performance of its services under the various management agreements and in
      connection with its corporate overhead, administration, salary expense and
      similar items. The expenses subject to reimbursement include fees Charter is
      obligated to pay under the mutual services agreement with CII. Payment of
      management fees by Charter’s operating subsidiaries is subject to certain
      restrictions under the credit facilities and indentures of such subsidiaries
      and
      the indentures governing the Charter Holdings public debt. If any portion of
      the
      management fee due and payable is not paid, it is deferred by Charter and
      accrued as a liability of such subsidiaries. Any deferred amount of the
      management fee will bear interest at the rate of 10% per year, compounded
      annually, from the date it was due and payable until the date it is paid. For
      the year ended December 31, 2005, the subsidiaries of Charter Holdings paid
      a total of $128 million in management fees to Charter.

Mutual
      Services Agreement

Charter,
      Charter Holdco and CII are parties to a mutual services agreement whereby each
      party shall provide rights and services to the other parties as may be
      reasonably requested for the management of the entities involved and their
      subsidiaries, including the cable systems owned by their subsidiaries all on
      a
      cost-reimbursement basis. The officers and employees of each party are available
      to the other parties to provide these rights and services, and all expenses
      and
      costs incurred in providing these rights and services are paid by Charter.
      Each
      of the parties will indemnify and hold harmless the other parties and their
      directors, officers and employees from and against any and all claims that
      may
      be made against any of them in connection with the mutual services agreement
      except due to its or their gross negligence or willful misconduct. The mutual
      services agreement expires on November 12, 2009, and may be terminated at
      any time by any party upon thirty days’ written notice to the other. For the
      year ended December 31, 2005, Charter paid approximately $89 million
      to Charter Holdco for services rendered pursuant to the mutual services
      agreement. All such amounts are reimbursable to Charter pursuant to a management
      arrangement with our subsidiaries. See "— Intercompany Management Arrangements."
      The accounts and balances related to these services eliminate in consolidation.
      CII no longer provides services pursuant to this agreement.

Previous
      Management Agreement with Charter Investment, Inc.

Prior
      to
      November 12, 1999, CII provided management and consulting services to our
      operating subsidiaries for a fee equal to 3.5% of the gross revenues of the
      systems then owned, plus reimbursement of expenses. The balance of management
      fees payable under the previous management agreement was accrued with payment
      at
      the discretion of CII, with interest payable on unpaid amounts. For the year
      ended December 31, 2005, Charter’s subsidiaries did not pay any fees to CII to
      reduce management fees payable. As of December 31, 2005, total management fees
      payable by our subsidiaries to CII were approximately $14 million, exclusive
      of
      any interest that may be charged and are included in deferred management fees
      -
      related party on the consolidated balance sheets contained in "Item 8.

      Statements and Supplementary Data

Charter
      Communications Holding Company, LLC Limited Liability Agreement —
Taxes

The
      limited liability company agreement of Charter Holdco contains special
      provisions regarding the allocation of tax losses and profits among its members
      — Vulcan Cable III Inc., CII and us. In some situations, these provisions may
      cause us to pay more tax than would otherwise be due if Charter Holdco had
      allocated profits and losses among its members based generally on the number
      of
      common membership units. See "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis
      of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies
      and Estimates — Income Taxes."

Vulcan
      Ventures Channel Access Agreement

Vulcan
      Ventures, an entity controlled by Mr. Allen, Charter, CII and Charter
      Holdco are parties to an agreement dated September 21, 1999 granting to
      Vulcan Ventures the right to use up to eight of our digital cable channels
      as


partial
      consideration for a prior capital contribution of $1.325 billion.
      Specifically, at Vulcan Ventures’ request, we will provide Vulcan Ventures with
      exclusive rights for carriage of up to eight digital cable television
      programming services or channels on each of the digital cable systems with
      local
      and to the extent available, national control of the digital product owned,
      operated, controlled or managed by Charter or its subsidiaries now or in the
      future of 550 megahertz or more. If the system offers digital services but
      has
      less than 550 megahertz of capacity, then the programming services will be
      equitably reduced. Upon request of Vulcan Ventures, we will attempt to reach
      a
      comprehensive programming agreement pursuant to which it will pay the
      programmer, if possible, a fee per digital video customer. If such fee
      arrangement is not achieved, then we and the programmer shall enter into a
      standard programming agreement. The initial term of the channel access agreement
      was 10 years, and the term extends by one additional year (such that the
      remaining term continues to be 10 years) on each anniversary date of the
      agreement unless either party provides the other with notice to the contrary
      at
      least 60 days prior to such anniversary date. To date, Vulcan Ventures has
      not requested to use any of these channels. However, in the future it is
      possible that Vulcan Ventures could require us to carry programming that is
      less
      profitable to us than the programming that we would otherwise carry and our
      results would suffer accordingly.

Equity
      Put Rights

CC
      VIII.

As
      part
      of the acquisition of the cable systems owned by Bresnan Communications Company
      Limited Partnership in February 2000, CC VIII, Charter’s indirect limited
      liability company subsidiary, issued, after adjustments, 24,273,943 Class A
      preferred membership units (collectively, the "CC VIII interest") with a
      value and an initial capital account of approximately $630 million to certain
      sellers affiliated with AT&T Broadband, subsequently owned by Comcast
      Corporation (the "Comcast sellers"). Mr. Allen granted the Comcast
      sellers the right to sell to him the CC VIII interest for approximately
      $630 million plus 4.5% interest annually from February 2000 (the "Comcast
      put right"). In April 2002, the Comcast sellers exercised the Comcast put right
      in full, and this transaction was consummated on June 6, 2003. Accordingly,
      Mr. Allen, indirectly through a company controlled by him, CII, became the
      holder of the CC VIII interest.

In
      the
      event of a liquidation of CC VIII, Mr. Allen would be entitled to a priority
      distribution with respect to a 2% priority return (which will continue to
      accrete). Any remaining distributions in liquidation would be distributed to
      CC
      V Holdings, LLC and Mr. Allen in proportion to CC V Holdings, LLC's capital
      account and Mr. Allen's capital account (which will equal the initial capital
      account of the Comcast sellers of approximately $630 million, increased or
      decreased by Mr. Allen's pro rata share of CC VIII’s profits or losses (as
      computed for capital account purposes) after June 6, 2003).

An
      issue
      arose as to whether the documentation for the Bresnan transaction was correct
      and complete with regard to the ultimate ownership of the CC VIII interest
      following consummation of the Comcast put right. Thereafter, the board of
      directors of Charter formed a Special Committee (comprised of Messrs.
      Merritt, Tory and Wangberg) to investigate the matter and take any other
      appropriate action on behalf of Charter with respect to this matter. After
      conducting an investigation of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Special
      Committee determined that a "scrivener’s error" had occurred in February 2000 in
      connection with the preparation of the last-minute revisions to the Bresnan
      transaction documents and that, as a result, Charter should seek the reformation
      of the Charter Holdco limited liability company agreement, or alternative
      relief, in order to restore and ensure the obligation that the CC VIII interest
      be automatically exchanged for Charter Holdco units. The Special Committee
      further determined that, as part of such contract reformation or alternative
      relief, Mr. Allen should be required to contribute the CC VIII
      interest to Charter Holdco in exchange for 24,273,943 Charter Holdco membership
      units. The Special Committee also recommended to the board of directors of
      Charter that, to the extent the contract reformation is achieved, the board
      of
      directors should consider whether the CC VIII interest should ultimately be
      held by Charter Holdco or Charter Holdings or another entity owned directly
      or
      indirectly by them.

Mr. Allen
      disagreed with the Special Committee’s determinations described above and so
      notified the Special Committee. Mr. Allen contended that the transaction was
      accurately reflected in the transaction documentation and contemporaneous and
      subsequent company public disclosures. The Special Committee and Mr. Allen
      determined to utilize the Delaware Court of Chancery’s program for mediation of
      complex business disputes in an effort to resolve the CC VIII interest dispute.

As
      of
      October 31, 2005, Mr. Allen, the Special Committee, Charter, Charter Holdco
      and
      certain of their affiliates, agreed to settle the dispute, and execute certain
      permanent and irrevocable releases pursuant to the Settlement Agreement and
      Mutual Release agreement dated October 31, 2005 (the "Settlement"). Pursuant
      to
      the Settlement, CII has retained 30% of its CC VIII interest (the "Remaining
      Interests"). The Remaining Interests are subject to certain drag along, tag
      along and transfer restrictions as detailed in the revised CC VIII Limited
      Liability Company Agreement. CII transferred the other 70% of the CC VIII
      interest directly and indirectly, through Charter Holdco, to a newly formed
      entity, CCHC (a direct subsidiary of Charter Holdco and the direct parent of
      Charter Holdings). Of


that
      other 70% of the CC VIII preferred interests, 7.4% has been transferred by
      CII
      to CCHC for a subordinated exchangeable note with an initial accreted value
      of
      $48 million, accreting at 14%, compounded quarterly, with a 15-year maturity
      (the "CCHC note"). The remaining 62.6% has been transferred by CII to Charter
      Holdco, in accordance with the terms of the settlement for no additional
      monetary consideration. Charter Holdco contributed the 62.6% interest to CCHC.

As
      part
      of the Settlement, CC VIII issued approximately 49 million additional Class
      B
      units to CC V in consideration for prior capital contributions to CC VIII by
      CC
      V, with respect to transactions that were unrelated to the dispute in connection
      with CII’s membership units in CC VIII. As a result, Mr. Allen’s pro rata share
      of the profits and losses of CC VIII attributable to the Remaining Interests
      is
      approximately 5.6%.

The
      CCHC
      note is exchangeable, at CII’s option, at any time, for Charter Holdco Class A
      Common units at a rate equal to the then accreted value, divided by $2.00 (the
      "Exchange Rate"). Customary anti-dilution protections have been provided that
      could cause future changes to the Exchange Rate. Additionally, the Charter
      Holdco Class A Common units received will be exchangeable by the holder into
      Charter common stock in accordance with existing agreements between CII, Charter
      and certain other parties signatory thereto. Beginning

February
      28, 2009

, if the closing price of Charter common stock is at or above the
      Exchange Rate for a certain period of time as specified in the Exchange
      Agreement, Charter Holdco may require the exchange of the CCHC note for Charter
      Holdco Class A Common units at the Exchange Rate.

CCHC
      has
      the right to redeem the CCHC note under certain circumstances, for cash in
      an
      amount equal to the then accreted value, such amount, if redeemed prior to

February
      28, 2009

, would also include a make whole up to the accreted value
      through

February
      28, 2009

. CCHC must redeem the CCHC note at its maturity for cash in an
      amount equal to the initial stated value plus the accreted return through
      maturity.

The
      Board
      of Directors has determined that the transferred CC VIII interests remain at
      CCHC.

Mirror
      Securities

Charter
      is a holding company and its principal assets are its equity interest in Charter
      Holdco and certain mirror notes payable by Charter Holdco to Charter and mirror
      preferred units held by Charter, which have the same principal amount and terms
      as those of Charter's convertible senior notes and Charter’s outstanding
      preferred stock. In 2005, Charter Holdco paid to Charter $64 million related
      to
      interest on the mirror notes. In connection with our November 2004 sale of
      the
      $862.5 million principal amount of 5.875% convertible senior notes due 2009,
      Charter Holdco issued to us mirror notes in identical principal amount in
      exchange for the proceeds from our offering. Charter Holdco then purchased
      and
      pledged certain U.S. government securities to us as security for the mirror
      notes (which were in turn repledged by us to the trustee for the benefit of
      holders of our 5.875% convertible senior notes and which we expect to use to
      fund the first six interest payments on the notes), and agreed to lend common
      units to us, the terms of which will, to the extent practicable, mirror the
      terms of the shares. Charter Holdco also redeemed the remaining $588 million
      principal amount of the mirror notes in respect of our 5.75% convertible senior
      notes due 2005 concurrently with our December 23, 2004 redemption of our 5.75%
      convertible senior notes.

In
      addition, in December 2004, Charter Holdco entered into a share lending
      agreement with Charter in which it agreed to lend common units to Charter that
      would mirror the anticipated loan of Class A common shares by Charter to
      Citigroup Global Markets pursuant to a share lending agreement. The members
      of
      Charter Holdco (including the entities controlled by Mr. Allen) also at that
      time entered into a letter agreement providing, among other things, that for
      purposes of the allocation provisions of the Limited Liability Company Agreement
      of Charter Holdco, the mirror units be treated as disregarded and not
      outstanding until such time (and except to the extent) that, under Charter’s
      share lending agreement, Charter treats the loaned shares in a manner that
      assumes they will neither be returned by the borrower nor otherwise be acquired
      by Charter in lieu of such a return. In 2005, Charter issued 94.9 million shares
      of Class A common stock and the corresponding issuance of an equal number of
      mirror membership units by Charter Holdco to Charter pursuant to the share
      lending agreement. In February 2006, an additional 22.0 million shares and
      corresponding units were issued.

Allocation
      of Business Opportunities with Mr. Allen

As
      described under "— Third Party Business Relationships in which Mr. Allen
      has or had an Interest" in this section, Mr. Allen and a number of his
      affiliates have interests in various entities that provide services or
      programming to our subsidiaries. Given the diverse nature of Mr. Allen’s
      investment activities and interests, and to avoid the possibility of future
      disputes as to potential business, Charter and Charter Holdco, under the terms
      of their


respective
      organizational documents, may not, and may not allow their subsidiaries, to
      engage in any business transaction outside the cable transmission business
      except for the Digeo, Inc. joint venture; a joint venture to develop a digital
      video recorder set-top terminal; an existing investment in Cable Sports
      Southeast, LLC, a provider of regional sports programming; as an owner of the
      business of Interactive Broadcaster Services Corporation or, Chat TV, an
      investment in @Security Broadband Corp., a company developing broadband security
      applications; and incidental businesses engaged in as of the closing of
      Charter’s initial public offering in November 1999. This restriction will remain
      in effect until all of the shares of Charter’s high-vote Class B common
      stock have been converted into shares of Charter’s Class A common stock due
      to Mr. Allen’s equity ownership falling below specified thresholds.

Should
      Charter or Charter Holdco or any of their subsidiaries wish to pursue, or allow
      their subsidiaries to pursue, a business transaction outside of this scope,
      it
      must first offer Mr. Allen the opportunity to pursue the particular business
      transaction. If he decides not to pursue the business transaction and consents
      to Charter or its subsidiaries engaging in the business transaction, they will
      be able to do so. In any such case, the restated certificate of incorporation
      of
      Charter and the limited liability company agreement of Charter Holdco would
      need
      to be amended accordingly to modify the current restrictions on the ability
      of
      such entities to engage in any business other than the cable transmission
      business. The cable transmission business means the business of transmitting
      video, audio, including telephone, and data over cable systems owned, operated
      or managed by Charter, Charter Holdco or any of their subsidiaries from time
      to
      time.

Under
      Delaware corporate law, each director of Charter, including Mr. Allen, is
      generally required to present to Charter, any opportunity he or she may have
      to
      acquire any cable transmission business or any company whose principal business
      is the ownership, operation or management of cable transmission businesses,
      so
      that we may determine whether we wish to pursue such opportunities. However,
      Mr. Allen and the other directors generally will not have an obligation to
      present other types of business opportunities to Charter and they may exploit
      such opportunities for their own account.

Also,
      conflicts could arise with respect to the allocation of corporate opportunities
      between us and Mr. Allen and his affiliates in connection with his
      investments in businesses in which we are permitted to engage under Charter’s
      restated certificate of incorporation. Certain of the indentures of Charter
      and
      its subsidiaries require the applicable issuer of notes to obtain, under certain
      circumstances, approval of the board of directors of Charter and, where a
      transaction or series of related transactions is valued at or in excess of
      $50
      million, a fairness opinion with respect to transactions in which Mr. Allen
      has
      an interest. Related party transactions are approved by our Audit Committee
      in
      compliance with the listing requirements applicable to NASDAQ national market
      listed companies. We have not instituted any other formal plan or arrangement
      to
      address potential conflicts of interest.

The
      restrictive provisions of the organizational documents described above may
      limit
      our ability to take advantage of attractive business opportunities.
      Consequently, our ability to offer new products and services outside of the
      cable transmission business and enter into new businesses could be adversely
      affected, resulting in an adverse effect on our growth, financial condition
      and
      results of operations.

Third
      Party Business Relationships in which Mr. Allen has or had an
      Interest

As
      previously noted, Mr. Allen has and has had extensive investments in the
      areas of media and technology. We have a number of commercial relationships
      with
      third parties in which Mr. Allen has an interest. Mr. Allen or his
      affiliates own equity interests or warrants to purchase equity interests in
      various entities with which we do business or which provide us with products,
      services or programming. Mr. Allen owns 100% of the equity of Vulcan
      Ventures Incorporated and Vulcan Inc. and is the president of Vulcan Ventures.
      Ms. Jo Allen Patton is a director and the President and Chief Executive Officer
      of Vulcan Inc. and is a director and Vice President of Vulcan Ventures. Mr.
      Lance Conn is Executive Vice President of Vulcan Inc. and Vulcan Ventures.
      The
      various cable, media, Internet and telephone companies in which Mr. Allen
      has invested may mutually benefit one another. We can give no assurance, nor
      should you expect, that any of these business relationships will be successful,
      that we will realize any benefits from these relationships or that we will
      enter
      into any business relationships in the future with Mr. Allen’s affiliated
      companies.

Mr. Allen
      and his affiliates have made, and in the future likely will make, numerous
      investments outside of us and our business. We cannot assure you that, in the
      event that we or any of our subsidiaries enter into transactions in the future
      with any affiliate of Mr. Allen, such transactions will be on terms as
      favorable to us as terms we might have obtained from an unrelated third party.


TechTV,
      Inc.

TechTV,
      Inc. ("TechTV") operated a cable television network that offered programming
      mostly related to technology. Pursuant to an affiliation agreement that
      originated in 1998 and that terminates in 2008, TechTV has provided us with
      programming for distribution via our cable systems. The affiliation agreement
      provides, among other things, that TechTV must offer Charter Holdco certain
      terms and conditions that are no less favorable in the affiliation agreement
      than are given to any other distributor that serves the same number of or fewer
      TechTV viewing customers.

In
      March
      2004, Charter Holdco entered into agreements with Vulcan Programming and TechTV,
      which provide for (i) Charter Holdco and TechTV to amend the affiliation
      agreement which, among other things, revises the description of the TechTV
      network content, provides for Charter Holdco to waive certain claims against
      TechTV relating to alleged breaches of the affiliation agreement and provides
      for TechTV to make payment of outstanding launch receivables due to Charter
      Holdco under the affiliation agreement, (ii) Vulcan Programming to pay
      approximately $10 million and purchase over a 24-month period, at fair market
      rates, $2 million of advertising time across various cable networks on Charter
      cable systems in consideration of the agreements, obligations, releases and
      waivers under the agreements and in settlement of the aforementioned claims
      and
      (iii) TechTV to be a provider of content relating to technology and video gaming
      for Charter’s interactive television platforms through December 31, 2006
      (exclusive for the first year). For the year ended December 31, 2005, we
      recognized approximately $1 million of the Vulcan Programming payment as an
      offset to programming expense.

We
      believe that Vulcan Programming, which is 100% owned by Mr. Allen, owned an
      approximate 98% equity interest in TechTV at the time Vulcan Programming sold
      TechTV to an unrelated third party in May 2004.

Oxygen
      Media Corporation

Oxygen
      Media LLC ("Oxygen") provides programming content aimed at the female audience
      for distribution over cable systems and satellite. On July 22, 2002,
      Charter Holdco entered into a carriage agreement with Oxygen, whereby we agreed
      to carry programming content from Oxygen. Under the carriage agreement, we
      currently make Oxygen programming available to approximately 5 million of
      our video customers. In August 2004, Charter Holdco and Oxygen entered into
      agreements that amended and renewed the carriage agreement. The amendment to
      the
      carriage agreement (a) revised the number of our customers to which Oxygen
      programming must be carried and for which we must pay, (b) released Charter
      Holdco from any claims related to the failure to achieve distribution benchmarks
      under the carriage agreement, (c) required Oxygen to make payment on outstanding
      receivables for launch incentives due to us under the carriage agreement; and
      (d) requires that Oxygen provide its programming content to us on economic
      terms
      no less favorable than Oxygen provides to any other cable or satellite operator
      having fewer subscribers than us. The renewal of the carriage agreement (a)
      extends the period that we will carry Oxygen programming to our customers
      through January 31, 2008, and (b) requires license fees to be paid based on
      customers receiving Oxygen programming, rather than for specific customer
      benchmarks. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we paid Oxygen approximately
      $9 million for programming content. In addition, Oxygen pays us launch
      incentives for customers launched after the first year of the term of the
      carriage agreement up to a total of $4 million. We recorded approximately
      $0.1 million related to these launch incentives as a reduction of programming
      expense for the year ended December 31, 2005.

In
      August
      2004, Charter Holdco and Oxygen amended an equity issuance agreement to provide
      for the issuance of 1 million shares of Oxygen Preferred Stock with a
      liquidation preference of $33.10 per share plus accrued dividends to Charter
      Holdco in place of the $34 million of unregistered shares of Oxygen Media common
      stock required under the original equity issuance agreement. Oxygen Media
      delivered these shares in March 2005. The preferred stock is convertible into
      common stock after December 31, 2007 at a conversion ratio, the numerator of
      which is the liquidation preference and the denominator which is the fair market
      value per share of Oxygen Media common stock on the conversion date.

We
      recognized the guaranteed value of the investment over the life of the carriage
      agreement as a reduction of programming expense. For the year ended December
      31,
      2005, we recorded approximately $2 million as a reduction of programming
      expense. The carrying value of our investment in Oxygen was approximately $33
      million as of December 31, 2005.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, through Vulcan Programming, Mr. Allen owned an approximate
      31% interest in Oxygen assuming no exercises of outstanding warrants or
      conversion or exchange of convertible or exchangeable securities.


Ms.
      Jo
      Allen Patton is a director and the President of Vulcan Programming. Mr. Lance
      Conn is a Vice President of Vulcan Programming. Marc Nathanson has an indirect
      beneficial interest of less than 1% in Oxygen.

Portland
      Trail Blazers

On
      October 7, 1996, the former owner of our Falcon cable systems entered into
      a letter agreement and a cable television agreement with Trail Blazers Inc.
      for
      the cable broadcast in the metropolitan area surrounding Portland, Oregon of
      pre-season, regular season and playoff basketball games of the Portland Trail
      Blazers, a National Basketball Association basketball team. Mr. Allen is
      the 100% owner of the Portland Trail Blazers and Trail Blazers Inc. Under the
      letter agreement, Trail Blazers Inc. was paid a fixed fee for each customer
      in
      areas directly served by the Falcon cable systems. Under the cable television
      agreement, we shared subscription revenues with Trail Blazers Inc. We paid
      approximately $116,500 for the year ended December 31, 2005 in connection
      with the cable broadcast of Portland Trail Blazers basketball games under the
      October 1996 cable television agreement and subsequent local cable distribution
      agreements.

Digeo,
      Inc.

In
      March
      2001, a subsidiary of Charter, Charter Communications Ventures, LLC ("Charter
      Ventures") and Vulcan Ventures Incorporated formed DBroadband Holdings, LLC
      for
      the sole purpose of purchasing equity interests in Digeo, Inc. ("Digeo"), an
      entity controlled by Paul Allen. In connection with the execution of the
      broadband carriage agreement, DBroadband Holdings, LLC purchased an equity
      interest in Digeo funded by contributions from Vulcan Ventures Incorporated.
      The
      equity interest is subject to a priority return of capital to Vulcan Ventures
      up
      to the amount contributed by Vulcan Ventures on Charter Ventures’ behalf. After
      Vulcan Ventures recovers its amount contributed and any cumulative loss
      allocations, Charter Ventures has a 100% profit interest in DBroadband Holdings,
      LLC. Charter Ventures is not required to make any capital contributions,
      including capital calls to Digeo. DBroadband Holdings, LLC is therefore not
      included in our accompanying consolidated financial statements. Pursuant to
      an
      amended version of this arrangement, in 2003, Vulcan Ventures contributed a
      total of $29 million to Digeo, $7 million of which was contributed on
      Charter Ventures’ behalf, subject to Vulcan Ventures’ aforementioned priority
      return. Since the formation of DBroadband Holdings, LLC, Vulcan Ventures has
      contributed approximately $56 million on Charter Ventures’ behalf.

On
      March 2, 2001, Charter Ventures entered into a broadband carriage agreement
      with Digeo Interactive, LLC ("Digeo Interactive"), a wholly owned subsidiary
      of
      Digeo. The carriage agreement provided that Digeo Interactive would provide
      to
      Charter a "portal" product, which would function as the television-based
      Internet portal (the initial point of entry to the Internet) for Charter’s
      customers who received Internet access from Charter. The agreement term was
      for
      25 years and Charter agreed to use the Digeo portal exclusively for six
      years. Before the portal product was delivered to Charter, Digeo terminated
      development of the portal product.

On
      September 27, 2001, Charter and Digeo Interactive amended the broadband
      carriage agreement. According to the amendment, Digeo Interactive would provide
      to Charter the content for enhanced "Wink" interactive television services,
      known as Charter Interactive Channels ("i-channels"). In order to provide the
      i-channels, Digeo Interactive sublicensed certain Wink technologies to Charter.
      Charter is entitled to share in the revenues generated by the i-channels.
      Currently, our digital video customers who receive i-channels receive the
      service at no additional charge.

On
      September 28, 2002, Charter entered into a second amendment to its
      broadband carriage agreement with Digeo Interactive. This amendment superseded
      the amendment of September 27, 2001. It provided for the development by
      Digeo Interactive of future features to be included in the Basic i-TV service
      to
      be provided by Digeo and for Digeo’s development of an interactive "toolkit" to
      enable Charter to develop interactive local content. Furthermore, Charter could
      request that Digeo Interactive manage local content for a fee. The amendment
      provided for Charter to pay for development of the Basic i-TV service as well
      as
      license fees for customers who would receive the service, and for Charter and
      Digeo to split certain revenues earned from the service. In 2005, we paid Digeo
      Interactive approximately $3 million for customized development of the
      i-channels and the local content tool kit. This amendment expired pursuant
      to
      its terms on December 31, 2003. Digeo Interactive is continuing to provide
      the
      Basic i-TV service on a month-to-month basis.

On
      June
      30, 2003, Charter Holdco entered into an agreement with Motorola, Inc. for
      the
      purchase of 100,000 digital video recorder ("DVR") units. The software for
      these
      DVR units is being supplied by Digeo Interactive, LLC under a license agreement
      entered into in April 2004. Under the license agreement Digeo Interactive
      granted to Charter Holdco the right to use Digeo’s proprietary software for the
      number of DVR units that Charter deployed from a maximum of 10 headends through
      year-end 2004. This maximum number of headends restriction was expanded and


eventually
      eliminated through successive agreement amendments and the date for entering
      into license agreements for units deployed was extended. The license granted
      for
      each unit deployed under the agreement is valid for five years. In addition,
      Charter will pay certain other fees including a per-headend license fee and
      maintenance fees. Maximum license and maintenance fees during the term of the
      agreement are expected to be approximately $7 million. The agreement includes
      an
      "MFN clause" pursuant to which Charter is entitled to receive contract terms,
      considered on the whole, and license fees, considered apart from other contract
      terms, no less favorable than those accorded to any other Digeo customer.
      Charter paid approximately $1 million in license and maintenance fees in
      2005.

In
      April
      2004, we launched DVR service (using units containing the Digeo software) in
      our
      Rochester, Minnesota market using a broadband media center that is an integrated
      set-top terminal with a cable converter, DVR hard drive and connectivity to
      other consumer electronics devices (such as stereos, MP3 players, and digital
      cameras).

In
      May
      2004, Charter Holdco entered into a binding term sheet with Digeo Interactive
      for the development, testing and purchase of 70,000 Digeo PowerKey DVR units.
      The term sheet provided that the parties would proceed in good faith to
      negotiate, prior to year-end 2004, definitive agreements for the development,
      testing and purchase of the DVR units and that the parties would enter into
      a
      license agreement for Digeo's proprietary software on terms substantially
      similar to the terms of the license agreement described above. In November
      2004,
      Charter Holdco and Digeo Interactive executed the license agreement and in
      December 2004, the parties executed the purchase agreement, each on terms
      substantially similar to the binding term sheet. Total purchase price and
      license and maintenance fees during the term of the definitive agreements are
      expected to be approximately $41 million. The definitive agreements are
      terminable at no penalty to Charter in certain circumstances. Charter paid
      approximately $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 in capital
      purchases under this agreement.

In
      late
      2003, Microsoft filed suit against Digeo for $9 million in a breach of contract
      action, involving an agreement that Digeo and Microsoft had entered into in
      2001. Digeo informed Charter that it believed it had an indemnification claim
      against Charter for half that amount. Digeo settled with Microsoft agreeing
      to
      make a cash payment and to purchase certain amounts of Microsoft software
      products and consulting services through 2008. In consideration of Digeo
      agreeing to release Charter from its potential claim against Charter, after
      consultation with outside counsel Charter agreed, in June 2005, to purchase
      a
      total of $2.3 million in Microsoft consulting services through 2008, a portion
      of which amounts Digeo has informed Charter will count against Digeo’s purchase
      obligations with Microsoft.

In
      October 2005, Charter Holdco and Digeo Interactive entered into a binding term
      sheet for the test market deployment of the Moxi Entertainment Applications
      Pack
      ("MEAP"). The MEAP is an addition to the Moxi Client Software and will contain
      ten games (such as Video Poker and Blackjack), a photo application and jukebox
      application. The term sheet is limited to a test market application of
      approximately 14,000 subscribers and the aggregate value is not expected to
      exceed $0.1 million. In the event the test market proves successful, the
      companies will replace the term sheet with a long form agreement including
      a
      planned roll-out across additional markets. The term sheet expires on May 1,
      2006.

We
      believe that Vulcan Ventures, an entity controlled by Mr. Allen, owns an
      approximate 60% equity interest in Digeo, Inc., on a fully-converted non-diluted
      basis. Messrs. Allen and Conn and Ms. Patton are directors of Digeo. Mr. Lovett
      is a director of Digeo since December 2005 and Mr. Vogel was a director of
      Digeo
      in 2004. During 2004 and 2005, Mr. Vogel held options to purchase 10,000 shares
      of Digeo common stock.

Other
      Miscellaneous Relationships

Payment
      for Relative’s Services

Since
      June 2003, Mr. Vogel's brother-in-law has been an employee of Charter Holdco
      and
      has received a salary commensurate with his position in the engineering
      department.

Radio
      Advertising

We
      believe that, through a third party advertising agency, we have paid
      approximately $67,600 in 2005 to Mapleton Communications, an affiliate of
      Mapleton Investments, LLC that owns radio stations in Oregon and California.
      Mr.
      Nathanson is the Chairman and owner of Mapleton Investments, LLC.


Indemnification
      Advances

Pursuant
      to

Charter

’s
      bylaws
      (and the employment agreements of certain of our current and former officers),
      Charter is obligated (subject to certain limitations) to indemnify and hold
      harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any officer, director or
      employee against all expense, liability and loss (including, among other things,
      attorneys’ fees) reasonably incurred or suffered by such officer, director or
      employee as a result of the fact that he or she is a party or is threatened
      to
      be made a party or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding
      by
      reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer or employee
      of
      Charter. In addition, Charter is obligated to pay, as an advancement of its
      indemnification obligation, the expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by
      any officer, director or employee in defending any such action, suit or
      proceeding in advance of its final disposition, subject to an obligation to
      repay those amounts under certain circumstances. Pursuant to these
      indemnification arrangements and as an advancement of costs, Charter has
      reimbursed certain of its current and former directors and executive officers
      a
      total of approximately $16,200 in respect of invoices received in 2005, in
      connection with their defense of certain legal actions. These amounts were
      submitted to Charter’s director and officer insurance carrier and have been
      reimbursed consistent with the terms of the settlement of the legal actions.

Item 14.

Principal
      Accounting Fees and Services.

Audit
      Fees

We
      incurred fees and related expenses for professional services
      rendered by KPMG LLP ("KPMG") for the audits of our and our subsidiaries’
financial statements (including four subsidiaries that are also public
      registrants), for the review of our and our subsidiaries’ interim financial
      statements and seven offering memorandums and registration statement filings
      in
      2005 and five offering memorandums and registration statement filings in 2004
      totaling approximately $6 million in each of 2005 and 2004. Included in the
      total for each of 2005 and 2004 are fees and related expenses of $2 million
      for
      the audit of internal control over financial reporting required under
      Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404.

Audit-Related
      Fees

We
      incurred fees to KPMG of approximately $0.1 million during the
      year ended December 31, 2004. These services primarily related to the audit
      of
      our 401(k) plan and advisory services associated with our Sarbanes-Oxley Section
      404 implementation.

All
      Other Fees

None.

The
      Audit
      Committee appoints, retains, compensates and oversees the registered public
      accountants (subject, if applicable, to board of director and/or shareholder
      ratification), and approves in advance all fees and terms for the audit
      engagement and non-audit engagements where nonaudit services are not prohibited
      by Section 10A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended with
      registered public accountants. Preapprovals of non-audit services are sometimes
      delegated to a single member of the Audit Committee. However, any pre-approvals
      made by the Audit Committee’s designee are presented at the Audit Committee’s
      next regularly scheduled meeting. The Audit Committee has an obligation to
      consult with management on these matters. The Audit Committee approved 100%
      of
      the KPMG fees for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Each year,
      including 2005, with respect to the proposed audit engagement, the Audit
      Committee reviews the proposed risk assessment process in establishing the
      scope
      of examination and the reports to be rendered.

In
      its
      capacity as a committee of the Board, the Audit Committee oversees the work
      of
      the registered public accounting firm (including resolution of disagreements
      between management and the public accounting firm regarding financial reporting)
      for the purpose of preparing or issuing an audit report or performing other
      audit, review or attest services. The registered public accounting firm reports
      directly to the Audit Committee. In performing its functions, the Audit
      Committee undertakes those tasks and responsibilities that, in its judgment,
      most effectively contribute to and implement the purposes of the Audit Committee
      charter. For more detail of the Audit Committee’s authority and
      responsibilities, see Charter’s Audit Committee charter set forth in Appendix A
      of our 2004 Proxy Statement filed with the SEC on June 25, 2004.

Report
        of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To
        the
        Board of Directors

Charter
        Communications, Inc.:

We
        have
        audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Charter Communications,
        Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and
        the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders’
equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
        period
        ended December 31, 2005. These consolidated financial statements are the
        responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
        opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We
        conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
        Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
        we plan
        and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
        statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
        on a
        test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
        statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
        and
        significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
        financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
        reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
        our
        opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
        fairly,
        in all material respects, the financial position of Charter Communications,
        Inc.
        and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their
        operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
        ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
        principles.

We
        also
        have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
        Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
        control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria
        established in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued
        by
        the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO),
        and
        our report dated February 27, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on
        management’s assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control
        over financial reporting.

As
        discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, effective
        September 30, 2004, the Company adopted EITF Topic D-108,

Use
        of the Residual Method to Value Acquired Assets Other than
        Goodwill

.

As
        discussed in Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements, effective
        January
        1, 2003, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
        No.
        123,

Accounting
        for Stock-Based Compensation

,
        as
        amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148,

Report
        of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
        Board
        of Directors

Charter
        Communications, Inc.:

We
        have
        audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s
        Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Charter
        Communications, Inc. (the Company) maintained effective internal control
        over
        financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established
        in

Internal
        Control - Integrated Framework

issued
        by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
        (COSO).

The
        Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
        over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
        control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
        on
        management's assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
        internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
        conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
        Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
        we plan
        and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
        internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
        respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
        over
        financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating
        the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
        such
        other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
        that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
        company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
        to
        provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
        and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
        with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control
        over
        financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
        to
        the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
        reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
        provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
        to
        permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
        accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
        are
        being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
        of
        the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
        timely
        detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
        assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
        of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
        not
        prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
        effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
        become
        inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
        with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
        our
        opinion, management's assessment that the Company maintained effective internal
        control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated,
        in
        all material respects, based on criteria established in

Internal
        Control - Integrated Framework

issued
        by COSO.

Also,
        in
        our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
        internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based
        on

criteria
        established in

Internal
        Control - Integrated Framework

issued
        by

COSO

.

We
        also
        have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
        Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company
        as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements
        of
        operations, changes in shareholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows for each
        of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2005, and our report
        dated February 27, 2006

expressed
        an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Organization
      and Basis of Presentation

Charter
      Communications, Inc. ("Charter") is a holding company whose principal assets
      at
      December 31, 2005 are the 48% controlling common equity interest in Charter
      Communications Holding Company, LLC ("Charter Holdco") and "mirror" notes which
      are payable by Charter Holdco to Charter and have the same principal amount
      and
      terms as those of Charter’s convertible senior notes. Charter Holdco is the sole
      owner of CCHC, LLC, which is the sole owner of Charter Communications Holdings,
      LLC ("Charter Holdings"). The consolidated financial statements include the
      accounts of Charter, Charter Holdco, Charter Holdings and all of their wholly
      owned subsidiaries where the underlying operations reside, which are
      collectively referred to herein as the "Company." Charter has 100% voting
      control over Charter Holdco and had historically consolidated on that basis.
      Charter continues to consolidate Charter Holdco as a variable interest entity
      under Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation ("FIN")
      46(R)

Consolidation
      of Variable Interest Entities

.
      Charter
      Holdco’s limited liability company agreement provides that so long as Charter’s
      Class B common stock retains its special voting rights, Charter will maintain
      a
      100% voting interest in Charter Holdco. Voting control gives Charter full
      authority and control over the operations of Charter Holdco. All significant
      intercompany accounts and transactions among consolidated entities have been
      eliminated. The Company is a broadband communications company operating in
      the
      United States. The Company offers its customers traditional cable video
      programming (analog and digital video) as well as high-speed Internet services
      and, in some areas, advanced broadband services such as high-definition
      television, video on demand and telephone. The Company sells its cable video
      programming, high-speed Internet and advanced broadband services on a
      subscription basis. The Company also sells local advertising on
      satellite-delivered networks.

The
      preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
      generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
      and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
      and
      disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
      statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
      reporting period. Areas involving significant judgments and estimates include
      capitalization of labor and overhead costs; depreciation and amortization costs;
      impairments of property, plant and equipment, franchises and goodwill; income
      taxes; and contingencies. Actual results could differ from those
      estimates.

Reclassifications.

Certain
      prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the 2005
      presentation.

Liquidity
      and Capital Resources

The
      Company incurred net loss applicable to common stock of $970 million, $4.3
      billion and $242 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company’s net
      cash flows from operating activities were $260 million, $472 million and
      $765 million for the years ending December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
      respectively.

The
      Company has a significant level of debt. The Company's long-term financing
      as of
      December 31, 2005 consists of $5.7 billion of credit facility debt, $12.8
      billion accreted value of high-yield notes and $863 million accreted value
      of
      convertible senior notes. In 2006, $50 million of the Company’s debt matures and
      in 2007, an additional $385 million matures. In 2008 and beyond, significant
      additional amounts will become due under the Company’s remaining long-term debt
      obligations.

Recent
      Financing Transactions

On
      January 30, 2006, CCH II, LLC ("CCH II") and CCH II Capital Corp. issued $450
      million in debt securities, the proceeds of which were provided, directly or
      indirectly, to Charter Communications Operating, LLC ("Charter Operating"),
      which used such funds to reduce borrowings, but not commitments, under the
      revolving portion of its credit facilities.

In
      October 2005, CCO Holdings, LLC ("CCO Holdings") and CCO Holdings Capital Corp.,
      as guarantor thereunder, entered into a senior bridge loan agreement (the
      "Bridge Loan") with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Credit Suisse, Cayman Islands
      Branch and Deutsche Bank AG Cayman Islands Branch (the "Lenders") whereby the
      Lenders committed to make loans to CCO Holdings in an aggregate amount of $600
      million. Upon the issuance of

$450
        million of CCH II notes discussed above, the commitment under the Bridge
        Loan
        was reduced to $435 million. CCO Holdings may draw upon the facility between
        January 2, 2006 and September 29, 2006 and the loans will mature on the sixth
        anniversary of the first borrowing under the Bridge Loan.

In
      September 2005, Charter Holdings and its wholly owned subsidiaries, CCH I,
      LLC
      ("CCH I") and CCH I Holdings, LLC ("CIH"), completed the exchange of
      approximately $6.8 billion total principal amount of outstanding debt securities
      of Charter Holdings in a private placement for new debt securities. Holders
      of
      Charter Holdings notes due in 2009 and 2010 exchanged $3.4 billion principal
      amount of notes for $2.9 billion principal amount of new 11% CCH I notes due
      2015. Holders of Charter Holdings notes due 2011 and 2012 exchanged $845 million
      principal amount of notes for $662 million principal amount of 11% CCH I notes
      due 2015. In addition, holders of Charter Holdings notes due 2011 and 2012
      exchanged $2.5 billion principal amount of notes for $2.5 billion principal
      amount of various series of new CIH notes. Each series of new CIH notes has
      the
      same interest rate and provisions for payment of cash interest as the series
      of
      old Charter Holdings notes for which such CIH notes were exchanged. In addition,
      the maturities for each series were extended three years.

See Note
      9 for discussion of transaction and related financial statement
      impact.

The
      Company requires significant cash to fund debt service costs, capital
      expenditures and ongoing operations. The Company has historically funded these
      requirements through cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under
      its
      credit facilities, sales of assets, issuances of debt and equity securities
      and
      cash on hand. However, the mix of funding sources changes from period to period.
      For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company generated $260 million of
      net
      cash flows from operating activities after paying cash interest of $1.5 billion.

In
      addition, the Company used $1.1 billion for purchases of property, plant and
      equipment. Finally, the Company had net cash flows from financing activities
      of
      $136 million.

The
      Company expects that cash on hand, cash flows from operating activities and
      the
      amounts available under its credit facilities and Bridge Loan will be adequate
      to meet its cash needs in 2006. The Company believes that cash flows from
      operating activities and amounts available under the Company’s credit facilities
      and Bridge Loan will not be sufficient to fund the Company’s operations and
      satisfy its interest and debt repayment obligations in 2007 and beyond. The
      Company is working with its financial advisors to address this funding
      requirement. However, there can be no assurance that such funding will be
      available to the Company. In addition, Paul G. Allen, Charter’s Chairman and
      controlling shareholder, and his affiliates are not obligated to purchase equity
      from, contribute to or loan funds to the Company.

Debt
      Covenants

The
      Company’s ability to operate depends upon, among other things, its continued
      access to capital, including credit under the Charter Operating credit
      facilities and Bridge Loan. The Charter Operating credit facilities, along
      with
      the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ indentures and Bridge Loan, contain certain
      restrictive covenants, some of which require the Company to maintain specified
      financial ratios and meet financial tests and to provide audited financial
      statements with an unqualified opinion from the Company’s independent auditors.
      As of December 31, 2005, the Company is in compliance with the covenants under
      its indentures, Bridge Loan and credit facilities, and the Company expects
      to
      remain in compliance with those covenants for the next twelve months. As of
      December 31, 2005,

the

Company’s potential availability under its credit facilities totaled
      approximately $553 million, none of which was limited by
      covenants

. 
      In addition, as of January 2, 2006, the Company has additional borrowing
      availability of $600 million under the Bridge Loan (which was reduced to $435
      million as a result of the issuance of the CCH II notes).

Continued
      access to the Company’s credit facilities and Bridge Loan is subject to the
      Company remaining in compliance with these covenants, including covenants tied
      to the Company’s operating performance. If any events of non-compliance occur,
      funding under the credit facilities and Bridge Loan may not be available and
      defaults on some or potentially all of the Company’s debt obligations could
      occur. An event of default under any of the Company’s debt instruments could
      result in the acceleration of its payment obligations under that debt and,
      under
      certain circumstances, in cross-defaults under its other debt obligations,
      which
      could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
      condition and results of operations.

(dollars

Specific
      Limitations

Charter’s
      ability to make interest payments on its convertible senior notes, and, in
      and 2009, to repay the outstanding principal of its convertible senior notes
      of
      $20 million and $863 million, respectively, will depend on its ability to raise
      additional capital and/or on receipt of payments or distributions from Charter
      Holdco and its subsidiaries. During 2005, Charter Holdings distributed $60
      million to Charter Holdco.

As of
      December 31, 2005, Charter Holdco was owed $22 million in intercompany loans
      from its subsidiaries, which were available to pay interest and principal on
      Charter's convertible senior notes.

In
      addition, Charter has $98 million of governmental securities pledged as security
      for the next four scheduled semi-annual interest payments on Charter’s 5.875%
      convertible senior notes.

Distributions
      by Charter’s subsidiaries to a parent company (including Charter, CCHC and
      Charter Holdco)

for
      payment of principal on parent company notes

are
      restricted under the indentures governing the CIH notes, CCH I notes, CCH II
      notes, CCO Holdings notes and Charter Operating notes

unless
      there is no default, each applicable subsidiary’s leverage ratio test is met at
      the time of such distribution and, in the case of the convertible senior notes,
      other specified tests are met.

For
      the
      quarter ended December 31, 2005, there was no default under any of these
      indentures and each such subsidiary met its applicable leverage ratio tests

based
      on
      December 31, 2005 financial results

.

Such
      distributions would be restricted, however, if any such subsidiary fails to
      meet
      these tests. In the past, certain subsidiaries have from time to time failed
      to
      meet their leverage ratio test. There can be no assurance that they will satisfy
      these tests at the time of such distribution.

Distributions
      by Charter Operating and CCO Holdings for payment of principal on parent company
      notes are further restricted by the covenants in the credit facilities and
      Bridge Loan, respectively.

Distributions
      by CIH, CCH I, CCH II, CCO Holdings and Charter Operating to a parent company
      for payment of parent company interest are permitted if there is no default
      under the aforementioned indentures. However, distributions for payment of
      interest on the convertible senior notes are further limited to when each
      applicable subsidiary’s leverage ratio test is met and other specified tests are
      met. There can be no assurance that they will satisfy these tests at the time
      of
      such distribution.

The
      indentures governing the Charter Holdings notes permit Charter Holdings to
      make
      distributions to Charter Holdco for payment of interest or principal on the
      convertible senior notes, only if, after giving effect to the distribution,
      Charter Holdings can incur additional debt under the leverage ratio of 8.75
      to
      1.0, there is no default under Charter Holdings’ indentures and other specified
      tests are met. For the quarter ended

December
      31, 2005, there was no default under Charter Holdings’ indentures and Charter
      Holdings met its leverage ratio test based on December 31, 2005 financial
      results

.

Such
      distributions would be restricted, however, if Charter Holdings fails to meet
      these tests. In the past, Charter Holdings has from time to time failed to
      meet
      this leverage ratio test. There can be no assurance that Charter Holdings will
      satisfy these tests at the time of such distribution.

During

periods
      in which distributions are restricted,

the
      indentures governing the Charter Holdings notes permit Charter Holdings and
      its
      subsidiaries to make specified investments (that are not restricted payments)
      in
      Charter Holdco or Charter up to an amount determined by a formula, as long
      as
      there is no default under the indentures.

Summary
      of Significant Accounting Policies

Cash
      Equivalents

The
      Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of
      three months or less to be cash equivalents. These investments are carried
      at
      cost, which approximates market value.

Property,
      Plant and Equipment

Property,
      plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including all material, labor and
      certain indirect costs associated with the construction of cable transmission
      and distribution facilities.

While
      the
      Company’s capitalization is based on specific activities, once capitalized,
      costs are tracked by fixed asset category at the cable system level and not
      on a
      specific asset basis.

Costs associated with initial customer
      installations and the additions of network equipment

necessary
      to enable advanced services are capitalized. Costs capitalized as part of
      initial customer installations include materials, labor, and certain indirect
      costs. Indirect costs are associated with the activities of the Company’s
      personnel who assist in connecting and activating the new service and consist
      of
      compensation and indirect costs associated with these support functions.
      Indirect costs primarily include employee benefits and payroll taxes, direct
      variable costs associated with capitalizable activities, consisting primarily
      of
      installation and construction vehicle costs, the cost of dispatch personnel
      and
      indirect costs directly attributable to capitalizable activities. The costs
      of
      disconnecting service at a customer’s dwelling or reconnecting service to a
      previously installed dwelling are charged to operating expense in the period
      incurred. Costs for repairs and maintenance are charged to operating expense
      as
      incurred, while plant and equipment replacement and betterments, including
      replacement of cable drops from the pole to the dwelling, are capitalized.

Depreciation
      is recorded using the straight-line composite method over management’s estimate
      of the useful lives of the related assets as follows:

Asset
        Retirement Obligations

Certain
        of our franchise agreements and leases contain provisions requiring us to
        restore facilities or remove equipment in the event that the franchise or
        lease
        agreement is not renewed. We expect to continually renew our franchise
        agreements and have concluded that substantially all of the related franchise
        rights are indefinite lived intangible assets. Accordingly, the possibility
        is
        remote that we would be required to incur significant restoration or removal
        costs related to these franchise agreements in the foreseeable future. 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 143,

Accounting for
        Asset Retirement Obligations

," as interpreted by FIN No. 47,

Accounting
        for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations - an Interpretation of FASB
        Statement No. 143

, requires that a liability be recognized for an asset
        retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable
        estimate of fair value can be made. We have not recorded an estimate for
        potential franchise related obligations but would record an estimated liability
        in the unlikely event a franchise agreement containing such a provision were
        no
        longer expected to be renewed. We also expect to renew many of our lease
        agreements related to the continued operation of our cable business in the
        franchise areas. For our lease agreements, the liabilities related to the
        removal provisions, where applicable, have been recorded and are not significant
        to the financial statements.

Franchises

Franchise
      rights represent the value attributed to agreements with local authorities
      that
      allow access to homes in cable service areas acquired through the purchase
      of
      cable systems. Management estimates the fair value of franchise rights at the
      date of acquisition and determines if the franchise has a finite life or an
      indefinite-life as defined by SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill
      and Other Intangible Assets

.
      All
      franchises that qualify for indefinite-life treatment under SFAS No. 142
      are no longer amortized against earnings but instead are tested for impairment
      annually as of October 1, or more frequently as warranted by events or
      changes in circumstances (see Note 7). The Company concluded that 99% of its
      franchises qualify for indefinite-life treatment; however, certain franchises
      did not qualify for indefinite-life treatment due to technological or
      operational factors that limit their lives. These franchise costs are amortized
      on a straight-line basis over 10 years. Costs incurred in renewing cable
      franchises are deferred and amortized over 10 years.

Other
      Noncurrent Assets

Other
      noncurrent assets primarily include deferred financing costs, governmental
      securities, investments in equity securities and goodwill. Costs related to
      borrowings are deferred and amortized to interest expense over the terms of
      the
      related borrowings.

Investments
      in equity securities are accounted for at cost, under the equity method of
      accounting or in accordance with SFAS No. 115,

Accounting
      for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

.
      Charter
      recognizes losses for any decline in value considered to be other than
      temporary. Certain marketable equity securities are classified as
      available-for-sale and reported at market value with unrealized gains and losses
      recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss.

The
      following summarizes investment information as of and for the years ended
      December 31, 2005 and 2004:

The
      gain
      on equity investments, under the equity method for the year ended December
      31,
      2005 primarily represents a gain realized on an exchange of the Company’s
      interest in an equity investee for an investment in a larger enterprise. Such
      amounts are included in other, net in the statements of operations.

As
      required by the indentures to the Company’s 5.875% convertible senior notes
      issued in November 2004, the Company purchased U.S. government securities valued
      at approximately $144 million with maturities corresponding to the interest
      payment dates for the convertible senior notes. These securities were pledged
      and are held in escrow to provide payment in full for the first six interest
      payments of the convertible senior notes (see Note 9), two of which were funded
      in 2005. These securities are accounted for as held-to-maturity securities.
      At
      December 31, 2005, the carrying value and fair value of the securities was
      approximately $98 million and $97 million, respectively, with approximately
      $50
      million recorded in prepaid and other assets and approximately $48 million
      recorded in other assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.

Valuation
      of Property, Plant and Equipment

The
      Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and used
      for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
      carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable using asset groupings
      consistent with those used to evaluate franchises.  Such events or changes
      in circumstances could include such factors as impairment of the Company’s
      indefinite life franchise under SFAS No. 142, changes in technological advances,
      fluctuations in the fair value of such assets, adverse changes in relationships
      with local franchise authorities, adverse changes in market conditions or a
      deterioration of operating results. If a review indicates that the carrying
      value of such asset is not recoverable from estimated undiscounted cash flows,
      the carrying value of such asset is reduced to its estimated fair value. While
      the Company believes that its estimates of future cash flows are reasonable,
      different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect its
      evaluations of asset recoverability. No impairments of long-lived assets to
      be
      held and used were recorded in 2005, 2004 and 2003, however, approximately
      $39
      million of impairment on assets held for sale was recorded for the year ended
      December 31, 2005 (see Note 4).

Derivative
      Financial Instruments

The
      Company accounts for derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS
      No. 133,

Accounting
      for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

,
      as
      amended. For those instruments which qualify as hedging activities, related
      gains or losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. For
      all
      other derivative instruments, the related gains or losses are recorded in the
      income statement. The Company uses interest rate risk

management
      derivative instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements, interest rate
      cap
      agreements and interest rate collar agreements (collectively referred to herein
      as interest rate agreements) as required under the terms of the credit
      facilities of the Company’s subsidiaries. The Company’s policy is to manage
      interest costs using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt. Using interest
      rate
      swap agreements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the
      difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference
      to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. Interest rate cap agreements are
      used to lock in a maximum interest rate should variable rates rise, but enable
      the Company to otherwise pay lower market rates. Interest rate collar agreements
      are used to limit exposure to and benefits from interest rate fluctuations
      on
      variable rate debt to within a certain range of rates. The Company does not
      hold
      or issue any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

Certain
      provisions of the Company’s 5.875% convertible senior notes issued in November
      2004 were considered embedded derivatives for accounting purposes and were
      required to be separately accounted for from the convertible senior notes.
      In
      accordance with SFAS No. 133, these derivatives are marked to market with gains
      or losses recorded in interest expense on the Company’s consolidated statement
      of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company
      recognized $29 million in gains and $1 million in losses, respectively, related
      to these derivatives. The gains resulted in a reduction of interest expense
      while the losses resulted in an increase in interest expense related to these
      derivatives. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, $1 million and $10 million,
      respectively, is recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses relating
      to
      the short-term portion of these derivatives and $1 million and $21 million,
      respectively, is recorded in other long-term liabilities related to the
      long-term portion.

Revenue
      Recognition

Revenues
      from residential and commercial video, high-speed Internet and telephone
      services are recognized when the related services are provided. Advertising
      sales are recognized at estimated realizable values in the period that the
      advertisements are broadcast. Local governmental authorities impose franchise
      fees on the Company ranging up to a federally mandated maximum of 5% of gross
      revenues as defined in the franchise agreement. Such fees are collected on
      a
      monthly basis from the Company’s customers and are periodically remitted to
      local franchise authorities. Franchise fees are reported as revenues on a gross
      basis with a corresponding operating expense

.

Programming
      Costs

The
      Company has various contracts to obtain analog, digital and premium video
      programming from program suppliers whose compensation is typically based on
      a
      flat fee per customer. The cost of the right to exhibit network programming
      under such arrangements is recorded in operating expenses in the month the
      programming is available for exhibition. Programming costs are paid each month
      based on calculations performed by the Company and are subject to periodic
      audits performed by the programmers. Certain programming contracts contain
      launch incentives to be paid by the programmers. The Company receives these
      payments related to the activation of the programmer’s cable television channel
      and recognizes the launch incentives on a straight-line basis over the life
      of
      the programming agreement as a reduction of programming expense. This offset
      to
      programming expense was $42 million, $62 million and $64 million for the years
      ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Programming costs included
      in the accompanying statement of operations were $1.4 billion, $1.3 billion
      and
      $1.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
      respectively. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the deferred amount of
      launch incentives, included in other long-term liabilities, were $83 million
      and
      $105 million, respectively.

Advertising
      Costs

Advertising
      costs associated with marketing the Company’s products and services are
      generally expensed as costs are incurred. Such advertising expense was $97
      million, $72 million and $62 million for the years ended December 31, 2005,
      2004 and 2003, respectively.

Stock-Based
      Compensation

The
      Company has historically accounted for stock-based compensation in accordance
      with Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25,

Accounting
      for Stock Issued to Employees

,
      and
      related interpretations, as permitted by SFAS No. 123,

Accounting
      for Stock-Based Compensation

.
      On
      January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the fair value measurement provisions
      of SFAS No. 123 using the prospective method under which the Company will
      recognize compensation expense of a stock-based award to an employee over the
      vesting period based on the fair value of the award on the grant date consistent
      with the method described in Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation
      ("FIN") No. 28,

Accounting
      for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award
      Plans

.
      Adoption of these provisions resulted in utilizing a preferable accounting
      method as the consolidated financial statements will present the estimated
      fair
      value of stock-based compensation in expense consistently with other forms
      of
      compensation and other expense associated with goods and services received
      for
      equity instruments. In accordance with SFAS No. 148,

Accounting
      for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure,

the
      fair
      value method was applied only to awards granted or modified after
      January 1, 2003, whereas awards granted prior to such date were accounted
      for under APB No. 25, unless they were modified or settled in cash.

SFAS
      No. 123 requires pro forma disclosure of the impact on earnings as if the
      compensation expense for these plans had been determined using the fair value
      method. The following table presents the Company’s net loss and loss per share
      as reported and the pro forma amounts that would have been reported using the
      fair value method under SFAS No. 123 for the years presented:

The

      were used for grants during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
      respectively: risk-free interest rates of 4.0%, 3.3%, and 3.0%; expected
      volatility of 70.9%, 92.4% and 93.6%; and expected lives of 4.5 years, 4.6
      years
      and 4.5 years, respectively. The valuations assume no dividends are paid.

Unfavorable
      Contracts and Other Settlements

The
      Company recognized $5 million of benefit for the year ended December 31, 2004
      related to changes in estimated legal reserves established as part of previous
      business combinations, which, based on an evaluation of current facts and
      circumstances, are no longer required.

The
      Company recognized $72 million of benefit for the year ended December 31, 2003
      as a result of the settlement of estimated liabilities recorded in connection
      with prior business combinations. The majority of this benefit (approximately
      $52 million) is due to the renegotiation of a major programming contract, for
      which a liability had been recorded for the above market portion of the
      agreement in conjunction with the Falcon acquisition in 1999 and

the
      Bresnan acquisition in 2000. The remaining benefit relates to the reversal
      of
      previously recorded liabilities, which are no longer required.

Income
      Taxes

The
      Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences
      between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company’s assets
      and liabilities and expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss
      carryforwards. The impact on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates and tax
      law,
      if any, applied to the years during which temporary differences are expected
      to
      be settled, are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period
      of enactment (see Note 24).

Minority
      Interest

Minority
      interest on the consolidated balance sheets primarily represents preferred
      membership interests in an indirect subsidiary of Charter held by Mr. Paul
      G.
      Allen. Minority interest totaled $188 million and $648 million as of
      December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, on the accompanying consolidated
      balance sheets.

Reported
      losses allocated to minority interest on the statement of operations reflect
      the
      minority interests in CC VIII and Charter Holdco. Because minority interest
      in
      Charter Holdco was substantially eliminated at December 31, 2003, beginning
      in
      2004, Charter began to absorb substantially all future losses before income
      taxes that otherwise would have been allocated to minority interest (see Note
      11).

Loss
      per Common Share

Basic
      loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss applicable to common
      stock by 310,159,047 shares, 300,291,877 shares and 294,597,519 shares for
      the
      years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, representing the weighted-average
      common shares outstanding during the respective periods. Diluted loss per common
      share equals basic loss per common share for the periods presented, as the
      effect of stock options and other convertible securities are antidilutive
      because the Company incurred net losses. All membership units of Charter Holdco
      are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into common stock of Charter at the
      option of the holders. As of December 31, 2005, Charter Holdco has 755,386,702
      membership units outstanding. Should the holders exchange units for shares,
      the
      effect would not be dilutive because the Company incurred net losses.

The
      94.9
      million shares issued in November 2005 and July 2005 pursuant to the share
      lending agreement described in Note 14 are required to be returned, in
      accordance with the contractual arrangement, and are treated in basic and
      diluted earnings per share as if they were already returned and retired.
      Consequently, there is no impact of the shares of common stock lent under the
      share lending agreement in the earnings per share calculation.

Segments

SFAS
      No. 131,

Disclosure
      about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information

,
      established standards for reporting information about operating segments in
      annual financial statements and in interim financial reports issued to
      shareholders. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise
      about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated on
      a
      regular basis by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group,
      in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing
      performance of the segment.

The
      Company’s operations are managed on the basis of geographic divisional operating
      segments. The Company has evaluated the criteria for aggregation of the
      geographic operating segments under paragraph 17 of SFAS No. 131 and
      believes it meets each of the respective criteria set forth. The Company
      delivers similar products and services within each of its geographic divisional
      operations. Each geographic and divisional service area utilizes similar means
      for delivering the programming of the Company’s services; have similarity in the
      type or class of customer receiving the products and services; distributes
      the
      Company’s services over a unified network; and operates within a consistent
      regulatory environment. In addition, each of the geographic divisional
      operating

      has similar economic characteristics. In light of the Company’s similar
      services, means for delivery, similarity in type of customers, the use of a
      unified network and other considerations across its geographic divisional
      operating structure, management has determined that the Company has one
      reportable segment, broadband services.

Sale
      of Assets

In
      2005,
      the Company closed the sale of certain cable systems in Texas, West Virginia
      and
      Nebraska, representing a total of approximately 33,000 analog video customers.
      During the year ended December 31, 2005, those cable systems met the criteria
      for assets held for sale under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
      ("SFAS") No. 144,

Accounting
      for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

.
      As
      such, the assets were written down to fair value less estimated costs to sell
      resulting in asset impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2005
      of
      approximately $39 million.

In
      2004,
      the Company closed the sale of certain cable systems in Florida, Pennsylvania,
      Maryland, Delaware, New York and West Virginia to Atlantic Broadband Finance,
      LLC. These transactions resulted in a $106 million gain recorded as a gain
      on
      sale of assets in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. The total
      net proceeds from the sale of all of these systems were approximately $735
      million. The proceeds were used to repay a portion of amounts outstanding under
      the Company’s revolving credit facility.

Franchises
      and Goodwill

Franchise
      rights represent the value attributed to agreements with local authorities
      that
      allow access to homes in cable service areas acquired through the purchase
      of
      cable systems. Management estimates the fair value of franchise rights at the
      date of acquisition and determines if the franchise has a finite life or an
      indefinite-life as defined by SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill
      and Other Intangible Assets

.
      Franchises that qualify for indefinite-life treatment under SFAS No. 142 are
      tested for impairment annually each October 1 based on valuations, or more
      frequently as warranted by events or changes in circumstances. Such test
      resulted in a total franchise impairment of approximately $3.3 billion during
      the third quarter of 2004. The 2003 and 2005 annual impairment tests resulted
      in
      no impairment. Franchises are aggregated into essentially inseparable asset
      groups to conduct the valuations. The asset groups generally represent
      geographic clustering of the Company’s cable systems into groups by which such
      systems are managed. Management believes such grouping represents the highest
      and best use of those assets.

The
      Company’s valuations, which are based on the present value of projected after
      tax cash flows, result in a value of property, plant and equipment, franchises,
      customer relationships and its total entity value. The value of goodwill is
      the
      difference between the total entity value and amounts assigned to the other
      assets.

Franchises,
      for valuation purposes, are defined as the future economic benefits of the
      right
      to solicit and service potential customers (customer marketing rights), and
      the
      right to deploy and market new services such as interactivity and telephone
      to
      the potential customers (service marketing rights). Fair value is determined
      based on estimated discounted future cash flows using assumptions consistent
      with internal forecasts. The franchise after-tax cash flow is calculated as
      the
      after-tax cash flow generated by the potential customers obtained and the new
      services added to those customers in future periods. The sum of the present
      value of the franchises' after-tax cash flow in years 1 through 10 and the
      continuing value of the after-tax cash flow beyond year 10 yields the fair
      value
      of the franchise.

The
      Company follows the guidance of Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue 02-17,

Recognition
      of Customer Relationship Intangible Assets Acquired in a Business Combination,

in
      valuing customer relationships. Customer relationships, for valuation purposes,
      represent the value of the business relationship with existing customers and
      are
      calculated by projecting future after-tax cash flows from these customers
      including the right to deploy and market additional services such as
      interactivity and telephone to these customers. The present value of these
      after-tax cash flows yields the fair value of the customer relationships.
      Substantially all acquisitions occurred prior to January 1, 2002. The Company
      did not record any value associated with the customer relationship intangibles
      related to those acquisitions. For acquisitions subsequent to January 1, 2002
      the Company did assign a value to the customer relationship intangible, which
      is
      amortized over its estimated useful life.

In
      September 2004, the SEC staff issued EITF Topic D-108 which requires the direct
      method of separately valuing all intangible assets and does not permit goodwill
      to be included in franchise assets. The Company adopted Topic D-108 in its
      impairment assessment as of September 30, 2004 that resulted in a total
      franchise impairment of approximately $3.3 billion. The Company recorded a
      cumulative effect of accounting change of $765 million (approximately $875
      million before tax effects of $91 million and minority interest effects of
      $19
      million) for the year ended December 31, 2004 representing the portion of the
      Company's total franchise impairment attributable to no longer including
      goodwill with franchise assets. The effect of the adoption was to increase
      net
      loss and loss per share by $765 million and $2.55, respectively, for the year
      ended December 31, 2004. The remaining $2.4 billion of the total franchise
      impairment was attributable to the use of lower projected growth rates and
      the
      resulting revised estimates of future cash flows in the Company's valuation,
      and
      was recorded as impairment of franchises in the Company's accompanying
      consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004.
      Sustained analog video customer losses by the Company in the third quarter
      of
      2004 primarily as a result of increased competition from direct broadcast
      satellite providers and decreased growth rates in the Company's high-speed
      Internet customers in the third quarter of 2004, in part, as a result of
      increased competition from digital subscriber line service providers led to
      the
      lower projected growth rates and the revised estimates of future cash flows
      from
      those used at October 1, 2003.

      years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the net carrying amount of
      indefinite-lived franchises was reduced by $52 million and $490 million,
      respectively, related to the sale of cable systems (see Note 4). Additionally,
      in 2004 and 2005, approximately $37 million and $13 million, respectively,
      of
      franchises that were previously classified as finite-lived were reclassified
      to
      indefinite-lived, based on the Company’s renewal of these franchise assets in
      2004 and 2005. Franchise amortization expense for the years ended
      December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $4 million, $4 million and $9 million,
      respectively, which represents the amortization relating to franchises that
      did
      not qualify for indefinite-life treatment under SFAS No. 142, including
      costs associated with franchise renewals. The Company expects that amortization
      expense on franchise assets will be approximately $2 million annually for each
      of the next five years. Actual amortization expense in future periods could
      differ from these estimates as a result of new intangible asset acquisitions
      or
      divestitures, changes in useful lives and other relevant factors.

The

        of the

        to

        issued in exchange for Charter Holdings notes and the CCH I notes issued
        in
        exchange for the 8.625% Charter Holdings notes due 2009 are recorded at the
        historical book values of the Charter Holdings notes for financial reporting
        purposes as opposed to the current accreted value for legal purposes and
        notes
        indenture purposes (the amount that is currently payable if the debt becomes
        immediately due). As of December 31, 2005, the accreted value of the Company’s
        debt for legal purposes and notes indenture purposes is $18.8
        billion.

On
      January 30, 2006, CCH II and CCH II Capital Corp. issued $450 million in debt
      securities, the proceeds of which will be provided, directly or indirectly,
      to
      Charter Operating, which will use such funds to reduce borrowings, but not
      commitments, under the revolving portion of its credit facilities.

In
      October 2005, CCO Holdings and CCO Holdings Capital Corp., as guarantor
      thereunder, entered into the Bridge Loan with the Lenders whereby the Lenders
      committed to make loans to CCO Holdings in an aggregate amount of $600 million.
      Upon the issuance of $450 million of CCH II notes discussed above, the
      commitment under the bridge loan agreement was reduced to $435 million. CCO
      Holdings may draw upon the facility between January 2, 2006 and September 29,
      2006 and the loans will mature on the sixth anniversary of the first borrowing
      under the bridge loan. Each loan will accrue interest at a rate equal to an
      adjusted LIBOR rate plus a spread. The spread will initially be 450 basis points
      and will increase (a) by an additional 25 basis points at the end of the
      six-month period following the date of the first borrowing, (b) by an additional
      25 basis points at the end of each of the next two subsequent three month
      periods and (c) by 62.5 basis points at the end of each of the next two
      subsequent three-month periods. CCO Holdings will be required to prepay loans
      from the net proceeds from (i) the issuance of equity or incurrence of debt
      by
      Charter and its subsidiaries, with certain exceptions, and (ii) certain asset
      sales (to the extent not used for other purposes permitted under the bridge
      loan).

In
      August
      2005, CCO Holdings issued $300 million in debt securities, the proceeds of
      which
      were used for general corporate purposes, including the payment of distributions
      to its parent companies, including Charter Holdings, to pay interest expense.

Gain
      on Extinguishment of Debt

In
      September 2005, Charter Holdings and its wholly owned subsidiaries, CCH I and
      CIH, completed the exchange of approximately $6.8 billion total principal amount
      of outstanding debt securities of Charter Holdings in a private placement for
      new debt securities. Holders of Charter Holdings notes due in 2009 and 2010
      exchanged $3.4 billion principal amount of notes for $2.9 billion principal
      amount of new 11% CCH I senior secured notes due 2015. Holders of Charter
      Holdings notes due 2011 and 2012 exchanged $845 million principal amount of
      notes for $662 million principal amount of 11% CCH I notes due 2015. In
      addition, holders of Charter Holdings notes due 2011 and 2012 exchanged $2.5
      billion principal amount of notes for $2.5 billion principal amount of various
      series of new CIH notes. Each series of new CIH notes has the same interest
      rate
      and provisions for payment of cash interest as the series of old Charter
      Holdings notes for which such CIH notes were exchanged. In addition, the
      maturities for each series were extended three years. The exchanges resulted
      in
      a net gain on extinguishment of debt of approximately $490 million for the
      year
      ended December 31, 2005.

In
      March
      and June 2005, Charter Operating consummated exchange transactions with a small
      number of institutional holders of Charter Holdings 8.25% senior notes due
      pursuant to which Charter Operating issued, in private placements, approximately
      $333 million principal amount of new notes with terms identical to Charter
      Operating's 8.375% senior second lien notes due 2014 in exchange for
      approximately $346 million of the Charter Holdings 8.25% senior notes due 2007.
      The exchanges resulted in a net gain on extinguishment of debt of approximately
      $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The Charter Holdings notes
      received in the exchange were thereafter distributed to Charter Holdings and
      cancelled.

During
      the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company repurchased, in private
      transactions, from a small number of institutional holders, a total of $136
      million principal amount of its 4.75% convertible senior notes due 2006.

(dollars

These
      transactions resulted in a net gain on extinguishment of debt of approximately
      $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005.

In
      March
      2005, Charter’s subsidiary, CC V Holdings, LLC, redeemed all of its 11.875%
      notes due 2008, at 103.958% of principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid
      interest to the date of redemption. The total cost of redemption was
      approximately $122 million and was funded through borrowings under the Charter
      Operating credit facilities. The redemption resulted in a loss on extinguishment
      of debt for the year ended December 31, 2005 of approximately $5 million.
      Following such redemption, CC V Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries (other than
      non-guarantor subsidiaries) guaranteed the Charter Operating credit facilities
      and granted a lien on all of their assets as to which a lien can be perfected
      under the Uniform Commercial Code by the filing of a financing
      statement.

On
      November 22, 2004, the Company issued $862.5 million original principal amount
      of 5.875% convertible senior notes due 2009, which are convertible into shares
      of Charter’s Class A common stock, par value $.001 per share, at a rate of
      413.2231 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (or approximately $2.42
      per
      share), subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. On December 23, 2004,
      the Company used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the notes to redeem
      all of its outstanding 5.75% convertible senior notes due 2005 (total principal
      amount of $588 million). The redemption resulted in a loss on extinguishment
      of
      debt of $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.

In
      April
      2004, Charter’s indirect subsidiaries, Charter Operating and Charter
      Communications Operating Capital Corp., sold $1.5 billion of senior second-lien
      notes in a private transaction. Additionally, Charter Operating amended and
      restated its $5.1 billion credit facilities, among other things, to defer
      maturities and increase availability under those facilities to approximately
      $6.5 billion, consisting of a $1.5 billion six-year revolving credit facility,
      a
      $2.0 billion six-year term loan facility and a $3.0 billion seven-year term
      loan
      facility. Charter Operating used the additional borrowings under the amended
      and
      restated credit facilities, together with proceeds from the sale of the Charter
      Operating senior second-lien notes to refinance the credit facilities of its
      subsidiaries, CC VI Operating Company, LLC ("CC VI Operating"), Falcon Cable
      Communications, LLC ("Falcon Cable"), and CC VIII Operating, LLC ("CC VIII
      Operating"), all in concurrent transactions. In addition, Charter Operating
      was
      substituted as the lender in place of the banks under those subsidiaries’ credit
      facilities. These transactions resulted in a net loss on extinguishment of
      debt
      of $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.

The
      Company recognized a loss of approximately $23 million recorded as loss on
      debt
      to equity conversion on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations
      for the year ended December 31, 2004 from privately negotiated exchanges of
      a
      total of $30 million principal amount of Charter’s 5.75% convertible senior
      notes for shares of Charter Class A common stock. The exchanges resulted in
      the
      issuance of more shares in the exchange transaction than would have been
      issuable under the original terms of the convertible senior notes.

In
      September 2003, Charter, Charter Holdings and their indirect subsidiary, CCH
      II
      purchased, in a non-monetary transaction, a total of

approximately

$609
      million principal amount of Charter’s outstanding convertible senior notes and

approximately

$1.3
      billion principal amount of the senior notes and senior discount notes issued
      by
      Charter Holdings from institutional investors in a small number of privately
      negotiated transactions. As consideration for these securities, CCH II issued

approximately

$1.6
      billion principal amount of 10.25% notes due 2010,

and
      realized approximately $294 million of debt discount

.
      CCH II
      also issued an additional $30 million principal amount of 10.25% notes for
      an
      equivalent amount of cash and used the proceeds for transaction costs and for
      general corporate purposes. This transaction resulted in a gain on
      extinguishment of debt of $267 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.
      See
      discussion of the CCH II notes below for more details.

4.75%
      Charter Convertible Notes.

In
      May
      2001, Charter issued 4.75% convertible senior notes with a total principal
      amount at maturity of $633 million. As of December 31, 2005, there was $20
      million in total principal amount of these notes outstanding. The 4.75% Charter
      convertible notes rank equally with any of Charter’s future unsubordinated and
      unsecured indebtedness, but are structurally subordinated to all existing and
      future indebtedness and other liabilities of Charter’s
      subsidiaries.

(dollars

The
      4.75%
      Charter convertible notes are convertible at the option of the holder into
      shares of Class A common stock at a conversion rate of 38.0952 shares per $1,000
      principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to a price of $26.25 per share,
      subject to certain adjustments. Specifically, the adjustments include
      anti-dilutive provisions, which automatically occur based on the occurrence
      of
      specified events to provide protection rights to holders of the notes.
      Additionally, Charter may adjust the conversion ratio under certain
      circumstances when deemed appropriate. These notes are redeemable at Charter’s
      option at amounts decreasing from 101.9% to 100% of the principal amount, plus
      accrued and unpaid interest beginning on June 4, 2004, to the date of
      redemption. Interest is payable semiannually on December 1 and June 1, until
      maturity on June 1, 2006.

Upon
      a
      change of control, subject to certain conditions and restrictions, Charter
      may
      be required to repurchase the notes, in whole or in part, at 100% of their
      principal amount plus accrued interest at the repurchase date.

5.875%
      Charter Convertible Notes

.

In
      November 2004, Charter issued 5.875% convertible senior notes due 2009 with
      a
      total original principal amount of $862.5 million. The 5.875% convertible senior
      notes are unsecured (except with respect to the collateral as described below)
      and rank equally with our existing and future unsubordinated and unsecured
      indebtedness (except with respect to the collateral described below), but are
      structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other
      liabilities of our subsidiaries. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears.
      As of December 31, 2005, there was $862.5 million in total principal amount
      outstanding and $843 million in accreted value outstanding.

The
      5.875% convertible senior notes are convertible at any time at the option of
      the
      holder into shares of Class A common stock at an initial conversion rate of
      413.2231 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to
      a
      conversion price of approximately $2.42 per share, subject to certain
      adjustments. Specifically, the adjustments include anti-dilutive provisions,
      which cause adjustments to occur automatically based on the occurrence of
      specified events to provide protection rights to holders of the notes. The
      conversion rate may also be increased (but not to exceed 462 shares per $1,000
      principal amount of notes) upon a specified change of control transaction.
      Additionally, Charter may elect to increase the conversion rate under certain
      circumstances when deemed appropriate and subject to applicable limitations
      of
      the NASDAQ stock market. Holders who convert their notes prior to November
      16,
      2007 will receive an early conversion make whole amount in respect of their
      notes based on a proportional share of the portfolio of pledged securities
      described below, with specified adjustments.

No
      holder
      of notes will be entitled to receive shares of our Class A common stock on
      conversion to the extent that receipt of the shares would cause the converting
      holder to become, directly or indirectly, a "beneficial holder" (within the
      meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
      promulgated thereunder) of more than 4.9% of the outstanding shares of our
      Class
      A common stock if such conversion would take place prior to November 16, 2008,
      or more than 9.9% thereafter.

If
      a
      holder tenders a note for conversion, we may direct that holder (unless we
      have
      called those notes for redemption) to a financial institution designated by
      us
      to conduct a transaction with that institution, on substantially the same terms
      that the holder would have received on conversion, but if any such financial
      institution does not accept such notes or does not deliver the required
      conversion consideration, we remain obligated to convert the notes.

Charter
        Holdco used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the notes to purchase
        a
        portfolio of U.S. government securities in an amount which we believe will
        be
        sufficient to make the first six interest payments on the notes. These
        government securities were pledged to us as security for a mirror note issued
        by
        Charter Holdco to Charter and pledged to the trustee under the indenture
        governing the notes as security for our obligations thereunder. Such securities
        are being used to fund the next four interest payments under the notes. The
        fair
        value of the pledged securities was $97 million at December 31, 2005.

Upon
      a
      change of control and certain other fundamental changes, subject to certain
      conditions and restrictions, Charter may be required to repurchase the notes,
      in
      whole or in part, at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued interest at
      the
      repurchase date.

      any

      period begins thereafter. Holders who convert notes that we have called for
      redemption shall receive, in addition to the early conversion make whole amount,

March
      1999 Charter Holdings Notes.

The
      March
      1999 Charter Holdings notes are general unsecured obligations of Charter
      Holdings and Charter Communications Capital Corporation ("Charter Capital").
      The
      March 1999 8.250% Charter Holdings notes mature on April 1, 2007, and as of

      Operating credit facilities.

Charter
      Holdings and Charter Capital will not have the right to redeem the March 1999
      8.250% Charter Holdings notes prior to their maturity on April 1, 2007. Charter
      Holdings and Charter Capital may redeem some or all of the March 1999 8.625%
      Charter Holdings notes and the March 1999 9.920% Charter Holdings notes at
      any
      time, in each case, at a premium. The optional redemption price declines to

      of the principal amount of March 1999 Charter Holdings notes redeemed, plus
      accrued and unpaid interest, if any, for redemption on or after April 1,
      2007.

In

      Holdings notes at 101% of their principal amount or accreted value, as
      applicable, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.

The
      indentures governing the March 1999 Charter Holdings notes contain restrictive
      covenants that limit certain transactions or activities by Charter Holdings
      and
      its restricted subsidiaries. Substantially all of Charter Holdings' direct
      and
      indirect subsidiaries are currently restricted subsidiaries.

      indebtedness under the Charter Operating credit facilities and related
      obligations were required to guarantee the Charter Operating notes. The note
      guarantee of each such guarantor is:

·

a
                senior obligation of such
                guarantor;

·

                to
                provisions in the Charter Operating indenture that permit interest
                and,
                subject to meeting the 4.25 to 1.0 leverage ratio test, principal

As
      a
      result of the above leverage ratio test being met, CCO Holdings and certain
      of
      its subsidiaries provided the additional guarantees described above during
      the
      first quarter of 2005.

All
      the
      subsidiaries of Charter Operating (except CCO NR Sub, LLC, and certain other
      subsidiaries that are not deemed material and are designated as nonrecourse
      subsidiaries under the Charter Operating credit facilities) are restricted
      subsidiaries of Charter Operating under the Charter Operating notes.
      Unrestricted subsidiaries generally will not be subject to the restrictive
      covenants in the Charter Operating indenture.

In
      the
      event of specified change of control events, Charter Operating must offer to
      purchase the Charter Operating notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the
      total principal amount of the Charter Operating notes repurchased plus any
      accrued and unpaid interest thereon.

The
      indenture governing the Charter Operating senior notes contains restrictive
      covenants that limit certain transactions or activities by Charter Operating
      and
      its restricted subsidiaries. Substantially all of Charter Operating’s direct and
      indirect subsidiaries are currently restricted subsidiaries.

Renaissance
      Notes.

In
      connection with the acquisition of Renaissance in April 1999, the Company
      assumed $163 million principal amount at maturity of 10.000% senior
      discount notes due 2008 of which $49 million was repurchased in May 1999.
      The Renaissance notes bear interest, payable semi-annually, on April 15 and
      October 15. The Renaissance notes are due on April 15, 2008. As of
      December 31, 2005, there was $114 million in total principal amount outstanding
      and $115 million in accreted value outstanding.

Charter
      Operating Credit Facilities

The
      Charter Operating credit facilities were amended and restated concurrently
      with
      the sale of $1.5 billion senior second-lien notes in April 2004, among other
      things, to defer maturities and increase availability under these facilities
      and
      to enable Charter Operating to acquire the interests of the lenders under the
      CC
      VI Operating, CC VIII Operating and Falcon credit facilities, thereby
      consolidating all credit facilities under one amended and restated Charter
      Operating credit agreement.

The
      Charter Operating credit facilities provide borrowing availability of up to
      $6.5
      billion as follows:

·

two
      term
      facilities:

(i)

a
                Term A facility with a total principal amount of $2.0 billion, of
                which
                12.5% matures in 2007, 30% matures in 2008, 37.5% matures in 2009
                and 20%
                matures in 2010; and

(ii)

a
                Term B facility with a total principal amount of $3.0 billion, which
                shall
                be repayable in 27 equal quarterly installments aggregating in each
                loan
                year to 1% of the original amount of the Term B facility, with the
                remaining balance due at final maturity in 2011;
                and

·

a
                revolving credit facility, in a total amount of $1.5 billion, with
                a
                maturity date in 2010.

Amounts
      outstanding under the Charter Operating credit facilities bear interest, at
      Charter Operating’s election, at a base rate or the Eurodollar rate (4.06% to
      4.50% as of December 31, 2005 and 2.07% to 2.28% as of December 31, 2004),
      as
      defined, plus a margin for Eurodollar loans of up to 3.00% for the Term A
      facility and revolving credit facility, and up to 3.25% for the Term B facility,
      and for base rate loans of up to 2.00% for the Term A facility and revolving
      credit facility, and up to 2.25% for the Term B facility. A quarterly commitment
      fee of up to .75% is payable on the average daily unborrowed balance of the
      revolving credit facilities.

The
      obligations of our subsidiaries under the Charter Operating credit facilities
      (the "Obligations") are guaranteed by Charter Operating’s immediate parent
      company, CCO Holdings, and the subsidiaries of Charter Operating, except for
      immaterial subsidiaries and subsidiaries precluded from guaranteeing by reason
      of the provisions of other indebtedness to which they are subject (the
      "non-guarantor subsidiaries," primarily Renaissance and its subsidiaries).
      The
      Obligations are also secured by (i) a lien on all of the assets of Charter
      Operating and its subsidiaries (other than assets of the non-guarantor
      subsidiaries), to the extent such lien can be perfected under the Uniform
      Commercial Code by the filing of a financing statement, and (ii) a pledge by
      CCO
      Holdings of the equity interests owned by it in Charter Operating or any of
      Charter Operating’s subsidiaries, as well as intercompany obligations owing to
      it by any of such entities.

Upon
      the
      Charter Holdings Leverage Ratio (as defined in the indenture governing the
      Charter Holdings senior notes and senior discount notes) being under 8.75 to
      1.0, the Charter Operating credit facilities required that the 11.875% notes
      due
      2008 issued by CC V Holdings, LLC be redeemed. Because such Leverage Ratio
      was
      determined to be under 8.75 to 1.0, CC V Holdings, LLC redeemed such notes
      in
      March 2005, and CC V Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries (other than
      non-guarantor subsidiaries) became guarantors of the Obligations and have
      granted a lien on all of their assets as to which a lien can be perfected under
      the Uniform Commercial Code by the filing of a financing statement.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, outstanding borrowings under the Charter Operating credit
      facilities were approximately $5.7 billion and the unused total potential
      availability was approximately $553 million, none of which was limited by
      covenant restrictions.

Charter
      Operating Credit Facilities — Restrictive Covenants

The
      Charter Operating credit facilities contain representations and warranties,
      and
      affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type. The
      financial covenants measure performance against standards set for leverage,
      debt
      service coverage, and interest coverage, tested as of the end of each quarter.

allowable
      leverage ratio is 4.25 to 1.0 until maturity, tested as of the end of each
      quarter beginning September 30, 2004. Additionally, the Charter Operating credit
      facilities contain provisions requiring mandatory loan prepayments under
      specific circumstances, including when significant amounts of assets are sold
      and the proceeds are not reinvested in assets useful in the business of the
      borrower within a specified period, and upon the incurrence of certain
      indebtedness when the ratio of senior first lien debt to operating cash flow
      is
      greater than 2.0 to 1.0.

The
      Charter Operating credit facilities permit Charter Operating and its
      subsidiaries to make distributions to pay interest on the Charter Operating
      senior second-lien notes, the CIH notes, the CCH I notes, the CCH II senior
      notes, the CCO Holdings senior notes, the Charter convertible senior notes,
      the
      CCHC notes and the Charter Holdings senior notes, provided that, among other
      things, no default has occurred and is continuing under the Charter Operating
      credit facilities. Conditions to future borrowings include absence of a default
      or an event of default under the Charter Operating credit facilities and the
      continued accuracy in all material respects of the representations and
      warranties, including the absence since December 31, 2003 of any event,
      development or circumstance that has had or could reasonably be expected to
      have
      a material adverse effect on our business.

The
      events of default under the Charter Operating credit facilities include, among
      other things:

CCO
      Holdings Bridge Loan

In
      October 2005, CCO Holdings and CCO Holdings Capital Corp., as guarantor
      thereunder, entered into the Bridge Loan) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Credit
      Suisse, Cayman Islands Branch and Deutsche Bank AG Cayman Islands Branch (the
      "Lenders") whereby the Lenders committed to make loans to CCO Holdings in an
      aggregate amount of $600 million. In January 2006, upon the issuance of $450
      million of CCH II notes discussed above, the commitment under the bridge loan
      agreement was reduced to $435 million. CCO Holdings may draw upon the facility
      between January 2, 2006 and September 29, 2006 and the loans will mature on
      the
      sixth anniversary of the first borrowing under the Bridge Loan.

Beginning
      on the first anniversary of the first date that CCO Holdings borrows under
      the
      Bridge Loan and at any time thereafter, any Lender will have the option to
      receive "exchange notes" (the terms of which are described below, the "Exchange
      Notes") in exchange for any loan that has not been repaid by that date. Upon
      the
      earlier of (x) the date that at least a majority of all loans that have been
      outstanding have been exchanged for Exchange Notes and

(y)
      the
      date that is 18 months after the first date that CCO Holdings borrows under
      the
      Bridge Loan, the remainder of loans will be automatically exchanged for Exchange
      Notes.

As
      conditions to each draw, (i) there shall be no default under the Bridge Loan,
      (ii) all the representations and warranties under the bridge loan shall be
      true
      and correct in all material respects and (iii) all conditions to borrowing
      under
      the Charter Operating credit facilities (with certain exceptions) shall be
      satisfied.

The
      aggregate unused commitment will be reduced by 100% of the net proceeds from
      certain asset sales, to the extent such net proceeds have not been used to
      prepay loans or Exchange Notes. However, asset sales that generate net proceeds
      of less than $75 million will not be subject to such commitment reduction
      obligation, unless the aggregate net proceeds from such asset sales exceed
      $200
      million, in which case the aggregate unused commitment will be reduced by the
      amount of such excess.

CCO
      Holdings will be required to prepay loans (and redeem or offer to repurchase
      Exchange Notes, if issued) from the net proceeds from (i) the issuance of equity
      or incurrence of debt by Charter and its subsidiaries, with certain exceptions,
      and (ii) certain asset sales (to the extent not used for purposes permitted
      under the bridge loan).

The
      covenants and events of default applicable to CCO Holdings under the Bridge
      Loan
      are similar to the covenants and events of default in the indenture for the
      senior secured notes of CCH I.

The
      Exchange Notes will mature on the sixth anniversary of the first borrowing
      under
      the Bridge Loan. The Exchange Notes will bear interest at a rate equal to the
      rate that would have been borne by the loans. The same mandatory redemption
      provisions will apply to the Exchange Notes as applied to the loans, except
      that
      CCO Holdings will be required to make an offer to redeem upon the occurrence
      of
      a change of control at 101% of principal amount plus accrued and unpaid
      interest.

The
      Exchange Notes will, if held by a person other than an initial lender or an
      affiliate thereof, be (a) non-callable for the first three years after the
      first
      borrowing date and (b) thereafter, callable at par plus accrued interest plus
      a
      premium equal to 50% of the coupon in effect on the first anniversary of the
      first borrowing date, which premium shall decline to 25% of such coupon in
      the
      fourth year and to zero thereafter. Otherwise, the Exchange Notes will be
      callable at any time at 100% of the amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid
      interest.

Based
      upon outstanding indebtedness as of December 31, 2005, the amortization of
      term
      loans, scheduled reductions in available borrowings of the revolving credit
      facilities, and the maturity dates for all senior and subordinated notes and
      debentures, total future principal payments on the total borrowings under all
      debt agreements as of December 31, 2005, are as follows:

For
      the
      amounts of debt scheduled to mature during 2006, it is management’s intent to
      fund the repayments from borrowings on the Company’s revolving credit facility.
      The accompanying consolidated balance sheet reflects this intent by presenting
      all debt balances as long-term while the table above reflects actual debt
      maturities as of the stated date.

Note
                Payable - Related Party

CCHC,
      LLC Note

In
      October 2005, Charter, acting through a Special Committee of Charter’s Board of
      Directors, and Mr. Allen, settled a dispute that had arisen between the parties
      with regard to the ownership of CC VIII. As part of that settlement, CCHC issued
      a subordinated exchangeable note (the "CCHC Note") to

Charter
      Investment, Inc. ("CII")

.
      The
      CCHC Note has a 15-year maturity. The CCHC Note has an initial accreted value
      of
      $48 million accreting at 14% compounded quarterly, except that from and after
      February 28, 2009, CCHC may pay any increase in the accreted value of the CCHC
      Note in cash and the accreted value of the CCHC Note will not increase to the
      extent such amount is paid in cash. The CCHC Note is exchangeable at CII’s
      option, at any time, for Charter Holdco Class A Common units at a rate equal
      to
      the then accreted value, divided by $2.00 (the "Exchange Rate"). Customary
      anti-dilution protections have been provided that could cause future changes
      to
      the Exchange Rate. Additionally, the Charter Holdco Class A Common units
      received will be exchangeable by the holder into Charter common stock in
      accordance with existing agreements between CII, Charter and certain other
      parties signatory thereto. Beginning February 28, 2009, if the closing price
      of
      Charter common stock is at or above the Exchange Rate for a certain period
      of
      time as specified in the Exchange Agreement, Charter Holdco may require the
      exchange of the CCHC Note for Charter Holdco Class A Common units at the
      Exchange Rate.  Additionally, CCHC has the right to redeem the CCHC Note
      under certain circumstances for cash in an amount equal to the then accreted
      value, such amount, if redeemed prior to February 28, 2009, would also include
      a
      make whole up to the accreted value through February 28, 2009. CCHC must redeem
      the CCHC Note at its maturity for cash in an amount equal to the initial stated
      value plus the accreted return through maturity. The accreted value of the
      CCHC
      Note as of December 31, 2005 is $49 million.

Minority
      Interest and Equity Interest of Charter Holdco

Charter
      is a holding company whose primary assets are a controlling equity interest
      in
      Charter Holdco, the indirect owner of the Company’s cable systems, and $863
      million and $990 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, of mirror
      notes that are payable by Charter Holdco to Charter and have the same principal
      amount and terms as those of Charter’s convertible senior notes. Minority
      interest on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2005
      and 2004 primarily represents preferred membership interests in CC VIII, LLC
      ("CC VIII"), an indirect subsidiary of Charter Holdco, of $188 million and
      $656
      million, respectively. As more fully described in Note 25, this preferred
      interest arises from the approximately $630 million of preferred membership
      units issued by CC VIII in connection with an acquisition in February 2000
      and
      was the subject of a dispute between Charter and Mr. Allen, Charter’s Chairman
      and controlling shareholder that was settled October 31, 2005. In conjunction
      with the settlement, the Company adjusted minority interest for $467 million,
      of
      which $418 million was reclassified from minority interest to equity in the
      fourth quarter of 2005. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2005, approximately
      5.6% of CC VIII’s income is allocated to minority interest.

Minority
      interest historically included the portion of Charter Holdco’s member’s equity
      not owned by Charter. However, members’ deficit of Charter Holdco was $4.8
      billion, $4.4 billion and $57 million as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
      respectively, thus minority interest in Charter Holdco has been eliminated.
      Minority interest was 52%, 53% and 54% as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
      respectively. Reported losses allocated to minority interest on the consolidated
      statement of operations are limited to the extent of any remaining minority
      interest on the balance sheet related to Charter Holdco. Additionally, minority
      interest includes the proportionate share of changes in fair value of interest
      rate risk derivative agreements. Such amounts are temporary as they are
      contractually scheduled to reverse over the life of the underlying instrument.
      Because minority interest in Charter Holdco was substantially eliminated at
      December 31, 2003, beginning in 2004, the Company began to absorb substantially
      all losses before income taxes that otherwise would have been allocated to
      minority interest. This resulted in an additional $454 million and $2.4 billion
      of net loss for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Subject
      to any changes in Charter Holdco’s capital structure, future losses will
      continue to be absorbed by Charter. Changes to minority interest consist of
      the
      following for the periods presented:

Preferred
      Stock - Redeemable

On
      August 31, 2001, in connection with its acquisition of Cable USA, Inc. and
      certain cable system assets from affiliates of Cable USA, Inc., the Company
      issued 505,664 shares of Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock
      (the "Preferred Stock") valued at and with a liquidation preference of
      $51 million. Holders of the Preferred Stock have no voting rights but are
      entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends at an annual rate of 5.75%,
      payable quarterly. If for any reason Charter fails to pay the dividends on
      the
      Preferred Stock on a timely basis, the dividend rate on each share increases
      to
      an annual rate of 7.75% until the payment is made. The Preferred Stock is
      redeemable by Charter at its option on or after August 31, 2004 and must be
      redeemed by Charter at any time upon a change of control, or if not previously
      redeemed or converted, on August 31, 2008. The Preferred Stock is
      convertible, in whole or in part, at the option of the holders from
      April 1, 2002 through August 31, 2008, into shares of common stock at
      an initial conversion rate equal to a conversion price of $24.71 per share
      of
      common stock, subject to certain customary adjustments. The redemption price
      per
      share of Preferred Stock is the Liquidation Preference of $100, subject to
      certain customary adjustments. In the first quarter of 2003, the Company issued
      39,595 additional shares of preferred stock valued at and with a liquidation
      preference of $4 million.

In
      November 2005, Charter repurchased 508,546 shares of its Series A Convertible
      Redeemable Preferred Stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately
      $31
      million (or $60 per share). The shares had liquidation preference of
      approximately $51 million and had accrued but unpaid dividends of approximately
      $3 million resulting in a gain of approximately $23 million recorded in gain
      (loss) on extinguishment of debt and preferred stock. Following the repurchase,
      36,713 shares of preferred stock remained outstanding.

In
      connection with the repurchase, the holders of Preferred Stock consented to
      an
      amendment to the Certificate of Designation governing the Preferred Stock that
      will eliminate the quarterly dividends on all of the outstanding Preferred
      Stock
      and will provide that the liquidation preference for the remaining shares
      outstanding will be $105.4063 per share, which amount shall accrete from
      September 30, 2005 at an annual rate of 7.75%, compounded quarterly. Certain
      holders of Preferred Stock also released Charter from various threatened claims
      relating to their acquisition and ownership of the Preferred Stock, including
      threatened claims for breach of contract.

Common
      Stock

The
      Company's Class A common stock and Class B common stock are identical except
      with respect to certain voting, transfer and conversion rights. Holders of
      Class
      A common stock are entitled to one vote per share and holder of Class B common
      stock is entitled to ten votes for each share of Class B common stock held
      and
      for each Charter Holdco membership unit held. The Class B common stock is
      subject to significant transfer restrictions and is convertible on a share
      for
      share basis into Class A common stock at the option of the holder. Charter
      Holdco membership units are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis for shares
      of
      Class A common stock.

Share
      Lending Agreement

In
      2005,
      Charter issued 94.9 million shares of Class A common stock in a public
      offering, which was effected pursuant to an effective registration statement
      that initially covered the issuance and sale of up to 150 million shares of
      Class A common stock. The shares were issued pursuant to the share lending
      agreement, pursuant to which Charter had previously agreed to loan up to
      150 million shares to Citigroup Global Markets Limited ("CGML"). Because
      less than the full 150 million shares covered by the share lending
      agreement were sold in the offering, Charter as of December 31, 2005 was
      obligated to issue, at CGML’s request, up to an additional 55.1 million
      loaned shares in subsequent registered public offerings pursuant to the share
      lending agreement. In February 2006, an additional 22.0 million shares were
      issued under the share lending agreement.

This
      offering of Charter’s Class A common stock was conducted to facilitate
      transactions by which investors in Charter’s 5.875% convertible senior notes due
      2009, issued on November 22, 2004, hedged their investments in the
      convertible senior notes. Charter did not receive any of the proceeds from
      the
      sale of this Class A common stock. However, under the share lending
      agreement, Charter received a loan fee of $.001 for each share that it lends
      to
      CGML.

The
      issuance of up to a total of 150 million shares of common stock (of which 94.9
      million were issued in 2005) pursuant to a share lending agreement executed
      by
      Charter in connection with the issuance of the 5.875% convertible senior notes
      in November 2004 is essentially analogous to a sale of shares coupled with
      a
      forward contract for the reacquisition of the shares at a future date. An
      instrument that requires physical settlement by repurchase of a fixed number
      of
      shares in exchange for cash is considered a forward purchase instrument. While
      the share lending agreement does not require a cash payment upon return of
      the
      shares, physical settlement is required (i.e., the shares borrowed must be
      returned at the end of the arrangement.) The fair value of the 94.9 million
      shares lent in 2005 is approximately $116 million as of December 31, 2005.
      However, the net effect on shareholders’ deficit of the shares lent in July
      pursuant to the share lending agreement, which includes Charter’s requirement to
      lend the shares and the counterparties’ requirement to return the shares, is de
      minimis and represents the cash received upon lending of the shares and is
      equal
      to the par value of the common stock to be issued.

Comprehensive
      Loss

Certain
      marketable equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported
      at market value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as accumulated other
      comprehensive loss on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
      Additionally, the Company reports changes in the fair value of interest rate
      agreements designated as hedging the variability of cash flows associated with
      floating-rate debt obligations, that meet the effectiveness criteria of SFAS

      million, respectively.

Accounting
      for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

The
      Company uses interest rate risk management derivative instruments, such as
      interest rate swap agreements and interest rate collar agreements (collectively
      referred to herein as interest rate agreements) to manage its interest costs.
      The Company’s policy is to manage interest costs using a mix of fixed and
      variable rate debt. Using interest

rate
      swap
      agreements, the Company has agreed to exchange, at specified intervals through
      2007, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated
      by
      reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. Interest rate collar
      agreements are used to limit the Company’s exposure to and benefits from
      interest rate fluctuations on variable rate debt to within a certain range
      of
      rates.

The
      Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes.
      The
      Company does, however, have certain interest rate derivative instruments that
      have been designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Such instruments
      effectively convert variable interest payments on certain debt instruments
      into
      fixed payments. For qualifying hedges, SFAS No. 133 allows derivative gains
      and losses to offset related results on hedged items in the consolidated
      statement of operations. The Company has formally documented, designated and
      assessed the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting. For
      the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, net gain on derivative
      instruments and hedging activities includes gains of $3 million, $4 million
      and
      $8 million, respectively, which represent cash flow hedge ineffectiveness on
      interest rate hedge agreements arising from differences between the critical
      terms of the agreements and the related hedged obligations. Changes in the
      fair
      value of interest rate agreements designated as hedging instruments of the
      variability of cash flows associated with floating-rate debt obligations that
      meet the effectiveness criteria SFAS No. 133 are reported in accumulated other
      comprehensive loss. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, a
      gain
      of $16 million, $42 million and $48 million, respectively, related to derivative
      instruments designated as cash flow hedges, was recorded in accumulated other
      comprehensive loss and minority interest. The amounts are subsequently
      reclassified into interest expense as a yield adjustment in the same period
      in
      which the related interest on the floating-rate debt obligations affects
      earnings (losses).

Certain
      interest rate derivative instruments are not designated as hedges as they do
      not
      meet the effectiveness criteria specified by SFAS No. 133. However,
      management believes such instruments are closely correlated with the respective
      debt, thus managing associated risk. Interest rate derivative instruments not
      designated as hedges are marked to fair value, with the impact recorded as

gain
      (loss) on derivative instruments and hedging activities in the Company’s
      consolidated statement of operations

.
      For the
      years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,

net
      gain
      on derivative instruments and hedging activities includes gains of $47 million,
      $65 million and $57 million, respectively, for interest rate derivative
      instruments not designated as hedges.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company had outstanding $1.8 billion,
      $2.7 billion and $3.0 billion and $20 million, $20 million and $520
      million, respectively, in notional amounts of interest rate swaps and collars,
      respectively. The notional amounts of interest rate instruments do not represent
      amounts exchanged by the parties and, thus, are not a measure of exposure to
      credit loss. The amounts exchanged are determined by reference to the notional
      amount and the other terms of the contracts.

17.

Fair
      Value of Financial Instruments

The
      Company has estimated the fair value of its financial instruments as of
      December 31, 2005 and 2004 using available market information or other
      appropriate valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment, however, is required
      in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly,
      the estimates presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements
      are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company would realize in
      a
      current market exchange.

The
      carrying amounts of cash, receivables, payables and other current assets and
      liabilities approximate fair value because of the short maturity of those
      instruments. The Company is exposed to market price risk volatility with respect
      to investments in publicly traded and privately held entities.

The
      fair
      value of interest rate agreements represents the estimated amount the Company
      would receive or pay upon termination of the agreements. Management believes
      that the sellers of the interest rate agreements will be able to meet their
      obligations under the agreements. In addition, some of the interest rate
      agreements are with certain of the participating banks under the Company’s
      credit facilities, thereby reducing the exposure to credit loss. The Company
      has
      policies regarding the financial stability and credit standing of major
      counterparties. Nonperformance

Stock
      Compensation Plans

The
      Company grants stock options, restricted stock and other incentive compensation
      pursuant to the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan of Charter (the "2001 Plan"). Prior
      to
      2001, options were granted under the 1999 Option Plan of Charter Holdco (the
      "1999 Plan").

The
      Plan provided for the grant of options to purchase membership units in Charter
      Holdco to current and prospective employees and consultants of Charter Holdco
      and its affiliates and current and prospective non-employee directors of
      Charter. Options granted generally vest over five years from the grant date,
      with 25% vesting 15 months after the anniversary of the grant date and
      ratably thereafter. Options not exercised accumulate and are exercisable, in
      whole or in part, in any subsequent period, but not later than 10 years from
      the
      date of grant. Membership units received upon exercise of the options are
      automatically exchanged into Class A common stock of Charter on a
      one-for-one basis.

The
      Plan provides for the grant of non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation
      rights, dividend equivalent rights, performance units and performance shares,
      share awards, phantom stock and/or shares of restricted stock (not to exceed
      20,000,000), as each term is defined in the 2001 Plan. Employees, officers,
      consultants and directors of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates
      are
      eligible to receive grants under the 2001 Plan. Options granted generally vest
      over four years from the grant date, with 25% vesting on the anniversary of
      the
      grant date and ratably thereafter. Generally, options expire 10 years from
      the grant date.

The
      Plan allows for the issuance of up to a total of 90,000,000 shares of Charter
      Class A common stock (or units convertible into Charter Class A common
      stock). The total shares available reflect a July 2003 amendment to the 2001
      Plan approved by the board of directors and the shareholders of Charter to
      increase available shares by 30,000,000 shares. In 2001, any shares covered
      by
      options that terminated under the 1999 Plan were transferred to the 2001 Plan,
      and no new options can be granted under the 1999 Plan.

In
      the
      years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, certain directors were awarded
      a
      total of 492,225, 182,932 and 80,603 shares, respectively, of restricted Class
      A
      common stock of which 44,121 shares had been cancelled as of December 31, 2005.
      The shares vest one year from the date of grant. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, in
      connection with new employment agreements, certain officers were awarded
      2,987,500, 50,000 and 50,000 shares, respectively, of restricted Class A common
      stock of which 68,750 shares had been cancelled as of December 31, 2005. The
      shares vest annually over a one to three-year period beginning from the date
      of
      grant. As of December 31, 2005, deferred compensation remaining to be recognized
      in future period totaled $2 million.

A
      summary
      of the activity for the Company’s stock options, excluding granted shares of
      restricted Class A common stock, for the years ended December 31,
      2005, 2004 and 2003, is as follows (amounts in thousands, except per share

The
      following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding and
      exercisable as of December 31, 2005:

On
      January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the fair value measurement provisions
      of SFAS No. 123, under which the Company recognizes compensation expense of
      a stock-based award to an employee over the vesting period based on the fair
      value of the award on the grant date. Adoption of these provisions resulted
      in
      utilizing a preferable accounting method as the consolidated financial
      statements present the estimated fair value of stock-based compensation in
      expense consistently with other forms of compensation and other expense
      associated with goods

and
      services received for equity instruments. In accordance with SFAS No. 123,
      the fair value method will be applied only to awards granted or modified after
      January 1, 2003, whereas awards granted prior to such date will continue to
      be accounted for under APB No. 25, unless they are modified or settled in
      cash. The ongoing effect on consolidated results of operations or financial
      condition will be dependent upon future stock based compensation awards granted.
      The Company recorded $14 million, $31 million and $4 million of option
      compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
      respectively.

In
      January 2004, the Company began an option exchange program in which the Company
      offered its employees the right to exchange all stock options (vested and
      unvested) under the 1999 Charter Communications Option Plan and 2001 Stock
      Incentive Plan that had an exercise price over $10 per share for shares of

      shares of restricted stock in exchange for tendered options, Charter issued
      that
      employee shares of restricted stock in the exchange. If, based on the exchange
      ratios, an employee would have received 400 or fewer shares of restricted stock
      in exchange for tendered options, Charter instead paid the employee cash in
      an
      amount equal to the number of shares the employee would have received multiplied
      by $5.00.

The

offer
      applied to options (vested and unvested) to purchase a total of 22,929,573
      shares of Class A common stock, or approximately 48% of the Company's 47,882,365
      total options issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2003. Participation
      by
      employees was voluntary. Those members of the Company's board of directors
      who
      were not also employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries were not
      eligible to participate in the exchange offer.

In
      the
      closing of the exchange offer on February 20, 2004, the Company accepted for
      cancellation eligible options to purchase approximately 18,137,664 shares of
      its
      Class A common stock. In exchange, the Company granted 1,966,686 shares of
      restricted stock, including 460,777 performance shares to eligible employees
      of
      the rank of senior vice president and above, and paid a total cash amount of
      approximately $4 million (which amount includes applicable withholding taxes)
      to
      those employees who received cash rather than shares of restricted stock. The
      restricted stock was granted on February 25, 2004. Employees tendered
      approximately 79% of the options eligible to be exchanged under the program.

The
      cost
      to the Company of the stock option exchange program was approximately $10
      million, with a 2004 cash compensation expense of approximately $4 million
      and a
      non-cash compensation expense of approximately $6 million to be expensed ratably
      over the three-year vesting period of the restricted stock in the
      exchange.

In
      January 2004, the Compensation Committee of the board of directors of Charter
      approved Charter's Long-Term Incentive Program ("LTIP"), which is a program
      administered under the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan. Under the LTIP, employees
      of
      Charter and its subsidiaries whose pay classifications exceed

a
      certain
      level are eligible to receive stock options, and more senior level employees
      are
      eligible to receive stock options and performance shares. The stock options
      vest
      25% on each of the first four anniversaries of the date of grant. The
      performance shares vest on the third anniversary of the grant date and shares
      of
      Charter Class A common stock are issued, conditional upon Charter's performance
      against financial performance measures established by Charter’s management and
      approved by its board of directors as of the time of the award. Charter granted
      3.2 million and 6.9 million shares in 2005 and 2004, respectively, under this
      program and recognized expense of $1 million and $8 million in the first three
      quarters of 2005 and 2004, respectively. However, in the fourth quarter of
      and 2004, the Company reversed the entire $1 million and $8 million,
      respectively, of expense based on the Company’s assessment of the probability of
      achieving the financial performance measures established by Charter and required
      to be met for the performance shares to vest. In February 2006, the Compensation
      Committee approved a modification to the financial performance measures required
      to be met for the performance shares to vest after which management believes
      that a approximately 2.5 million of the performance shares are likely to vest.
      As such, expense of approximately $3 million will be amortized over the
      remaining two year service period.

Special
      Charges

In

      fourth quarter of 2002, the Company began a workforce reduction program and
      consolidation of its operations from three divisions and ten regions into five
      operating divisions, eliminating redundant practices and streamlining its
      management structure. The Company has recorded special charges as a result
      of
      reducing its workforce, executive severance and consolidating administrative
      offices in 2003, 2004 and 2005. The activity associated with this initiative
      is

Income
      Taxes

All
      operations are held through Charter Holdco and its direct and indirect
      subsidiaries. Charter Holdco and the majority of its subsidiaries are not
      subject to income tax. However, certain of these subsidiaries are corporations
      and are subject to income tax. All of the taxable income, gains, losses,
      deductions and credits of Charter Holdco are passed through to its members:
      Charter, Charter Investment, Inc. ("CII") and Vulcan Cable III Inc. ("Vulcan
      Cable"). Charter is responsible for its share of taxable income or loss of
      Charter Holdco allocated to Charter in accordance with the Charter Holdco
      limited liability company agreement (the "LLC Agreement") and partnership tax
      rules and regulations.

The
      LLC
      Agreement provides for certain special allocations of net tax profits and net
      tax losses (such net tax profits and net tax losses being determined under
      the
      applicable federal income tax rules for determining capital accounts). Under
      the
      LLC Agreement, through the end of 2003, net tax losses of Charter Holdco that
      would otherwise have

been
      allocated to Charter based generally on its percentage ownership of outstanding
      common units were allocated instead to membership units held by Vulcan Cable
      and
      CII (the "Special Loss Allocations") to the extent of their respective capital
      account balances. After 2003, under the LLC Agreement, net tax losses of Charter
      Holdco are to be allocated to Charter, Vulcan Cable and CII based generally
      on
      their respective percentage ownership of outstanding common units to the extent
      of their respective capital account balances. Allocations of net tax losses
      in
      excess of the members’ aggregate capital account balances are allocated under
      the rules governing Regulatory Allocations, as described below. Subject to
      the
      Curative Allocation Provisions described below, the LLC Agreement further
      provides that, beginning at the time Charter Holdco generates net tax profits,
      the net tax profits that would otherwise have been allocated to Charter based
      generally on its percentage ownership of outstanding common membership units
      will instead generally be allocated to Vulcan Cable and CII (the "Special Profit
      Allocations"). The Special Profit Allocations to Vulcan Cable and CII will
      generally continue until the cumulative amount of the Special Profit Allocations
      offsets the cumulative amount of the Special Loss Allocations. The amount and
      timing of the Special Profit Allocations are subject to the potential
      application of, and interaction with, the Curative Allocation Provisions
      described in the following paragraph. The LLC Agreement generally provides
      that
      any additional net tax profits are to be allocated among the members of Charter
      Holdco based generally on their respective percentage ownership of Charter
      Holdco common membership units.

Because
      the respective capital account balance of each of Vulcan Cable and CII was
      reduced to zero by December 31, 2002, certain net tax losses of Charter Holdco
      that were to be allocated for 2002, 2003, 2004 and

2005,
      to
      Vulcan Cable and CII instead have been allocated to Charter (the "Regulatory
      Allocations"). As a result of the allocation of net tax losses to Charter in
      2005, Charter’s capital account balance was reduced to zero during 2005. The LLC
      Agreement provides that once the capital account balances of all members have
      been reduced to zero, net tax losses are to be allocated to Charter, Vulcan
      Cable and CII based generally on their respective percentage ownership of
      outstanding common units. Such allocations are also considered to be Regulatory
      Allocations. The LLC Agreement further provides that, to the extent possible,
      the effect of the Regulatory Allocations is to be offset over time pursuant
      to
      certain curative allocation provisions (the "Curative Allocation Provisions")
      so
      that, after certain offsetting adjustments are made, each member's capital
      account balance is equal to the capital account balance such member would have
      had if the Regulatory Allocations had not been part of the LLC Agreement. The
      cumulative amount of the actual tax losses allocated to Charter as a result
      of
      the Regulatory Allocations through the year ended December 31, 2005 is
      approximately $4.1 billion.

As
        a
        result of the Special Loss Allocations and the Regulatory Allocations referred
        to above (and their interaction with the allocations related to assets
        contributed to Charter Holdco with differences between book and tax basis),
        the
        cumulative amount of losses of Charter Holdco allocated to Vulcan Cable and

CII

is in
        excess of the amount that would have been allocated to such entities if the
        losses of Charter Holdco had been allocated among its members in proportion
        to
        their respective percentage ownership of Charter Holdco common membership
        units.
        The cumulative amount of such excess losses was approximately $977 million
        through December 31, 2005.

In
      certain situations, the Special Loss Allocations, Special Profit Allocations,
      Regulatory Allocations and Curative Allocation Provisions described above could
      result in Charter paying taxes in an amount that is more or less than if Charter
      Holdco had allocated net tax profits and net tax losses among its members based
      generally on the number of common membership units owned by such members. This
      could occur due to differences in (i) the character of the allocated income
      (e.g., ordinary versus capital), (ii) the allocated amount and timing of
      tax depreciation and tax amortization expense due to the application of section
      704(c) under the Internal Revenue Code, (iii) the potential interaction
      between the Special Profit Allocations and the Curative Allocation Provisions,
      (iv) the amount and timing of alternative minimum taxes paid by Charter, if
      any,
      (v) the apportionment of the allocated income or loss among the states in
      which Charter Holdco does business, and (vi) future federal and state tax
      laws. Further, in the event of new capital contributions to Charter Holdco,
      it
      is possible that the tax effects of the Special Profit Allocations, Special
      Loss
      Allocations, Regulatory Allocations and Curative Allocation Provisions will
      change significantly pursuant to the provisions of the income tax regulations
      or
      the terms of a contribution agreement with respect to such contribution. Such
      change could defer the actual tax benefits to be derived by Charter with respect
      to the net tax losses allocated to it or accelerate the actual taxable income
      to
      Charter with respect to the net tax profits allocated to it. As a result, it
      is
      possible under certain circumstances, that Charter could receive future
      allocations of

taxable
      income in excess of its currently allocated tax deductions and available tax
      loss carryforwards. The ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards
      is
      potentially subject to certain limitations as discussed below.

In
      addition, under their exchange agreement with Charter, Vulcan Cable and CII
      may
      exchange some or all of their membership units in Charter Holdco for Charter’s
      Class B common stock, be merged with Charter, or be acquired by Charter in
      a non-taxable reorganization. If such an exchange were to take place prior
      to
      the date that the Special Profit Allocation provisions had fully offset the
      Special Loss Allocations, Vulcan Cable and CII could elect to cause Charter
      Holdco to make the remaining Special Profit Allocations to Vulcan Cable and
      CII
      immediately prior to the consummation of the exchange. In the event Vulcan
      Cable
      and CII choose not to make such election or to the extent such allocations
      are
      not possible, Charter would then be allocated tax profits attributable to the
      membership units received in such exchange pursuant to the Special Profit
      Allocation provisions. Mr. Allen has generally agreed to reimburse Charter
      for any incremental income taxes that Charter would owe as a result of such
      an
      exchange and any resulting future Special Profit Allocations to Charter. The
      ability of Charter to utilize net operating loss carryforwards is potentially
      subject to certain limitations as discussed below. If Charter were to become
      subject to certain limitations (whether as a result of an exchange described
      above or otherwise), and as a result were to owe taxes resulting from the
      Special Profit Allocations, then Mr. Allen may not be obligated to reimburse
      Charter for such income taxes.

For
      the
      years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded deferred
      income tax expense and benefits as shown below. The income tax expense is
      recognized through increases in deferred tax liabilities related to our
      investment in Charter Holdco, as well as through current federal and state
      income tax expense and increases in the deferred tax liabilities of certain
      of
      our indirect corporate subsidiaries. The income tax benefits were realized
      through reductions in the deferred tax liabilities related to Charter’s
      investment in Charter Holdco, as well as the deferred tax liabilities of certain
      of Charter’s indirect corporate subsidiaries. In 2003, Charter received tax loss
      allocations from Charter Holdco. Previously, the tax losses had been allocated
      to Vulcan Cable and CII in accordance with the Special Loss Allocations provided
      under the Charter Holdco limited liability company agreement. The Company does
      not expect to recognize a similar benefit related to its investment in Charter
      Holdco after 2003 due to limitations on its ability to offset future tax
      benefits against the remaining deferred tax liabilities. However, the actual
      tax
      provision calculation in future periods will be the result of current and future
      temporary differences, as well as future operating results.

As
      of
      December 31, 2005, the Company has deferred tax assets of $4.2 billion,
      which primarily relate to financial and tax losses allocated to Charter from
      Charter Holdco. The deferred tax assets include $2.4 billion of tax net
      operating loss carryforwards (generally expiring in years 2006 through 2025)
      of
      Charter and its indirect corporate subsidiaries. Valuation allowances of $3.7
      billion exist with respect to these deferred tax assets of which $1.8 billion
      relate to the tax net operating loss carryforwards.

Realization
      of any benefit from the Company’s tax net operating losses is dependent on: (1)
      Charter and its indirect corporate subsidiaries’ ability to generate future
      taxable income and (2) the absence of certain future "ownership changes" of
      Charter's common stock. An "ownership change" as defined in the applicable
      federal income tax rules, would place significant limitations, on an annual
      basis, on the use of such net operating losses to offset any future taxable
      income the Company may generate. Such limitations, in conjunction with the
      net
      operating loss expiration provisions, could effectively eliminate the Company’s
      ability to use a substantial portion of its net operating losses

to
      offset
      any future taxable income. Future transactions and the timing of such
      transactions could cause an ownership change. Such transactions include
      additional issuances of common stock by the Company (including but not limited
      to the issuance of up to a total of 150 million shares of common stock (of
      which
      116.9 million were issued through 2006) under the share lending agreement),
      the
      issuance of shares of common stock upon future conversion of Charter’s
      convertible senior notes and the issuance of common stock in the class action
      settlement discussed in Note 26, reacquisition of the borrowed shares by
      Charter, or acquisitions or sales of shares by certain holders of Charter’s
      shares, including persons who have held, currently hold, or accumulate in the
      future five percent or more of Charter’s outstanding stock (including upon an
      exchange by Mr. Allen or his affiliates, directly or indirectly, of membership
      units of Charter Holdco into CCI common stock).  Many of the foregoing
      transactions are beyond management’s control.

The
      total
      valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2005 and
      2004 was $3.7 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively. In assessing the
      realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more
      likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be
      realized. Because of the uncertainties in projecting future taxable income
      of
      Charter Holdco, valuation allowances have been established except for deferred
      benefits available to offset certain deferred tax liabilities.

The
      Company is currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for
      the
      tax years ending December 31, 2002 and 2003. The Company’s results (excluding
      Charter and its indirect corporate subsidiaries) for these years are subject
      to
      this examination. Management does not expect the results of this examination
      to
      have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition
      or results of operations.

      is a holding company and its principal assets are its equity interest in Charter
      Holdco and certain mirror notes payable by Charter Holdco to Charter and mirror
      preferred units held by Charter, which have the same principal amount and terms
      as those of Charter’s convertible senior notes and Charter’s outstanding
      preferred stock. In 2004, Charter Holdco paid to Charter $49 million related
      to
      interest on the mirror notes, and Charter Holdco paid an additional $4 million
      related to dividends on the mirror preferred membership units. Further, during
      2004 Charter Holdco issued 7,252,818 common membership units to Charter in
      cancellation of $30 million principal amount of mirror notes so as to mirror
      the
      issuance by Charter of Class A common stock in exchange for a like principal
      amount of its outstanding convertible notes.

Charter
      is a party to management arrangements with Charter Holdco and certain of its
      subsidiaries. Under these agreements, Charter provides management services
      for
      the cable systems owned or operated by its subsidiaries. The management services
      include such services as centralized customer billing services, data processing
      and related support, benefits administration and coordination of insurance
      coverage and self-insurance programs for medical, dental and workers’
compensation claims. Costs associated with providing these services are billed
      and charged directly to the Company’s operating subsidiaries and are included
      within operating costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of
      operations. Such costs totaled $212 million, $202 million and $210 million
      for
      the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. All other
      costs incurred on the behalf of Charter’s operating subsidiaries are considered
      a part of the management fee and are recorded as a component of selling, general
      and administrative expense, in the accompanying consolidated financial
      statements. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the
      management fee charged to the Company’s operating subsidiaries approximated the
      expenses incurred by Charter Holdco and Charter on behalf of the Company’s
      operating subsidiaries. The credit facilities of the Company’s operating
      subsidiaries prohibit payments of management fees in excess of 3.5% of revenues
      until repayment of the outstanding indebtedness. In the event any portion of
      the
      management fee due and payable is not paid, it is deferred by Charter and
      accrued as a liability of such subsidiaries.

Any
      deferred amount of the management fee will bear interest at the rate of 10%

      it is paid.

Mr. Allen,
      the controlling shareholder of Charter, and a number of his affiliates have
      interests in various entities that provide services or programming to Charter’s
      subsidiaries. Given the diverse nature of Mr. Allen’s investment activities
      and interests, and to avoid the possibility of future disputes as to potential
      business, Charter and Charter Holdco, under the terms of their respective
      organizational documents, may not, and may not allow their subsidiaries to
      engage in any business transaction outside the cable transmission business
      except for certain existing approved investments. Should Charter or Charter
      Holdco or any of their subsidiaries wish to pursue, or allow their subsidiaries
      to pursue, a business transaction outside of this scope, it must first offer
      Mr. Allen the opportunity to pursue the particular business transaction. If
      he decides not to pursue the business transaction and consents to Charter or
      its
      subsidiaries engaging in the business transaction, they will be able to do
      so.
      The cable transmission business means the business of transmitting video, audio,
      including telephone, and data over cable systems owned, operated or managed
      by
      Charter, Charter Holdco or any of their subsidiaries from time to time.

Mr. Allen
      or his affiliates own or have owned equity interests or warrants to purchase
      equity interests in various entities with which the Company does business or
      which provides it with products, services or programming. Among these entities
      are TechTV L.L.C. ("TechTV"), Oxygen Media Corporation ("Oxygen Media"), Digeo,
      Inc., Click2learn, Inc., Trail Blazer Inc., Action Sports Cable Network ("Action
      Sports") and Microsoft Corporation. In May 2004, TechTV was sold to an unrelated
      third party. Mr. Allen owns 100% of the equity of Vulcan Ventures
      Incorporated ("Vulcan Ventures") and Vulcan Inc. and is the president of Vulcan
      Ventures. Ms. Jo Allen Patton is a director and the President and Chief
      Executive Officer of Vulcan Inc. and is a director and Vice President of Vulcan
      Ventures. Mr. Lance Conn is Executive Vice President of Vulcan Inc. and Vulcan
      Ventures. Mr. Savoy was a vice president and a director of Vulcan Ventures
      until
      his resignation in September 2003 and he resigned as a director of Charter
      in
      April 2004. The various cable, media, Internet and telephone companies in which
      Mr. Allen has invested may mutually benefit one another. The Company can
      give no assurance, nor should you expect, that any of these business
      relationships will be successful, that the Company will realize any benefits
      from these relationships or that the Company will enter into any business
      relationships in the future with Mr. Allen’s affiliated companies.

Mr. Allen
      and his affiliates have made, and in the future likely will make, numerous
      investments outside of the Company and its business. The Company cannot assure
      that, in the event that the Company or any of its subsidiaries enter into
      transactions in the future with any affiliate of Mr. Allen, such
      transactions will be on terms as favorable to the Company as terms it might
      have
      obtained from an unrelated third party. Also, conflicts could arise with respect
      to the allocation of corporate opportunities between the Company and
      Mr. Allen and his affiliates. The Company has not instituted any formal
      plan or arrangement to address potential conflicts of interest.

The
      Company received or receives programming for broadcast via its cable systems
      from TechTV (now G4), Oxygen Media and Trail Blazers Inc. The Company pays
      a fee
      for the programming service generally based on the number of customers receiving
      the service. Such fees for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003
      were each less than 1% of total operating expenses.

Tech
      TV.

The
      Company received from TechTV programming for distribution via its cable system
      pursuant to an affiliation agreement. The affiliation agreement provided, among
      other things, that TechTV must offer Charter certain terms and conditions that
      are no less favorable in the affiliation agreement than are given to any other
      distributor that serves the same number of or fewer TechTV viewing customers.
      Additionally, pursuant to the affiliation agreement, the Company was entitled
      to
      incentive payments for channel launches through December 31, 2003.

In
      March
      2004, Charter Holdco entered into agreements with Vulcan Programming and TechTV,
      which provide for (i) Charter Holdco and TechTV to amend the affiliation
      agreement which, among other things, revises the description of the TechTV
      network content, provides for Charter Holdco to waive certain claims against
      TechTV relating to alleged breaches of the affiliation agreement and provides
      for TechTV to make payment of outstanding launch receivables due to Charter
      Holdco under the affiliation agreement, (ii) Vulcan Programming to pay
      approximately $10 million and purchase over a 24-month period, at fair market
      rates, $2 million of advertising time

across
      various cable networks on Charter cable systems in consideration of the
      agreements, obligations, releases and waivers under the agreements and in
      settlement of the aforementioned claims and (iii) TechTV to be a provider of
      content relating to technology and video gaming for Charter's interactive
      television platforms through December 31, 2006 (exclusive for the first year).
      For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company recognized
      approximately $1 million and $5 million, respectively, of the Vulcan Programming
      payment as an offset to programming expense.

Oxygen.

Oxygen
      Media LLC ("Oxygen") provides programming content aimed at the female audience
      for distribution over cable systems and satellite. On July 22, 2002,
      Charter Holdco entered into a carriage agreement with Oxygen whereby the Company
      agreed to carry programming content from Oxygen. Under the carriage agreement,
      the Company currently makes Oxygen programming available to approximately
      5 million of its video customers. In August 2004, Charter Holdco and Oxygen
      entered into agreements that amended and renewed the carriage agreement. The
      amendment to the carriage agreement (a) revised the number of the Company's
      customers to which Oxygen programming must be carried and for which the Company
      must pay, (b) released Charter Holdco from any claims related to the failure
      to
      achieve distribution benchmarks under the carriage agreement, (c) required
      Oxygen to make payment on outstanding receivables for launch incentives due
      to
      the Company under the carriage agreement; and (d) requires that Oxygen provide
      its programming content to the Company on economic terms no less favorable
      than
      Oxygen provides to any other cable or satellite operator having fewer
      subscribers than the Company. The renewal of the carriage agreement (a) extends
      the period that the Company will carry Oxygen programming to its customers
      through January 31, 2008, and (b) requires license fees to be paid based on
      customers receiving Oxygen programming, rather than for specific customer
      benchmarks. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company
      paid Oxygen approximately $9 million, $13 million and $9 million, respectively.
      In addition, Oxygen pays the Company launch incentives for customers launched
      after the first year of the term of the carriage agreement up to a total of
      $4 million. The Company recorded approximately $0.1 million related to
      these launch incentives as a reduction of programming expense for the year
      ended
      December 31, 2005 and $1 million for each of the years ended December 31,
      2004 and 2003, respectively.

In
      August
      2004, Charter Holdco and Oxygen also amended the equity issuance agreement
      to
      provide for the issuance of 1 million shares of Oxygen Preferred Stock with
      a
      liquidation preference of $33.10 per share plus accrued dividends to Charter
      Holdco on February 1, 2005 in place of the $34 million of unregistered shares
      of
      Oxygen Media common stock required under the original equity issuance agreement.
      Oxygen Media delivered these shares in March 2005. The preferred stock is
      convertible into common stock after December 31, 2007 at a conversion ratio,
      the
      numerator of which is the liquidation preference and the denominator which
      is
      the fair market value per share of Oxygen Media common stock on the conversion
      date.

The
      Company recognized the guaranteed value of the investment over the life of
      the
      carriage agreement as a reduction of programming expense. For the years ended
      December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company recorded approximately $2 million,
      $13 million, and $9 million, respectively, as a reduction of programming
      expense. The carrying value of the Company’s investment in Oxygen was
      approximately $33 million and $32 million as of December 31, 2005 and 2004,
      respectively.

Digeo,
      Inc

.
      In
      March 2001, Charter Ventures and Vulcan Ventures Incorporated formed DBroadband
      Holdings, LLC for the sole purpose of purchasing equity interests in Digeo.
      In
      connection with the execution of the broadband carriage agreement, DBroadband
      Holdings, LLC purchased an equity interest in Digeo funded by contributions
      from
      Vulcan Ventures Incorporated. The equity interest is subject to a priority
      return of capital to Vulcan Ventures up to the amount contributed by Vulcan
      Ventures on Charter Ventures’ behalf. After Vulcan Ventures recovers its amount
      contributed and any cumulative loss allocations, Charter Ventures has a 100%
      profit interest in DBroadband Holdings, LLC. Charter Ventures is not required
      to
      make any capital contributions, including capital calls to Digeo. DBroadband
      Holdings, LLC is therefore not included in the Company’s consolidated financial
      statements. Pursuant to an amended version of this arrangement, in 2003, Vulcan
      Ventures contributed a total of $29 million to Digeo, $7 million of
      which was contributed on Charter Ventures’ behalf, subject to Vulcan Ventures’
aforementioned priority return. Since the formation of DBroadband Holdings,
      LLC,
      Vulcan Ventures has contributed approximately $56 million on Charter Ventures’
behalf.

(dollars
          in millions, except where indicated)

On
      September 27, 2001, Charter and Digeo Interactive amended the broadband
      carriage agreement. According to the amendment, Digeo Interactive would provide
      to Charter the content for enhanced "Wink" interactive television services,
      known as Charter Interactive Channels ("i-channels"). In order to provide the
      i-channels, Digeo Interactive sublicensed certain Wink technologies to Charter.
      Charter is entitled to share in the revenues generated by the i-channels.
      Currently, the Company’s digital video customers who receive i-channels receive
      the service at no additional charge.

On
      September 28, 2002, Charter entered into a second amendment to its
      broadband carriage agreement with Digeo Interactive. This amendment superseded
      the amendment of September 27, 2001. It provided for the development by
      Digeo Interactive of future features to be included in the Basic i-TV service
      to
      be provided by Digeo and for Digeo’s development of an interactive

"

toolkit"
      to enable Charter to develop interactive local content. Furthermore, Charter
      could request that Digeo Interactive manage local content for a fee. The
      amendment provided for Charter to pay for development of the Basic i-TV service
      as well as license fees for customers who would receive the service, and for
      Charter and Digeo to split certain revenues earned from the service. The Company
      paid Digeo Interactive approximately $3 million, $3 million and $4 million
      for
      the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, for customized
      development of the i-channels and the local content tool kit. This amendment
      expired pursuant to its terms on December 31, 2003. Digeo Interactive is
      continuing to provide the Basic i-TV service on a month-to-month
      basis.

On
      June
      30, 2003, Charter Holdco entered into an agreement with Motorola, Inc. for
      the
      purchase of 100,000 digital video recorder ("DVR"') units. The software for
      these DVR units is being supplied by Digeo Interactive, LLC under a license
      agreement entered into in April 2004. Under the license agreement Digeo
      Interactive granted to Charter Holdco the right to use Digeo's proprietary
      software for the number of DVR units that Charter deployed from a maximum of
      headends through year-end 2004. This maximum number of headends restriction
      was
      expanded and eventually eliminated through successive agreement amendments
      and
      the date for entering into license agreements for units deployed was extended.
      The license granted for each unit deployed under the agreement is valid for
      five
      years. In addition, Charter will pay certain other fees including a per-headend
      license fee and maintenance fees. Maximum license and maintenance fees during
      the term of the agreement are expected to be approximately $7 million. The
      agreement provides that Charter is entitled to receive contract terms,
      considered on the whole, and license fees, considered apart from other contract
      terms, no less favorable than those accorded to any other Digeo customer.
      Charter paid approximately $1 million in license and maintenance fees in
      2005.

In
      April
      2004, the Company launched DVR service using units containing the Digeo software
      in its Rochester, Minnesota market using a broadband media center that is an
      integrated set-top terminal with a cable converter, DVR hard drive and
      connectivity to other consumer electronics devices (such as stereos, MP3
      players, and digital cameras).

In
      May
      2004, Charter Holdco entered into a binding term sheet with Digeo Interactive
      for the development, testing and purchase of 70,000 Digeo PowerKey DVR units.
      The term sheet provided that the parties would proceed in good faith to
      negotiate, prior to year-end 2004, definitive agreements for the development,
      testing and purchase of the DVR units and that the parties would enter into
      a
      license agreement for Digeo's proprietary software on terms substantially
      similar to the terms of the license agreement described above. In November
      2004,
      Charter Holdco and Digeo Interactive executed the license agreement and in
      December 2004, the parties executed the purchase agreement, each on terms
      substantially similar to the binding term sheet. Product development and testing
      has been completed. Total purchase price and license and maintenance fees during
      the term of the definitive agreements are expected to be approximately $41
      million. The definitive agreements are terminable at no penalty to Charter
      in
      certain circumstances. Charter paid approximately $10 million and $1 million
      for
      the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, in capital purchases
      under this agreement.

CC
      VIII.

As
      part
      of the acquisition of the cable systems owned by Bresnan Communications Company
      Limited Partnership in February 2000, CC VIII, LLC, Charter’s indirect limited
      liability company subsidiary, issued, after adjustments, 24,273,943 Class A
      preferred membership units (collectively, the "CC VIII interest") with a
      value and an initial capital account of approximately $630 million to certain
      sellers affiliated with AT&T Broadband, subsequently owned by Comcast
      Corporation (the "Comcast sellers"). Mr. Allen granted the Comcast
      sellers the

right
      to
      sell to him the CC VIII interest for approximately $630 million plus
      4.5% interest annually from February 2000 (the "Comcast put right"). In April
      2002, the Comcast sellers exercised the Comcast put right in full, and this
      transaction was consummated on June 6, 2003. Accordingly, Mr. Allen
      has become the holder of the CC VIII interest, indirectly through an
      affiliate.

In
      the
      event of a liquidation of CC VIII, Mr. Allen would be entitled to a priority
      distribution with respect to a 2% priority return (which will continue to
      accrete). Any remaining distributions in liquidation would be distributed to
      CC
      V Holdings, LLC and Mr. Allen in proportion to CC V Holdings, LLC's capital
      account and Mr. Allen's capital account (which will equal the initial capital
      account of the Comcast sellers of approximately $630 million, increased or
      decreased by Mr. Allen's pro rata share of CC VIII’s profits or losses (as
      computed for capital account purposes) after June 6, 2003).

An
      issue
      arose as to whether the documentation for the Bresnan transaction was correct
      and complete with regard to the ultimate ownership of the CC VIII interest
      following consummation of the Comcast put right. Thereafter, the board of
      directors of Charter formed a Special Committee of independent directors to
      investigate the matter and take any other appropriate action on behalf of
      Charter with respect to this matter. After conducting an investigation of the
      relevant facts and circumstances, the Special Committee determined that a
      "scrivener’s error" had occurred in February 2000 in connection with the
      preparation of the last-minute revisions to the Bresnan transaction documents
      and that, as a result, Charter should seek the reformation of the Charter Holdco
      limited liability company agreement, or alternative relief, in order to restore
      and ensure the obligation that the CC VIII interest be automatically exchanged
      for Charter Holdco units. The Special Committee further determined that, as
      part
      of such contract reformation or alternative relief, Mr. Allen should be
      required to contribute the CC VIII interest to Charter Holdco in exchange
      for 24,273,943 Charter Holdco membership units. The Special Committee also
      recommended to the board of directors of Charter that, to the extent the
      contract reformation is achieved, the board of directors should consider whether
      the CC VIII interest should ultimately be held by Charter Holdco or Charter
      Holdings or another entity owned directly or indirectly by them.

Mr. Allen
      disagreed with the Special Committee’s determinations described above and so
      notified the Special Committee. Mr. Allen contended that the transaction was
      accurately reflected in the transaction documentation and contemporaneous and
      subsequent company public disclosures. The Special Committee and Mr. Allen
      determined to utilize the Delaware Court of Chancery's program for mediation
      of
      complex business disputes in an effort to resolve the CC VIII interest dispute.

As
      of
      October 31, 2005, Mr. Allen, the Special Committee, Charter, Charter Holdco
      and
      certain of their affiliates, agreed to settle the dispute, and execute certain
      permanent and irrevocable releases pursuant to the Settlement Agreement and
      Mutual Release agreement dated October 31, 2005 (the "Settlement").

Pursuant
      to the Settlement, CII has retained 30% of its CC VIII interest (the "Remaining
      Interests"). The Remaining Interests are subject to certain drag along, tag
      along and transfer restrictions as detailed in the revised CC VIII Limited
      Liability Company Agreement. CII transferred the other 70% of the CC VIII
      interest directly and indirectly, through Charter Holdco, to a newly formed
      entity, CCHC (a direct subsidiary of Charter Holdco and the direct parent of
      Charter Holdings). Of the 70% of the CC VIII preferred interests, 7.4% has
      been
      transferred by CII to CCHC for a subordinated exchangeable note with an initial
      accreted value of $48 million, accreting at 14%, compounded quarterly, with
      a
      15-year maturity (the "Note"). The remaining 62.6% has been transferred by
      CII
      to Charter Holdco, in accordance with the terms of the settlement for no
      additional monetary consideration. Charter Holdco contributed the 62.6% interest
      to CCHC.

As
      part
      of the Settlement, CC VIII issued approximately 49 million additional Class
      B
      units to CC V in consideration for prior capital contributions to CC VIII by
      CC
      V, with respect to transactions that were unrelated to the dispute in connection
      with CII’s membership units in CC VIII. As a result, Mr. Allen’s pro rata share
      of the profits and losses of CC VIII attributable to the Remaining Interests
      is
      approximately 5.6%.

The
      Note
      is exchangeable, at CII’s option, at any time, for Charter Holdco Class A Common
      units at a rate equal to the then accreted value, divided by $2.00 (the
      "Exchange Rate"). Customary anti-dilution protections have been provided that
      could cause future changes to the Exchange Rate. Additionally, the Charter
      Holdco Class A Common units received will be exchangeable by the holder into
      Charter common stock in accordance with existing agreements between CII, Charter
      and certain other parties signatory thereto. Beginning February 28, 2009, if

Helicon.

In
      1999,
      the Company purchased the Helicon cable systems. As part of that purchase,
      Mr. Allen entered into a put agreement with a certain seller of the Helicon
      cable systems that received a portion of the purchase price in the form of
      a
      preferred membership interest in Charter Helicon, LLC with a redemption price
      of
      $25 million plus accrued interest. Under the Helicon put agreement, such
      holder had the right to sell any or all of the interest to Mr. Allen prior
      to its mandatory redemption in cash on July 30, 2009. On August 31,
      2005, 40% of the preferred membership interest was put to Mr. Allen. The
      remaining 60% of the preferred interest in Charter Helicon, LLC remained subject
      to the put to Mr. Allen. Such preferred interest was recorded in other
      long-term liabilities. On October 6, 2005, Charter Helicon, LLC redeemed all
      of
      the preferred membership interest for the redemption price of $25 million plus
      accrued interest.

Certain
      related parties, including members of the board of directors and officers,
      hold
      interests in the Company’s senior convertible debt and senior notes and discount
      notes of the Company’s subsidiary of approximately $60 million of face value at
      December 31, 2005.

      The
      Company leases certain facilities and equipment under noncancelable operating
      leases. Leases and rental costs charged to expense for the years ended
      December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, were $23 million, $23 million and $30
      million, respectively.

(2)

The
      Company pays programming fees under multi-year contracts ranging from three
      to
      ten years typically based on a flat fee per customer, which may be fixed for
      the
      term or may in some cases, escalate over the term. Programming costs included
      in
      the accompanying statement of operations were $1.4 billion, $1.3 billion and
      $1.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
      respectively. Certain of the Company’s programming agreements are based on a
      flat fee per month or have guaranteed minimum payments. The table sets forth
      the
      aggregate guaranteed minimum commitments under the Company’s programming
      contracts.

NOTES
          TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER
          31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003

(dollars
          in millions, except where indicated)

The
        following items are not included in the contractual obligation table due
        to
        various factors discussed below. However, the Company incurs these costs
        as part
        of its operations:

·

The
                Company also rents utility poles used in its operations. Generally,
                pole
                rentals are cancelable on short notice, but the Company anticipates
                that
                such rentals will recur. Rent expense incurred for pole rental attachments
                for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, was $46
                million, $43 million and $40 million, respectively.

·

The
                Company pays franchise fees under multi-year franchise agreements
                based on
                a percentage of revenues earned from video service per year. The
                Company
                also pays other franchise related costs, such as public education
                grants
                under multi-year agreements. Franchise fees and other franchise-related
                costs included in the accompanying statement of operations were $170
                million, $164 million and $162 million for the years ended December
                31,
                2005, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

·

The
                Company also has $165 million in letters of credit, primarily to
                its
                various worker’s compensation, property casualty and general liability
                carriers as collateral for reimbursement of claims. These letters
                of
                credit reduce the amount the Company may borrow under its credit
                facilities.

Litigation

Securities
      Class Actions and Derivative Suits

In
      and 2003, the Company had a series of lawsuits filed against Charter and certain
      of its former and present officers and directors (collectively the "Actions").
      In general, the lawsuits alleged that Charter utilized misleading accounting
      practices and failed to disclose these accounting practices and/or issued false
      and misleading financial statements and press releases concerning Charter’s
      operations and prospects.

Charter
      and the individual defendants entered into a Memorandum of Understanding on
      August 5, 2004 setting forth agreements in principle regarding settlement
      of the Actions. Charter and various other defendants in those actions
      subsequently entered into Stipulations of Settlement dated as of
      January 24, 2005, setting forth a settlement of the Actions in a manner
      consistent with the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding. On June 30,
      2005, the Court issued its final approval of the settlements. At the end of
      September 2005, after the period for appeals of the settlements expired,
      Stipulations of Dismissal were filed with the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals
      resulting in the dismissal of the two appeals with prejudice. Procedurally
      therefore, the settlements are final.

As
      amended, the Stipulations of Settlement provided that, in exchange for a release
      of all claims by plaintiffs against Charter and its former and present officers
      and directors named in the Actions, Charter would pay to the plaintiffs a
      combination of cash and equity collectively valued at $144 million, which
      was to include the fees and expenses of plaintiffs’ counsel. Of this amount,
      $64 million was to be paid in cash (by Charter’s insurance carriers) and
      the $80 million balance was to be paid in shares of Charter Class A
      common stock having an aggregate value of $40 million and ten-year warrants
      to purchase shares of Charter Class A common stock having an aggregate
      warrant value of $40 million, with such values in each case being
      determined pursuant to formulas set forth in the Stipulations of Settlement.
      However, Charter had the right, in its sole discretion, to substitute cash
      for
      some or all of the aforementioned securities on a dollar for dollar basis.
      Pursuant to that right, Charter elected to fund the $80 million obligation
      with 13.4 million shares of Charter Class A common stock (having an
      aggregate value of approximately $15 million pursuant to the formula set
      forth in the Stipulations of Settlement) with the remaining balance (less an
      agreed upon $2 million discount in respect of that portion allocable to
      plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees) to be paid in cash. In addition, Charter had agreed
      to issue additional shares of its Class A common stock to its insurance
      carrier having an aggregate value of $5 million; however, by agreement with
      its carrier, Charter paid $4.5 million in cash in lieu of issuing such
      shares. As a result in 2004, the Company recorded a $149 million litigation
      liability within other long-term liabilities and a $64 million insurance
      receivable as part of other non-current assets on its consolidated balance
      sheet
      and an $85 million special charge on its consolidated statement of

operations.
      Charter delivered the settlement consideration to the claims administrator
      on
      July 8, 2005, and it was held in escrow pending resolution of the appeals.
      Those appeals are now resolved.

In
      October 2001 and 2002, two class action lawsuits were filed against Charter
      alleging that Charter Holdco improperly charged them a wire maintenance fee
      without request or permission. They also claimed that Charter Holdco improperly
      required them to rent analog and/or digital set-top terminals even though their
      television sets were "cable ready." In April 2004, the parties participated
      in a
      mediation which resulted in settlement of the lawsuits. As a result of the
      settlement, we recorded a special charge of $9 million in our consolidated
      statement of operations in 2004. In December 2004 the court entered a written
      order formally approving that settlement.

Furthermore,
      Charter is also party to, other lawsuits and claims that arose in the ordinary
      course of conducting its business. In the opinion of management, after taking
      into account recorded liabilities, the outcome of these other lawsuits and
      claims are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
      consolidated financial condition, results of operations or its
      liquidity.

Regulation
      in the Cable Industry

The
      operation of a cable system is extensively regulated by the Federal
      Communications Commission ("FCC"), some state governments and most local
      governments. The FCC has the authority to enforce its regulations through the
      imposition of substantial fines, the issuance of cease and desist orders and/or
      the imposition of other administrative sanctions, such as the revocation of
      FCC
      licenses needed to operate certain transmission facilities used in connection
      with cable operations. The 1996 Telecom Act altered the regulatory structure
      governing the nation’s communications providers. It removed barriers to
      competition in both the cable television market and the local telephone market.
      Among other things, it reduced the scope of cable rate regulation and encouraged
      additional competition in the video programming industry by allowing local
      telephone companies to provide video programming in their own telephone service
      areas.

Future
      legislative and regulatory changes could adversely affect the Company’s
      operations, including, without limitation, additional regulatory requirements
      the Company may be required to comply with as it offers new services such as
      telephone.

Employee
                Benefit Plan

The
      Company’s employees may participate in the Charter Communications, Inc. 401(k)
      Plan. Employees that qualify for participation can contribute up to 50% of
      their
      salary, on a pre-tax basis, subject to a maximum contribution limit as
      determined by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company matches 50% of the
      first
      5% of participant contributions. The Company made contributions to the 401(k)
      plan totaling $6 million, $7 million and $7 million for the years ended
      December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Recently
      Issued Accounting Standards

In
      November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153,

Exchanges
      of Non-monetary Assets — An Amendment of APB No. 29

.
      This
      statement eliminates the exception to fair value for exchanges of similar
      productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchange
      transactions that do not have commercial substance — that is, transactions that
      are not expected to result in significant changes in the cash flows of the
      reporting entity. We adopted this pronouncement effective April 1, 2005. The
      exchange transaction discussed in Note 3 was accounted for under this standard.

In
      December 2004, the FASB issued the revised SFAS No. 123,

Share
      — Based Payment

,
      which
      addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions in which a company
      receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of that
      company or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company’s
      equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity
      instruments. This statement will be effective for the Company beginning January
      1, 2006. Because Charter adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS

No.
      on January 1, 2003, the Company does not expect this revised standard to have
      a
      material impact on its financial statements.

In
      March
      2005, the FASB issued FIN 47,

Accounting
      for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations.

This
      interpretation clarifies that the term "conditional asset retirement obligation"
      as used in FASB Statement No. 143,

Accounting
      for Asset Retirement Obligations

,
      refers
      to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the
      timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may
      or
      may not be within the control of the entity. This pronouncement is effective
      for
      fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. The adoption of this interpretation
      did not have a material impact on our financial statements.

Charter
      does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective
      accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the
      Company’s accompanying financial statements.

Subsequent
                Events

In
          February 2006, the Company signed two separate definitive agreements to
          sell
          certain cable television systems serving a total of approximately 316,000
          analog
          video customers in West Virginia, Virginia, Illinois and Kentucky for a
          total of
          approximately $896 million. The closings of these transactions are expected
          to
          occur in the third quarter of 2006. Under the terms of the Bridge Loan,
          bridge
          availability will be reduced by the proceeds of asset
          sales.
