PART

Item

Business.

Introduction

Charter
      Communications, Inc. ("Charter") is a broadband communications company operating
      in the United States, with approximately 5.73 million customers at December
      31,
      2006. Through our hybrid fiber and coaxial cable network, we offer our customers
      traditional cable video programming (analog and digital, which we refer to
      as
      "video" service), high-speed Internet access, advanced broadband cable services
      (such as Charter OnDemand

TM

video service ("OnDemand"), high definition television service,
      and
      digital video recorder (“DVR”) service) and, in many of our markets, telephone
      service. See

Item
      1.

      Products and Services

"

for
      further description of these terms, including

"

customers.

"

At
      December 31, 2006, we served approximately 5.43 million analog video customers,
      of which approximately 2.81 million were also digital video customers. We also
      served approximately 2.40 million high-speed Internet customers (including
      approximately 268,900 who received only high-speed Internet services). We also
      provided telephone service to approximately 445,800 customers (including
      approximately 27,200 who received only telephone service).

At
      December 31, 2006, our investment in cable properties, long-term debt,
      accumulated deficit and total shareholders’ deficit were $14.4 billion, $19.1
      billion, $11.5 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively. Our working capital
      deficit was $959 million at December 31, 2006. For the year ended
      December 31, 2006, our revenues, net loss applicable to common stock, and
      net loss per common share were approximately $5.5 billion, $1.4 billion, and
      $4.13, respectively.

We
      have a
      history of net losses. Further, we expect to continue to report net losses
      for
      the foreseeable future. Our net losses are principally attributable to
      insufficient revenue to cover the combination of operating expenses and interest
      expenses we incur because of our high level of debt and depreciation expenses
      that we incur resulting from the capital investments we have made and continue
      to make in our cable properties. We expect that these expenses will remain
      significant.

Charter
      was organized as a Delaware corporation in 1999 and completed an initial public
      offering of its Class A common stock in November 1999. Charter is a holding
      company whose principal assets are an approximate 55% equity interest (52%
      for
      accounting purposes) and a 100% voting interest in Charter Communications
      Holding Company, LLC (“Charter Holdco”), the direct parent of CCHC, LLC
      (“CCHC”), which is the direct parent of Charter Communications Holdings, LLC
      ("Charter Holdings"). Charter also holds certain preferred equity and
      indebtedness of Charter Holdco that mirror the terms of securities issued by
      Charter. Charter's only business is to act as the sole manager of Charter Holdco
      and its subsidiaries. As sole manager, Charter controls the affairs of Charter
      Holdco and its limited liability company subsidiaries.

Paul
      G.
      Allen controls Charter through an as-converted common equity interest of
      approximately 49% and a voting control interest of 91% as of December 31, 2006.
      He also owns 45% of Charter Holdco through affiliated entities. His membership
      units in Charter Holdco are convertible at any time for shares of our Class
      B
      common stock on a one-for-one basis, which shares are in turn convertible into
      Class A common stock. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one
      vote. Mr. Allen is entitled to ten votes for each share of Class B common stock
      and for each membership unit in Charter Holdco held by him and his affiliates.

Our
      principal executive offices are located at Charter Plaza, 12405 Powerscourt

      posted on our website is not incorporated into this annual report.


Certain
      Significant Developments in 2006

We
      continue to pursue opportunities to improve our liquidity.

Our
      efforts in this regard have resulted in the completion of a number of financing
      and asset sales transactions in 2006, as follows:

·

the
                January 2006 sale by our subsidiaries, CCH II, LLC ("CCH II") and
                CCH II
                Capital Corp., of an additional $450 million principal amount of
                their
                10.250% senior notes due 2010;

·

the
                April 2006 refinancing of our credit
                facilities;

·

the
                September 2006 exchange by our subsidiaries, Charter Holdings, CCH
                I, LLC
                (“CCH I”), CCH I Capital Corp., CCH II and CCH II Capital Corp., of
                approximately $797 million in total principal amount of outstanding
                debt
                securities of Charter Holdings in a private placement for CCH I and
                CCH II
                new debt securities (the “Private Exchange”);

·

the
                September 2006 exchange by us and our subsidiaries, CCHC, CCH II,
                and CCH
                II Capital Corp., of approximately $450 million in total principal
                amount
                of Charter’s 5.875% convertible senior notes due 2009 for cash, shares of
                Charter’s Class A common stock and CCH II new debt securities;
                and

·

the
                third quarter 2006 sales of certain cable television systems serving
                a
                total of approximately 390,300 analog video customers for a total
                sales
                price of approximately $1.0
                billion.

Recent
      Event

In
      February 2007, we engaged J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Banc of America
      Securities LLC, and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. to arrange and syndicate
      a
      refinancing and expansion of our existing $6.85 billion senior secured credit
      facilities.  The proposed transaction includes $8.35 billion of senior
      secured credit facilities, consisting of a $1.5 billion revolving credit
      facility, a $1.5 billion new term facility, and a $5.0 billion refinancing
      term
      loan facility at Charter Communications Operating, LLC and a $350 million third
      lien term loan at CCO Holdings, LLC, (collectively, the “Transaction”).

We
      expect
      to use a portion of the additional proceeds from the Transaction to redeem
      up to
      $550 million of our subsidiary, CCO Holdings, LLC’s outstanding floating rate
      notes due 2010 and up to $187 million of Charter Holdings' outstanding 8.625%
      senior notes due 2009 in addition to other general corporate purposes. We expect
      that we will enter into the credit facilities in March 2007.  Upon
      completion of the Transaction, we expect to have adequate liquidity to fund
      our
      operations and service our debt through 2008.

Focus
      for 2007

We
      strive
      to provide value to our customers by offering a high-quality suite of services
      including video, high-speed Internet, and telephone service as well as advanced
      offerings including OnDemand video service, high-definition television service,
      and DVR service. We offer our services to encourage customers to subscribe
      to a
      combination of services known as a bundle. We offer a two-services bundle,
      which
      is a combination of two of our service offerings; but our main focus is
      marketing our three-services bundle, also called “Triple Play.” With a bundle,
      the customer receives a lower total price than the sum of the price of
      individual services, along with the convenience of a single bill. By continually
      focusing on the needs of our customers - raising customer service levels and
      investing in products and services they desire - our goal is to be the premier
      provider of in-home entertainment and communications services in the communities
      we serve.

In
      2007,
      we expect to continue with the strategic priorities identified in 2006, which
      were to:

·

improve
                the end-to-end customer experience and increase customer
                loyalty;

·

grow
                sales and retention for all our products and services;

·

drive
                operating and capital effectiveness; and

·

continue
                an opportunistic approach to enhancing liquidity, extending maturities,
                and reducing debt.

We
      strive
      to continually improve our customers’ experiences and, in doing so, to increase
      customer loyalty by instilling a service-oriented culture throughout our care
      centers, field service operations, and corporate support organization.

Charter
      markets its service offerings by employing a segmented, targeted marketing
      approach. We determine which marketing and sales programs are the most effective
      using campaign management tools that track, analyze, and report the results
      of
      our marketing campaigns.


We
      believe that customers value our ability to combine video, high-speed Internet,
      and telephone services into attractively priced bundled offerings that
      distinguish us from the competition. Bundling of services, by combining two
      or
      more Charter services for one value-based price, is fundamental to our marketing
      strategy because we believe bundled offerings increase customer acceptance
      of
      our services, and improve customer retention and satisfaction. We will pursue
      further growth in our customer base through targeted marketing of bundled
      services and continually improving the end-to-end customer experience.

During
      2006, we extended the deployment of our telephone capabilities to approximately
      3.9 million additional homes passed, to reach a total of approximately 6.8
      million homes passed across our network, and we plan to extend to additional
      homes passed in 2007. During 2007, we plan to focus our marketing and sales
      efforts to attract additional customers to our telephone service, primarily
      through bundled offers with our video and high-speed Internet services.

In
      addition to serving and growing our residential customer base, we will increase
      efforts to make video, high-speed Internet and telephone services available
      to
      the business community. We believe that small businesses will find our bundled
      service offerings provide value and convenience, and that we can continue to
      grow this portion of our business.

We
      expect
      to continue a disciplined approach to managing capital expenditures by directing
      resources to initiatives and opportunities offering the highest expected
      returns. We anticipate placing a priority on supporting deployment of telephone
      service to residential and small business customers.

Our
      asset
      sales and operational initiatives in 2006 have improved the density of our
      geographic service areas and provided a more efficient operating platform.
      We
      operate an integrated customer care system to serve our customers.  We are
      deploying telephone service capability to the majority of our systems to more
      effectively leverage the capability of our broadband network, and are making
      a
      series of service improvement initiatives related to our technical operations.
      We expect our continuous improvement initiatives to further enhance the
      operating effectiveness and efficiencies of our operating platform.  We
      will also continue to evaluate our geographic service areas for opportunities
      to
      improve operating and capital efficiencies, through sales,

exchanges
      of systems with other providers, and/or acquisitions of cable
      systems.

In
      2007,
      we will continue to evaluate potential financial transactions that can enhance
      our liquidity, extend debt maturities, and/or reduce our debt.

We
      believe our focus on these strategic priorities will enable us to provide
      greater value to our customers and thereby generate future growth opportunities
      for us.


Corporate
      Organizational Structure

The
      chart
      below sets forth our organizational structure and that of our direct and
      indirect subsidiaries. This chart does not include all of our affiliates and
      subsidiaries and, in some cases, we have combined separate entities for
      presentation purposes. The equity ownership, voting percentages, and
      indebtedness amounts shown below are approximations as of December 31, 2006,
      and
      do not give effect to any exercise, conversion or exchange of then outstanding
      options, preferred stock, convertible notes, and other convertible or
      exchangeable securities. Indebtedness amounts shown below are accreted values
      for financial reporting purposes as of December 31, 2006. See “Item 8. Financial
      Statements and Supplementary Data,” which also includes the principal amount of
      the indebtedness described below.


Charter
      Communications, Inc.

Certain
      provisions of Charter’s certificate of incorporation and Charter Holdco’s
      limited liability company agreement effectively require that Charter’s
      investment in Charter Holdco replicate, on a “mirror” basis, Charter’s
      outstanding equity and debt structure. As a result of these coordinating
      provisions, whenever Charter issues equity or debt, Charter transfers the
      proceeds from such issuance to Charter Holdco, and Charter Holdco issues a
      “mirror” security to Charter that replicates the characteristics of the security
      issued by Charter. Consequently, Charter’s principal assets are an approximate
      55% common equity interest (52% for accounting purposes) and a 100% voting
      interest in Charter Holdco, “mirror” notes that are payable by Charter Holdco to
      Charter that have the same principal amount and terms as Charter’s convertible
      senior notes and preferred units in Charter Holdco that mirror the terms and
      liquidation preferences of Charter’s outstanding preferred stock. Charter
      Holdco, through its subsidiaries, owns cable systems and certain strategic
      investments. As sole manager under applicable operating agreements, Charter
      controls the affairs of Charter Holdco and its limited liability company
      subsidiaries. In addition, Charter also provides management services to Charter
      Holdco and its subsidiaries under a management services agreement.


The
      following table sets forth information as of December 31, 2006 with respect
      to
      the shares of common stock of Charter on an actual outstanding, “as converted”
and “fully diluted” basis:

      Communications Holding Company, LLC.

Charter
      Holdco, a Delaware limited liability company formed on May 25, 1999, is the
      direct 100% parent of CCHC. The common membership units of Charter Holdco are
      owned approximately 55% by Charter, 15% by Vulcan Cable III Inc. and 30% by
      CII.
      All of the outstanding common membership units in Charter Holdco held by Vulcan
      Cable III Inc. and CII are controlled by Mr. Allen and are exchangeable on
      a one-for-one basis at any time for shares of Class B common stock of
      Charter, which are in turn convertible into Class A common stock of
      Charter. Charter controls 100% of the voting power of Charter Holdco and is
      its
      sole manager.

Certain
      provisions of Charter’s certificate of incorporation and Charter Holdco’s
      limited liability company agreement effectively require that Charter’s
      investment in Charter Holdco replicate, on a “mirror” basis, Charter’s
      outstanding equity and debt structure. As a result, in addition to its equity
      interest in common units of Charter Holdco, Charter also holds 100% of the
      5.875% mirror convertible notes of Charter Holdco that automatically convert
      into common membership units upon the conversion of any Charter 5.875%
      convertible senior notes and 100% of the mirror preferred membership units
      of
      Charter Holdco that automatically convert into common membership units upon
      the
      conversion of the Series A convertible redeemable preferred stock of
      Charter.

CCHC,
      LLC.

CCHC, a
      Delaware limited liability company formed on October 25, 2005, is the issuer
      of
      an exchangeable accreting note. In October 2005, Charter, acting through a
      Special Committee of Charter’s Board of Directors, and Mr. Allen, settled a
      dispute that had arisen between the parties with regard to the ownership of
      CC
      VIII. As part of that settlement, CCHC issued the CCHC note to CII.

Interim
      Holding Company Debt Issuers.

As
      indicated in the organizational chart above, our interim holding company debt
      issuers indirectly own the subsidiaries that own or operate all of our cable
      systems, subject to a CC VIII minority interest held by Mr. Allen and CCH I
      as
      described below. For a description of the debt issued by these issuers please
      see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
      Results of Operations — Description of Our Outstanding Debt.”

Preferred
      Equity in CC VIII, LLC.

CII owns
      30% of the CC VIII preferred membership interests. CCH I, a direct subsidiary
      of
      CCH I Holdings, LLC (“CIH”), directly owns the remaining 70% of these preferred
      interests. The common membership interests in CC VIII are indirectly owned
      by
      Charter Operating. See Notes 11 and 22 to our accompanying consolidated
      financial statements contained in “Item 8. Financial Statements and

Products
      and Services

We
      sell
      video services, high-speed Internet services, and in many areas, telephone
      services utilizing our cable system. Our video services include traditional
      cable video services (analog and digital) and in some areas advanced broadband
      services such as high definition television, OnDemand, and DVR. Our telephone
      services are primarily provided using voice over Internet protocol (“VoIP”), to
      transmit digital voice signals over our systems. Our video, high-speed Internet,
      and telephone services are offered to residential and commercial customers.
      We
      sell our video services, high-speed Internet, and telephone services on a
      subscription basis, with prices and related charges that vary primarily based
      on
      the types of service selected, whether the services are sold as a “bundle” or on
      an individual basis, and the equipment necessary to receive the services, with
      some variation in prices depending on geographic location.

The
      following table summarizes our customer statistics for analog and digital video,
      residential high-speed Internet and residential telephone approximate as of
      December 31, 2006 and 2005.

After
      giving effect to the acquisition of cable systems in January 2006 and the sales
      of certain non-strategic cable systems in the third quarter of 2006, December
      31, 2005 analog video customers, digital video customers, high-speed Internet
      customers and telephone customers would have been 5,506,800, 2,638,500,
      2,097,700 and 136,000, respectively.

(a)

“Customers”
                include all persons our corporate billing records show as receiving
                service (regardless of their payment status), except for complimentary
                accounts (such as our employees). In addition, at December 31, 2006
                and
                2005, “customers” include approximately 35,700 and 50,500 persons whose
                accounts were over 60 days past due in payment, approximately 6,000
                and
                14,300 persons, whose accounts were over 90 days past due in payment
                and
                approximately 2,700 and 7,400 of which were over 120 days past due
                in
                payment, respectively

.

(b)

“Analog
                video customers” include all customers who receive video
                services.

(c)

Included
                within “video customers” are those in commercial and multi-dwelling
                structures, which are calculated on an equivalent bulk unit (“EBU”) basis.
                EBU is calculated for a system by dividing the bulk price charged
                to
                accounts in an area by the most prevalent price charged to non-bulk
                residential customers in that market for the comparable tier of service.
                The EBU method of estimating analog video customers is consistent
                with the
                methodology used in determining costs paid to programmers and has
                been
                used consistently.

(d)

“Digital
                video customers” include all households that have one or more digital
                set-top boxes or cable cards deployed.

(e)

"Residential
                high-speed Internet customers" represent those residential customers
                who
                subscribe to our high-speed Internet service.


(f)

“Residential
                  telephone customers” include all residential customers receiving telephone
                  service.

Video
      Services

In
      2006,
      video services represented 61% of our total revenues. Our video service
      offerings include the following:

High-Speed
      Internet Services

In
      2006,
      residential high-speed Internet services represented 19% of our total revenues.
      We offer several tiers of high-speed Internet services to our residential
      customers primarily via cable modems attached to personal computers. We also
      offer home networking gateways to these customers.

Telephone
      Services

In
      2006,
      telephone services represented 2% of our total revenues. We provide voice
      communications services primarily using VoIP, to transmit digital voice signals
      over our systems. At December 31, 2006, telephone service was available to
      approximately 6.8 million homes passed, and we were marketing these services
      to
      approximately 93% of those homes. We will continue to prepare additional markets
      for telephone launches in 2007.


Commercial
      Services

In
      2006,
      commercial services represented 6% of our total revenues. We offer integrated
      network solutions to commercial and institutional customers. These solutions
      include high-speed Internet and video services. In addition, we offer high-speed
      Internet services to small businesses. We will continue to expand the marketing
      of our video and high-speed Internet services to the business community and
      have
      begun to introduce telephone services.

Sale
      of Advertising

In
      2006,
      sale of advertising represented 6% of our total revenues. We receive revenues
      from the sale of local advertising on satellite-delivered networks such as
      MTV®,
      CNN® and ESPN®. In any particular market, we generally insert local advertising
      on up to 40 channels. We also provide cross-channel advertising to some
      programmers.

From
      time
      to time, certain of our vendors, including programmers and equipment vendors,
      have purchased advertising from us. For the years ending December 31, 2006,
      and 2004, we had advertising revenues from programmers of approximately $17
      million, $15 million, and $16 million, respectively. These revenues resulted
      from purchases at market rates pursuant to binding agreements.

Pricing
      of Our Products and Services

Our
      revenues are derived principally from the monthly fees customers pay for the
      services we offer. We typically charge a one-time installation fee which is
      sometimes waived or discounted during certain promotional periods. The prices
      we
      charge for our products and services vary based on the level of service the
      customer chooses and the geographic market. Most of our pricing is reviewed
      throughout the year and adjusted on an annual basis.

In
      accordance with the Federal Communications Commission’s (“FCC”) rules, the
      prices we charge for video cable-related equipment, such as set-top boxes and
      remote control devices, and for installation services, are based on actual
      costs
      plus a permitted rate of return in regulated markets.

Although
      our broadband service offerings vary across the markets we serve because of
      various factors including competition, regulatory factors, and service
      availability, our services are typically offered at monthly prices, excluding
      franchise fees and other taxes.

We

offer
      reduced-price service for promotional periods in order to attract new customers
      and to promote the bundling of two or more services. There is no assurance
      that
      these customers will remain as customers when the promotional pricing service
      expires. When customers bundle services, they enjoy prices that are lower per
      service than if they had only purchased a single service.

Our
      Network Technology

We
      employ
      the hybrid fiber coaxial cable (“HFC”) architecture for our systems. HFC
      architecture combines the use of fiber optic cable with coaxial cable. In most
      systems, we deliver our signals via fiber optic cable from the headend to a
      group of nodes, and use coaxial cable to deliver the signal from individual
      nodes to the homes passed served by that node. Our system design enables a
      maximum of 500 homes passed to be served by a single node. Currently, our
      average node serves approximately 385 homes passed. Our system design provides
      for six strands of fiber to each node, with two strands activated and four
      strands reserved for spares and future services. We believe that this hybrid
      network design provides high capacity and signal quality. The design also
      provides reserve capacity for the addition of future services.

HFC
      architecture benefits include:


The
      following table sets forth the technological capacity of our systems as of
      December 31, 2006 based on a percentage of homes passed:

Approximately
      93% of our homes passed are served by systems that have bandwidth of 550
      megahertz or greater. This bandwidth capacity enables us to offer digital
      television, high-speed Internet services, telephone service and other advanced
      services.

We
      have
      reduced the number of headends that serve our customers from 1,138 at
      January 1, 2001 to 553 at December 31, 2006. Because headends are the
      control centers of a cable system, where incoming signals are amplified,
      converted, processed and combined for transmission to the customer, reducing
      the
      number of headends reduces related equipment, service personnel, and maintenance
      expenditures. As of December 31, 2006, approximately 88% of our customers were
      served by headends serving at least 10,000 customers. After completion of the
      sale of certain cable systems in January 2007, we further reduced the number
      of
      headends that serve our customers to 393.

As
      of
      December 31, 2006, our cable systems consisted of approximately 205,500
      strand and trench miles of coax, and approximately 54,300 strand and trench
      miles of fiber optic cable, passing approximately 11.8 million households and
      serving approximately 5.7 million customers. After completion of the sale of
      certain cable systems in January 2007, our cable systems consisted of
      approximately 201,700 strand and trench miles of coax, and approximately 54,100
      strand and trench miles of fiber optic cable, passing approximately 11.7 million
      households and serving approximately 5.7 million customers.

Management
      of Our Systems

The
      corporate office, which includes employees of Charter and Charter Holdco, is
      responsible for coordinating and overseeing overall operations including
      establishing company wide policies and procedures. The corporate office performs
      certain financial and administrative functions on a centralized basis such
      as
      accounting, cash management, taxes, billing, finance, human resources, risk
      management, telephone, payroll, information system design and support, internal
      audit, legal, purchasing, customer care, marketing and programming contract
      administration and Internet service, network and circuits administration and
      oversight and coordination of external auditors and consultants. The corporate
      office performs these services on a cost reimbursement basis pursuant to a
      management services agreement. Our field operations are managed within three
      divisions. Each division has a divisional president and is supported by
      operational, financial, legal, customer care, marketing and engineering
      functions.

Customer
      Care

Our
      customer care centers are managed centrally, with the deployment and execution
      of care strategies and initiatives conducted on a company-wide basis. As a
      result of facilities consolidations that occurred in 2006, we have seven
      customer care locations, compared to the thirteen locations at December 31,
      and have launched technology and procedures resulting in the seven locations
      being able to function as an integrated system. We believe that consolidation
      and integration of our care centers will allow us to improve service delivery
      and customer satisfaction.

We
      provide service to our customers 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and utilize
      technologically advanced equipment that we believe enhances interactions with
      our customers through more intelligent call routing, data management, and
      forecasting and scheduling capabilities. We believe that through continued
      optimization of our care network we will be able to improve complaint
      resolution, equipment troubleshooting, sales of new and additional services,
      and
      customer retention.

We
      are
      committed to making further improvements in the area of customer care to
      increase customer retention and satisfaction. Accordingly, we have certain
      initiatives underway targeted at gaining new customers and retaining existing
      ones. We have increased efforts to focus management attention on instilling
      a
      customer service oriented culture throughout our organization, and to give
      the
      customer service areas of our operations resources for staffing, training,
      and
      financial incentives for employee performance.


We
      have
      agreements with three third party call center service providers. We believe
      these relationships further our service objectives and support marketing
      activities by providing additional capacity to respond to customer
      inquiries.

We
      also
      utilize our website to enhance customer care by enabling customers to view
      and
      pay their bills online, obtain useful information, and perform various equipment
      troubleshooting procedures. Our customers may also obtain support through our
      on-line chat and email functionality.

Sales
      and Marketing

In
      2006,
      our primary strategic direction was to accelerate the rate of revenue growth
      by
      increasing our investments in marketing, sustaining these higher investments
      throughout the year, and implementing targeted marketing programs designed
      to
      offer appropriate bundles of products to the appropriate existing and potential
      customers. Marketing expenditures increased by $38 million, or 27%, over the
      year ended December 31, 2005 to $180 million for the year ended December 31,
      2006. We expect to continue to invest in targeted marketing efforts in 2007.

Our
      marketing organization is intended to promote interaction, information flow,
      and
      sharing of best practices between our corporate office and our field offices,
      which make local decisions as to when and how certain marketing programs will
      be
      implemented.  We monitor customer perception, competition, pricing, and
      service preferences, among other factors, to increase our responsiveness to
      our
      customers. Our coordinated marketing activities involve door-to-door,
      telemarketing, media advertising, e-marketing, direct mail, and retail
      locations. In 2006, we increased our focus on migrating existing single service
      customers into multiple service bundles and launching our telephone service.

Programming

General

We
      believe that offering a wide variety of programming influences a customer’s
      decision to subscribe to and retain our cable services. We rely on market
      research, customer demographics and local programming preferences to determine
      channel offerings in each of our markets. We obtain basic and premium
      programming from a number of suppliers, usually pursuant to written contracts.
      Our programming contracts generally continue for a fixed period of time, usually
      from three to ten years, and are subject to negotiated renewal. Some program
      suppliers offer financial incentives to support the launch of a channel and/or
      ongoing marketing support. We also negotiate volume discount pricing structures.
      Programming costs are usually payable each month based on calculations performed
      by us and are generally subject to annual cost escalations and audits by the
      programmers.

Costs

Programming
      is usually made available to us for a license fee, which is generally paid
      based
      on the number of customers to whom we make such programming available. Such
      license fees may include “volume” discounts available for higher numbers of
      customers, as well as discounts for channel placement or service penetration.
      Some channels are available without cost to us for a limited period of time,
      after which we pay for the programming. For home shopping channels, we receive
      a
      percentage of the revenue attributable to our customers’ purchases.

Our
      cable
      programming costs have increased in every year we have operated in excess of
      customary inflationary and cost-of-living type increases. We expect them to
      continue to increase due to a variety of factors, including annual increases
      imposed by programmers and additional programming, including high-definition
      and
      OnDemand programming, being provided to customers. In particular, sports
      programming costs have increased significantly over the past several years.
      In
      addition, contracts to purchase sports programming sometimes provide for
      optional additional programming to be available on a surcharge basis during
      the
      term of the contract.

Federal
      law allows commercial television broadcast stations to make an election between
      “must-carry” rights and an alternative “retransmission-consent” regime. When a
      station opts for the retransmission-consent regime, we are not allowed to carry
      the station’s signal without the station’s permission. Future demands by owners
      of broadcast stations for carriage of other services or cash payments to those
      broadcasters in exchange for retransmission consent could further increase
      our
      programming costs or require us to cease carriage of popular programming,
      potentially leading to a loss of customers in affected markets.


Over
      the
      past several years, we have not been able to increase prices sufficiently to
      fully offset increased programming costs, and with the impact of competition
      and
      other marketplace factors, we do not expect to be able to do so in the
      foreseeable future.

In
      addition, our

inability
      to fully pass these programming cost increases on to our customers has had
      and
      is expected in the future to have an adverse impact on our cash flow and
      operating margins.

In
      order
      to mitigate reductions of our operating margins due to rapidly increasing
      programming costs, we are reviewing our pricing and programming packaging
      strategies, and we plan to continue to migrate certain program services from
      our
      analog level of service to our digital tiers. As we migrate our programming
      to
      our digital tier packages, certain programming that was previously available
      to
      all of our customers via an analog signal, may only be part of an elective
      digital tier package offered to our customers for an additional fee. As a
      result, we expect that the customer base upon which we pay programming fees
      will
      proportionately decrease, and the overall expense for providing that service
      will likewise decrease. However, reductions in the size of certain programming
      customer bases may result in the loss of specific volume discount benefits.

We
      have
      programming contracts that have expired and others that will expire at or before
      the end of 2007.

We
      plan
      to seek to renegotiate the terms of these agreements as they come due for
      renewal.

There
      can
      be no assurance that these agreements will be renewed on favorable or comparable
      terms. To the extent that we are unable to reach agreement with certain
      programmers on terms that we believe are reasonable, we have been, and may
      in
      the future be, forced to remove such programming channels from our line-up,
      which may result in a loss of customers.

Franchises

As
      of
      December 31, 2006, our systems operated pursuant to a total of
      approximately 3,600 franchises, permits, and similar authorizations issued
      by
      local and state governmental authorities. Such governmental authorities often
      must approve a transfer to another party. Most franchises are subject to
      termination proceedings in the event of a material breach. In addition, most
      franchises require us to pay the granting authority a franchise fee of up to
      5.0% of revenues as defined in the various agreements, which is the maximum
      amount that may be charged under the applicable federal law. We are entitled
      to
      and generally do pass this fee through to the customer.

Prior
      to
      the scheduled expiration of most franchises, we generally initiate renewal
      proceedings with the granting authorities. This process usually takes three
      years but can take a longer period of time. The Communications Act of 1934,
      as
      amended (the “Communications Act”), which is the primary federal statute
      regulating interstate communications, provides for an orderly franchise renewal
      process in which granting authorities may not unreasonably withhold renewals.
      In
      connection with the franchise renewal process, many governmental authorities
      require the cable operator to make certain commitments, such as building out
      certain of the franchise areas at various levels of service requirements and
      allowing for public access channels. Historically we have been able to renew
      our
      franchises without incurring significant costs, although any particular
      franchise may not be renewed on commercially favorable terms or otherwise.
      Our
      failure to obtain renewals of our franchises, especially those in the major
      metropolitan areas where we have the most customers, could have a material
      adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations,
      or our liquidity, including our ability to comply with our debt covenants.
      Approximately 12% of our franchises, covering approximately 15% of our analog
      video customers were expired at December 31, 2006. Approximately 8% of
      additional franchises, covering approximately 11% of additional analog video
      customers will expire on or before December 31, 2007, if not renewed prior
      to
      expiration. We expect to renew all or substantially all of these
      franchises.

Legislative
      proposals have been introduced in the United States Congress and in some state
      legislatures to streamline cable franchising. This legislation is intended
      to
      facilitate entry by new competitors, particularly local telephone companies.
      See
“— Regulation and Legislation — Vi

      Services —

Franchise
      Matters.”

Competition

We
      face
      competition in the areas of price, service offerings, and service reliability.
      We compete with other providers of television signals and other sources of
      home
      entertainment. In addition, as we continue to expand into additional services
      such as high-speed Internet access and telephone, we face competition from
      other
      providers of each type of service. We operate in a very competitive business
      environment, which can adversely affect our business and operations.

In
      terms
      of competition for customers, we view ourselves as a member of the broadband
      communications industry, which encompasses multi-channel video for television
      and related broadband services, such as high-speed Internet, telephone, and
      other interactive video services. In the broadband industry, our principal
      competitor for video services throughout our territory is direct broadcast
      satellite (“DBS”) and our principal competitor for high-speed


Internet
      services is digital subscriber line (“DSL”) provided by telephone companies. Our
      principal competitors for telephone services are established telephone companies
      and other carriers, including VoIP providers. Based on telephone companies’
entry into video service and the upgrades of their networks, they will likely
      become increasingly more significant competitors for both high-speed Internet
      and video customers. We do not consider other cable operators to be significant
      competitors in our overall market, as overbuilds are infrequent and
      geographically spotty (although in any particular market, a cable operator
      overbuilder would likely be a significant competitor at the local level).

Although
      cable operators tend not to be direct competitors, their relative size may
      affect the competitive landscape in terms of how a cable company competes
      against non-cable competitors in the market place as well as in relationships
      with vendors who deal with cable operators. For example, a larger cable operator
      might have better access to and pricing for the multiple types of services
      cable
      companies offer. Also, a larger entity might have more advantageous access
      to
      financial resources and acquisition opportunities.

Our
      key
      competitors include:

DBS

Direct
      broadcast satellite is a significant competitor to cable systems. The DBS
      industry has grown rapidly over the last several years, and now serves more
      than
      27 million subscribers nationwide. DBS service allows the subscriber to receive
      video services directly via satellite using a dish antenna. Furthermore,
      EchoStar and DirecTV both have entered into joint marketing agreements with
      major telecommunications companies to offer bundled packages combining
      telephone, including wireless, as well as high-speed Internet and video
      services.

Video
      compression technology and high powered satellites allow DBS providers to offer
      more than 200 digital channels from a single satellite, thereby surpassing
      the
      typical analog cable system. In 2006, major DBS competitors offered a greater
      variety of channel packages, and were especially competitive at the lower end
      pricing, such as a monthly price of approximately $35 for 60 channels compared
      to approximately $50 for the closest comparable package offered by us in most
      of
      our markets. In addition, while we continue to believe that the initial
      investment by a DBS customer exceeds that of a cable customer, the initial
      equipment cost for DBS has decreased substantially, as the DBS providers have
      aggressively marketed offers to new customers of incentives for discounted
      or
      free equipment, installation, and multiple units. DBS providers are able to
      offer service nationwide and are able to establish a national image and branding
      with standardized offerings, which together with their ability to avoid
      franchise fees of up to 5% of revenues and property tax, leads to greater
      efficiencies and lower costs in the lower tiers of service. However, we believe
      that cable-delivered OnDemand and Subscription OnDemand services are superior
      to
      DBS service, because cable headends can store thousands of titles which
      customers can access and control independently, whereas DBS technology can
      only
      make available a much smaller number of titles with DVR-like customer control.
      We also believe that our higher tier services, particularly bundled premium
      packages, are price-competitive with DBS packages, and that many consumers
      prefer our ability to economically bundle video packages with high-speed
      Internet packages. Further, cable providers have the potential in some areas
      to
      provide a more complete “whole house” communications package when combining
      video, high-speed Internet, and telephone services. We believe that this ability
      to bundle services differentiates us from DBS competitors and could enable
      us to
      win back former customers who migrated to satellite. However, joint marketing
      arrangements between DBS providers and telecommunications carriers allow similar
      bundling of services in certain areas, and DBS providers are making investments
      to offer more high definition programming, including local high definition
      programming.

Competition
      from DBS service providers may also present greater challenges in areas of
      lower
      population density, and we believe that our systems serve a higher concentration
      of such areas than those of other major cable service providers.

DBS
      providers have made attempts at widespread deployment of high-speed Internet
      access services via satellite, but those services have been technically
      constrained and of limited appeal. DBS providers continue to explore options,
      such as combining satellite communications with terrestrial wireless networks,
      to provide high-speed Internet and other services. DBS providers have entered
      into joint marketing arrangements with telecommunications carriers allowing
      them
      to offer terrestrial DSL services in many markets.

Telephone
      Companies and Utilities

The
      competitive environment has been significantly affected by technological
      developments and regulatory changes enacted under the Telecommunication Act
      of
      1996 (the “1996 Telecom Act”), which amended the Communications Act and which is
      designed to enhance competition in the cable television and local telephone
      markets. Federal


cross-ownership
      restrictions historically limited entry by local telephone companies into the
      cable business. The 1996 Telecom Act modified this cross-ownership restriction,
      making it possible for local exchange carriers, who have considerable resources,
      to provide a wide variety of video services competitive with services offered
      by
      cable systems.

Telephone
      companies already provide facilities for the transmission and distribution
      of
      voice and data services, including Internet services, in competition with our
      existing or potential interactive services ventures and businesses. Telephone
      companies can obtain the right to lawfully enter the cable television business
      and some telephone companies have been extensively upgrading their networks
      to
      provide video services, as well as telephone and Internet access service.

Two
      major
      local telephone companies, AT&T Inc. (“AT&T”) and Verizon
      Communications, Inc. (“Verizon”), have both announced that they intend to invest
      in upgrading their networks. Some upgraded portions of these networks are or
      will be capable of carrying two-way video services that are technically
      comparable to ours, high-speed Internet services that operate at speeds as
      high
      as or higher than those we make available to customers in these areas, and
      digital voice services that are similar to ours. In addition, these companies
      continue to offer their traditional telephone services, as well as bundles
      that
      include wireless voice services provided by affiliated companies. We believe
      that AT&T’s and Verizon’s upgrades have been completed in systems
      representing approximately 1% of our homes passed as of December 31,
      2006.

Additional upgrades in markets in which we operate are expected.

Although
      telephone companies have obtained franchises or alternative authorizations
      in
      some areas and are seeking them in others, they are attempting through various
      means (including federal and state legislation and through FCC rulemaking)
      to
      weaken or streamline the franchising requirements applicable to them. If
      telephone companies are successful in avoiding or weakening the franchise and
      other regulatory requirements that are applicable to cable operators like
      Charter, their competitive posture would be enhanced. We cannot predict the
      likelihood of success of the broadband services offered by our competitors
      or
      the impact on us of such competitive ventures. The large scale entry of major
      telephone companies as direct competitors in the video marketplace could
      adversely affect the profitability and valuation of established cable
      systems.

DSL
      service allows Internet access to subscribers at data transmission speeds
      greater than those available over conventional telephone lines. DSL service
      therefore is more competitive with high-speed Internet access over cable systems
      than conventional dial-up. Most telephone companies which already have plant,
      an
      existing customer base, and other operational functions in place (such as,
      billing, service personnel, etc.), offer DSL service. DSL actively markets
      its
      service, and many providers have offered promotional pricing with a one-year
      service agreement. The FCC has determined that DSL service is an “information
      service,” and based on that classification has removed DSL service from many
      traditional telecommunications regulations. Legislative action and the FCC's
      decisions and policies in this area are subject to change. We expect DSL to
      remain a significant competitor to our high-speed Internet services,
      particularly as we enter the telephone business and telephone companies
      aggressively bundle DSL with telephone service to discourage their customers
      from switching to cable company services. In addition, the continuing deployment
      of fiber into telephone companies’ networks will enable them to provide higher
      bandwidth Internet service than provided over traditional DSL
      lines.

We
      believe that pricing for residential and commercial Internet services on our
      system is generally comparable to that for similar DSL services and that some
      residential customers prefer our ability to bundle Internet services with video
      and/or telephone services, and prefer the higher Internet speeds we have made
      more generally available. However, DSL providers may currently be in a better
      position to offer data services to businesses since their networks tend to
      be
      more complete in commercial areas. They also have the ability to bundle
      telephone with Internet services for a higher percentage of their customers,
      and
      that ability is appealing to many consumers. Joint marketing arrangements
      between DSL providers and DBS providers may allow some additional bundling
      of
      services.

Charter
      offers telephone service in a majority of its service areas. Charter also
      provides traditional circuit-switched telephone service in a few communities.
      In
      these areas, Charter competes directly with established telephone companies
      and
      other carriers, including VoIP providers, for voice service customers. Because
      we offer voice services, we are subject to considerable competition from
      telephone companies and other telecommunications providers. The
      telecommunications industry is highly competitive and includes competitors
      with
      greater financial and personnel resources, strong brand name recognition, and
      long-standing relationships with regulatory authorities and customers. Moreover,
      mergers, joint ventures and alliances among franchise, wireless, or private
      cable operators, local exchange carriers, and others, may result in providers
      capable of offering cable television, Internet, and telephone services in direct
      competition with us. For example, major local exchange carriers have entered
      into


arrangements
      with EchoStar and DirecTV in which they will market packages combining telephone
      service, DSL, and DBS services.

Additionally,
      we are subject to competition from utilities which possess fiber optic
      transmission lines capable of transmitting signals with minimal signal
      distortion. Utilities are also developing broadband over power line technology,
      which may allow the provision of Internet and other broadband services to homes
      and offices. Utilities have deployed broadband over power line technology in
      a
      few limited markets.

Broadcast
      Television

Cable
      television has long competed with broadcast television, which consists of
      television signals that the viewer is able to receive without charge using
      an
“off-air” antenna. The extent of such competition is dependent upon the quality
      and quantity of broadcast signals available through “off-air” reception,
      compared to the services provided by the local cable system. Traditionally,
      cable television has provided higher picture quality and more channel offerings
      than broadcast television. However, the recent licensing of digital spectrum
      by
      the FCC will provide traditional broadcasters with the ability to deliver high
      definition television pictures and multiple digital-quality program streams,
      as
      well as advanced digital services such as subscription video and data
      transmission.

Traditional
      Overbuilds

Cable
      systems are operated under non-exclusive franchises granted by local
      authorities. More than one cable system may legally be built in the same area.
      It is possible that a franchising authority might grant a second franchise
      to
      another cable operator and that such a franchise might contain terms and
      conditions more favorable than those afforded us. In addition, entities willing
      to establish an open video system, under which they offer unaffiliated
      programmers non-discriminatory access to a portion of the system’s cable system,
      may be able to avoid local franchising requirements. Well-financed businesses
      from outside the cable industry, such as public utilities that already possess
      fiber optic and other transmission lines in the areas they serve, may over
      time
      become competitors. There are a number of cities that have constructed their
      own
      cable systems, in a manner similar to city-provided utility services. There
      also
      has been interest in traditional cable overbuilds by private companies.
      Constructing a competing cable system is a capital intensive process which
      involves a high degree of risk. We believe that in order to be successful,
      a
      competitor’s overbuild would need to be able to serve the homes and businesses
      in the overbuilt area with equal or better service quality, on a more
      cost-effective basis than we can. Any such overbuild operation would require
      either significant access to capital or access to facilities already in place
      that are capable of delivering cable television programming.

As
      of
      December 31, 2006, we are aware of traditional overbuild situations
      impacting approximately 7% of our total homes passed and potential traditional
      overbuild situations in areas servicing approximately an additional 4% of our
      total homes passed. Additional overbuild situations may occur.

Private
      Cable

Additional
      competition is posed by satellite master antenna television systems, or SMATV
      systems, serving multiple dwelling units, or MDUs, such as condominiums,
      apartment complexes, and private residential communities. These private cable
      systems may enter into exclusive agreements with such MDUs, which may preclude
      operators of franchise systems from serving residents of such private complexes.
      Private cable systems can offer improved reception of local television stations,
      and many of the same satellite-delivered program services that are offered
      by
      cable systems. SMATV systems currently benefit from operating advantages not
      available to franchised cable systems, including fewer regulatory burdens and
      no
      requirement to service low density or economically depressed communities.
      Exemption from regulation may provide a competitive advantage to certain of
      our
      current and potential competitors.

Wireless
      Distribution

Cable
      systems also compete with wireless program distribution services such as
      multi-channel multipoint distribution systems or “wireless cable,” known as
      MMDS, which uses low-power microwave frequencies to transmit television
      programming over-the-air to paying customers. MMDS services, however, require
      unobstructed “line of sight” transmission paths, and MMDS ventures have been
      quite limited to date.


The
      FCC
      has completed its auction of Multichannel Video Distribution & Data Service
      (“MVDDS”) licenses. MVDDS is a new terrestrial video and data fixed wireless
      service that the FCC hopes will spur competition in the cable and DBS
      industries.

Other
      Competitors

Local
      wireless Internet services have recently begun to operate in many markets using
      available unlicensed radio spectrum. Some cellular phone service operators
      are
      also marketing PC cards offering wireless broadband access to their cellular
      networks. These service options offer another alternative to cable-based
      Internet access.

High-speed
      Internet access facilitates the streaming of video into homes and businesses.
      As
      the quality and availability of video streaming over the Internet improves,
      video streaming likely will compete with the traditional delivery of video
      programming services over cable systems. It is possible that programming
      suppliers will consider bypassing cable operators and market their services
      directly to the consumer through video streaming over the Internet.

Regulation
      and Legislation

The
      following summary addresses the key regulatory and legislative developments
      affecting the cable industry and our three primary services: video service,
      high-speed Internet service, and telephone service. Cable system operations
      are
      extensively regulated by the FCC, certain state governments, and most local
      governments. A failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to
      substantial penalties. Our business can be dramatically impacted by changes
      to
      the existing regulatory framework, whether triggered by legislative,
      administrative, or judicial rulings. Congress and the FCC have expressed a
      particular interest in increasing competition in the communications field
      generally and in the cable television field specifically. The 1996 Telecom
      Act
      altered the regulatory structure governing the nation's communications
      providers. It removed barriers to competition in both the cable television
      market and the local telephone market. At the same time, the FCC has pursued
      spectrum licensing options designed to increase competition to the cable
      industry by wireless multichannel video programming distributors. We could
      be
      materially disadvantaged in the future if we are subject to new regulations
      that
      do not equally impact our key competitors.

Congress
      and the FCC have frequently revisited the subject of communications regulation,
      and they are likely to do so in the future. In addition, franchise agreements
      with local governments must be periodically renewed, and new operating terms
      may
      be imposed. Future legislative, regulatory, or judicial changes could adversely
      affect our operations. We can provide no assurance that the already extensive
      regulation of our business will not be expanded in the future.

Video

Service

Cable
      Rate Regulation.

The
      cable industry has operated under a federal rate regulation regime for more
      than
      a decade. The regulations currently restrict the prices that cable systems
      charge for the minimum level of video programming service, referred to as “basic
      service,” and associated equipment. All other cable offerings are now
      universally exempt from rate regulation. Although basic rate regulation operates
      pursuant to a federal formula, local governments, commonly referred to as local
      franchising authorities, are primarily responsible for administering this
      regulation. The majority of our local franchising authorities have never been
      certified to regulate basic cable rates (and order rate reductions and refunds),
      but they retain the right to do so, except in those specific communities facing
      “effective competition,” as defined under federal law. With increased DBS
      competition, our systems are increasingly likely to satisfy the effective
      competition standard. We have already secured FCC recognition of effective
      competition, and become rate deregulated in many of our
      communities.

There
      have been frequent calls to impose expanded rate regulation on the cable
      industry. Confronted with rapidly increasing cable programming costs, it is
      possible that Congress may adopt new constraints on the retail pricing or
      packaging of cable programming. For example, there has been considerable
      legislative and regulatory interest in requiring cable operators to offer
      historically bundled programming services on an

à
la
      carte

basis,
      or to at least offer a separately available child-friendly “Family Tier.” Such
      constraints could adversely affect our operations.

Federal
      rate regulations generally require cable operators to allow subscribers to
      purchase premium or pay-per-view services without the necessity of subscribing
      to any tier of service, other than the basic service tier. The applicability
      of
      this rule in certain situations remains unclear, and adverse decisions by the
      FCC could affect our


pricing
      and packaging of services. As we attempt to respond to a changing marketplace
      with competitive pricing practices, such as targeted promotions and discounts,
      we may face Communications Act uniform pricing requirements that impede our
      ability to compete.

Must
      Carry/Retransmission Consent.

There
      are
      two alternative legal methods for carriage of local broadcast television
      stations on cable systems. Federal “must carry” regulations require cable
      systems to carry local broadcast television stations upon the request of the
      local broadcaster. Alternatively, federal law includes “retransmission consent”
regulations, by which popular commercial television stations can prohibit cable
      carriage unless the cable operator first negotiates for “retransmission
      consent,” which may be conditioned on significant payments or other concessions.
      Broadcast stations must elect “must carry” or “retransmission consent” every
      three years, with the next election to be made prior to September 15, 2008.
      Either option has a potentially adverse effect on our business.

The
      burden associated with must carry could increase significantly if cable systems
      were required to simultaneously carry both the analog and digital signals of
      each television station (dual carriage), as the broadcast industry transitions
      from an analog to a digital format. The burden could also increase significantly
      if cable systems are required to carry multiple program streams included within
      a single digital broadcast transmission (multicast carriage).

Additional
      government-mandated broadcast carriage obligations could disrupt existing
      programming commitments, interfere with our preferred use of limited channel
      capacity, and limit our ability to offer services that appeal to our customers
      and generate revenues. The FCC issued a decision in 2005 confirming an earlier
      ruling against mandating either dual carriage or multicast carriage. However,
      the FCC could reverse its own ruling or Congress could legislate additional
      carriage obligations. Federal law has established February 2009 as the deadline
      to complete the broadcast transition to digital spectrum and to reclaim analog
      spectrum. Cable operators may need to take additional operational steps and/or
      make further operating and capital investments at that time to ensure that
      customers not otherwise equipped to receive digital programming, retain access
      to broadcast programming.

Access
      Channels.

Local
      franchise agreements often require cable operators to set aside certain channels
      for public, educational, and governmental access programming. Federal law also
      requires cable systems to designate a portion of their channel capacity for
      commercial leased access by unaffiliated third parties. The FCC has recently
      announced its intention to conduct a rulemaking aimed at increasing the use
      of
      commercial leased access channels. Increased activity in this area could further
      burden the channel capacity of our cable systems, and potentially limit the
      amount of services we are able to offer and may necessitate further investments
      to expand our network capacity.

Access
      to Programming.

The
      Communications Act and the FCC’s “program access” rules generally prevent
      satellite video programmers affiliated with cable operators from favoring cable
      operators over competing multichannel video distributors, such as DBS, and
      limit
      the ability of such programmers to offer exclusive programming arrangements
      to
      cable operators. The FCC has extended the exclusivity restrictions through
      October 2007. Given the heightened competition and media consolidation that
      Charter faces, it is possible that we will find it increasingly difficult to
      gain access to popular programming at favorable terms. Such difficulty could
      adversely impact our business.

Ownership
      Restrictions.

Federal
      regulation of the communications field traditionally included a host of
      ownership restrictions, which limited the size of certain media entities and
      restricted their ability to enter into competing enterprises. Through a series
      of legislative, regulatory, and judicial actions, most of these restrictions
      have been either eliminated or substantially relaxed. For example, historic
      restrictions on local exchange carriers offering cable service within their
      telephone service area, as well as those prohibiting broadcast stations from
      owning cable systems within their broadcast service area, no longer exist.
      Changes in this regulatory area, including some still subject to judicial
      review, could alter the business landscape in which we operate, as formidable
      new competitors (including electric utilities, local exchange carriers, and
      broadcast/media companies) may increasingly choose to offer cable services.

The
      FCC
      previously adopted regulations precluding any cable operator from serving more
      than 30% of all domestic multichannel video subscribers and from devoting more
      than 40% of the activated channel capacity of any cable system to the carriage
      of affiliated national video programming services. These cable ownership
      restrictions were invalidated by the courts, and the FCC is now considering
      adoption of replacement regulations.

Pole
      Attachments.

The
      Communications Act requires most utilities to provide cable systems with access
      to poles and conduits and simultaneously subjects the rates charged for this
      access to either federal or state regulation. The Communications Act specifies
      that significantly higher rates apply if the cable plant is providing
      telecommunications services. The FCC has clarified that a cable operator's
      favorable pole rates are not endangered by the provision of Internet access,
      and
      that determination was upheld by the United States Supreme Court.

It


remains
      possible that the underlying pole attachment formula, or its application to
      Internet and telecommunications offerings, will be modified in a manner that
      substantially increases our pole attachment costs. We are a defendant in at
      least one lawsuit where the utility company claims that we should pay an
      increased rate on its poles. An adverse outcome would likely lead to higher
      pole
      attachment costs in certain states.

Cable
      Equipment.

In
      1996,
      Congress enacted a statute seeking to promote the “competitive availability of
      navigational devices” by allowing cable subscribers to use set-top boxes
      obtained from third parties, including third-party retailers. The FCC has
      undertaken several steps to implement this statute designed to promote
      competition in the delivery of cable equipment and compatibility with new
      digital technology. The FCC has expressly ruled that cable customers must be
      allowed to purchase set-top boxes from third parties, and has established a
      multi-year phase-in during which security functions (which would remain in
      the
      operator's exclusive control) would be unbundled from the basic converter
      functions, which could then be provided by third party vendors. The first phase
      of implementation has already passed, whereby cable operators are providing
      “CableCard” security modules and support to customer-owned digital televisions
      and similar devices equipped with built-in set-top box functionality compatible
      with CableCards. A prohibition on cable operators leasing digital set-top boxes
      that integrate security and basic navigation functions is scheduled to go into
      effect as of July 1, 2007.

There
      have been many requests for waiver of the integrated security ban filed with
      the
      FCC. Charter has petitioned the FCC to waive the prohibition as applied to
      our
      least expensive digital set-top boxes, and the National Cable and
      Telecommunications Association filed a request with the FCC that the prohibition
      be waived for all cable operators, for all set-top boxes, until a downloadable
      security solution is available, or until December 31, 2009, whichever is
      earlier. We cannot predict whether the FCC will grant these or any other
      requests.

It
      is
      possible that our vendors will be unable to deliver all of the necessary set-top
      boxes that we will require in time for us to comply with the FCC regulation,
      which could subject us to FCC penalties. In addition, our vendors will attempt
      to pass on costs associated with the design and manufacture of the new set-top
      boxes, which we may not be able to recover from our customers.

The
      cable
      and consumer electronics industries have been attempting to negotiate an
      agreement that would establish additional specifications for two-way digital
      televisions. It is unclear how this process will develop and how it will affect
      our offering of cable equipment and our relationship with our
      customers.

Privacy

Regulation

.
      The
      Communications Act limits our ability to collect and disclose subscribers’
personally identifiable information for our video, telephone, and high-speed
      Internet services, as well as provides requirements to safeguard such
      information. Charter is subject to additional Federal, State, and local laws
      and
      regulations that may also impose additional subscriber and employee privacy
      restrictions. Further, the FCC, FTC, and many states now regulate the
      telemarketing practices of cable operators, including telemarketing and online
      marketing efforts.

Other
      FCC Regulatory Matters.

FCC
      regulations cover a variety of additional areas, including, among other things:
      (1) equal employment opportunity obligations; (2) customer service standards;
      (3) technical service standards; (4) MDU access rights for potential
      competitions; (5) mandatory blackouts of certain network, syndicated and sports
      programming; (6) restrictions on political advertising; (7) restrictions on
      advertising in children's programming; (8) restrictions on origination
      cablecasting; (9) restrictions on carriage of lottery programming; (10)
      sponsorship identification obligations; (11) closed captioning of video
      programming; (12) licensing of systems and facilities; (13) maintenance of
      public files;

and
      (14)
      emergency alert systems.

It
      is
      possible that Congress or the FCC will expand or modify its regulation of cable
      systems in the future, and we cannot predict at this time how that might impact
      our business.

Copyright.

Cable
      systems are subject to a federal copyright compulsory license covering carriage
      of television and radio broadcast signals. The possible modification or
      elimination of this compulsory copyright license is the subject of continuing
      legislative review and could adversely affect our ability to obtain desired
      broadcast programming. Moreover, the Copyright Office has not yet provided
      any
      guidance as to how the compulsory copyright license should apply to newly
      offered digital broadcast signals.

Copyright
      clearances for non-broadcast programming services are arranged through private
      negotiations. Cable operators also must obtain music rights for locally
      originated programming and advertising from the major music performing rights
      organizations. These licensing fees have been the source of litigation in the
      past, and we cannot predict with certainty whether license fee disputes may
      arise in the future.


Franchise
      Matters.

Cable
      systems generally are operated pursuant to nonexclusive franchises granted
      by a
      municipality or other state or local government entity in order to cross public
      rights-of-way. Cable franchises generally are granted for fixed terms and in
      many cases include monetary penalties for noncompliance and may be terminable
      if
      the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions.

The
      specific terms and conditions of cable franchises vary materially between
      jurisdictions. Each franchise generally contains provisions governing cable
      operations, franchise fees, system construction, maintenance, technical
      performance, and customer service standards. A number of states subject cable
      systems to the jurisdiction of centralized state government agencies, such
      as
      public utility commissions. Although local franchising authorities have
      considerable discretion in establishing franchise terms, certain federal
      protections benefit cable operators. For example, federal law caps local
      franchise fees and includes renewal procedures designed to protect incumbent
      franchisees from arbitrary denials of renewal. Even if a franchise is renewed,
      however, the local franchising authority may seek to impose new and more onerous
      requirements as a condition of renewal. Similarly, if a local franchising
      authority's consent is required for the purchase or sale of a cable system,
      the
      local franchising authority may attempt to impose more burdensome requirements
      as a condition for providing its consent.

Legislative
      proposals have been introduced in the United States Congress and in state
      legislatures that would greatly streamline cable franchising. This legislation
      is intended to facilitate entry by new competitors, particularly local telephone
      companies. Such legislation has passed in several states, including states
      where
      we have significant operations. Although certain of these states have provided
      some regulatory relief for incumbent cable operators, these proposals are
      generally viewed as being more favorable to new entrants due to a number of
      factors, including efforts to withhold streamlined cable franchising from
      incumbents until after the expiration of their existing franchises, and the
      potential for new entrants to serve only higher-income areas of a particular
      community. To the extent incumbent cable operators are not able to avail
      themselves of this streamlined franchising process, such operators may continue
      to be subject to more onerous franchise requirements at the local level than
      new
      entrants. At least two additional states where we have cable systems have issued
      regulations that will facilitate telephone company provision of video services
      by eliminating or reducing the application of franchising requirements to the
      telephone companies. A proceeding is pending at the FCC to determine whether
      local franchising authorities are impeding the deployment of competitive cable
      services through unreasonable franchising requirements and whether any such
      impediments should be preempted. At this time, we are not able to determine
      what
      impact such proceeding may have on us.

Internet
      Service

Over
      the
      past several years, proposals have been advanced at the FCC and Congress that
      would require cable operators offering Internet service to provide
      non-discriminatory access to their networks to competing Internet service
      providers. In a 2005 ruling, commonly referred to as

Brand
      X

,
      the
      Supreme Court upheld an FCC decision making it less likely that any
      non-discriminatory “open access” requirements (which are generally associated
      with common carrier regulation of “telecommunications services”) will be imposed
      on the cable industry by local, state or federal authorities. The Supreme Court
      held that the FCC was correct in classifying cable-provided Internet service
      as
      an “information service,” rather than a “telecommunications service.” This
      favorable regulatory classification limits the ability of various governmental
      authorities to impose open access requirements on cable-provided Internet
      service.

The
      FCC’s
      classification also means

that it
      is unlikely the FCC will regulate Internet service to the same extent as cable
      or telecommunications services. However, the FCC has concluded that the
      Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) does apply to
      facilities-based broadband Internet access providers, setting a deadline of
      May
      14, 2007 for broadband providers to accommodate law enforcement requests for
      electronic surveillance pursuant to court order or other lawful authority.
      The
      FCC also issued a non-binding policy statement in 2005 establishing four basic
      principles that the FCC says will inform its ongoing policymaking activities
      regarding broadband-related Internet services. Those principles state that
      consumers are entitled to access the lawful Internet content of their choice,
      consumers are entitled to run applications and services of their choice, subject
      to the needs of law enforcement, consumers are entitled to connect their choice
      of legal devices that do not harm the network, and consumers are entitled to
      competition among network providers, application and service providers and
      content providers. It is unclear what, if any, additional regulations the FCC
      might impose on our Internet service, and what, if any, impact, such regulations
      might have on our business.

As
      the
      Internet has matured, it has become the subject of increasing regulatory
      interest. Congress and federal regulators have adopted a wide range of measures
      directly or potentially affecting Internet use, including, for example, consumer
      privacy, copyright protections (which afford copyright owners certain rights
      against us that could adversely affect our relationship with a customer accused
      of violating copyright laws), defamation liability,


taxation,
      obscenity, and unsolicited commercial e-mail. Additionally, the FCC and Congress
      are considering subjecting high-speed Internet access services to the Universal
      Service funding requirements. This would impose significant new costs on our
      high-speed Internet service. State and local governmental organizations have
      also adopted Internet-related regulations. These various governmental
      jurisdictions are also considering additional regulations in these and other
      areas, such as pricing, service and product quality, and intellectual property
      ownership.

The
      adoption of new Internet regulations or the adaptation of existing laws to
      the
      Internet could adversely affect our business.

Telephone
      Service

The
      Telecom Act created a more favorable regulatory environment for us to provide
      telecommunications services. In particular, it limited the regulatory role
      of
      local franchising authorities and established requirements ensuring that
      providers of traditional telecommunications services can interconnect with
      other
      telephone companies to provide a viable service. Many implementation details
      remain unresolved, and there are substantial regulatory changes being considered
      that could impact, in both positive and negative ways, our primary
      telecommunications competitors and our own entry into the field of telephone
      service. The FCC and state regulatory authorities are considering, for example,
      whether common carrier regulation traditionally applied to incumbent local
      exchange carriers should be modified.

The
      FCC
      has concluded that alternative voice technologies, like certain types of VoIP
      (we use VoIP technology for our telephone service), should be regulated only
      at
      the federal level, rather than by individual states. A legal challenge to that
      FCC decision is pending. While the FCC’s decision appears to be a positive
      development for VoIP offerings, it is unclear whether and how the FCC will
      apply
      certain types of common carrier regulations, such as intercarrier compensations
      and universal service obligations to alternative voice technology. Also, the
      FCC
      and Congress are considering whether, and to what extent, VoIP service will
      have
      interconnection rights with local telephone companies. The FCC has already
      determined that providers of telephone services using Internet Protocol
      technology must comply with traditional 911 emergency service obligations
      (“E911”) and it has extended requirements for accommodating law enforcement
      wiretaps to such providers. It is unclear how these regulatory matters
      ultimately will be resolved and how they will affect our potential expansion
      into telephone service.

Employees

As
      of
      December 31, 2006, we had approximately 15,500 full-time equivalent employees.
      At December 31, 2006, approximately 100 of our employees were represented by
      collective bargaining agreements. We have never experienced a work stoppage.

Item
      1A.

Risk
      Factors.

Risks
      Related to Significant Indebtedness of Us and Our
      Subsidiaries

We
      and our subsidiaries have a significant amount of existing debt and may incur
      significant additional debt, including secured debt, in the future, which could
      adversely affect our financial health and our ability to react to changes in
      our
      business.

We
      and
      our subsidiaries have a significant amount of debt and may (subject to
      applicable restrictions in our debt instruments) incur additional debt in the
      future. As of December 31, 2006, our total debt was approximately $19.1 billion,
      our shareholders' deficit was approximately $6.2 billion and the deficiency
      of
      earnings to cover fixed charges for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $1.2
      billion.

As
      of
      December 31, 2006, approximately $413 million aggregate principal amount of
      Charter's convertible notes was outstanding; which matures in 2009. We will
      need
      to raise additional capital and/or receive distributions or payments from our
      subsidiaries in order to satisfy this debt obligation. An additional $450
      million aggregate principal amount of Charter’s convertible notes was held by
      CCHC.

Because
      of our significant indebtedness, our ability to raise additional capital at
      reasonable rates, or at all, is uncertain, and the ability of our subsidiaries
      to make distributions or payments to their parent companies is subject to
      availability of funds and restrictions under our subsidiaries' applicable debt
      instruments and under applicable law. If we need to raise additional capital
      through the issuance of equity or find it necessary to engage in a
      recapitalization or other similar transaction, our shareholders could suffer
      significant dilution, and in the case of a recapitalization or other similar
      transaction, our noteholders might not receive principal and interest payments
      to which they are contractually entitled.


Our
      significant amount of debt could have other important consequences. For example,
      the debt will or could:

·

require
                us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operating
                activities to make payments on our debt, reducing our funds available
                for
                working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate
                expenses;

·

limit
                our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business,
                the cable and telecommunications industries, and the economy at
                large;

·

place
                us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have proportionately
                less debt;

·

make
                us vulnerable to interest rate increases, because approximately 22%
                of our
                borrowings are, and will continue to be, at variable rates of
                interest;

·

expose
                us to increased interest expense to the extent we refinance existing
                debt
                with higher cost debt;

·

adversely
                affect our relationship with customers and
                suppliers;

·

limit
                our ability to borrow additional funds in the future, due to applicable
                financial and restrictive covenants in our debt;

·

make
                it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to the holders
                of our
                notes and for our subsidiaries to satisfy their obligations to their
                lenders under their credit facilities and to their noteholders;
                and

·

limit
                future increases in the value, or cause a decline in the value of
                our
                equity, which could limit our ability to raise additional capital
                by
                issuing equity.

A
      default
      by one of our subsidiaries under its debt obligations could result in the
      acceleration of those obligations, which in turn could trigger cross defaults
      under other agreements governing our long-term indebtedness. In addition, the
      secured lenders under the Charter Operating credit facilities and the holders
      of
      the Charter Operating senior second-lien notes could foreclose on their
      collateral, which includes equity interest in our subsidiaries, and exercise
      other rights of secured creditors. Any default under those credit facilities
      or
      the indentures governing our convertible notes or our subsidiaries’ debt could
      adversely affect our growth, our financial condition, our results of operations,
      and our ability to make payments on our convertible notes, Charter Operating’s
      credit facilities, and other debt of our subsidiaries, and could force us to
      seek the protection of the bankruptcy laws. We and our subsidiaries may incur
      significant additional debt in the future. If current debt levels increase,
      the
      related risks that we now face will intensify.

The
      agreements and instruments governing our debt and the debt of our subsidiaries
      contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our ability
      to operate our business, as well as significantly affect our
      liquidity.

The
      Charter Operating credit facilities and the indentures governing our and our
      subsidiaries' debt contain a number of significant covenants that could
      adversely affect our ability to operate our business, as well as significantly
      affect our liquidity, and therefore could adversely affect our results of
      operations. These covenants will restrict, among other things, our and our
      subsidiaries' ability to:

·

incur
                additional debt;

·

repurchase
                or redeem equity interests and
                debt;

·

issue
                equity;

·

make
                certain investments or
                acquisitions;

·

pay
                dividends or make other
                distributions;

·

dispose
                of assets or merge;

·

enter
                into related party transactions; and

·

grant
                liens and pledge assets.

The
      breach of any covenants or obligations in the foregoing indentures or credit
      facilities, not otherwise waived or amended, could result in a default under
      the
      applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations,
      which in turn could trigger cross defaults under other agreements governing
      our
      long-term indebtedness. In addition, the secured lenders under the Charter
      Operating credit facilities and the holders of the Charter Operating senior
      second-lien notes could foreclose on their collateral, which includes equity
      interests in our subsidiaries, and exercise other rights of secured creditors.
      Any default under those credit facilities or the indentures governing our
      convertible notes or our subsidiaries' debt could adversely affect our growth,
      our financial condition, our results of operations and our ability to make
      payments on our convertible notes, Charter Operating's credit facilities, and
      other debt of our subsidiaries, and could force us to seek the protection of
      the
      bankruptcy laws.


Charter
      Operating may not be able to access funds under its credit facilities if it
      fails to satisfy the covenant restrictions in its credit facilities, which
      could
      adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to conduct our
      business.

Our
      subsidiaries have historically relied on access to credit facilities in order
      to
      fund operations and to service parent company debt, and we expect such reliance
      to continue in the future. Our total potential borrowing availability under
      the
      Charter Operating credit facilities was approximately $1.3 billion as of
      December 31, 2006, although the actual availability at that time was only $1.1
      billion because of limits imposed by covenant restrictions. There can be no
      assurance that actual availability under our credit facilities will not be
      limited by covenant restrictions in the future.

One
      of
      the conditions to the availability of funding under Charter Operating's credit
      facilities is the absence of a default under such facilities, including as
      a
      result of any failure to comply with the covenants under the facilities. Among
      other covenants, the facilities require Charter Operating to maintain specific
      financial ratios. The facilities also provide that Charter Operating has to
      obtain an unqualified audit opinion from its independent accountants for each
      fiscal year. There can be no assurance that Charter Operating will be able
      to
      continue to comply with these or any other of the covenants under the credit
      facilities.

An
      event
      of default under the credit facilities or indentures, if not waived, could
      result in the acceleration of those debt obligations and, consequently, could
      trigger cross defaults under other agreements governing our long-term
      indebtedness. In addition, the secured lenders under the Charter Operating
      credit facilities and the holders of the Charter Operating senior second-lien
      notes could foreclose on their collateral, which includes equity interest in
      our
      subsidiaries, and exercise other rights of secured creditors. Any default under
      those credit facilities or the indentures governing our convertible notes or
      our
      subsidiaries’ debt could adversely affect our growth, our financial condition,
      our results of operations, and our ability to make payments on our convertible
      notes, Charter Operating’s credit facilities, and other debt of our
      subsidiaries, and could force us to seek the protection of the bankruptcy laws,
      which could materially adversely impact our ability to operate our business
      and
      to make payments under our debt instruments.

We
      depend on generating sufficient cash flow and having access to additional
      external liquidity sources to fund our debt obligations, capital expenditures,
      and ongoing operations.

Our
      ability to service our debt and to fund our planned capital expenditures and
      ongoing operations will depend on both our ability to generate cash flow and
      our
      access to additional external liquidity sources. Our ability to generate cash
      flow is dependent on many factors, including:

·

competition
                from other video programming distributors, including incumbent telephone
                companies, direct broadcast satellite operators, wireless broadband
                providers and DSL providers;

·

unforeseen
                difficulties we may encounter in our continued introduction of our
                telephone services such as our ability to meet heightened customer
                expectations for the reliability of voice services compared to other
                services we provide, and our ability to meet heightened demand for
                installations and customer service;

·

our
                ability to sustain and grow revenues by offering video, high-speed
                Internet, telephone and other services, and to maintain and grow
                a stable
                customer base, particularly in the face of increasingly aggressive
                competition from other service
                providers;

·

our
                ability to obtain programming at reasonable prices or to pass programming
                cost increases on to our customers;

·

general
                business conditions, economic uncertainty or slowdown;
                and

·

the
                effects of governmental regulation, including but not limited to
                local
                franchise authorities, on our
                business.

Some
      of
      these factors are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient
      cash flow or access additional external liquidity sources, we may not be able
      to
      service and repay our debt, operate our business, respond to competitive
      challenges, or fund our other liquidity and capital needs. Although we and
      our
      subsidiaries have been able to raise funds through issuances of debt in the
      past, we may not be able to access additional sources of external liquidity
      on
      similar terms, if at all. We expect that cash on hand, cash flows from operating
      activities, and the amounts available under our credit facilities will be
      adequate to meet our cash needs through 2007. We believe that cash flows from
      operating activities and amounts available under our credit facilities may
      not
      be sufficient to fund our operations and satisfy our interest and principal
      repayment obligations in 2008 and will not be sufficient to fund


such
      needs in 2009 and beyond. See “Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and
      Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

—

Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Because
      of our holding company structure, our outstanding notes are structurally
      subordinated in right of payment to all liabilities of our subsidiaries.
      Restrictions in our subsidiaries' debt instruments and under applicable law
      limit their ability to provide funds to us or our various debt
      issuers.

Our
      sole
      assets are our equity interests in our subsidiaries. Our operating subsidiaries
      are separate and distinct legal entities and are not obligated to make funds
      available to us for payments on our notes or other obligations in the form
      of
      loans, distributions, or otherwise. Our subsidiaries' ability to make
      distributions to us or the applicable debt issuers to service debt obligations
      is subject to their compliance with the terms of their credit facilities and
      indentures, and restrictions under applicable law. See “Part II. Item 7.
      Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
      Operations

—
      Liquidity and Capital Resources — Limitations on Distributions” and “— Debt
      Covenants.”

Under
      the
      Delaware Limited Liability Company Act, our subsidiaries may only make
      distributions if they have “surplus” as defined in the act. Under fraudulent
      transfer laws, our subsidiaries may not pay dividends if they are insolvent
      or
      are rendered insolvent thereby. The measures of insolvency for purposes of
      these
      fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding
      to determine whether a fraudulent transfer has occurred. Generally, however,
      an
      entity would be considered insolvent if:

·

the
                sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than
                the
                fair saleable value of all its
                assets;

·

the
                present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount
                that
                would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts,
                including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature;
                or

·

it
                could not pay its debts as they became
                due.

While
      we
      believe that our relevant subsidiaries currently have surplus and are not
      insolvent, there can be no assurance that these subsidiaries will be permitted
      to make distributions in the future in compliance with these restrictions in
      amounts needed to service our indebtedness. Our direct or indirect subsidiaries
      include the borrowers and guarantors under the Charter Operating credit
      facilities. Several of our subsidiaries are also obligors and guarantors under
      other senior high yield notes. Our convertible notes are structurally
      subordinated in right of payment to all of the debt and other liabilities of
      our
      subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2006, our total debt was approximately $19.1
      billion, of which approximately $18.7 billion was structurally senior to our
      convertible notes.

In
      the
      event of bankruptcy, liquidation, or dissolution of one or more of our
      subsidiaries, that subsidiary's assets would first be applied to satisfy its
      own
      obligations, and following such payments, such subsidiary may not have
      sufficient assets remaining to make payments to its parent company as an equity
      holder or otherwise. In that event:

·

the
                lenders under Charter Operating's credit facilities, whose interests
                are
                secured by substantially all of our operating assets, will have the
                right
                to be paid in full before us from any of our subsidiaries' assets;
                and

·

the
                holders of preferred membership interests in our subsidiary, CC VIII,
                would have a claim on a portion of its assets that may reduce the
                amounts
                available for repayment to holders of our outstanding
                notes.

All
      of our and our subsidiaries' outstanding debt is subject to change of control
      provisions. We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to fulfill
      our obligations under our indebtedness following a change of control, which
      would place us in default under the applicable debt
      instruments.

We
      may
      not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to fulfill our obligations
      under our and our subsidiaries' notes and credit facilities following a change
      of control. Under the indentures governing our and our subsidiaries' notes,
      upon
      the occurrence of specified change of control events, we are required to offer
      to repurchase all of these notes. However, Charter and our subsidiaries may
      not
      have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control event to make the
      required repurchase of these notes, and our subsidiaries are limited in their
      ability to make distributions or other payments to fund any required repurchase.
      In addition, a change of control under our credit facilities would result in
      a
      default under those credit facilities. Because such credit facilities and our
      subsidiaries' notes are obligations of our subsidiaries, the credit facilities
      and our subsidiaries' notes would have to be repaid by our subsidiaries before
      their assets could be available to us to repurchase our convertible senior
      notes. Our failure to make or complete a change of control offer would place
      us
      in default under our convertible senior notes. The failure of our subsidiaries
      to make a change of control offer or repay the amounts accelerated under their
      notes and credit facilities would place them in default.

Risks
      Related to Our Business

We
      operate in a very competitive business environment, which affects our ability
      to
      attract and retain customers and can adversely affect our business and
      operations.

The
      industry in which we operate is highly competitive and has become more so in
      recent years. In some instances, we compete against companies with fewer
      regulatory burdens, easier access to financing, greater personnel and other
      resources, greater brand name recognition, and long-established relationships
      with regulatory authorities and customers. Increasing consolidation in the
      cable
      industry and the repeal of certain ownership rules may provide additional
      benefits to certain of our competitors, either through access to financing,
      resources, or efficiencies of scale.

Our
      principal competitor for video services throughout our territory is DBS. The
      two
      largest DBS providers are DIRECTV and Echostar Communications. Competition
      from
      DBS, including intensive marketing efforts with aggressive pricing and exclusive
      programming such as the “NFL Sunday Ticket,” has had an adverse impact on our
      ability to retain customers. DBS has grown rapidly over the last several years.
      The cable industry, including us, has lost a significant number of video
      customers to DBS competition, and we face serious challenges in this area in
      the
      future. In some areas, DBS operators have entered into co-marketing arrangements
      with other of our competitors to offer service bundles combining video services
      provided by the DBS operator and DSL and traditional telephone service offered
      by the telephone companies. These service bundles resemble our bundles and
      result in a single bill to the customer. We believe that competition from DBS
      service providers may present greater challenges in areas of lower population
      density, and that our systems service a higher concentration of such areas
      than
      those of certain other major cable service providers.

Local
      telephone companies and electric utilities can offer video and other services
      in
      competition with us and they increasingly may do so in the future. Two major
      local telephone companies, AT&T and Verizon, have both announced that they
      intend to make upgrades of their networks. Some upgraded portions of these
      networks are or will be capable of carrying two-way video services that are
      technically comparable to ours, high-speed data services that operate at speeds
      as high or higher than those we make available to customers in these areas
      and
      digital voice services that are similar to ours. In addition, these companies
      continue to offer their traditional telephone services as well as bundles that
      include wireless voice services provided by affiliated companies. We believe
      that AT&T and Verizon’s upgrades have been completed in systems representing
      approximately 1% of our homes passed as of December 31, 2006.

Additional
      upgrades in markets in which we operate are expected.

In areas
      where they have launched video services, these parties are aggressively
      marketing video, voice and data bundles at entry level prices similar to those
      we use to market our bundles. Certain telephone companies have begun more
      extensive upgrades in their networks that enable them to begin providing video
      services, as well as telephone and high bandwidth Internet access services,
      to
      residential and business customers and they are now offering such service in
      limited areas. Some of these telephone companies have obtained, and are now
      seeking, franchises or operating authorizations under terms and conditions
      more
      favorable than those imposed on us.

With
      respect to our Internet access services, we face competition, including
      intensive marketing efforts and aggressive pricing, from telephone companies
      and
      other providers of DSL and “dial-up”. DSL service is competitive with high-speed
      Internet service over cable systems. In addition, DBS providers have entered
      into joint marketing arrangements with Internet access providers to offer
      bundled video and Internet service, which competes with our ability to provide
      bundled services to our customers. Moreover, as we expand our telephone
      offerings, we face considerable competition from established telephone companies
      and other carriers, including VoIP providers.

In
      order
      to attract new customers, from time to time we make promotional offers,
      including offers of temporarily reduced-price or free service. These promotional
      programs result in significant advertising, programming and operating expenses,
      and also require us to make capital expenditures to acquire additional digital
      set-top boxes. Customers who subscribe to our services as a result of these
      offerings may not remain customers for any significant period of time following
      the end of the promotional period. A failure to retain existing customers and
      customers added through promotional offerings or to collect the amounts they
      owe
      us could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial
      results.


Mergers,
      joint ventures and alliances among franchised, wireless or private cable
      operators, satellite television providers, local exchange carriers and others,
      may provide additional benefits to some of our competitors, either through
      access to financing, resources or efficiencies of scale, or the ability to
      provide multiple services in direct competition with us.

In
      addition to the various competitive factors discussed above, our business is
      subject to risks relating to increasing competition for the leisure and
      entertainment time of consumers. Our business competes with all other sources
      of
      entertainment and information delivery, including broadcast television, movies,
      live events, radio broadcasts, home video products, console games, print media,
      and the Internet. Technological advancements, such as video-on-demand, new
      video
      formats, and Internet streaming and downloading, have increased the number
      of
      entertainment and information delivery choices available to consumers, and
      intensified the challenges posed by audience fragmentation. The increasing
      number of choices available to audiences could negatively impact not only
      consumer demand for our products and services, but also advertisers’ willingness
      to purchase advertising from us. If we do not respond appropriately to further
      increases in the leisure and entertainment choices available to consumers,
      our
      competitive position could deteriorate, and our financial results could suffer.

We
      cannot
      assure you that our cable systems will allow us to compete effectively.
      Additionally, as we expand our offerings to include other telecommunications
      services, and to introduce new and enhanced services, we will be subject to
      competition from other providers of the services we offer. We cannot predict
      the
      extent to which competition may affect our business and operations in the
      future.

We
      have a history of net losses and expect to continue to experience net losses.
      Consequently, we may not have the ability to finance future
      operations.

We
      have
      had a history of net losses and expect to continue to report net losses for
      the
      foreseeable future. Our net losses are principally attributable to insufficient
      revenue to cover the combination of operating expenses and interest expenses
      we
      incur because of our high level of debt and the depreciation expenses that
      we
      incur resulting from the capital investments we have made in our cable
      properties. We expect that these expenses will remain significant. We reported
      net losses applicable to common stock of $1.4 billion, $970 million, and $4.3
      billion for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.
      Continued losses would reduce our cash available from operations to service
      our
      indebtedness, as well as limit our ability to finance our
      operations.

We
      may not have the ability to pass our increasing programming costs on to our
      customers, which would adversely affect our cash flow and operating
      margins.

Programming
      has been, and is expected to continue to be, our largest operating expense
      item.
      In recent years, the cable industry has experienced a rapid escalation in the
      cost of programming, particularly sports programming. We expect programming
      costs to continue to increase because of a variety of factors, including annual
      increases imposed by programmers and additional programming, including high
      definition television, and

OnDemand

programming, being provided to customers. The inability to fully pass these
      programming cost increases on to our customers has had an adverse impact on
      our
      cash flow and operating margins. We have programming contracts that have expired
      or that will expire at or before the end of 2007. There can be no assurance
      that
      these agreements will be renewed on favorable or comparable terms. To the extent
      that we are unable to reach agreement with certain programmers on terms that
      we
      believe are reasonable we may be forced to remove such programming channels
      from
      our line-up, which could result in a further loss of customers.

Increased
      demands by owners of some broadcast stations for carriage of other services
      or
      payments to those broadcasters for retransmission consent could further increase
      our programming costs. Federal law allows commercial television broadcast
      stations to make an election between “must-carry” rights and an alternative
“retransmission-consent” regime. When a station opts for the latter, cable
      operators are not allowed to carry the station’s signal without the station’s
      permission. In some cases, we carry stations under short-term arrangements
      while
      we attempt to negotiate new long-term retransmission agreements. If negotiations
      with these programmers prove unsuccessful, they could require us to cease
      carrying their signals, possibly for an indefinite period. Any loss of stations
      could make our video service less attractive to customers, which could result
      in
      less subscription and advertising revenue. In retransmission-consent
      negotiations, broadcasters often condition consent with respect to one station
      on carriage of one or more other stations or programming services in which
      they
      or their affiliates have an interest. Carriage of these other services may
      increase our programming expenses and diminish the amount of capacity we have
      available to introduce new services, which could have an adverse effect on
      our
      business and financial results.


If
      our required capital expenditures in 2007, 2008 and beyond exceed our
      projections, we may not have sufficient funding, which could adversely affect
      our growth, financial condition and results of
      operations.

During
      the year ended December 31, 2006, we spent approximately $1.1 billion on capital
      expenditures. During 2007, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately
      $1.2 billion. The actual amount of our capital expenditures depends on the
      level
      of growth in high-speed Internet and telephone customers, and in the delivery
      of
      other advanced services, as well as the cost of introducing any new services.
      We
      may need additional capital in 2007, 2008, and beyond if there is accelerated
      growth in high-speed Internet customers, telephone customers or in the delivery
      of other advanced services. If we cannot obtain such capital from increases
      in
      our cash flow from operating activities, additional borrowings, proceeds from
      asset sales or other sources, our growth, financial condition, and results
      of
      operations could suffer materially.

We
      face risks inherent to our telephone business.

We
      may
      encounter unforeseen difficulties as we introduce our telephone service in
      new
      operating areas and as we increase the scale of our telephone service offerings
      in areas in which they have already been launched. First, we face heightened
      customer expectations for the reliability of telephone services, as compared
      with our video and high-speed data services. We have undertaken significant
      training of customer service representatives and technicians, and we will
      continue to need a highly trained workforce. To ensure reliable service, we
      may
      need to increase our expenditures, including spending on technology, equipment
      and personnel. If the service is not sufficiently reliable or we otherwise
      fail
      to meet customer expectations, our telephone business could be adversely
      affected. Second, the competitive landscape for telephone services is intense;
      we face competition from providers of Internet telephone services, as well
      as
      incumbent local telephone companies, cellular telephone service providers,
      and
      others. Third, we depend on interconnection and related services provided by
      certain third parties. As a result, our ability to implement changes as the
      service grows may be limited. Finally, we expect advances in communications
      technology, as well as changes in the marketplace and the regulatory and
      legislative environment. Consequently, we are unable to predict the effect
      that
      ongoing or future developments in these areas might have on our telephone
      business and operations.

Our
      inability to respond to technological developments and meet customer demand
      for
      new products and services could limit our ability to compete
      effectively.

Our
      business is characterized by rapid technological change and the introduction
      of
      new products and services, some of which are bandwidth-intensive. We cannot
      assure you that we will be able to fund the capital expenditures necessary
      to
      keep pace with technological developments, or that we will successfully
      anticipate the demand of our customers for products and services requiring
      new
      technology or bandwidth beyond our expectations. Our inability to maintain
      and
      expand our upgraded systems and provide advanced services in a timely manner,
      or
      to anticipate the demands of the marketplace, could materially adversely affect
      our ability to attract and retain customers. Consequently, our growth, financial
      condition and results of operations could suffer materially.

We
      depend on third party suppliers and licensors; thus, if we are unable to procure
      the necessary equipment, software or licenses on reasonable terms and on a
      timely basis, our ability to offer services could be impaired, and our growth,
      operations, business, financial results and financial condition could be
      materially adversely affected.

We
      depend
      on third party suppliers and licensors to supply some of the hardware, software
      and operational support necessary to provide some of our services. We obtain
      these materials from a limited number of vendors, some of which do not have
      a
      long operating history. Some of our hardware, software and operational support
      vendors represent our sole source of supply or have, either through contract
      or
      as a result of intellectual property rights, a position of some exclusivity.
      If
      demand exceeds these vendors’ capacity or if these vendors experience operating
      or financial difficulties, or are otherwise unable to provide the equipment
      we
      need in a timely manner and at reasonable prices, our ability to provide some
      services might be materially adversely affected, or the need to procure or
      develop alternative sources of the affected materials or services might delay
      our ability to serve our customers. These events could materially and adversely
      affect our ability to retain and attract customers, and have a material negative
      impact on our operations, business, financial results and financial condition.
      A
      limited number of vendors of key technologies can lead to less product
      innovation and higher costs. For these reasons, we generally endeavor to
      establish alternative vendors for materials we consider critical, but may not
      be
      able to establish these relationships or be able to obtain required materials
      on
      favorable terms.


For
      example, each of our systems currently purchases set-top boxes from a limited
      number of vendors, because each of our cable systems uses one or two proprietary
      conditional access security schemes, which allow us to regulate subscriber
      access to some services, such as premium channels. We believe that the
      proprietary nature of these conditional access schemes makes other manufacturers
      reluctant to produce set-top boxes. Future innovation in set-top boxes may
      be
      restricted until these issues are resolved. In addition, we believe that the
      general lack of compatibility among set-top box operating systems has slowed
      the
      industry’s development and deployment of digital set-top box applications.

Malicious
      and abusive Internet practices could impair our high-speed Internet
      services.

Our
      high-speed Internet customers utilize our network to access the Internet and,
      as
      a consequence, we or they may become victim to common malicious and abusive
      Internet activities, such as unsolicited mass advertising (i.e., “spam”) and
      dissemination of viruses, worms, and other destructive or disruptive software.
      These activities could have adverse consequences on our network and our
      customers, including degradation of service, excessive call volume to call
      centers, and damage to our or our customers' equipment and data. Significant
      incidents could lead to customer dissatisfaction and, ultimately, loss of
      customers or revenue, in addition to increased costs to service our customers
      and protect our network. Any significant loss of high-speed Internet customers
      or revenue, or significant increase in costs of serving those customers, could
      adversely affect our growth, financial condition and results of
      operations.

We
      could be deemed an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act of
      1940. This would impose significant restrictions on us and would be likely
      to
      have a material adverse impact on our growth, financial condition and results
      of
      operation.

Our
      principal assets are our equity interests in Charter Holdco and certain
      indebtedness of Charter Holdco. If our membership interest in Charter Holdco
      were to constitute less than 50% of the voting securities issued by Charter
      Holdco, then our interest in Charter Holdco could be deemed an “investment
      security” for purposes of the Investment Company Act. This may occur, for
      example, if a court determines that the Class B common stock is no longer
      entitled to special voting rights and, in accordance with the terms of the
      Charter Holdco limited liability company agreement, our membership units in
      Charter Holdco were to lose their special voting privileges. A determination
      that such interest was an investment security could cause us to be deemed to
      be
      an investment company under the Investment Company Act, unless an exemption
      from
      registration were available or we were to obtain an order of the Securities
      and
      Exchange Commission excluding or exempting us from registration under the
      Investment Company Act.

If
      anything were to happen which would cause us to be deemed an investment company,
      the Investment Company Act would impose significant restrictions on us,
      including severe limitations on our ability to borrow money, to issue additional
      capital stock, and to transact business with affiliates. In addition, because
      our operations are very different from those of the typical registered
      investment company, regulation under the Investment Company Act could affect
      us
      in other ways that are extremely difficult to predict. In sum, if we were deemed
      to be an investment company it could become impractical for us to continue
      our
      business as currently conducted and our growth, our financial condition and
      our
      results of operations could suffer materially.

If
      a court determines that the Class B common stock is no longer entitled to
      special voting rights, we would lose our rights to manage Charter Holdco. In
      addition to the investment company risks discussed above, this could materially
      impact the value of the Class A common stock.

If
      a
      court determines that the Class B common stock is no longer entitled to special
      voting rights, Charter would no longer have a controlling voting interest in,
      and would lose its right to manage, Charter Holdco. If this were to
      occur:

·

we
                would retain our proportional equity interest in Charter Holdco but
                would
                lose all of our powers to direct the management and affairs of Charter
                Holdco and its subsidiaries; and

·

we
                would become strictly a passive investment vehicle and would be treated
                under the Investment Company Act as an investment
                company.

This
      result, as well as the impact of being treated under the Investment Company
      Act
      as an investment company, could materially adversely impact:


·

the
                liquidity of the Class A common
                stock;

·

how
                the Class A common stock trades in the
                marketplace;

·

the
                price that purchasers would be willing to pay for the Class A common
                stock
                in a change of control transaction or otherwise;
                and

·

the
                market price of the Class A common
                stock.

Uncertainties
      that may arise with respect to the nature of our management role and voting
      power and organizational documents as a result of any challenge to the special
      voting rights of the Class B common stock, including legal actions or
      proceedings relating thereto, may also materially adversely impact the value
      of
      the Class A common stock.

For
      tax purposes, there is significant risk that we will experience an ownership
      change resulting in a material limitation on the use of a substantial amount
      of
      our existing net operating loss carryforwards.

As
      of
      December 31, 2006, we had approximately $6.7 billion of tax net operating
      losses, resulting in a gross deferred tax asset of approximately $2.7 billion,
      expiring in the yea

rs
      through 2026.  Due to uncertainties in projected future taxable income,
      valuation allowances have been established against the gross deferred tax assets
      for book accounting purposes, except for deferred benefits available to offset
      certain deferred tax liabilities.  Currently, such tax net operating losses
      can accumulate and be used to offset any of our future taxable income.
 However, an “ownership change” as defined in Section 382 of the Internal
      Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, would place significant limitations, on an
      annual basis, on the use of such net operating losses to offset future taxable
      income we may generate.  Such limitations, in conjunction with the net
      operating loss expiration provisions, could effectively eliminate our ability
      to
      use a substantial portion of our net operating losses to offset future taxable
      income.

Future
      transactions and the timing of such transactions could cause an ownership change
      for income tax purposes. Such transactions include additional issuances of
      common stock by us (including but not limited to issuances upon future
      conversion of our 5.875% convertible senior notes), the return to us of the
      borrowed shares loaned by us in connection with the issuance of the 5.875%
      convertible senior notes, or acquisitions or sales of shares by certain holders
      of our shares, including persons who have held, currently hold, or accumulate
      in
      the future five percent or more of our outstanding stock (including upon an
      exchange by Mr. Allen or his affiliates, directly or indirectly, of membership
      units of Charter Holdco into our Class B common stock). Many of the foregoing
      transactions, including whether Mr. Allen exchanges his Charter Holdco units,
      are beyond our control.

Risks
      Related to Mr. Allen's Controlling Position

The
      failure by Mr. Allen to maintain a minimum voting and economic interest in
      us
      could trigger a change of control default under our subsidiary's credit
      facilities.

The
      Charter Operating credit facilities provide that the failure by (a) Mr. Allen,
      (b) his estate, spouse, immediate family members and heirs and (c) any trust,
      corporation, partnership or other entity, the beneficiaries, stockholders,
      partners or other owners of which consist exclusively of Mr. Allen or such
      other
      persons referred to in (b) above or a combination thereof to maintain a 35%
      direct or indirect voting interest in the applicable borrower would result
      in a
      change of control default. Such a default could result in the acceleration
      of
      repayment of our and our subsidiaries' indebtedness, including borrowings under
      the Charter Operating credit facilities.

Mr.
      Allen controls our stockholder voting and may have interests that conflict
      with
      the interests of the other holders of our Class A common
      stock.

Mr.
      Allen
      has the ability to control us. Through his control, as of December 31, 2006,
      of
      approximately 91% of the voting power of our capital stock, Mr. Allen is
      entitled to elect all but one of our board members and effectively has the
      voting power to elect the remaining board member as well. Mr. Allen thus has
      the
      ability to control fundamental corporate transactions requiring equity holder
      approval, including, but not limited to, the election of all of our directors,
      approval of merger transactions involving us and the sale of all or
      substantially all of our assets.

Mr.
      Allen
      is not restricted from investing in, and has invested in, and engaged in, other
      businesses involving or related to the operation of cable television systems,
      video programming, high-speed Internet service, telephone or business and
      financial transactions conducted through broadband interactivity and Internet
      services. Mr. Allen may also engage in other businesses that compete or may
      in
      the future compete with us.


Mr.
      Allen's control over our management and affairs could create conflicts of
      interest if he is faced with decisions that could have different implications
      for him, us and the other holders of our Class A common stock. For example,
      if
      Mr. Allen were to elect to exchange his Charter Holdco membership units for
      our
      Class B common stock pursuant to our existing exchange agreement with him,
      such
      a transaction would result in an ownership change for income tax purposes,
      as
      discussed above. See “

—

For
      tax
      purposes, there is significant risk that we will experience an ownership change
      resulting in a material limitation on the use of a substantial amount of our
      existing net operating loss carryforwards.” Further, Mr. Allen could effectively
      cause us to enter into contracts with another entity in which he owns an
      interest, or to decline a transaction into which he (or another entity in which
      he owns an interest) ultimately enters.

Current
      and future agreements between us and either Mr. Allen or his affiliates may
      not
      be the result of arm's-length negotiations. Consequently, such agreements may
      be
      less favorable to us than agreements that we could otherwise have entered into
      with unaffiliated third parties.

We
      are not permitted to engage in any business activity other than the cable
      transmission of video, audio and data unless Mr. Allen authorizes us to pursue
      that particular business activity, which could adversely affect our ability
      to
      offer new products and services outside of the cable transmission business
      and
      to enter into new businesses, and could adversely affect our growth, financial
      condition and results of operations.

Our
      certificate of incorporation and Charter Holdco's limited liability company
      agreement provide that Charter and Charter Holdco and our subsidiaries, cannot
      engage in any business activity outside the cable transmission business except
      for specified businesses. This will be the case unless Mr. Allen consents to
      our
      engaging in the business activity. The cable transmission business means the
      business of transmitting video, audio (including telephone services), and data
      over cable television systems owned, operated, or managed by us from time to
      time. These provisions may limit our ability to take advantage of attractive
      business opportunities.

The
      loss of Mr. Allen's services could adversely affect our ability to manage our
      business.

Mr.
      Allen
      is Chairman of our board of directors and provides strategic guidance and other
      services to us. If we were to lose his services, our growth, financial
      condition, and results of operations could be adversely impacted.

The
      special tax allocation provisions of the Charter Holdco limited liability
      company agreement may cause us in some circumstances to pay more taxes than
      if
      the special tax allocation provisions were not in
      effect.

Charter
      Holdco's limited liability company agreement provided that through the end
      of
      2003, net tax losses (such net tax losses being determined under the federal
      income tax rules for determining capital accounts) of Charter Holdco that would
      otherwise have been allocated to us based generally on our percentage ownership
      of outstanding common membership units of Charter Holdco, would instead be
      allocated to the membership units held by Vulcan Cable III Inc. (“Vulcan Cable”)
      and CII. The purpose of these special tax allocation provisions was to allow
      Mr.
      Allen to take advantage, for tax purposes, of the losses generated by Charter
      Holdco during such period. In some situations, these special tax allocation
      provisions could result in our having to pay taxes in an amount that is more
      or
      less than if Charter Holdco had allocated net tax losses to its members based
      generally on the percentage of outstanding common membership units owned by
      such
      members. For further discussion on the details of the tax allocation provisions

Risks
      Related to Regulatory and Legislative Matters

Our
      business is subject to extensive governmental legislation and regulation, which
      could adversely affect our business.

Regulation
      of the cable industry has increased cable operators' administrative and
      operational expenses and limited their revenues. Cable operators are subject
      to,
      among other things:

·

rules
                governing the provision of cable equipment and compatibility with
                new
                digital technologies;

·

rules
                and regulations relating to subscriber
                privacy;

·

limited
                rate regulation;

·

requirements
                governing when a cable system must carry a particular broadcast station
                and when it must first obtain consent to carry a broadcast
                station;


·

rules
                  and regulations relating to provision of voice
                  communications;

·

rules
                  for franchise renewals and transfers;
                  and

·

other
                  requirements covering a variety of operational areas such as equal
                  employment opportunity, technical standards, and customer service
                  requirements.

Additionally,
      many aspects of these regulations are currently the subject of judicial
      proceedings and administrative or legislative proposals. There are also ongoing
      efforts to amend or expand the federal, state, and local regulation of some
      of
      our cable systems, which may compound the regulatory risks we already face.
      Certain states and localities are considering new telecommunications taxes
      that
      could increase operating expenses.

Our
      cable system franchises are subject to non-renewal or termination. The failure
      to renew a franchise in one or more key markets could adversely affect our
      business.

Our
      cable
      systems generally operate pursuant to franchises, permits, and similar
      authorizations issued by a state or local governmental authority controlling
      the
      public rights-of-way. Many franchises establish comprehensive facilities and
      service requirements, as well as specific customer service standards and
      monetary penalties for non-compliance. In many cases, franchises are terminable
      if the franchisee fails to comply with significant provisions set forth in
      the
      franchise agreement governing system operations. Franchises are generally
      granted for fixed terms and must be periodically renewed. Local franchising
      authorities may resist granting a renewal if either past performance or the
      prospective operating proposal is considered inadequate. Franchise authorities
      often demand concessions or other commitments as a condition to renewal. In
      some
      instances, franchises have not been renewed at expiration, and we have operated
      and are operating under either temporary operating agreements or without a
      license while negotiating renewal terms with the local franchising authorities.
      Approximately 12% of our franchises, covering approximately 15% of our analog
      video customers, were expired as of December 31, 2006. Approximately 8% of
      additional franchises, covering approximately an additional 11% of our analog
      video customers, will expire on or before December 31, 2007, if not renewed
      prior to expiration.

We
      cannot
      assure you that we will be able to comply with all significant provisions of
      our
      franchise agreements and certain of our franchisors have from time to time
      alleged that we have not complied with these agreements. Additionally, although
      historically we have renewed our franchises without incurring significant costs,
      we cannot assure you that we will be able to renew, or to renew as favorably,
      our franchises in the future. A termination of or a sustained failure to renew
      a
      franchise in one or more key markets could adversely affect our business in
      the
      affected geographic area.

Our
      cable system franchises are non-exclusive. Accordingly, local franchising
      authorities can grant additional franchises and create competition in market
      areas where none existed previously, resulting in overbuilds, which could
      adversely affect results of operations.

Our
      cable
      system franchises are non-exclusive. Consequently, local franchising authorities
      can grant additional franchises to competitors in the same geographic area
      or
      operate their own cable systems. In addition, certain telephone companies are
      seeking authority to operate in local communities without first obtaining a
      local franchise. As a result, competing operators may build systems in areas
      in
      which we hold franchises. In some cases municipal utilities may legally compete
      with us without obtaining a franchise from the local franchising
      authority.

Legislative
      proposals have been introduced in the United States Congress and in state
      legislatures that would greatly streamline cable franchising. This legislation
      is intended to facilitate entry by new competitors, particularly local telephone
      companies. Such legislation has passed in several states, including states
      where
      we have significant operations. Although certain of these states have provided
      some regulatory relief for incumbent cable operators, these proposals are
      generally viewed as being more favorable to new entrants due to a number of
      factors, including efforts to withhold streamlined cable franchising from
      incumbents until after the expiration of their existing franchises, and the
      potential for new entrants to serve only higher-income areas of a particular
      community. To the extent incumbent cable operators are not able to avail
      themselves of this streamlined franchising process, such operators may continue
      to be subject to more onerous franchise requirements at the local level than
      new
      entrants. At least two additional states where we have cable systems have issued
      regulations that will facilitate telephone company provision of video services
      by eliminating or reducing the application of franchising requirements to the
      telephone companies. A proceeding is pending at the FCC to determine whether
      local franchising authorities are impeding the deployment of competitive cable
      services through unreasonable franchising requirements and whether such
      impediments should be preempted. We are not yet able to determine what impact
      such proceeding may have on us.


The
      existence of more than one cable system operating in the same territory is
      referred to as an overbuild. These overbuilds could adversely affect our growth,
      financial condition, and results of operations by creating or increasing
      competition. As of December 31, 2006, we are aware of traditional overbuild
      situations impacting approximately 7% of our estimated homes passed, and
      potential traditional overbuild situations in areas servicing approximately
      an
      additional 4% of our estimated homes passed. Additional overbuild situations
      may
      occur in other systems.

Local
      franchise authorities have the ability to impose additional regulatory
      constraints on our business, which could further increase our
      expenses.

In
      addition to the franchise agreement, cable authorities in some jurisdictions
      have adopted cable regulatory ordinances that further regulate the operation
      of
      cable systems. This additional regulation increases the cost of operating our
      business. We cannot assure you that the local franchising authorities will
      not
      impose new and more restrictive requirements. Local franchising authorities
      also
      generally have the power to reduce rates and order refunds on the rates charged
      for basic services.

Further
      regulation of the cable industry could cause us to delay or cancel service
      or
      programming enhancements, or impair our ability to raise rates to cover our
      increasing costs, resulting in increased losses.

Currently,
      rate regulation is strictly limited to the basic service tier and associated
      equipment and installation activities. However, the FCC and the U.S. Congress
      continue to be concerned that cable rate increases are exceeding inflation.
      It
      is possible that either the FCC or the U.S. Congress will again restrict the
      ability of cable system operators to implement rate increases. Should this
      occur, it would impede our ability to raise our rates. If we are unable to
      raise
      our rates in response to increasing costs, our losses would
      increase.

There
      has
      been considerable legislative and regulatory interest in requiring cable
      operators to offer historically bundled programming services on an á la carte
      basis, or to at least offer a separately available child-friendly “Family Tier.”
It is possible that new marketing restrictions could be adopted in the future.
      Such restrictions could adversely affect our operations.

Actions
      by pole owners might subject us to significantly increased pole attachment
      costs.

Pole
      attachments are cable wires that are attached to utility poles. Cable system
      attachments to public utility poles historically have been regulated at the
      federal or state level, generally resulting in favorable pole attachment rates
      for attachments used to provide cable service. The FCC clarified that a cable
      operator's favorable pole rates are not endangered by the provision of Internet
      access, and that approach ultimately was upheld by the Supreme Court of the
      United States. Despite the existing regulatory regime, utility pole owners
      in
      many areas are attempting to raise pole attachment fees and impose additional
      costs on cable operators and others. The favorable pole attachment rates
      afforded cable operators under federal law can be increased by utility companies
      if the operator provides telecommunications services, in addition to cable
      service, over cable wires attached to utility poles. To date, VoIP service
      has
      not been classified as either a telecommunications service or cable service
      under the Communications Act. If VoIP were classified as a telecommunications
      service under the Communications Act by the FCC, a state Public Utility
      Commission, or an appropriate court, it might result in significantly increased
      pole attachment costs for us, which could adversely affect our financial
      condition and results of operations. We are a defendant in at least one lawsuit
      where the utility company claims that we should pay an increased rate on its
      poles. Any significant increased pole attachment costs could have a material
      adverse impact on our profitability and discourage system upgrades and the
      introduction of new products and services.

We
      may be required to provide access to our networks to other Internet service
      providers which could significantly increase our competition and adversely
      affect our ability to provide new products and
      services.

A
      number
      of companies, including independent Internet service providers (“ISPs”), have
      requested local authorities and the FCC to require cable operators to provide
      non-discriminatory access to cable's broadband infrastructure, so that these
      companies may deliver Internet services directly to customers over cable
      facilities. In a 2005 ruling, commonly referred to as

Brand X

, the
      Supreme Court upheld an FCC decision making it less likely that any
      nondiscriminatory “open access” requirements (which are generally associated
      with common carrier regulation of “telecommunications services”) will be imposed
      on the cable industry by local, state or federal authorities. The Supreme Court
      held that the FCC was correct in classifying cable provided Internet service
      as
      an “information service,” rather than a “telecommunications service.”
Notwithstanding

Brand X

,
      there
      has been increasing advocacy by certain internet content providers and consumer
      groups for new federal laws or regulations to adopt so-called “net


neutrality”
      principles limiting the ability of broadband network owners (like Charter)
      to
      manage and control their own networks. The proposals might prevent network
      owners, for example, from charging bandwidth intensive content providers, such
      as certain online gaming, music, and video service providers, an additional
      fee
      to ensure quality delivery of the services to consumers. If we were required
      to
      allocate a portion of our bandwidth capacity to other Internet service
      providers, or were prohibited from charging heavy bandwidth intensive services
      a
      fee for use of our networks, we believe that it could impair our ability to
      use
      our bandwidth in ways that would generate maximum revenues.

Changes
      in channel carriage regulations could impose significant additional costs on
      us.

Cable
      operators also face significant regulation of their channel carriage. They
      currently can be required to devote substantial capacity to the carriage of
      programming that they would not carry voluntarily, including certain local
      broadcast signals, local public, educational, and government access programming,
      and unaffiliated commercial leased access programming. This carriage burden
      could increase in the future, particularly if cable systems were required to
      carry both the analog and digital versions of local broadcast signals (dual
      carriage), or to carry multiple program streams included with a single digital
      broadcast transmission (multicast carriage). Additional government-mandated
      broadcast carriage obligations could disrupt existing programming commitments,
      interfere with our preferred use of limited channel capacity, and limit our
      ability to offer services that would maximize customer appeal and revenue
      potential. Although the FCC issued a decision in February 2005, confirming
      an
      earlier ruling against mandating either dual carriage or multicast carriage,
      that decision is subject to a petition for reconsideration which is pending.
      In
      addition, the FCC could reverse its own ruling or Congress could legislate
      additional carriage obligations.

Offering
      voice communications service may subject us to additional regulatory burdens,
      causing us to incur additional costs.

In
      2002,
      we began to offer voice communications services on a limited basis over our
      broadband network. We continue to develop and deploy VoIP services. The FCC
      has
      declared that certain VoIP services are not subject to traditional state public
      utility regulation. The full extent of the FCC preemption of state and local
      regulation of VoIP services is not yet clear. Expanding our offering of these
      services may require us to obtain certain authorizations, including federal
      and
      state licenses. We may not be able to obtain such authorizations in a timely
      manner, or conditions could be imposed upon such licenses or authorizations
      that
      may not be favorable to us. The FCC has extended certain traditional
      telecommunications requirements, such as E911 and Universal Service
      requirements, to many VoIP providers, such as Charter. The FCC has also required
      that these VoIP providers comply with obligations applied to traditional
      telecommunications carriers to ensure their networks can accommodate law
      enforcement wiretaps by May 2007. Telecommunications companies generally are
      subject to other significant regulation which could also be extended to VoIP
      providers. If additional telecommunications regulations are applied to our
      VoIP
      service, it could cause us to incur additional costs.

Properties.

Our
      principal physical assets consist of cable distribution plant and equipment,
      including signal receiving, encoding and decoding devices, headend reception
      facilities, distribution systems, and customer premise equipment for each of
      our
      cable systems.

Our
      cable
      plant and related equipment are generally attached to utility poles under pole
      rental agreements with local public utilities and telephone companies, and
      in
      certain locations are buried in underground ducts or trenches. We own or lease
      real property for signal reception sites, and own most of our service
      vehicles.

Historically,
      our subsidiaries have owned the real property and buildings for our data
      centers, customer contact centers, and our divisional administrative offices.
      Since early 2003 we have reduced our total real estate portfolio square footage
      by approximately 15% and have decreased our annual operating lease costs by
      approximately 28%. In addition, Charter has sold over $34 million worth of
      land
      and buildings since early 2003. We plan to continue to reduce operating costs
      and improve utilization in this area through consolidation of sites within
      our
      system footprints. Our subsidiaries generally have leased space for business
      offices throughout our operating divisions. Our headend and tower locations
      are
      located on owned or leased parcels of land, and we generally own the towers
      on


which
      our
      equipment is located. Charter Holdco owns the real property and building for
      our
      principal executive offices.

The
      physical components of our cable systems require maintenance as well as periodic
      upgrades to support the new services and products we introduce. See
“Item 1. Business - Our Network Technology.” We believe that our properties
      are generally in good operating condition and are suitable for our business
      operations.

Item 3.

Legal
      Proceedings.

We
      are a
      defendant or co-defendant in several unrelated lawsuits claiming infringement
      of
      various patents relating to various aspects of our businesses. Other industry
      participants are also defendants in certain of these cases, and, in many cases,
      we expect that any potential liability would be the responsibility of our
      equipment vendors pursuant to applicable contractual indemnification provisions.
      In the event that a court ultimately determines that we infringe on any
      intellectual property rights, we may be subject to substantial damages and/or
      an
      injunction that could require us or our vendors to modify certain products
      and
      services we offer to our subscribers. While we believe the lawsuits are without
      merit, and intend to defend the actions vigorously, the lawsuits could be
      material to our consolidated results of operations of any one period, and no
      assurance can be given that any adverse outcome would not be material to our
      consolidated financial condition, results of operations or
      liquidity.

We
      are a
      party to other lawsuits and claims that arise in the ordinary course of
      conducting our business. The ultimate outcome of these other legal matters
      pending against us or our subsidiaries cannot be predicted, and although such
      lawsuits and claims are not expected individually to have a material adverse
      effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or
      liquidity, such lawsuits could have, in the aggregate, a material adverse effect
      on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or
      liquidity.

(C)
      Dividends

Charter
      has not paid stock or cash dividends on any of its common stock, and we do
      not
      intend to pay cash dividends on common stock for the foreseeable future. We
      intend to retain future earnings, if any, to finance our business.

Charter
      Holdco may make pro rata distributions to all holders of its common membership
      units, including Charter. Covenants in the indentures and credit agreements
      governing the debt obligations of Charter Communications Holdings and its
      subsidiaries restrict their ability to make distributions to us, and
      accordingly, limit our ability to declare or pay cash dividends. See
“Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
      Results of Operations.”

(D)
      Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation
      Plans

The
      following information is provided as of December 31, 2006 with respect to equity
      compensation plans:


(1)

This
                total does not include 2,572,267 shares issued pursuant to restricted
                stock grants made under our 2001 Stock Incentive Plan, which were
                or are
                subject to vesting based on continued employment or 12,184,749 performance
                shares issued under our LTIP plan, which are subject to vesting based
                on
                continued employment and Charter’s achievement of certain performance
                criteria.

(2)

Includes
                shares of Class A common stock to be issued upon exercise of options
                granted pursuant to an individual compensation agreement with a
                consultant.

For
      information regarding securities issued under our equity compensation plans,
      see
      Note 20 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in
      “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

(E)
      Performance Graph

The
      graph
      below shows the cumulative total return on our Class A common stock for the
      period from December 31, 2001 through December 31, 2006, in comparison
      to the cumulative total return on Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and a
      peer group consisting of the four national cable operators that are most
      comparable to us in terms of size and nature of operations. The Company’s peer
      group consists of Cablevision Systems Corporation, Comcast Corporation, Insight
      Communications, Inc. (through third quarter 2005) and Mediacom Communications
      Corp. The results shown assume that $100 was invested on December 31, 2001
      and that all dividends were reinvested. These indices are included for
      comparative purposes only and do not reflect whether it is management’s opinion
      that such indices are an appropriate measure of the relative performance of
      the
      stock involved, nor are they intended to forecast or be indicative of future
      performance of the Class A common stock.


(F) Recent
      Sales of Unregistered Securities

During
      2006, there were no unregistered sales of securities of the registrant other
      than those previously reported on a Form 10-Q or Form 8-K.

Item 6.

Selected
      Financial Data

.

The
      following table presents selected consolidated financial data for the periods
      indicated (dollars in millions, except share data):

(a)

In
                2006, we sold certain cable television systems in West Virginia and
                Virginia

to
                Cebridge Connections, Inc.

We
                determined that the West Virginia and Virginia cable systems comprise
                operations and cash flows that for financial reporting purposes meet
                the
                criteria for discontinued operations. Accordingly, the results of
                operations for the West Virginia and Virginia cable systems have
                been
                presented as discontinued operations, net of tax for the year ended
                December 31, 2006 and all prior periods presented herein have been
                reclassified to conform to the current
                presentation.

(b)

Minority
                interest represents

preferred
                membership interests in our indirect subsidiary, CC VIII, and since
                June 6, 2003, the pro rata share of the profits and losses of CC
                VIII. This preferred membership interest arises from approximately
                $630 million of preferred membership units issued by CC VIII in
                connection with an acquisition in February 2000. As part of the Private
                Exchange, CCHC contributed its 70% interest in the

24,273,943
                Class A preferred membership units (collectively, the "CC VIII
                interest")

to
                CCH I.

See
                Note 22 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements contained
                in
                “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Reported
                losses allocated to minority interest on the statement of operations
                are
                limited to the extent of any remaining minority interest on the balance
                sheet related to Charter Holdco. Because minority interest in Charter
                Holdco was substantially eliminated at December 31, 2003, beginning
                in
                2004, Charter began to absorb substantially all losses before income
                taxes
                that otherwise would have been allocated to minority interest. Under
                our
                existing capital structure, Charter will continue to absorb all future
                losses for GAAP purposes.

Comparability
      of the above information from year to year is affected by acquisitions and
      dispositions completed by us. See Note 4 to our accompanying consolidated
      financial statements contained in “Item 8. Financial Statements and
      Supplementary Data” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
      Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital
      Resources.”


Item 7.

Management’s
      Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
      Operations.

Reference
      is made to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Statement Regarding
      Forward-Looking Statements,” which describes important factors that could cause
      actual results to differ from expectations and non-historical information
      contained herein. In addition, the following discussion should be read in
      conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements of Charter
      Communications, Inc. and subsidiaries as of and for the years ended
      December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.

Overview

Charter
      is a broadband communications company operating in the United States, with
      approximately 5.73 million customers at December 31, 2006. Through our hybrid
      fiber and coaxial cable network, we offer our customers traditional cable video
      programming (analog and digital, which we refer to as "video" service),
      high-speed Internet access, advanced broadband cable services (such as OnDemand,
      high definition television service and DVR) and, in many of our markets,
      telephone service. See "Item 1. Business

—
      Products and Services

"

for
      further description of these terms, including

"

customers.

"

Approximately
      88% of our revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005,
      respectively, are attributable to monthly subscription fees charged to customers
      for our video, high-speed Internet, telephone, and commercial services provided
      by our cable systems. Generally, these customer subscriptions may be
      discontinued by the customer at any time. The remaining 12% of revenue is
      derived primarily from advertising revenues, franchise fee revenues (which
      are
      collected by us but then paid to local franchising authorities), pay-per-view
      and OnDemand programming (where users are charged a fee for individual programs
      viewed), installation or reconnection fees charged to customers to commence
      or
      reinstate service, and commissions related to the sale of merchandise by home
      shopping services.

The
      industry's and our most significant operational challenges include competition
      from DBS providers and DSL service providers. See "Item 1. Business —
Competition.'' We believe that competition from DBS has resulted in net analog
      video customer losses. In addition, DBS competition combined with increasingly
      limited opportunities to expand our customer base, now that approximately 52%
      of
      our analog video customers subscribe to our digital video service, has resulted
      in decreased growth rates for digital video customers. Competition from DSL
      providers has resulted in decreased growth rates for high-speed Internet
      customers. In the recent past, we have grown revenues by offsetting analog
      video
      customer losses with price increases and sales of incremental services such
      as
      high-speed Internet, OnDemand, DVR, high definition television, and telephone.
      We expect to continue to grow revenues through price increases, increases in
      the
      number of our customers who purchase bundled services, and through sales of
      incremental video services including high definition television, OnDemand and
      DVR service. In addition, we expect to increase revenues by expanding the sales
      of our services to our commercial customers.

Our
      expenses primarily consist of operating costs, selling, general and
      administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization expense and interest
      expense. Operating costs primarily include programming costs, the cost of our
      workforce, cable service related expenses, advertising sales costs and franchise
      fees. Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily include salaries
      and benefits, rent expense, billing costs, call center costs, internal network
      costs, bad debt expense and property taxes. Controlling our expenses impacts
      our
      ability to improve margins. We are attempting to control our costs of operations
      by maintaining strict controls on expenses. More specifically, we are focused
      on
      managing our cost structure by managing our workforce to control cost increases
      and improve productivity, and leveraging our growth and increasing size in
      purchasing activities. In addition, we are reviewing our pricing and programming
      packaging strategies. See “Item 1. Business — Programming” for more details.

Our
      operating income from continuing operations increased to $367 million for the
      year ended December 31, 2006 from $304 million for the year ended December
      31,
      2005. We had positive operating margins (defined as operating income from
      continuing operations divided by revenues) of 7% and 6% for the years ended
      December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The improvement in operating income
      from continuing operations and operating margin for the year ended December
      31,
      2006 is principally due to an increase in revenue over expenses as a result
      of
      increased customers for high-speed Internet, digital video, and advanced
      services, as well as overall rate increases. Operating loss from continuing
      operations was $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004. We had a
      negative operating margin of 40% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The
      increase in operating income from continuing operations and positive operating
      margin for the year ended December 31, 2005 was principally due to the
      impairment of franchises of $2.3 billion recorded in the third quarter of 2004,
      which did not recur in 2005.


Although
      we do not expect charges for impairment in the future of comparable magnitude,
      potential charges could occur due to changes in market conditions.

We
      have a
      history of net losses. Further, we expect to continue to report net losses
      for
      the foreseeable future. Our net losses are principally attributable to
      insufficient revenue to cover the combination of operating expenses and interest
      expenses we incur because of our high level of debt and the depreciation
      expenses that we incur resulting from the capital investments we have made
      and
      continue to make in our cable properties. We expect that these expenses will
      remain significant.

Beginning
      in 2004 and continuing through January 2007, we sold several cable systems
      which

reflects
      our strategy to divest geographically non-strategic assets to allow for more
      efficient operations, while also increasing our liquidity.

In
      2004,
      we sold cable systems representing a total of approximately 228,500 analog
      video
      customers. In 2005, we closed the sale of certain cable systems representing
      a
      total of approximately 33,000 analog video customers, and in 2006, we sold
      cable
      systems serving a total of approximately 390,300 analog video customers. In
      January 2007, we completed the sale of additional cable systems representing
      approximately 34,400 analog video customers. As a result of these sales we
      have
      improved our geographic footprint by reducing our number of headends, increasing
      the number of customers per headend, and reducing the number of states in which
      the majority of our customers reside.

In
        2006,
        we determined that the West Virginia and Virginia cable systems, which were
        part
        of the system sales disclosed above, comprised operations and cash flows
        that
        for financial reporting purposes met the criteria for discontinued operations.
        Accordingly, the results of operations for the West Virginia and Virginia
        cable
        systems (including a gain on sale of approximately $200 million recorded
        in the
        third quarter of 2006), have been presented as discontinued operations, net
        of
        tax, for the year ended December 31, 2006, and all prior periods presented
        herein have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Tax
        expense of $18 million associated with this gain on sale was recorded in
        the
        fourth quarter of 2006.

Critical
        Accounting Policies and Estimates

Certain
      of our accounting policies require our management to make difficult, subjective
      or complex judgments. Management has discussed these policies with the Audit
      Committee of Charter’s board of directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed
      the following disclosure. We consider the following policies to be the most
      critical in understanding the estimates, assumptions and judgments that are
      involved in preparing our financial statements, and the uncertainties that
      could
      affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows:

·

capitalization
                of labor and overhead costs;

·

useful
                lives of property, plant and
                equipment;

·

impairment
                of property, plant, and equipment, franchises, and
                goodwill;

·

income
                taxes; and

·

litigation.

In
      addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require
      estimates or judgment but are not deemed critical, such as the allowance for
      doubtful accounts, but changes in judgment, or estimates in these other items
      could also have a material impact on our financial statements.

Capitalization
      of labor and overhead costs.

The
      cable
      industry is capital intensive, and a large portion of our resources are spent
      on
      capital activities associated with extending, rebuilding, and upgrading our
      cable network. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the net carrying amount of
      our property, plant and equipment (consisting primarily of cable network assets)
      was approximately $5.2 billion (representing 35% of total assets) and $5.8
      billion (representing 36% of total assets), respectively. Total capital
      expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 were
      approximately $1.1 billion, $1.1 billion, and $924 million, respectively.

Costs
      associated with network construction, initial customer installations (including
      initial installations of new or advanced services), installation refurbishments,
      and the addition of network equipment necessary to provide new or advanced
      services, are capitalized. While our capitalization is based on specific
      activities, once capitalized, we track


these
      costs by fixed asset category at the cable system level, and not on a specific
      asset basis. Costs capitalized as part of initial customer installations include
      materials, direct labor, and certain indirect costs (“overhead”). These indirect
      costs are associated with the activities of personnel who assist in connecting
      and activating the new service, and consist of compensation and overhead costs
      associated with these support functions. The costs of disconnecting service
      at a
      customer’s dwelling or reconnecting service to a previously installed dwelling
      are charged to operating expense in the period incurred. Costs for repairs
      and
      maintenance are charged to operating expense as incurred, while equipment
      replacement and betterments, including replacement of cable drops from the
      pole
      to the dwelling, are capitalized.

We
      make
      judgments regarding the installation and construction activities to be
      capitalized. We capitalize direct labor and overhead using standards developed
      from actual costs and applicable operational data. We calculate standards for
      items such as the labor rates, overhead rates, and the actual amount of time
      required to perform a capitalizable activity. For example, the standard amounts
      of time required to perform capitalizable activities are based on studies of
      the
      time required to perform such activities. Overhead rates are established based
      on an analysis of the nature of costs incurred in support of capitalizable
      activities, and a determination of the portion of costs that is directly
      attributable to capitalizable activities. The impact of changes that resulted
      from these studies were not significant in the periods presented.

Labor
      costs directly associated with capital projects are capitalized. We capitalize
      direct labor costs based upon the specific time devoted to network construction
      and customer installation activities. Capitalizable activities performed in
      connection with customer installations include such activities as:

·

Dispatching
                a “truck roll” to the customer’s dwelling for service
                connection;

·

Verification
                of serviceability to the customer’s dwelling (i.e., determining whether
                the customer’s dwelling is capable of receiving service by our cable
                network and/or receiving advanced or Internet
                services);

·

Customer
                premise activities performed by in-house field technicians and third-party
                contractors in connection with customer installations, installation
                of
                network equipment in connection with the installation of expanded
                services, and equipment replacement and betterment;
                and

·

Verifying
                the integrity of the customer’s network connection by initiating test
                signals downstream from the headend to the customer’s digital set-top
                box.

Judgment
      is required to determine the extent to which overhead costs incurred result
      from
      specific capital activities, and therefore should be capitalized. The primary
      costs that are included in the determination of the overhead rate are
      (i) employee benefits and payroll taxes associated with capitalized direct
      labor, (ii) direct variable costs associated with capitalizable activities,
      consisting primarily of installation and construction vehicle costs,
      (iii) the cost of support personnel, such as dispatchers, who directly
      assist with capitalizable installation activities, and (iv) indirect costs
      directly attributable to capitalizable activities.

While
      we
      believe our existing capitalization policies are appropriate, a significant
      change in the nature or extent of our system activities could affect
      management’s judgment about the extent to which we should capitalize direct
      labor or overhead in the future. We monitor the appropriateness of our
      capitalization policies, and perform updates to our internal studies on an
      ongoing basis to determine whether facts or circumstances warrant a change
      to
      our capitalization policies. We capitalized internal direct labor and overhead
      of $204 million, $190 million and $164 million, respectively, for the years
      ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004. Capitalized internal direct labor
      and overhead costs have increased in 2005 and 2006 as compared to 2004 as a
      result of the use of more internal labor for capitalizable installations, rather
      than third party contractors.

Useful
      lives of property, plant and equipment.

We
      evaluate the appropriateness of estimated useful lives assigned to our property,
      plant and equipment, based on annual analyses of such useful lives, and revise
      such lives to the extent warranted by changing facts and circumstances. Any
      changes in estimated useful lives as a result of these analyses, which were
      not
      significant in the periods presented, will be reflected prospectively beginning
      in the period in which the study is completed. The effect of a one-year decrease
      in the weighted average remaining useful life of our property, plant and
      equipment would be an increase in depreciation expense for the year ended
      December 31, 2006 of approximately $168 million. The effect of a one-year
      increase in the weighted average useful life of our


property,
      plant and equipment would be a decrease in
      depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 of approximately
      $131
      million.

Depreciation
      expense related to property, plant and equipment totaled $1.3 billion, $1.4

      costs
      and expenses, for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004,
      respectively. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line composite method

Impairment
      of property, plant and equipment, franchises and goodwill.

As
      discussed above, the net carrying value of our property, plant and equipment
      is
      significant. We also have recorded a significant amount of cost related to
      franchises, pursuant to which we are granted the right to operate our cable
      distribution network throughout our service areas. The net carrying value of
      franchises as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 was approximately $9.2 billion
      (representing 61% of total assets) and $9.8 billion (representing 60% of total
      assets), respectively. Furthermore, our noncurrent assets include approximately
      $61 million of goodwill.

We
      adopted SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill
      and Other Intangible Assets,

on
      January 1, 2002. SFAS No. 142 requires that franchise intangible
      assets that meet specified indefinite-life criteria no longer be amortized
      against earnings, but instead must be tested for impairment annually based
      on
      valuations, or more frequently as warranted by events or changes in
      circumstances. In determining whether our franchises have an indefinite-life,
      we
      considered the likelihood of franchise renewals, the expected costs of franchise
      renewals, and the technological state of the associated cable systems, with
      a
      view to whether or not we are in compliance with any technology upgrading
      requirements specified in a franchise agreement. We have concluded that as
      of
      December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 more than 99% of our franchises qualify for
      indefinite-life treatment under SFAS No. 142, and that less than one
      percent of our franchises do not qualify for indefinite-life treatment, due
      to
      technological or operational factors that limit their lives. Costs of
      finite-lived franchises, along with costs associated with franchise renewals,
      are amortized on a straight-line basis over 10 years, which represents
      management’s best estimate of the average remaining useful lives of such
      franchises. Franchise amortization expense was $2 million, $4 million, and
      $3
      million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004,
      respectively. We expect that amortization expense on franchise assets will
      be
      approximately $1 million annually for each of the next five years. Actual
      amortization expense in future periods could differ from these estimates as
      a
      result of new intangible asset acquisitions or divestitures, changes in useful
      lives, and other relevant factors. Our goodwill is also deemed to have an
      indefinite life under SFAS No. 142.

SFAS
      No. 144,

Accounting
      for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

,
      requires that we evaluate the recoverability of our property, plant and
      equipment and franchise assets which did not qualify for indefinite-life
      treatment under SFAS No. 142, upon the occurrence of events or changes in
      circumstances which indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
      recoverable. Such events or changes in circumstances could include such factors
      as the impairment of our indefinite-life franchises under SFAS No. 142, changes
      in technological advances, fluctuations in the fair value of such assets,
      adverse changes in relationships with local franchise authorities, adverse
      changes in market conditions, or a deterioration of operating results. Under
      SFAS No. 144, a long-lived asset is deemed impaired when the carrying amount
      of
      the asset exceeds the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with
      the asset. No impairments of long-lived assets to be held and used were recorded
      in the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, or 2004, however, approximately
      $159
      million and $39 million of impairment on assets held for sale was recorded
      for
      the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We are also required
      to evaluate the recoverability of our indefinite-life franchises, as well as
      goodwill, on an annual basis or more frequently as deemed necessary.

Under
      both SFAS No. 144 and SFAS No. 142, if an asset is determined to be impaired,
      it
      is required to be written down to its estimated fair market value. We determine
      fair market value based on estimated discounted future cash flows, using
      reasonable and appropriate assumptions that are consistent with internal
      forecasts. Our assumptions include these and other factors: Penetration rates
      for analog and digital video, high-speed Internet, and telephone; revenue growth
      rates; and expected operating margins and capital expenditures. Considerable
      management judgment is necessary to estimate future cash flows, and such
      estimates include inherent uncertainties, including those relating to the timing
      and amount of future cash flows, and the discount rate used in the calculation.


Based
        on
        the guidance prescribed in Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 02-7,

Unit
        of Accounting for Testing of Impairment of Indefinite-Lived Intangible
        Assets

,
        franchises were aggregated into essentially inseparable

asset groups to
        conduct the valuations. The asset groups generally represent geographic
        clustering of our cable systems into groups by which such systems are managed.
        Management believes such groupings represent the highest and best use of
        those
        assets.

Our
      valuations, which are based on the present value of projected after tax cash
      flows, result in a value of property, plant and equipment, franchises, customer
      relationships, and our total entity value. The value of goodwill is the
      difference between the total entity value and amounts assigned to the other
      assets. The use of different valuation assumptions or definitions of franchises
      or customer relationships, such as our inclusion of the value of selling
      additional services to our current customers within customer relationships
      versus franchises, could significantly impact our valuations and any resulting
      impairment.

Franchises,
      for valuation purposes, are defined as the future economic benefits of the
      right
      to solicit and service potential customers (customer marketing rights), and
      the
      right to deploy and market new services, such as interactivity and telephone,
      to
      the potential customers (service marketing rights). Fair value is determined
      based on estimated discounted future cash flows using assumptions consistent
      with internal forecasts. The franchise after-tax cash flow is calculated as
      the
      after-tax cash flow generated by the potential customers obtained (less the
      anticipated customer churn) and the new services added to those customers in
      future periods. The sum of the present value of the franchises’ after-tax cash
      flow in years 1 through 10 and the continuing value of the after-tax cash flow
      beyond year 10 yields the fair value of the franchise. Prior to the adoption
      of
      EITF Topic D-108,

Use
      of the Residual Method to Value Acquired Assets Other than
      Goodwill

,
      discussed below, we followed a residual method of valuing our franchise assets,
      which had the effect of including goodwill with the franchise
      assets.

We
      follow
      the guidance of EITF Issue 02-17,

Recognition
      of Customer Relationship Intangible Assets Acquired in a Business Combination,

in
      valuing customer relationships. Customer relationships, for valuation purposes,
      represent the value of the business relationship with our existing customers
      (less the anticipated customer churn), and are calculated by projecting future
      after-tax cash flows from these customers, including the right to deploy and
      market additional services such as interactivity and telephone to these
      customers. The present value of these after-tax cash flows yields the fair
      value
      of the customer relationships. Substantially all our acquisitions occurred
      prior
      to January 1, 2002. We did not record any value associated with the
      customer relationship intangibles related to those acquisitions. For
      acquisitions subsequent to January 1, 2002, we did assign a value to the
      customer relationship intangible, which is amortized over its estimated useful
      life.

The
      valuations used in our impairment assessments involve numerous assumptions
      as
      noted above. While economic conditions, applicable at the time of the valuation,
      indicate the combination of assumptions utilized in the valuations are
      reasonable, as market conditions change so will the assumptions, with a
      resulting impact on the valuation and consequently the potential impairment
      charge. At October 1, 2006, a 10% and 5% decline in the estimated fair value
      of
      our franchise assets in each of our asset groupings would have resulted in
      an
      impairment charge of approximately $60 million and $0,
      respectively.

In
      September 2004, EITF Topic D-108,

Use
      of the Residual Method to Value Acquired Assets Other than
      Goodwill

,
      was
      issued, which requires the direct method of separately valuing all intangible
      assets and does not permit goodwill to be included in franchise assets. We
      performed an impairment assessment as of September 30, 2004, and adopted Topic
      D-108 in that assessment resulting in a total franchise impairment of
      approximately $3.3 billion. We recorded a cumulative effect of accounting change
      of $765 million (approximately $875 million before tax effects of $91 million
      and minority interest effects of $19 million) for the year ended December 31,
      2004 representing the portion of our total franchise impairment attributable
      to
      no longer including goodwill with franchise assets. The effect of the adoption
      was to increase net loss and loss per share by $765 million and $2.55,
      respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2004. The remaining $2.4 billion
      of the total franchise impairment was attributable to the use of lower projected
      growth rates and the resulting revised estimates of future cash flows in our
      valuation, and was recorded as impairment of franchises in our consolidated
      statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004. Sustained analog
      video customer losses by us and our industry peers in the third quarter of
      primarily as a result of increased competition from DBS providers and decreased
      growth rates in our and our industry peers’ high-speed Internet customers in the
      third quarter of 2004, in part as a result of increased competition from DSL
      providers, led us to lower our projected growth rates and accordingly revise
      our
      estimates of future cash flows from those used in prior years. See “Item 1.
      Business — Competition.”

The
      valuations completed at October 1, 2006 and 2005 showed franchise values in
      excess of book value, and thus resulted in no impairment.


Income
      Taxes.

All
      operations are held through Charter Holdco and its direct and indirect
      subsidiaries. Charter Holdco and the majority of its subsidiaries are not
      subject to income tax. However, certain of these subsidiaries are corporations
      and are subject to income tax. All of the taxable income, gains, losses,
      deductions and credits of Charter Holdco are passed through to its members:
      Charter, CII and Vulcan Cable. Charter is responsible for its share of taxable
      income or loss of Charter Holdco allocated to it in accordance with the Charter
      Holdco limited liability company agreement (“LLC Agreement”) and partnership tax
      rules and regulations.

The
      LLC
      Agreement provides for certain special allocations of net tax profits and net
      tax losses (such net tax profits and net tax losses being determined under
      the
      applicable federal income tax rules for determining capital accounts). Under
      the
      LLC Agreement, through the end of 2003, net tax losses of Charter Holdco that
      would otherwise have been allocated to Charter based generally on its percentage
      ownership of outstanding common units were allocated instead to membership
      units
      held by Vulcan Cable and CII (the “Special Loss Allocations”) to the extent of
      their respective capital account balances. After 2003, under the LLC Agreement,
      net tax losses of Charter Holdco are allocated to Charter, Vulcan Cable and
      CII
      based generally on their respective percentage ownership of outstanding common
      units to the extent of their respective capital account balances. Allocations
      of
      net tax losses in excess of the members’ aggregate capital account balances are
      allocated under the rules governing Regulatory Allocations, as described below.
      Subject to the Curative Allocation Provisions described below, the LLC Agreement
      further provides that, beginning at the time Charter Holdco generates net tax
      profits, the net tax profits that would otherwise have been allocated to Charter
      based generally on its percentage ownership of outstanding common membership
      units, will instead generally be allocated to Vulcan Cable and CII (the “Special
      Profit Allocations”). The Special Profit Allocations to Vulcan Cable and CII
      will generally continue until the cumulative amount of the Special Profit
      Allocations offsets the cumulative amount of the Special Loss Allocations.
      The
      amount and timing of the Special Profit Allocations are subject to the potential
      application of, and interaction with, the Curative Allocation Provisions
      described in the following paragraph. The LLC Agreement generally provides
      that
      any additional net tax profits are to be allocated among the members of Charter
      Holdco based generally on their respective percentage ownership of Charter
      Holdco common membership units.

Because
      the respective capital account balances of each of Vulcan Cable and CII were
      reduced to zero by December 31, 2002, certain net tax losses of Charter
      Holdco that were to be allocated for 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005, to Vulcan Cable
      and CII, instead have been allocated to Charter (the “Regulatory Allocations”).
      As a result of the allocation of net tax losses to Charter in 2005, Charter’s
      capital account balance was reduced to zero during 2005. The LLC Agreement
      provides that once the capital account balances of all members have been reduced
      to zero, net tax losses are to be allocated to Charter, Vulcan Cable and CII
      based generally on their respective percentage ownership of outstanding common
      units. Such allocations are also considered to be Regulatory Allocations. The
      LLC Agreement further provides that, to the extent possible, the effect of
      the
      Regulatory Allocations is to be offset over time pursuant to certain curative
      allocation provisions (the “Curative Allocation Provisions”) so that, after
      certain offsetting adjustments are made, each member’s capital account balance
      is equal to the capital account balance such member would have had if the
      Regulatory Allocations had not been part of the LLC Agreement. The cumulative
      amount of the actual tax losses allocated to Charter as a result of the
      Regulatory Allocations through the year ended December 31, 2006 is
      approximately $4.1 billion.

As
      a
      result of the Special Loss Allocations and the Regulatory Allocations referred
      to above (and their interaction with the allocations related to assets
      contributed to Charter Holdco with differences between book and tax basis),
      the
      cumulative amount of losses of Charter Holdco allocated to Vulcan Cable and
      CII
      is in excess of the amount that would have been allocated to such entities
      if
      the losses of Charter Holdco had been allocated among its members in proportion
      to their respective percentage ownership of Charter Holdco common membership
      units. The cumulative amount of such excess losses was approximately
      $1 billion through December 31, 2006.

In
      certain situations, the Special Loss Allocations, Special Profit Allocations,
      Regulatory Allocations, and Curative Allocation Provisions described above
      could
      result in Charter paying taxes in an amount that is more or less than if Charter
      Holdco had allocated net tax profits and net tax losses among its members based
      generally on the number of common membership units owned by such members. This
      could occur due to differences in (i) the character of the allocated income
      (e.g., ordinary versus capital), (ii) the allocated amount and timing of
      tax depreciation and tax amortization expense due to the application of
      section 704(c) under the Internal Revenue Code, (iii) the potential
      interaction between the Special Profit Allocations and the Curative Allocation
      Provisions, (iv) the amount and timing of alternative minimum taxes paid by
      Charter, if any, (v) the apportionment of the allocated income or loss
      among the states in which Charter Holdco does business, and (vi) future
      federal and state tax laws. Further, in the event of new capital contributions
      to Charter Holdco, it is possible that the tax effects of the Special Profit
      Allocations, Special Loss Allocations, Regulatory Allocations and Curative
      Allocation Provisions will change


significantly
      pursuant to the provisions of the income tax regulations or the terms of a
      contribution agreement with respect to such contributions. Such change could
      defer the actual tax benefits to be derived by Charter with respect to the
      net
      tax losses allocated to it or accelerate the actual taxable income to Charter
      with respect to the net tax profits allocated to it. As a result, it is possible
      under certain circumstances, that Charter could receive future allocations
      of
      taxable income in excess of its currently allocated tax deductions and available
      tax loss carryforwards. The ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards
      is potentially subject to certain limitations as discussed below.

In
      addition, under their exchange agreement with Charter, Vulcan Cable and CII
      have
      the right at anytime to exchange some or all of their membership units in
      Charter Holdco for Charter’s Class B common stock, be merged with Charter
      in exchange for Charter’s Class B common stock, or be acquired by Charter in a
      non-taxable reorganization in exchange for Charter’s Class B common stock. If
      such an exchange were to take place prior to the date that the Special Profit
      Allocation provisions had fully offset the Special Loss Allocations, Vulcan
      Cable and CII could elect to cause Charter Holdco to make the remaining Special
      Profit Allocations to Vulcan Cable and CII immediately prior to the consummation
      of the exchange. In the event Vulcan Cable and CII choose not to make such
      election or to the extent such allocations are not possible, Charter would
      then
      be allocated tax profits attributable to the membership units received in such
      exchange pursuant to the Special Profit Allocation provisions. Mr. Allen
      has generally agreed to reimburse Charter for any incremental income taxes
      that
      Charter would owe as a result of such an exchange and any resulting future
      Special Profit Allocations to Charter. The ability of Charter to utilize net
      operating loss carryforwards is potentially subject to certain limitations
      (see
“Risk Factors — For tax purposes, there is significant risk that we will
      experience an ownership change resulting in a material limitation on the use
      of
      a substantial amount of our existing net operating loss carryforwards”). If
      Charter were to become subject to such limitations (whether as a result of
      an
      exchange described above or otherwise), and as a result were to owe taxes
      resulting from the Special Profit Allocations, then Mr. Allen may not be
      obligated to reimburse Charter for such income taxes. Further, Mr. Allen’s
      obligation to reimburse Charter for taxes attributable to the Special Profit
      Allocation to Charter ceases upon a subsequent change of control of
      Charter.

As
      of
      December 31, 2006 and 2005, we have recorded net deferred income tax
      liabilities of $514 million and $325 million, respectively. Additionally,
      as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, we have deferred tax assets of
      $4.6 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, which primarily relate to
      financial and tax losses allocated to Charter from Charter Holdco. We are
      required to record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that
      some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized.
      Given the uncertainty surrounding our ability to utilize our deferred tax
      assets, these items have been offset with a corresponding valuation allowance
      of
      $4.2 billion and $3.7 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
      respectively.

Charter
      Holdco is currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for the
      tax years ending December 31, 2002 and 2003. In addition, one of our
      indirect corporate subsidiaries is under examination by the Internal Revenue
      Service for the tax year ended December 31, 2004. Our results (excluding Charter
      and our indirect corporate subsidiaries, with the exception of the indirect
      corporate subsidiary under examination) for these years are subject to these
      examinations. Management does not expect the results of these examinations
      to
      have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results
      of operations, or our liquidity, including our ability to comply with our debt
      covenants.

Litigation.

Legal
      contingencies have a high degree of uncertainty. When a loss from a contingency
      becomes estimable and probable, a reserve is established. The reserve reflects
      management's best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the
      matter and is revised accordingly as facts and circumstances change, and
      ultimately when the matter is brought to closure. We have established reserves
      for certain matters and if any of these matters are resolved unfavorably,
      resulting in payment obligations in excess of management's best estimate of
      the
      outcome, such resolution could have a material adverse effect on our
      consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or our
      liquidity.

Revenues.

Average
      monthly revenue per analog video customer, measured on an annual basis, has
      increased from $67 in 2004 to $74 in 2005 and $82 in 2006. Average monthly
      revenue per analog video customer represents total annual revenue, divided
      by
      twelve, divided by the average number of analog video customers during the
      respective period. Revenue growth in 2006 and 2005 primarily reflects increases
      in the number of customers, price increases, and incremental video revenues
      from
      OnDemand, DVR and high-definition television services.

Cable
      system sales, net of acquisitions, in 2004, 2005, and 2006 reduced the increase
      in revenues in 2006 as compared to 2005 by approximately $24 million, and in
      2005 as compared to 2004 by approximately $30 million.


Revenues
      by service offering were as follows (dollars in millions):

Video
      revenues consist primarily of revenues from analog and digital video services
      provided to our non-commercial customers. Analog video customers decreased
      by
      210,700 and 79,100 customers in 2006 and 2005, respectively, of which 137,200
      in
      2006 was related to system sales, net of acquisitions. Digital video customers
      increased by 127,800 and 124,600 customers in 2006 and 2005, respectively.
      The
      increase in 2006 was reduced by the sale, net of acquisitions, of 42,100 digital
      customers. The increases in video revenues are attributable to the following
      (dollars in millions):

                compared to 2005

Revenues
      from telephone services increased primarily as a result of an increase of
      324,300 telephone customers in 2006, of which 14,500 was related to
      acquisitions, and 76,100 telephone customers in 2005. Approximately $6 million
      of the increase in 2006 telephone revenue compared to 2005 is related to an
      acquisition.

Advertising
      sales revenues consist primarily of revenues from commercial advertising
      customers, programmers and other vendors. In 2006, advertising sales revenues
      increased primarily as a result of an increase in local and national advertising
      sales, including political advertising. In 2005, advertising sales revenues
      increased primarily as a result of an increase in local advertising sales,
      and
      were offset by a decline in national advertising sales. In addition, the
      increases were offset by a decrease of $1 million in 2006 and $1 million in
      as a result of system sales. For the


years
      ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, we received $17 million, $15 million,
      and $16 million, respectively, in advertising sales revenues from
      programmers.

Commercial
      revenues consist primarily of revenues from cable video and high-speed Internet
      services provided to our commercial customers. Commercial revenues increased
      primarily as a result of an increase in commercial high-speed Internet revenues.
      The increases were reduced by approximately $1 million in 2006 and $3 million
      in
      2005 as a result of system sales.

Other
      revenues consist of revenues from franchise fees, equipment rental, customer
      installations, home shopping, dial-up Internet service, late payment fees,
      wire
      maintenance fees and other miscellaneous revenues. For the years ended December
      31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, franchise fees represented approximately 52%, 54%,
      and
      52%, respectively, of total other revenues. The increase in other revenues
      was
      primarily the result of increases in franchise fees as a result of increases
      in
      revenues upon which the fees apply, and increases in installation revenues.
      The
      increases were reduced by approximately $2 million in 2006 and $2 million in
      2005 as a result of system sales.

Programming
        costs were approximately $1.5 billion, $1.4 billion, and $1.3 billion,
        representing 61%, 62%, and 63% of total operating expenses for the years
        ended
        December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Programming costs consist
        primarily of costs paid to programmers for analog, premium, digital and
        pay-per-view programming. The increases in programming costs are primarily
        a
        result of rate increases, particularly in sports programming, and in 2005
        were
        offset by a decrease in analog video customers. In addition, programming
        costs
        increased as a result of reductions in the amounts of amortization of payments
        received from programmers in support of launches of new channels. Amounts
        amortized against programming expenses were $32 million, $41 million, and
        $59
        million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. We expect programming expenses
        to
        continue to increase due to a variety of factors, including annual increases
        imposed by programmers, and additional programming, including high-definition
        and OnDemand programming, being provided to customers. Labor costs increased
        due
        to an increase in headcount to support improved service levels and telephone
        deployment.

Depreciation
      and amortization.

Depreciation
      and amortization expense decreased by $89 million in 2006 and increased by
      $10
      million in 2005. During 2006, the decrease in depreciation was primarily the
      result of systems sales and certain assets becoming fully depreciated. During
      2005, the increase in depreciation was related to an increase in capital
      expenditures, which was partially offset by lower depreciation as the result
      of
      systems sales and certain assets becoming fully depreciated.

Impairment
      of franchises.

The use
      of lower projected growth rates and the resulting revised estimates of future
      cash flows in our valuation, primarily as a result of increased competition,
      led
      to the recognition of a $2.4 billion impairment charge for the year ended
      December 31, 2004. Our annual assessments in 2006 and 2005 did not result in
      impairment.

Asset
      impairment charges.

Asset
      impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 represent
      the
      write-down of assets related to cable asset sales to fair value less costs
      to
      sell. See Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained

Interest
      expense, net.

Net
      interest expense increased by $98 million in 2006 and by $119 million in 2005.
      The increase in net interest expense was a result of an increase in our average
      borrowing rate from 8.7% in 2004 to 9.0% in 2005 to 9.5% in 2006, and an
      increase in average debt outstanding from $18.6 billion in 2004 to $19.3 billion
      in 2005 to $19.4 billion in 2006. The increase in 2006 was coupled with $10
      million of losses related to embedded derivatives in Charter’s 5.875%
      convertible senior notes. The increase in 2005 was partially offset by $29
      million of gains related to embedded derivatives in Charter’s 5.875% convertible
      senior notes. See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements
      contained in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Income
      tax benefit (expense).

Income
      tax expense in 2006 and 2005 was recognized through increases in deferred tax
      liabilities related to our investment in Charter Holdco, as well as through
      current federal and state income tax expense, and increases in the deferred
      tax
      liabilities of certain of our indirect corporate subsidiaries. Income tax
      expense was offset by deferred tax benefits of $30 million related to asset
      impairment charges recorded in the year ended December 31, 2006. Income tax
      benefit for the year ended December 31, 2004 was realized as a result of
      decreases in certain deferred tax liabilities related to our investment in
      Charter Holdco, as well as decreases in the deferred tax liabilities of certain
      of our indirect corporate subsidiaries, attributable to the write-down of
      franchise assets for financial statement purposes and not for tax purposes.
      We
      do not expect to recognize a similar benefit associated with the impairment
      of
      franchises in future periods. However, the actual tax provision calculations
      in
      future periods will be the result of current and future temporary differences,
      as well as future operating results.

Income
      (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax.

Income
      from discontinued operations, net of tax increased in 2006 compared to 2005
      due
      to a gain of $182 million (net of $18 million of tax recorded in the fourth
      quarter of 2006) recognized in 2006 on the sale of the West Virginia and
      Virginia systems.

Income
      from discontinued operations, net of tax increased in 2005 compared to a loss
      from discontinued operations, net of tax in 2004,

primarily
      due to the impairment of franchises recognized in 2004 described
      above.

Cumulative
      effect of accounting change, net of tax.

Cumulative
      effect of accounting change of $765 million (net of minority interest effects
      of
      $19 million and tax effects of $91 million) in 2004 represents the impairment
      charge recorded as a result of our adoption of Topic D-108.

Net
      loss.

The
      impact to net loss in 2006

and 2005
      of asset impairment charges, extinguishment of debt, and gain on discontinued
      operations, was to decrease net loss by approximately $124 million and
      $482 million, respectively. The impact to net loss in 2004 of the
      impairment of franchises and cumulative effect of accounting change was to
      increase net loss by approximately $3.0 billion.


Preferred
      stock dividends.

On
      August
      31, 2001, Charter issued 505,664 shares (and on February 28, 2003 issued an
      additional 39,595 shares) of Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred
      Stock in connection with the Cable USA acquisition, on which Charter pays or
      accrues a quarterly cumulative cash dividend at an annual rate of 5.75% if
      paid,
      or 7.75% if accrued, on a liquidation preference of $100 per share. Beginning
      January 1, 2005, Charter accrued the dividend on its Series A Convertible
      Redeemable Preferred Stock. In November 2005, we repurchased 508,546 shares
      of
      our Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock. Following the repurchase,
      36,713 shares or preferred stock remain outstanding.

Loss
      per common share.

During
      2006 and 2005, net loss per common share increased by $1.00 and decreased by
      $11.34, or 32% and 78%, respectively, as a result of the factors described
      above.

Liquidity
      and Capital Resources

Introduction

This
      section contains a discussion of our liquidity and capital resources, including
      a discussion of our cash position, sources and uses of cash, access to credit
      facilities and other financing sources, historical financing activities, cash
      needs, capital expenditures and outstanding debt.

Overview
      of Our Debt and Liquidity

Our
      business requires significant cash to fund debt service costs, capital
      expenditures and ongoing operations. We have historically funded these
      requirements through cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under
      our
      credit facilities, proceeds from sales of assets, issuances of debt and equity
      securities, and cash on hand. However, the mix of funding sources changes from
      period to period. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we generated $323
      million of net cash flows from operating activities after paying cash interest
      of $1.7 billion.

In
      addition, we received proceeds from the sale of assets of approximately $1.0
      billion and used $1.1 billion for purchases of property, plant and equipment.

Finally,
      we had net cash flows used in financing activities of $219 million. We expect
      that our mix of sources of funds will continue to change in the future based
      on
      overall needs relative to our cash flow and on the availability of funds under
      the credit facilities of our subsidiaries, our access to the debt and equity
      markets, the timing of possible asset sales, and our ability to generate cash
      flows from operating activities. We continue to explore asset dispositions
      as
      one of several possible actions that we could take in the future to improve
      our
      liquidity, but we do not presently consider future asset sales as a significant
      source of liquidity.

We
      expect
      that cash on hand, cash flows from operating activities and the amounts
      available under our credit facilities will be adequate to meet our cash needs
      in
      2007. We believe that cash flows from operating activities and amounts available
      under our credit facilities may not be sufficient to fund our operations and
      satisfy our interest and principal repayment obligations in 2008, and will
      not
      be sufficient to fund such needs in 2009 and beyond. We continue to work with
      our financial advisors concerning our approach to addressing liquidity, debt
      maturities and our overall balance sheet leverage.


We
      have a
      significant level of debt. As of December 31, 2006, the accreted value of
      our total debt was approximately $19.1 billion, as summarized below (dollars
      in
      millions):

(a)

The accreted value presented above generally represents
              the principal amount of the notes less the original issue discount
              at the
              time of sale, plus the accretion to the balance sheet date except as
              follows. Certain of the CIH notes, CCH I notes, and CCH II notes issued
              in
              exchange for Charter Holdings notes and Charter convertible notes in
              and 2006 are recorded for financial reporting purposes at values different
              from the current accreted value for legal purposes and notes indenture
              purposes (the amount that is currently payable if the debt becomes
              immediately due). As of December 31, 2006, the accreted value of our
              debt
              for legal purposes and notes and indentures purposes is $18.8 billion.

(b)

In
                general, the obligors have the right to redeem all of the notes set
                forth
                in the above table (except with respect to the 5.875% convertible
                senior
                notes due 2009, the 8.25% Charter Holdings notes due 2007, the 10.000%
                Charter Holdings notes due 2009, the 10.75% Charter Holdings notes
                due
                2009, and the 9.625% Charter Holdings notes due 2009) in whole or
                in part
                at their option, beginning at various times prior to their stated
                maturity
                dates, subject to certain conditions, upon the payment of the outstanding
                principal amount (plus a specified redemption premium) and all accrued
                and
                unpaid interest. The 5.875% convertible senior notes are


redeemable if the closing price of our Class A
                common
                stock exceeds the conversion price by certain percentages as described
                below. For additional information see Note 9 to the accompanying
                consolidated financial statements contained in “Item 8. Financial
                Statements and Supplementary Data.”

(c)

The
                  5.875% convertible senior notes are convertible at the option of
                  the
                  holders into shares of Class A common stock at a conversion rate,
                  subject to certain adjustments, of 413.2231 shares per $1,000 principal
                  amount of notes, which is equivalent to a price of $2.42 per share.
                  Certain anti-dilutive provisions cause adjustments to occur automatically
                  upon the occurrence of specified events. Additionally, the conversion
                  ratio may be adjusted by us under certain circumstances.

(d)

Not
                  included within total long-term debt is the $57 million CCHC note,
                  which
                  is included in “note payable-related party” on our accompanying
                  consolidated balance sheets. See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated
                  financial statements contained in “Item 8. Financial Statements and
                  Supplementary Data.”

In
      2007,
      $130 million of our debt matures, and in 2008, an additional $50 million
      matures. In 2009 and beyond, significant additional amounts will become due
      under our remaining long-term debt obligations. The following table summarizes
      our payment obligations as of December 31, 2006 under our long-term debt and
      certain other contractual obligations and commitments (dollars in millions).


The
      following items are not included in the contractual obligations table because
      the obligations are not fixed and/or determinable due to various factors
      discussed below. However, we incur these costs as part of our
      operations:

·

We
                rent utility poles used in our operations. Generally, pole rentals
                are
                cancelable on short notice, but we anticipate that such rentals will
                recur. Rent expense incurred for pole rental attachments for the
                years
                ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, was $44 million, $44
                million, and $42 million, respectively.

·

We
                pay franchise fees under multi-year franchise agreements based on
                a
                percentage of revenues generated from video service per year. We
                also pay
                other franchise related costs, such as public education grants, under
                multi-year agreements. Franchise fees and other franchise-related
                costs
                included in the accompanying statement of operations were $175 million,
                $165 million, and $159 million for the years ended December 31, 2006,
                2005, and 2004, respectively.

·

We
                also have $147 million in letters of credit, primarily to our various
                worker’s compensation, property and casualty, and general liability
                carriers, as collateral for reimbursement of claims. These letters
                of
                credit reduce the amount we may borrow under our credit facilities.

Credit
      Facility Availability

Our
      ability to operate depends upon, among other things, our continued access to
      capital, including credit under the Charter Operating credit facilities. The
      Charter Operating credit facilities, along with our indentures, contain certain
      restrictive covenants, some of which require us to maintain specified financial
      ratios, and meet financial tests, and to provide audited financial statements
      with an unqualified opinion from our independent auditors. As of December 31,
      2006, we are in compliance with the covenants under our credit facilities,
      as
      well as under our indentures, and we expect to remain in compliance with those
      covenants for the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2006, our potential
      availability under our credit facilities totaled approximately $1.3 billion,
      although the actual availability at that time was only $1.1 billion because
      of
      limits imposed by covenant restrictions. Continued access to our credit
      facilities is subject to our remaining in compliance with these covenants,
      including covenants tied to our operating performance. If any events of
      non-compliance occur, funding under the credit facilities may not be available
      and defaults on some or potentially all of our debt obligations could occur.
      An
      event of default under any of our debt instruments could result in the
      acceleration of our payment obligations under that debt and, under certain
      circumstances, in cross-defaults under our other debt obligations, which could
      have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and
      results of operations.

Limitations
      on Distributions

Charter’s
      ability to make interest payments on its convertible senior notes, and, in
      2009,
      to repay the outstanding principal of its convertible senior notes of $413
      million, will depend on its ability to raise additional capital and/or on
      receipt of payments or distributions from Charter Holdco and its subsidiaries.
      As of December 31, 2006, Charter Holdco was owed $3 million in intercompany
      loans from its subsidiaries and had $8 million in cash, which were available
      to
      pay interest and principal on Charter’s convertible senior notes. In addition,
      Charter has $50 million of U.S. government securities pledged as security for
      the semi-annual interest payments on Charter’s convertible senior notes
      scheduled in 2007. CCHC also holds $450 million of Charter’s convertible senior
      notes.  As a result, if CCHC continues to hold those notes, CCHC will
      receive interest payments on the convertible senior notes from the pledged
      government securities.  The cumulative amount of interest payments expected
      to be received by CCHC may be available to be distributed to pay interest on
      the
      outstanding $413 million of the convertible senior notes due in 2008 and May
      2009, although CCHC may use those amounts for other purposes.

Distributions
      by Charter’s subsidiaries to a parent company (including Charter, Charter Holdco
      and CCHC)

for
      payment of principal on parent company notes,

are
      restricted under the indentures governing the CIH notes, CCH I notes, CCH II
      notes, CCO Holdings notes and Charter Operating notes

unless
      there is no default under the applicable indenture and each applicable
      subsidiary’s leverage ratio test is met at the time of such distribution, and,
      in the case of such distributions by Charter Operating for payment of principal
      on a portion of the outstanding CCO Holdings notes, other specified tests are
      met.

For
      the
      quarter ended December 31, 2006, there was no default under any of these
      indentures, and each such subsidiary met its applicable leverage ratio tests
      based on December 31, 2006 financial results.

Such
      distributions would be restricted, however, if any such subsidiary fails to
      meet
      these tests at the time of the contemplated distribution. In the past, certain
      subsidiaries have from time to time failed to meet their leverage ratio test.
      There can be no assurance that they will satisfy these tests at the time of
      the
      contemplated distribution.

Distributions
      by Charter Operating for payment of principal on parent company notes are
      further restricted by the covenants in the credit facilities.

Distributions
      by CIH, CCH I, CCH II, CCO Holdings and Charter


Operating
      to a parent company for payment of parent company interest are permitted if
      there is no default under the aforementioned indentures, and in the case of
      such
      distributions by Charter Operating for payment of interest on a portion of
      the
      outstanding CCO Holdings notes, Charter Operating’s leverage ratio and other
      specified tests are met.

The
      indentures governing the Charter Holdings notes permit Charter Holdings to
      make
      distributions to Charter Holdco for payment of interest or principal on the
      convertible senior notes, only if, after giving effect to the distribution,
      Charter Holdings can incur additional debt under the leverage ratio of 8.75
      to
      1.0, there is no default under Charter Holdings’ indentures and other specified
      tests are met. For the quarter ended

December
      31, 2006, there was no default under Charter Holdings’ indentures, and the other
      specified tests were met

.
      Such
      distributions would be restricted, however, if Charter Holdings fails to meet
      these tests at the time of the contemplated distribution. In the past, Charter
      Holdings has from time to time failed to meet this leverage ratio test. There
      can be no assurance that Charter Holdings will satisfy these tests at the time
      of the contemplated distribution.

During

periods
      in which distributions are restricted,

the
      indentures governing the Charter Holdings notes permit Charter Holdings and
      its
      subsidiaries to make specified investments (that are not restricted payments)
      in
      Charter Holdco or Charter, up to an amount determined by a formula, as long
      as
      there is no default under the indentures.

In
      addition to the limitation on distributions under the various indentures
      discussed above, distributions by our subsidiaries may be limited by applicable
      law. See “Risk Factors

—
Because
      of our holding company structure, our outstanding notes are structurally
      subordinated in right of payment to all liabilities of our subsidiaries.
      Restrictions in our subsidiaries’ debt instruments and under applicable law
      limit their ability to provide funds to us or our various debt
      issuers.”

Access
      to Capital

Our
      significant amount of debt could negatively affect our ability to access
      additional capital or the pricing or terms under which such capital might be
      available in the future. Additionally, our ability to incur additional debt
      may
      be limited by the restrictive covenants in our indentures and credit facilities.
      No assurances can be given that we will not experience liquidity problems if
      we
      do not obtain sufficient additional financing on a timely basis as our debt
      becomes due, because of adverse market conditions, increased competition, or
      other unfavorable events. If, at any time, additional capital or borrowing
      capacity is required beyond amounts internally generated or available under
      our
      credit facilities, or through additional debt or equity financings, we would
      consider:

If
      the
      above strategies are not successful, we could be forced to restructure our
      obligations or seek bankruptcy protection. In addition, if we need to raise
      additional capital through the issuance of equity or find it necessary to engage
      in a recapitalization or other similar transaction, our shareholders could
      suffer significant dilution and our noteholders might not receive the full
      principal and interest payments to which they are contractually entitled.

Recent
      Financing Transactions

We
      have
      completed many capital transactions since the formation of Charter. In 2006,
      we
      completed the following capital transactions, all of which impacted our
      liquidity.

In
      January 2006, CCH II and CCH II Capital Corp. issued $450 million in debt
      securities, the proceeds of which were provided to Charter Operating, which
      used
      such funds to reduce borrowings, but not commitments, under the revolving
      portion of its credit facilities.

In
      April
      2006, Charter Operating completed a $6.85 billion refinancing of its credit
      facilities including a new $350 million revolving/term facility (which converts
      to a term loan no later than April 2007), a $5.0 billion term loan due in 2013,
      and certain amendments to the existing $1.5 billion revolving credit facility.
      In addition, the refinancing reduced margins on Eurodollar rate term loans
      to
      2.625% from a weighted average of 3.15% previously, and


margins
      on base rate term loans to 1.625% from a weighted average of 2.15% previously.
      Concurrent with this refinancing, the CCO Holdings bridge loan was
      terminated.

In
      September 2006, Charter Holdings and its wholly owned subsidiaries, CCH I and
      CCH II, completed the exchange of approximately $797 million in total principal
      amount of outstanding debt securities of Charter Holdings. Holders of Charter
      Holdings notes due in 2009-2010 tendered $308 million principal amount of notes
      for $250 million principal amount of new 10.25% CCH II notes due 2013 and $37
      million principal amount of 11% CCH I notes due 2015. Holders of Charter
      Holdings notes due 2011-2012 tendered $490 million principal amount of notes
      for
      $425 million principal amount of 11% CCH I notes due 2015. The Charter Holdings
      notes received in the exchanges were thereafter distributed to Charter Holdings
      and retired. Also in September 2006, CCHC and CCH II completed the exchange
      of
      $450 million principal amount of Charter’s outstanding 5.875% senior convertible
      notes due 2009 for $188 million in cash, 45 million shares of Charter’s Class A
      common stock and $146 million principal amount of 10.25% CCH II notes due 2010.
      The convertible notes received in the exchange are held by CCHC.

Sale
      of Assets

In
      2006,
      we closed asset sales for total net proceeds of approximately $1.0 billion.
      We
      used the net proceeds from the asset sales to reduce borrowings, but not
      commitments, under the revolving portion of our credit facilities. Also in
      2006,
      we recorded asset impairment charges of $159 million related to cable systems
      meeting the criteria of assets held for sale.

Acquisition

In
      January 2006, we closed the purchase of certain cable systems in Minnesota
      from
      Seren Innovations, Inc. We acquired approximately 17,500 analog video customers,
      8,000 digital video customers, 13,200 high-speed Internet customers, and 14,500
      telephone customers, for a total purchase price of approximately $42
      million.

Historical
      Operating, Financing and Investing Activities

Cash
      and Cash Equivalents.

We
      held
      $60 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2006 compared to
      $21
      million as of December 31, 2005.

Operating
      Activities.

Net cash
      provided by operating activities increased $63 million, or 24% from $260 million
      for the year ended December 31, 2005 to $323 million for the year ended December
      31, 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2006, net cash provided by operating
      activities increased primarily as a result of changes in operating assets and
      liabilities that provided $240 million more cash during the year ended December
      31, 2006 than the corresponding period in 2005, offset by an increase in cash
      interest expense of $214 million over the corresponding prior
      period.

Net
      cash
      provided by operating activities decreased $212 million, or 45%, from $472
      million for the year ended December 31, 2004 to $260 million for the year ended
      December 31, 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2005, net cash provided
      by
      operating activities decreased primarily as a result of an increase in cash
      interest expense of $189 million over the corresponding prior period, and
      changes in operating assets and liabilities that used $45 million more cash
      during the year ended December 31, 2005 than the corresponding period in 2004.
      The change in operating assets and liabilities is primarily the result of the
      finalization of the class action settlement in the third quarter of
      2005.

Investing
      Activities.

Net
      cash
      used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005
      was
      $65 million and $1.0 billion, respectively. Investing activities used $960
      million less cash during the year ended December 31, 2006 than the corresponding
      period in 2005 primarily due to $1.0 billion of proceeds received in 2006 from
      the sale of assets, including cable systems.

Net
      cash
      used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
      was
      $1.0 billion and $243 million, respectively. Investing activities used $782
      million more cash during the year ended December 31, 2005 than during the
      corresponding period in 2004, primarily as a result of cash provided by proceeds
      from the sale of certain cable systems to Atlantic Broadband Finance, LLC in
      2004, which did not recur in 2005, combined with increased cash used for capital
      expenditures.


Financing
      Activities.

Net
      cash
      used by financing activities was $219 million and net cash provided by financing
      activities was $136 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005,
      respectively. The decrease in cash provided during the year ended December
      31,
      2006 compared to the corresponding period in 2005, was primarily the result
      of
      an increase in repayments of long-term debt.

Net
      cash
      provided by financing activities was $136 million and $294 million for the
      years
      ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in cash provided
      during the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to the corresponding period
      in 2004, was primarily the result of a decrease in borrowings of long-term
      debt
      and proceeds from issuance of debt offset by a decrease in repayments of
      long-term debt.

Capital
      Expenditures

We
      have
      significant ongoing capital expenditure requirements. Capital expenditures
      were
      $1.1 billion, $1.1 billion, and $924 million for the years ended December 31,
      2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The majority of the capital expenditures
      in
      2006, 2005, and 2004 related to our scalable infrastructure and customer premise
      equipment. See the table below for more details.

Our
      capital expenditures are funded primarily from cash flows from operating
      activities, the issuance of debt and borrowings under credit facilities. In
      addition, during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, our
      liabilities related to capital expenditures increased by $24 million, and $8
      million, and decreased $43 million, respectively.

During
      2007, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $1.2 billion.

We
      expect
      that the nature of these expenditures will continue to be composed primarily
      of
      purchases of customer premise equipment related to telephone and other advanced
      services, support capital, and scalable infrastructure. We expect to fund
      capital expenditures for 2007 primarily from cash flows from operating
      activities and borrowings under our credit facilities.

We
      have
      adopted capital expenditure disclosure guidance, which was developed by eleven
      then publicly traded cable system operators, including Charter, with the support
      of the National Cable & Telecommunications Association (“NCTA”). The
      disclosure is intended to provide more consistency in reporting capital
      expenditures and customers among peer companies in the cable industry. These
      disclosures are not required disclosures under GAAP, nor do they impact our
      accounting for capital expenditures under GAAP.

The
      following table presents our major capital expenditures categories in accordance
      with NCTA disclosure guidelines for the years ended December 31, 2006,
      2005, and 2004 (dollars in millions):

                and

Description
      of Our Outstanding Debt

Overview

As
      of
      December 31, 2006 and 2005, our long-term debt totaled approximately $19.1
      billion and $19.4 billion, respectively. This debt was comprised of
      approximately $5.4 billion and $5.7 billion of credit facility debt, $13.3
      billion and $12.8 billion accreted amount of high-yield notes and $408 million
      and $863 million accreted amount of convertible senior notes at December 31,
      2006 and 2005, respectively. See the organizational chart on page 4 and the
      first table under “ — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Overview of Our Debt and
      Liquidity” for debt outstanding by issuer.

As
      of
      December 31, 2006 and 2005, the blended weighted average interest rate on our
      debt was 9.5% and 9.3%, respectively. The interest rate on approximately 78%
      and
      77% of the total principal amount of our debt was effectively fixed, including
      the effects of our interest rate hedge agreements, as of December 31, 2006
      and
      2005, respectively. The fair value of our high-yield notes was $13.3 billion
      and
      $10.4 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The fair value of
      our
      convertible senior notes was $576 million and $647 million at December 31,
      and 2005, respectively. The fair value of our credit facilities was $5.4 billion
      and $5.7 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The fair value
      of
      high-yield and convertible notes was based on quoted market prices, and the
      fair
      value of the credit facilities was based on dealer quotations.

The
      following description is a summary of certain provisions of our credit
      facilities and our notes (the “Debt Agreements”).  The summary does not
      restate the terms of the Debt Agreements in their entirety, nor does it describe
      all terms of the Debt Agreements.  The agreements and instruments governing
      each of the Debt Agreements are complicated and you should consult such
      agreements and instruments for more detailed information regarding the Debt
      Agreements.

Charter
      Operating Credit Facilities - General

The
      Charter Operating credit facilities were amended and restated in April 2006,
      among other things, to defer maturities and to increase availability under
      these
      facilities. The Charter Operating credit facilities provide borrowing
      availability of up to $6.85 billion as follows:

Amounts
      outstanding under the Charter Operating credit facilities bear interest, at
      Charter Operating’s election, at a base rate or the Eurodollar rate, as defined,
      plus a margin for Eurodollar loans of up to 3.00% for the revolving credit
      facility and R/T Facility (until converted to term loans), up to 2.625% for
      the
      term facility and R/T Facility loans after converting to term loans, and for
      base rate loans of up to 2.00% for the revolving credit facility and R/T
      Facility (until converted to term loans), and up to 1.625% for the term facility
      and R/T Facility loans after converting to term loans. A quarterly commitment
      fee of up to .75% is payable on the average daily unborrowed balance of the
      revolving credit facility and, until converted into term loans, the R/T
      Facility.

The
      obligations of Charter Operating under the Charter Operating credit facilities
      (the “Obligations”) are guaranteed by Charter Operating’s immediate parent
      company, CCO Holdings, and the subsidiaries of Charter Operating, except for
      certain subsidiaries, including immaterial subsidiaries and subsidiaries
      precluded from guaranteeing by reason of the provisions of other indebtedness
      to
      which they are subject (the “non-guarantor subsidiaries”). The Obligations are
      also secured by (i) a lien on substantially all of the assets of Charter
      Operating and its subsidiaries (other than assets of the non-guarantor
      subsidiaries), and (ii) a pledge by CCO Holdings of the equity interests
      owned by it in Charter Operating, as well as intercompany obligations owing
      to
      it by Charter Operating.


Charter
      Operating Credit Facilities — Restrictive Covenants

The
      Charter Operating credit facilities contain representations and warranties,
      and
      affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type. The
      financial covenants measure performance against standards set for leverage
      and
      interest coverage to be tested as of the end of each quarter. The maximum
      allowable leverage ratio is 4.25 to 1.0 until maturity. Additionally, the
      Charter Operating credit facilities contain provisions requiring mandatory
      loan
      prepayments under specific circumstances, including in connection with certain
      sales of assets, so long as the proceeds have not been reinvested in the
      business.

The
      Charter Operating credit facilities permit Charter Operating and its
      subsidiaries to make distributions to pay interest on the Charter convertible
      notes, the CCHC notes, the Charter Holdings notes, the CIH notes, the CCH I
      notes, the CCH II notes, the CCO Holdings notes, and the Charter Operating
      second-lien notes, provided that, among other things, no default has occurred
      and is continuing under the Charter Operating credit facilities. Conditions
      to
      future borrowings include absence of a default or an event of default under
      the
      Charter Operating credit facilities, and the continued accuracy in all material
      respects of the representations and warranties, including the absence since
      December 31, 2005 of any event, development, or circumstance that has had
      or could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our
      business.

The
      events of default under the Charter Operating credit facilities include, among
      other things:

·

the
                failure to make payments when due or within the applicable grace
                period,

·

the
                failure to comply with specified covenants, including but not limited
                to a
                covenant to deliver audited financial statements with an unqualified
                opinion from our independent
                auditors,

·

the
                failure to pay or the occurrence of events that cause or permit the
                acceleration of other indebtedness owing by CCO Holdings, Charter
                Operating, or Charter Operating’s subsidiaries in amounts in excess of $50
                million in aggregate principal amount,

·

the
                failure to pay or the occurrence of events that result in the acceleration
                of other indebtedness owing by certain of CCO Holdings’ direct and

Outstanding
      Notes

Charter
      Communications, Inc. 5.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2009

In
      November 2004, Charter issued 5.875% convertible senior notes due 2009 with
      a
      total original principal amount of $862.5 million. The 5.875% convertible senior
      notes are unsecured (except with respect to the collateral as described below)
      and rank equally with our existing and future unsubordinated and unsecured
      indebtedness (except with respect to the collateral described below), but are
      structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other
      liabilities of our subsidiaries. Interest is payable semi-annually in
      arrears.

The
      5.875% convertible senior notes are convertible at any time at the option of
      the
      holder into shares of Class A common stock at an initial conversion rate of
      413.2231 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to
      a
      conversion price of approximately $2.42 per share, subject to certain
      adjustments. Specifically, the adjustments include anti-dilutive provisions,
      which cause adjustments to occur automatically based on the occurrence of
      specified events to provide protection rights to holders of the notes. The
      conversion rate may also be increased (but not to exceed 462 shares per $1,000
      principal amount of notes) upon a specified change of control transaction.
      Additionally, Charter may elect to increase the conversion rate under certain
      circumstances when


deemed
      appropriate, subject to applicable limitations of the NASDAQ stock market.
      Holders who convert their notes prior to November 16, 2007 will receive an
      early
      conversion make whole amount in respect of their notes, based on a proportional
      share of the portfolio of pledged securities described below, with specified
      adjustments.

No
      holder
      of notes will be entitled to receive shares of our Class A common stock on
      conversion to the extent that receipt of the shares would cause the converting
      holder to become, directly or indirectly, a "beneficial holder'' (within the
      meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
      promulgated thereunder) of more than 4.9% of the outstanding shares of our
      Class
      A common stock if such conversion would take place prior to November 16, 2008,
      or more than 9.9% thereafter.

If
      a
      holder tenders a note for conversion, we may direct that holder (unless we
      have
      called those notes for redemption) to a financial institution designated by
      us
      to conduct a transaction with that institution, on substantially the same terms
      that the holder would have received on conversion. But if any such financial
      institution does not accept such notes or does not deliver the required
      conversion consideration, we remain obligated to convert the notes.

Charter
      Holdco used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the notes to purchase
      a
      portfolio of U.S. government securities in an amount which we believe will
      be
      sufficient to make the first six interest payments on the notes. These
      government securities were pledged to us as security for a mirror note issued
      by
      Charter Holdco to Charter and pledged to the trustee under the indenture
      governing the notes as security for our obligations thereunder. We expect to
      use
      such securities to fund the first six interest payments under the notes, four
      of
      which were funded in 2005 and 2006. The fair value of the pledged securities
      was
      $49 million at December 31, 2006.

Upon
      a
      change of control and certain other fundamental changes, subject to certain
      conditions and restrictions, Charter may be required to repurchase the notes,
      in
      whole or in part, at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued interest at
      the
      repurchase date.

We
      may
      redeem the notes in whole or in part for cash at any time at a redemption price
      equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid
      interest, deferred interest, and liquidated damages, if any, but only if for
      any
      20 trading days in any 30 consecutive trading day period the closing price
      has
      exceeded 180% of the conversion price, or $4.356 per share, if such 30 trading
      day period begins prior to November 16, 2007, or 150% of the conversion price,
      or $3.63 per share, if such 30 trading period begins thereafter. Holders who
      convert notes that we have called for redemption shall receive, in addition
      to
      the early conversion make whole amount, if applicable, the present value of
      the
      interest on the notes converted that would have been payable for the period
      from
      the later of November 17, 2007, and the redemption date, through the scheduled
      maturity date for the notes, plus any accrued deferred interest.

CCHC,
      LLC Note

In
      October 2005, Charter, acting through a Special Committee of Charter’s Board of
      Directors, and Mr. Allen, settled a dispute that had arisen between the parties
      with regard to the ownership of CC VIII. As part of that settlement, CCHC issued
      the CCHC note to CII. The CCHC note has a 15-year maturity. The CCHC note has
      an
      initial accreted value of $48 million accreting at the rate of 14% per annum
      compounded quarterly, except that from and after February 28, 2009, CCHC may
      pay
      any increase in the accreted value of the CCHC note in cash and the accreted
      value of the CCHC note will not increase to the extent such amount is paid
      in
      cash. The CCHC note is exchangeable at CII’s option, at any time, for Charter
      Holdco Class A Common units at a rate equal to the then accreted value, divided
      by $2.00 (the “Exchange Rate”). Customary anti-dilution protections have been
      provided that could cause future changes to the Exchange Rate. Additionally,
      the
      Charter Holdco Class A Common units received will be exchangeable by the holder
      into Charter Class B common stock in accordance with existing agreements between
      CII, Charter and certain other parties signatory thereto. Beginning February
      28,
      2009, if the closing price of Charter common stock is at or above the Exchange
      Rate for a certain period of time as specified in the Exchange Agreement,
      Charter Holdco may require the exchange of the CCHC note for Charter Holdco
      Class A Common units at the Exchange Rate. Additionally, CCHC has the right
      to
      redeem the CCHC note under certain circumstances for cash in an amount equal
      to
      the then accreted value, such amount, if redeemed prior to February 28, 2009,
      would also include a make whole up to the accreted value through February 28,
      2009. CCHC must redeem the CCHC note at its maturity for cash in an amount
      equal
      to the initial stated value plus the accreted return through maturity. The
      accreted value of the CCHC note is $57 million as of December 31, 2006 and
      is
      recorded in Notes Payable - Related Party in the accompanying consolidated
      financial statements contained in “Item 8. Financial Statements and
      Supplementary Data.”

      indebtedness under the Charter Operating credit facilities and related

      guarantee of each such guarantor is:

·

a
                senior obligation of such
                guarantor;

·

structurally
                senior to the outstanding CCO Holdings notes (except in the case
                of CCO
                Holdings’ note guarantee, which is structurally

pari
                passu

with
                such senior notes), the outstanding CCH II notes, the outstanding
                CCH I
                notes, the outstanding CIH notes, the outstanding Charter Holdings
                notes
                and the outstanding Charter convertible senior
                notes;

·

senior
                in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness of such
                guarantor; and

·

effectively
                senior to the relevant subsidiary’s unsecured indebtedness, to the extent
                of the value of the collateral but subject to the prior lien of the
                credit
                facilities.

The
      Charter Operating notes and related note guarantees are secured by a
      second-priority lien on all of Charter Operating’s and its subsidiaries’ assets
      that secure the obligations of Charter Operating or any subsidiary of Charter
      Operating with respect to the Charter Operating credit facilities and the
      related obligations. The collateral currently consists of the capital stock
      of
      Charter Operating held by CCO Holdings, all of the intercompany obligations
      owing to CCO Holdings by Charter Operating or any subsidiary of Charter
      Operating, and substantially all of Charter Operating’s and the guarantors’
assets (other than the assets of CCO Holdings) in which security interests
      may
      be perfected under the Uniform Commercial Code by filing a financing statement
      (including capital stock and intercompany obligations), including, but not
      limited to:

·

with
                certain exceptions, all capital stock (limited in the case of capital
                stock of foreign subsidiaries, if any, to 66% of the capital stock
                of
                first tier foreign Subsidiaries) held by Charter Operating or any
                guarantor; and

·

with
                certain exceptions, all intercompany obligations owing to Charter
                Operating or any guarantor.

In
      the
      event that additional liens are granted by Charter Operating or its subsidiaries
      to secure obligations under the Charter Operating credit facilities or the
      related obligations, second priority liens on the same assets will be granted
      to
      secure the Charter Operating notes, which liens will be subject to the
      provisions of an intercreditor agreement (to which none of Charter Operating
      or
      its affiliates are parties). Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, no such
      second priority liens need be provided if the time such lien would otherwise
      be
      granted is not during a guarantee and pledge availability period (when the
      Leverage Condition is satisfied), but such second priority liens will be
      required to be provided in accordance with the foregoing sentence on or prior
      to
      the fifth business day of the commencement of the next succeeding guarantee
      and
      pledge availability period.

The
      Charter Operating notes are senior debt obligations of Charter Operating and
      Charter Communications Operating Capital Corp. To the extent of the value of
      the
      collateral (but subject to the prior lien of the credit facilities), they rank
      effectively senior to all of Charter Operating’s future unsecured senior
      indebtedness.

Summary
      of Restrictive Covenants of Our High Yield Notes

The
      following description is a summary of certain restrictions of our Debt
      Agreements.  The summary does not restate the terms of the Debt Agreements
      in their entirety, nor does it describe all restrictions of the Debt Agreements.
       The agreements and instruments governing each of the Debt Agreements are
      complicated and you should consult such agreements and instruments for more
      detailed information regarding the Debt Agreements.

The
      notes
      issued by Charter Holdings, CIH, CCH I, CCH II, CCO Holdings and Charter
      Operating (together, the “note issuers”) were issued pursuant to indentures that
      contain covenants that restrict the ability of the note issuers and their
      subsidiaries to, among other things:

·

incur
                indebtedness;

·

pay
                dividends or make distributions in respect of capital stock and other
                restricted payments;

·

issue
                equity;

·

make
                investments;

·

create
                liens;

·

sell
                assets;

·

consolidate,
                merge, or sell all or substantially all
                assets;

·

enter
                into sale leaseback transactions;

·

create
                restrictions on the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make certain
                payments; or

·

enter
                into transactions with affiliates.

However,
      such covenants are subject to a number of important qualifications and
      exceptions. Below we set forth a brief summary of certain of the restrictive
      covenants.

Restrictions
      on Additional Debt

The
      limitations on incurrence of debt and issuance of preferred stock contained
      in
      various indentures permit each of the respective notes issuers and its
      restricted subsidiaries to incur additional debt or issue preferred stock,
      so
      long as,

after
      giving pro forma effect to the incurrence, the leverage ratio would be below
      a
      specified level for each of the note issuers as follows:

Issuer

Leverage
                  Ratio

Charter
                  Holdings

8.75
                  to 1

CIH

8.75
                  to 1

CCH
                  I

7.5
                  to 1

CCH
                  II

5.5
                  to 1

CCOH

4.5
                  to 1

CCO

4.25
                  to 1

In
      addition, regardless of whether the leverage ratio could be met, so long as
      no
      default exists or would result from the incurrence or issuance, each issuer
      and
      their restricted subsidiaries are permitted to issue among other permitted
      indebtedness:

·

up
                to an amount of debt under credit facilities not otherwise allocated
                as
                indicated below:

·

Charter
                Holdings: $3.5 billion

·

CIH,
                CCH I, CCH II and CCO Holdings: $9.75
                billion

·

Charter
                Operating: $6.8 billion

·

up
                to $75 million of debt incurred to finance the purchase or capital
                lease
                of new assets;

·

up
                to $300 million of additional debt for any
                purpose;

·

Charter
                Holdings and CIH may incur additional debt in an amount equal to
                200% of
                proceeds of new cash equity proceeds received since March 1999, the
                date
                of our first indenture, and not allocated for restricted payments
                or
                permitted investments (the “Equity Proceeds Basket”); and


·

other
                items of indebtedness for specific purposes such as intercompany
                debt,
                refinancing of existing debt, and interest rate swaps to provide
                protection against fluctuation in interest
                rates.

Indebtedness
      under a single facility or agreement may be incurred in part under one of the
      categories listed above and in part under another, and generally may also later
      be reclassified into another category including as debt incurred under the
      leverage ratio. Accordingly, indebtedness under our credit facilities is
      incurred under a combination of the categories of permitted indebtedness listed
      above

.
      The
      restricted subsidiaries of note issuers are generally not permitted to issue
      subordinated debt securities.

Restrictions
      on Distributions

Generally,
      under the various indentures each of the note issuers and their respective
      restricted subsidiaries are permitted to pay dividends on or repurchase equity
      interests, or make other specified restricted payments, only if the applicable
      issuer can incur $1.00 of new debt under the applicable leverage ratio test
      after giving effect to the transaction and if no default exists or would exist
      as a consequence of such incurrence. If those conditions are met, restricted
      payments may be made in a total amount of up to the following amounts for the
      applicable issuer as indicated below:

·

                Holdings: the sum of 100% of Charter Holdings’ Consolidated EBITDA, as

                Operating: the sum of

100%
                of Charter Operating’s Consolidated EBITDA, as defined, minus 1.3 times
                its Consolidated Interest Expense, as defined, plus 100% of new cash
                and
                appraised non-cash equity proceeds received by Charter Operating
                and not
                allocated to certain investments, cumulatively from April 1, 2004,
                plus
                $100 million.

In
      addition, each of the note issuers may make distributions or restricted
      payments, so long as no default exists or would be caused by transactions among
      other distributions or restricted payments:

·

to
                repurchase management equity interests in amounts not to exceed $10
                million per fiscal year;

·

regardless
                of the existence of any default, to pay pass-through tax liabilities
                in
                respect of ownership of equity interests in the applicable issuer
                or its
                restricted subsidiaries; or

·

to
                make other specified restricted payments including merger fees up
                to 1.25%
                of the transaction value, repurchases using concurrent new issuances,
                and
                certain dividends on existing subsidiary preferred equity
                interests.

Each
      of
      CCH I, CCH II, CCO Holdings, and Charter Operating and their respective

restricted
      subsidiaries may make distributions or restricted payments: (i) so long as
      certain defaults do not exist and even if the applicable leverage test referred
      to above is not met, to enable certain of its parents to pay interest on certain
      of their indebtedness or (ii) so long as the applicable issuer could incur
      $1.00
      of indebtedness under the applicable leverage ratio test referred to above,
      to
      enable certain of its parents to purchase, redeem or refinance certain
      indebtedness.


Restrictions
      on Investments

Each
      of
      the note issuers and their respective restricted subsidiaries may not make
      investments except (i) permitted investments or (ii) if, after giving effect
      to
      the transaction, their leverage would be above the applicable leverage
      ratio.

                payments
                covenant (as if CIH had been in existence at all times during such

                been
                allocated to the restricted payments
                covenant.

Restrictions
      on Liens

Charter
      Operating and its restricted subsidiaries are not permitted to grant liens
      senior to the liens securing the Charter Operating notes, other than permitted
      liens, on their assets to secure indebtedness or other obligations, if, after
      giving effect to such incurrence, the senior secured leverage ratio (generally,
      the ratio of obligations secured by first priority liens to four times EBITDA,
      as defined, for the most recent fiscal quarter for which internal financial
      reports are available) would exceed 3.75 to 1.0. The restrictions on liens
      for
      each of the other note issuers only applies to liens on assets of the issuers
      themselves and does not restrict liens on assets of subsidiaries. With respect
      to all of the note issuers, permitted liens include liens securing indebtedness
      and other obligations under credit facilities (subject to specified limitations
      in the case of Charter Operating), liens securing the purchase price of financed
      new assets, liens securing indebtedness of up to $50 million and other specified
      liens.

Restrictions
      on the Sale of Assets; Mergers

The
      note
      issuers are generally not permitted to sell all or substantially all of their
      assets or merge with or into other companies unless their leverage ratio after
      any such transaction would be no greater than their leverage ratio immediately
      prior to the transaction, or unless after giving effect to the transaction,
      leverage would be below the applicable leverage ratio for the applicable issuer,
      no default exists, and the surviving entity is a U.S. entity that assumes the
      applicable notes.


The
      note
      issuers and their restricted subsidiaries may generally not otherwise sell
      assets or, in the case of restricted subsidiaries, issue equity interests,
      in
      excess of $100 million unless they receive consideration at least equal to
      the
      fair market value of the assets or equity interests, consisting of at least
      75%
      in cash, assumption of liabilities, securities converted into cash within 60
      days or productive assets. The note issuers and their restricted subsidiaries
      are then required within 365 days after any asset sale either to use or commit
      to use the net cash proceeds over a specified threshold to acquire assets used
      or useful in their businesses or use the net cash proceeds to repay specified
      debt, or to offer to repurchase the issuer’s notes with any remaining
      proceeds.

Restrictions
      on Sale and Leaseback Transactions

The
      note
      issuers and their restricted subsidiaries may generally not engage in sale
      and
      leaseback transactions unless, at the time of the transaction, the applicable
      issuer could have incurred secured indebtedness under its leverage ratio test
      in
      an amount equal to the present value of the net rental payments to be made
      under
      the lease, and the sale of the assets and application of proceeds is permitted
      by the covenant restricting asset sales.

Prohibitions
      on Restricting Dividends

The
      note
      issuers’ restricted subsidiaries may generally not enter into arrangements
      involving restrictions on their ability to make dividends or distributions
      or
      transfer assets to the applicable note issuer unless those restrictions with
      respect to financing arrangements are on terms that are no more restrictive
      than
      those governing the credit facilities existing when they entered into the
      applicable indentures or are not materially more restrictive than customary
      terms in comparable financings and will not materially impair the applicable
      note issuers’ ability to make payments on the notes.

Affiliate
      Transactions

The
      indentures also restrict the ability of the note issuers and their restricted
      subsidiaries to enter into certain transactions with affiliates involving
      consideration in excess of $15 million without a determination by the board
      of
      directors of the applicable note issuer

that
      the
      transaction complies with this covenant, or transactions with affiliates
      involving over $50 million without receiving an opinion as to the fairness
      to
      the holders of such transaction from a financial point of view issued by an
      accounting, appraisal or investment banking firm of national
      standing.

Cross
      Acceleration

Our
      indentures and those of certain of our subsidiaries include various events
      of
      default, including cross acceleration provisions. Under these provisions, a
      failure by any of the issuers or any of their restricted subsidiaries to pay
      at
      the final maturity thereof the principal amount of other indebtedness having
      a
      principal amount of $100 million or more (or any other default under any such
      indebtedness resulting in its acceleration) would result in an event of default
      under the indenture governing the applicable notes. As a result, an event of
      default related to the failure to repay principal at maturity or the
      acceleration of the indebtedness under the Charter Holdings notes, CIH notes,
      CCH I notes, CCH II notes, CCO Holdings notes, Charter Operating notes or the
      Charter Operating credit facilities could cause cross-defaults under our
      subsidiaries’ indentures.

Recently
      Issued Accounting Standards

In
      September 2006, the SEC issued SAB 108,

Considering
      the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in
      Current Year Financial Statements

,
      which
      addresses the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements in quantifying
      misstatements in current year financial statements. Misstatements are required
      to be quantified using both the balance-sheet (“iron-curtain”) and
      income-statement approach (“rollover”) and evaluated as to whether either
      approach results in a material error in light of quantitative and qualitative
      factors. SAB 108 is effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006
      and we adopted SAB 108 effective for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006.
      The adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material impact on our financial
      statements.

In
      June
      2006, the FASB issued FIN 48,

Accounting
      for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an Interpretation of FASB Statement
      No. 109

,
      which
      provides criteria for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure
      of uncertain tax positions. A tax benefit from an uncertain position may be
      recognized only if it is “more likely than not” that the position is sustainable
      based on its technical merits. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning
      after


December
      15, 2006 and we will adopt FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007. We are currently
      assessing the impact of

FIN
      48 on
      our financial statements.

In
      September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157,

Fair
      Value Measurements

,
      which
      establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about
      fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
      November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. We will adopt
      SFAS 157 effective January 1, 2008. We do not expect that the adoption of SFAS
      157 will have a material impact on our financial statements.

In
      February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 159,

The

Fair
      Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities - Including an
      amendment of FASB Statement No. 115

,
      which
      allows measurement at fair value of eligible financial assets and liabilities
      that are not otherwise measured at fair value.  If the fair value option
      for an eligible item is elected, unrealized gains and losses for that item
      shall
      be reported in current earnings at each subsequent reporting date.  SFAS
      159 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to draw
      comparison between the different measurement attributes the company elects
      for
      similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years
      beginning after November 15, 2007.  Early adoption is permitted.  We
      are currently assessing the impact of SFAS 159 on our financial
      statements.

We
      do not
      believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting
      pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on our accompanying
      financial statements.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
      and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Interest
      Rate Risk

We
      are
      exposed to various market risks, including fluctuations in interest rates.
      We
      use interest rate risk management derivative instruments, such as interest
      rate
      swap agreements and interest rate collar agreements (collectively referred
      to
      herein as interest rate agreements), as required under the terms of the credit
      facilities of our subsidiaries. Our policy is to manage interest costs using
      a
      mix of fixed and variable rate debt. Using interest rate swap agreements, we
      agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and
      variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional
      principal amount. Interest rate collar agreements are used to limit our exposure
      to, and to derive benefits from, interest rate fluctuations on variable rate
      debt to within a certain range of rates. Interest rate risk management
      agreements are not held or issued for speculative or trading purposes.

As
      of
      December 31, 2006 and 2005, our long-term debt totaled approximately $19.1
      billion and $19.4 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005,
      the
      weighted average interest rate on the credit facility debt was approximately
      7.9% and 7.8%, the weighted average interest rate on the high-yield notes was
      approximately 10.3% and 10.2%, and the weighted average interest rate on the
      convertible senior notes was approximately 6.9% and 6.3%, respectively,
      resulting in a blended weighted average interest rate of 9.5% and 9.3%,
      respectively. The interest rate on approximately 78% and 77% of the total
      principal amount of our debt was effectively fixed, including the effects of
      our
      interest rate hedge agreements as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

We
      do not
      hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. We do, however,
      have
      certain interest rate derivative instruments that have been designated as cash
      flow hedging instruments. Such instruments effectively convert variable interest
      payments on certain debt instruments into fixed payments. For qualifying hedges,
      SFAS No. 133 allows derivative gains and losses to offset related results on
      hedged items in the consolidated statement of operations. We have formally
      documented, designated and assessed the effectiveness of transactions that
      receive hedge accounting. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and
      2004,
      other income, net includes gains of $2 million, $3 million, and $4 million,
      respectively, which represent cash flow hedge ineffectiveness on interest rate
      hedge agreements arising from differences between the critical terms of the
      agreements and the related hedged obligations. Changes in the fair value of
      interest rate agreements designated as hedging instruments of the variability
      of
      cash flows associated with floating-rate debt obligations that meet the
      effectiveness criteria of SFAS No. 133 are reported in accumulated other
      comprehensive loss. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004,
      a
      loss of $1 million and gains of $16 million and $42 million, respectively,
      related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, were recorded
      in accumulated other comprehensive loss and minority interest. The amounts
      are
      subsequently reclassified into interest expense as a yield adjustment in the
      same period in which the related interest on the floating-rate debt obligations
      affects earnings (losses).


Certain
      interest rate derivative instruments are not designated as hedges as they do
      not
      meet the effectiveness criteria specified by SFAS No. 133. However, management
      believes such instruments are closely correlated with the respective debt,
      thus
      managing associated risk. Interest rate derivative instruments not designated
      as
      hedges are marked to fair value, with the impact recorded as other income,
      net,
      in our statements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005,
      and 2004, other income, net includes gains of $4 million, $47 million, and
      $65
      million, respectively, for interest rate derivative instruments not designated
      as hedges.

The
      table
      set forth below summarizes the fair values and contract terms of financial
      instruments subject to interest rate risk maintained by us as of December 31,
      2006 (dollars in millions):

The
      notional amounts of interest rate instruments do not represent amounts exchanged
      by the parties and, thus, are not a measure of our exposure to credit loss.
      The
      amounts exchanged are determined by reference to the notional amount and the
      other terms of the contracts. The estimated fair value approximates the costs
      (proceeds) to settle the outstanding contracts. Interest rates on variable
      debt
      are estimated using the average implied forward London Interbank Offering Rate
      (LIBOR) rates for the year of maturity based on the yield curve in effect
      at December 31, 2006.

At
      December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had outstanding $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion
      and
      $0 and $20 million, respectively, in notional amounts of interest rate
      swaps and collars, respectively. The notional amounts of interest rate
      instruments do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, thus, are
      not
      a measure of exposure to credit loss. The amounts exchanged are determined
      by
      reference to the notional amount and the other terms of the contracts.

Controls

Conclusion
      Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and
      Procedures

As
      of the
      end of the period covered by this report, management, including our Chief
      Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness
      of
      the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures with respect
      to the information generated for use in this annual report. The evaluation
      was
      based in part upon reports and affidavits provided by a number of executives.
      Based upon, and as of the date of that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer
      and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and
      procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurances that information
      required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange
      Act
      is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
      specified in the Commission’s rules and forms.


There
      was
      no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth
      quarter of 2006 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
      materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

In
      designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management
      recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and
      operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving
      the
      desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply
      its
      judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and
      procedures. Based upon the above evaluation, Charter’s management believes that
      its controls provide such reasonable assurances.

Management’s
      Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Charter’s
      management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
      control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the
      Exchange Act). Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable
      assurance to Charter’s management and board of directors regarding the
      preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.

Charter’s
      management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial

Report
      of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To
      the
      Board of Directors and Shareholders

Charter
      Communications, Inc.:

We
      have
      audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Charter Communications,
      Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and
      the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders’
equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
      ended December 31, 2006. These consolidated financial statements are the
      responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
      opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We
      conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
      Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
      plan
      and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
      statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
      on a
      test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
      statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
      and
      significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
      financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
      reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
      our
      opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly,
      in all material respects, the financial position of Charter Communications,
      Inc.
      and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their
      operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
      ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
      principles.

As
      discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, effective
      September 30, 2004, the Company adopted EITF Topic D-108,

Use
      of the Residual Method to Value Acquired Assets Other than
      Goodwill

.

We
      also
      have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
      Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
      control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria
      established in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued
      by
      the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO),
      and
      our report dated February 27, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on
      management’s assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control
      over financial reporting.

Report
      of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
      Board
      of Directors and Shareholders

Charter
      Communications, Inc.:

We
      have
      audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s
      Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Charter
      Communications, Inc. (the Company) maintained effective internal control over
      financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established
      in

Internal
      Control - Integrated Framework

issued
      by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
      (COSO).

The
      Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
      over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
      control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
      on
      management's assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
      internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
      conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
      Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
      plan
      and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
      internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
      respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
      over
      financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating
      the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
      such
      other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
      that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
      company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
      provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
      and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
      with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control
      over
      financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
      to
      the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
      reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
      provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
      permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
      accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
      being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
      of
      the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
      detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
      assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
      of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
      not
      prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
      effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
      inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
      with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
      our
      opinion, management's assessment that the Company maintained effective internal
      control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated,
      in
      all material respects, based on criteria established in

Internal
      Control - Integrated Framework

issued
      by COSO.

Also,
      in
      our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
      internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on

criteria
      established in

Internal
      Control - Integrated Framework

issued
      by

COSO

.

We
      also
      have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
      Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company
      as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of
      operations, changes in shareholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows for each
      of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2006, and our report
      dated February 27, 2007

expressed
      an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

1.

Organization
      and Basis of Presentation

Charter
      Communications, Inc. (“Charter”) is a holding company whose principal assets at
      December 31, 2006 are the 55% controlling common equity interest (52% for
      accounting purposes) in Charter Communications Holding Company, LLC (“Charter
      Holdco”) and “mirror” notes which are payable by Charter Holdco to Charter and
      have the same principal amount and terms as those of Charter’s convertible
      senior notes. Charter Holdco is the sole owner of CCHC, LLC ("CCHC"), which
      is
      the sole owner of Charter Communications Holdings, LLC ("Charter Holdings").
      The
      consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Charter, Charter
      Holdco, CCHC, Charter Holdings and all of their subsidiaries where the
      underlying operations reside, which are collectively referred to herein as
      the
      "Company." Charter has 100% voting control over Charter Holdco and had
      historically consolidated on that basis. Charter continues to consolidate
      Charter Holdco as a variable interest entity under Financial Accounting
      Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation ("FIN") 46(R)

Consolidation
      of Variable Interest Entities

.
      Charter
      Holdco’s limited liability company agreement provides that so long as Charter’s
      Class B common stock retains its special voting rights, Charter will maintain
      a
      100% voting interest in Charter Holdco. Voting control gives Charter full
      authority and control over the operations of Charter Holdco. All significant
      intercompany accounts and transactions among consolidated entities have been
      eliminated. The Company is a broadband communications company operating in
      the
      United States. The Company offers its customers traditional cable video
      programming (analog and digital video), high-speed Internet services, advanced
      broadband services such as high definition television, OnDemand, and digital
      video recorder service, and, in many of our markets, telephone service. The
      Company sells its cable video programming, high-speed Internet, telephone and
      advanced broadband services on a subscription basis. The Company also sells
      local advertising on cable networks.

The
      preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
      generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
      and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
      and
      disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
      statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
      reporting period. Areas involving significant judgments and estimates include
      capitalization of labor and overhead costs; depreciation and amortization costs;
      impairments of property, plant and equipment, franchises and goodwill; income
      taxes; and contingencies. Actual results could differ from those
      estimates.

Reclassifications.

Certain
      prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the 2006
      presentation

,

including
      discontinued operations as discussed in Note 4.

Liquidity
      and Capital Resources

The
      Company incurred net loss applicable to common stock of $1.4 billion, $970
      million, and $4.3 billion in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The Company’s
      net cash flows from operating activities were $323 million, $260 million, and
      $472 million for the years ending December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004,
      respectively.

The
      Company has a significant level of debt. The Company's long-term debt as of
      December 31, 2006 consisted of $5.4 billion of credit facility debt, $13.3
      billion accreted value of high-yield notes and $408 million accreted value
      of
      convertible senior notes. In 2007, $130 million of the Company’s debt matures
      and in 2008, an additional $50 million matures. In 2009 and beyond, significant
      additional amounts will become due under the Company’s remaining long-term debt
      obligations.

The
      Company requires significant cash to fund debt service costs, capital
      expenditures and ongoing operations. The Company has historically funded these
      requirements through cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under
      its
      credit facilities, sales of assets, issuances of debt and equity securities,
      and
      cash on hand. However, the mix of funding sources changes from period to
      period.

For
      the
      year ended December 31, 2006, the Company generated $323 million of net cash
      flows from operating activities after paying cash interest of $1.7 billion.

In
      addition, the Company received proceeds from the sale of assets of approximately
      $1.0 billion and used $1.1 billion for purchases of property, plant and
      equipment. Finally, the Company had net cash flows used in financing activities
      of $219 million.

          TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER
          31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004

(dollars
          in millions, except where indicated)

The
      Company expects that cash on hand, cash flows from operating activities and
      the
      amounts available under its credit facilities will be adequate to meet its
      cash
      needs through 2007. The Company believes that cash flows from operating
      activities and amounts available under the Company’s credit facilities may not
      be sufficient to fund the Company’s operations and satisfy its interest and
      principal repayment obligations in 2008, and will not be sufficient to fund
      such
      needs in 2009 and beyond. The Company continues to work with its financial
      advisors concerning its approach to addressing liquidity, debt maturities and
      its overall balance sheet leverage.

Credit
      Facility Availability

The
      Company’s ability to operate depends upon, among other things, its continued
      access to capital, including credit under the Charter Communications Operating,
      LLC (“Charter Operating”) credit facilities. The Charter Operating credit
      facilities, along with the Company’s indentures, contain certain restrictive
      covenants, some of which require the Company to maintain specified financial
      ratios, and meet financial tests, and to provide annual audited financial
      statements with an unqualified opinion from the Company’s independent auditors.
      As of December 31, 2006, the Company is in compliance with the covenants under
      its credit facilities, as well as under its indentures, and the Company expects
      to remain in compliance with those covenants for the next twelve months. As
      of
      December 31, 2006,

the

Company’s potential availability under its credit facilities totaled
      approximately $1.3 billion, although the actual availability at that time
      was only $1.1 billion because of limits imposed by covenant
      restrictions

.

Continued
      access to the Company’s credit facilities is subject to the Company remaining in
      compliance with these covenants, including covenants tied to the Company’s
      operating performance. If any events of non-compliance occur, funding under
      the
      credit facilities may not be available and defaults on some or potentially
      all
      of the Company’s debt obligations could occur. An event of default under any of
      the Company’s debt instruments could result in the acceleration of its payment
      obligations under that debt and, under certain circumstances, in cross-defaults
      under its other debt obligations, which could have a material adverse effect
      on
      the Company’s consolidated financial condition and results of
      operations.

Limitations
      on Distributions

Charter’s
      ability to make interest payments on its convertible senior notes, and, in
      2009,
      to repay the outstanding principal of its convertible senior notes of $413
      million, will depend on its ability to raise additional capital and/or on
      receipt of payments or distributions from Charter Holdco and its subsidiaries.

As
      of December 31, 2006, Charter Holdco was owed $3 million in intercompany loans
      from its subsidiaries and had $8 million in cash, which were available to pay
      interest and principal on Charter's convertible senior notes.

In
      addition, Charter has $50 million of U.S. government securities pledged as
      security for the semi-annual interest payments on Charter’s convertible senior
      notes scheduled in 2007.  CCHC also holds an additional $450 million of
      Charter’s convertible senior notes.  As a result, if CCHC continues to hold
      those notes, CCHC will receive interest payments on the convertible senior
      notes
      from the pledged government securities.  The cumulative amount of interest
      payments expected to be received by CCHC may be available to be distributed
      to
      pay interest on the outstanding $413 million principal amount of the convertible
      senior notes due in 2008 and May 2009, although CCHC may use those amounts
      for
      other purposes.

Distributions
      by Charter’s subsidiaries to a parent company (including Charter, Charter Holdco
      and CCHC)

for
      payment of principal on parent company notes,

are
      restricted under the indentures governing the CCH I Holdings, LLC (“CIH”) notes,
      CCH I, LLC (“CCH I”) notes, CCH II, LLC (“CCH II”) notes, CCO Holdings, LLC
      (“CCO Holdings”) notes, and Charter Operating notes

unless
      there is no default under the applicable indenture, and each applicable
      subsidiary’s leverage ratio test is met at the time of such distribution, and,
      in the case of such distributions by Charter Operating for payment of principal
      on a portion of the outstanding CCO Holdings notes, other specified tests are
      met.

For
      the
      quarter ended December 31, 2006, there was no default under any of these
      indentures and each such subsidiary met its applicable leverage ratio tests
      based on December 31, 2006 financial results.

Such
      distributions would be restricted, however, if any such subsidiary fails to
      meet
      these tests at the time of the contemplated distribution. In the past, certain
      subsidiaries have from time to time failed to meet their leverage ratio test.
      There can be no assurance that they will satisfy these tests at the time of
      the
      contemplated distribution.

Distributions
      by Charter Operating for payment of principal on parent company notes are
      further restricted by the covenants in the credit facilities.

DECEMBER
          31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004

(dollars
          in millions, except where indicated)

Distributions
      by CIH, CCH I, CCH II, CCO Holdings and Charter Operating to a parent company
      for payment of parent company interest are permitted if there is no default
      under the aforementioned indentures, and in the case of such distributions
      by
      Charter Operating for payment of interest on a portion of the outstanding CCO
      Holdings notes, Charter Operating’s leverage ratio and other specified tests are
      met.

The
      indentures governing the Charter Holdings notes permit Charter Holdings to
      make
      distributions to Charter Holdco for payment of interest or principal on the
      convertible senior notes, only if, after giving effect to the distribution,
      Charter Holdings can incur additional debt under the leverage ratio of 8.75
      to
      1.0, there is no default under Charter Holdings’ indentures, and other specified
      tests are met. For the quarter ended

December
      31, 2006, there was no default under Charter Holdings’ indentures and the other
      specified tests were met.

Such
      distributions would be restricted, however, if Charter Holdings fails to meet
      these tests at the time of the contemplated distribution. In the past, Charter
      Holdings has from time to time failed to meet this leverage ratio test. There
      can be no assurance that Charter Holdings will satisfy these tests at the time
      of the contemplated distribution.

During

periods
      in which distributions are restricted,

the
      indentures governing the Charter Holdings notes permit Charter Holdings and
      its
      subsidiaries to make specified investments (that are not restricted payments)
      in
      Charter Holdco or Charter, up to an amount determined by a formula, as long
      as
      there is no default under the indentures.

Recent
      Financing Transactions

In
      January 2006, CCH II and CCH II Capital Corp. issued $450 million in debt
      securities, the proceeds of which were provided to Charter Operating, which
      used
      such funds to reduce borrowings, but not commitments, under the revolving
      portion of its credit facilities.

In
      April
      2006, Charter Operating completed a $6.85 billion refinancing of its credit
      facilities including a new $350 million revolving/term facility (which converts
      to a term loan no later than April 2007), a $5.0 billion term loan due in 2013,
      and certain amendments to the existing $1.5 billion revolving credit facility.
      In addition, the refinancing reduced margins on Eurodollar rate term loans
      to
      2.625% from a weighted average of 3.15% previously, and margins on base rate
      term loans to 1.625% from a weighted average of 2.15% previously. Concurrent
      with this refinancing, the CCO Holdings bridge loan was terminated. The
      refinancing resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $27
      million.

In
      September 2006, Charter Holdings and its wholly owned subsidiaries, CCH I and
      CCH II, completed the exchange of approximately $797 million in total principal
      amount of outstanding debt securities of Charter Holdings. Holders of Charter
      Holdings notes due in 2009-2010 tendered $308 million principal amount of notes
      for $250 million principal amount of new 10.25% CCH II notes due 2013 and $37
      million principal amount of 11% CCH I notes due 2015. Holders of Charter
      Holdings notes due 2011-2012 tendered $490 million principal amount of notes
      for
      $425 million principal amount of 11% CCH I notes due 2015. The Charter Holdings
      notes received in the exchanges were thereafter distributed to Charter Holdings
      and retired. Also in September 2006, CCHC and CCH II completed the exchange
      of
      $450 million principal amount of Charter’s outstanding 5.875% senior convertible
      notes due 2009 for $188 million in cash, 45 million shares of Charter’s Class A
      Common Stock and $146 million principal amount of 10.25% CCH II notes due 2010.
      The convertible notes received in the exchange are held by CCHC.

Summary
      of Significant Accounting Policies

Cash
      Equivalents

The
      Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of
      three months or less to be cash equivalents. These investments are carried
      at
      cost, which approximates market value.

Property,
      Plant and Equipment

Property,
      plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including all material, labor and
      certain indirect costs associated with the construction of cable transmission
      and distribution facilities. While the Company’s capitalization is based on
      specific activities, once capitalized, costs are tracked by fixed asset category
      at the cable system level and not on

a
      specific asset basis. Costs associated with initial customer installations
      and
      the additions of network equipment necessary to enable advanced services are
      capitalized. Costs capitalized as part of initial customer installations include
      materials, labor, and certain indirect costs. Indirect costs are associated
      with
      the activities of the Company’s personnel who assist in connecting and
      activating the new service and consist of compensation and indirect costs
      associated with these support functions. Indirect costs primarily include
      employee benefits and payroll taxes, direct variable costs associated with
      capitalizable activities, consisting primarily of installation and construction
      vehicle costs, the cost of dispatch personnel and indirect costs directly
      attributable to capitalizable activities. The costs of disconnecting service
      at
      a customer’s dwelling or reconnecting service to a previously installed dwelling
      are charged to operating expense in the period incurred. Costs for repairs
      and
      maintenance are charged to operating expense as incurred, while plant and
      equipment replacement and betterments, including replacement of cable drops
      from
      the pole to the dwelling, are capitalized.

Depreciation
      is recorded using the straight-line composite method over management’s estimate
      of the useful lives of the related assets as follows:

Cable
                  distribution systems

7-20 years

Customer

Asset
      Retirement Obligations

Certain
      of the Company’s franchise agreements and leases contain provisions requiring
      the Company to restore facilities or remove equipment in the event that the
      franchise or lease agreement is not renewed. The Company expects to continually
      renew its franchise agreements and have concluded that substantially all of
      the
      related franchise rights are indefinite lived intangible assets. Accordingly,
      the possibility is remote that the Company would be required to incur
      significant restoration or removal costs related to these franchise agreements
      in the foreseeable future. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
      No. 143,

Accounting
      for Asset Retirement Obligations

,
      as
      interpreted by FIN No. 47,

Accounting
      for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations - an Interpretation of FASB
      Statement No. 143

,
      requires that a liability be recognized for an asset retirement obligation
      in
      the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can
      be
      made. The Company has not recorded an estimate for potential franchise related
      obligations but would record an estimated liability in the unlikely event a
      franchise agreement containing such a provision were no longer expected to
      be
      renewed. The Company also expects to renew many of its lease agreements related
      to the continued operation of its cable business in the franchise areas. For
      the
      Company’s lease agreements, the estimated liabilities related to the removal
      provisions, where applicable, have been recorded and are not significant to
      the
      financial statements.

Franchises

Franchise
      rights represent the value attributed to agreements with local authorities
      that
      allow access to homes in cable service areas acquired through the purchase
      of
      cable systems. Management estimates the fair value of franchise rights at the
      date of acquisition and determines if the franchise has a finite life or an
      indefinite-life as defined by SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill
      and Other Intangible Assets

.
      All
      franchises that qualify for indefinite-life treatment under SFAS No. 142
      are no longer amortized against earnings but instead are tested for impairment
      annually as of October 1, or more frequently as warranted by events or
      changes in circumstances (see Note 7). The Company concluded that more than
      99%
      of its franchises qualify for indefinite-life treatment; however, certain
      franchises did not qualify for indefinite-life treatment due to technological
      or
      operational factors that limit their lives. These franchise costs are amortized
      on a straight-line basis over 10 years. Costs incurred in renewing cable
      franchises are deferred and amortized over 10 years.

Other
      Noncurrent Assets

Other
      noncurrent assets primarily include deferred financing costs, governmental
      securities, investments in equity securities and goodwill. Costs related to
      borrowings are deferred and amortized to interest expense over the terms of
      the
      related borrowings.

Investments
      in equity securities are accounted for at cost, under the equity method of
      accounting or in accordance with SFAS No. 115,

Accounting
      for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

.
      Charter
      recognizes losses for any decline in value considered to be other than
      temporary. Certain marketable equity securities are classified as
      available-for-sale and reported at market value with unrealized gains and losses
      recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss.

The
      following summarizes investment information as of December 31, 2006 and 2005
      and
      for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004:

The
      gain
      on equity investments, under the cost method for the year ended December 31,
      2006 primarily represents gains realized on the sale of two investments. Such
      amounts are included in other income, net in the statements of
      operations.

The
      gain
      on equity investments, under the equity method for the year ended December
      31,
      2005 primarily represents a gain realized on an exchange of the Company’s
      interest in an equity investee for an investment in a larger enterprise. Such
      amounts are included in other income, net in the statements of
      operations.

As
      required by the indentures to the Company’s 5.875% convertible senior notes
      issued in November 2004, the Company purchased U.S. government securities valued
      at approximately $144 million with maturities corresponding to the interest
      payment dates for the convertible senior notes. These securities were pledged
      and are held in escrow to provide payment in full for the first six interest
      payments of the convertible senior notes (see Note 9), four of which were funded
      in 2006 and 2005. These securities are accounted for as held-to-maturity
      securities. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the carrying value of the securities
      was approximately $50 million and $98 million, respectively, while the fair
      value of the securities was approximately $49 million and $97 million,
      respectively. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, approximately $50 million and
      $50
      million was recorded in prepaid and other assets and approximately $0 and $48
      million was recorded in other assets on the Company’s consolidated balance
      sheets.

Valuation
      of Property, Plant and Equipment

The
      Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and used
      for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
      carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Such events or changes
      in
      circumstances could include such factors as impairment of the Company’s
      indefinite life franchise under SFAS No. 142, changes in technological advances,
      fluctuations in the fair value of such assets, adverse changes in relationships
      with local franchise authorities, adverse changes in market conditions or a
      deterioration of operating results. If a review indicates that the carrying
      value of such asset is not recoverable from estimated undiscounted cash flows,
      the carrying value of such asset is reduced to its estimated fair value. While
      the Company believes that

its
      estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions regarding
      such cash flows could materially affect its evaluations of asset recoverability.
      No impairments of long-lived assets to be held and used were recorded in 2006,
      2005, and 2004; however, approximately $159 million and $39 million of
      impairment on assets held for sale was recorded for the years ended December
      31,
      2006 and 2005, respectively (see Note 4).

Derivative
      Financial Instruments

The
      Company accounts for derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS
      No. 133,

Accounting
      for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

,
      as
      amended. For those instruments which qualify as hedging activities, related
      gains or losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. For
      all
      other derivative instruments, the related gains or losses are recorded in the
      income statement. The Company uses interest rate risk management derivative
      instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements, interest rate cap agreements
      and interest rate collar agreements (collectively referred to herein as interest
      rate agreements) as required under the terms of the credit facilities of the
      Company’s subsidiaries. The Company’s policy is to manage interest costs using a
      mix of fixed and variable rate debt. Using interest rate swap agreements, the
      Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between
      fixed
      and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional
      principal amount. Interest rate cap agreements are used to lock in a maximum
      interest rate should variable rates rise, but enable the Company to otherwise
      pay lower market rates. Interest rate collar agreements are used to limit
      exposure to and benefits from interest rate fluctuations on variable rate debt
      to within a certain range of rates. The Company does not hold or issue any
      derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

Certain
      provisions of the Company’s 5.875% convertible senior notes issued in November
      2004 were considered embedded derivatives for accounting purposes and were
      required to be separately accounted for from the convertible senior notes.
      In
      accordance with SFAS No. 133, these derivatives are marked to market with gains
      or losses recorded in interest expense on the Company’s consolidated statement
      of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company
      recognized $10 million in losses, $29 million in gains and $1 million in losses,
      respectively, related to these derivatives. The gains resulted in a reduction
      of
      interest expense while the losses resulted in an increase in interest expense
      related to these derivatives. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, $12 million and
      $1
      million, respectively, is recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses
      relating to the short-term portion of these derivatives and $0 and $1 million,
      respectively, is recorded in other long-term liabilities related to the
      long-term portion.

Revenue
      Recognition

Revenues
      from residential and commercial video, high-speed Internet and telephone
      services are recognized when the related services are provided. Advertising
      sales are recognized at estimated realizable values in the period that the
      advertisements are broadcast. Franchise fees imposed by local governmental
      authorities are collected on a monthly basis from the Company’s customers and
      are periodically remitted to local franchise authorities. Franchise fees of
      $179
      million, $174 million and $160 million for the years ended December 31, 2006,
      2005 and 2004, respectively, are reported as revenues on a gross basis with
      a
      corresponding operating expense

.

Sales
      taxes collected and remitted to state and local authorities are recorded on

Programming
      Costs

The
      Company has various contracts to obtain analog, digital and premium video
      programming from program suppliers whose compensation is typically based on
      a
      flat fee per customer. The cost of the right to exhibit network programming
      under such arrangements is recorded in operating expenses in the month the
      programming is available for exhibition. Programming costs are paid each month
      based on calculations performed by the Company and are subject to periodic
      audits performed by the programmers. Certain programming contracts contain
      launch incentives to be paid by the programmers. The Company receives these
      payments related to the activation of the programmer’s cable television channel
      and recognizes the launch incentives on a straight-line basis over the life
      of
      the programming agreement as a reduction of programming expense. This offset
      to
      programming expense was $32 million, $41 million, and $59 million for the years
      ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Programming costs
      included in the accompanying statement of operations were $1.5 billion, $1.4
      billion, and $1.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and
      2004, respectively. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005,

the
      deferred amounts of launch incentives, included in other long-term liabilities,
      were $67 million and $83 million, respectively.

      Costs

Advertising
      costs associated with marketing the Company’s products and services are
      generally expensed as costs are incurred. Such advertising expense was $131
      million, $94 million, and $70 million for the years ended December 31,
      2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

Stock-Based
      Compensation

The
      Company had historically accounted for stock-based compensation in accordance
      with Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25,

Accounting
      for Stock Issued to Employees

,
      and
      related interpretations, as permitted by SFAS No. 123,

Accounting
      for Stock-Based Compensation

.
      On
      January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the fair value measurement provisions
      of SFAS No. 123 using the prospective method under which the Company will
      recognize compensation expense of a stock-based award to an employee over the
      vesting period based on the fair value of the award on the grant date consistent
      with the method described in FIN No. 28,

Accounting
      for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award
      Plans

.
      Adoption of these provisions resulted in utilizing a preferable accounting
      method as the consolidated financial statements will present the estimated
      fair
      value of stock-based compensation in expense consistently with other forms
      of
      compensation and other expense associated with goods and services received
      for
      equity instruments. In accordance with SFAS No. 148,

Accounting
      for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure,

the
      fair
      value method was applied only to awards granted or modified after
      January 1, 2003, whereas awards granted prior to such date were accounted
      for under APB No. 25, unless they were modified or settled in cash.

On
      January 1, 2006, the Company adopted revised SFAS No. 123,

Share
      - Based Payment,

which
      addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions in which a company
      receives employee services in exchange for (a)

      provisions of SFAS No. 123 on January 1, 2003, the revised standard did not
      have
      a material impact on its financial statements. The Company recorded $13 million,
      $14 million, and $31 million of option compensation expense which is included
      in
      general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2006,

The
        fair
        value of each option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the
        Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The following weighted average assumptions
        were used for grants during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and
        2004,
        respectively; risk-free interest rates of 4.6%, 4.0%, and 3.3%; expected
        volatility of 87.3%, 70.9%, and 92.4% based on historical volatility; and
        expected lives of 6.3 years, 4.5 years, and 4.6 years, respectively. The
        valuations assume no dividends are paid.

Income
      Taxes

The
      Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences
      between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company’s assets
      and liabilities and expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss
      carryforwards. The impact on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates and tax
      law,
      if any, applied to the years during which temporary differences are expected
      to
      be settled, are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period
      of enactment (see Note 21).

Minority
      Interest

Minority
      interest on the consolidated balance sheets primarily represents preferred
      membership interests in an indirect subsidiary of Charter held by Mr. Paul
      G.
      Allen. Minority interest totaled $192 million and $188 million as of
      December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, on the accompanying consolidated
      balance sheets.

Reported
      losses allocated to minority interest on the statement of operations reflect
      the
      minority interests in CC VIII, LLC (“CC VIII”) and Charter Holdco. Because
      minority interest in Charter Holdco was substantially eliminated, Charter
      absorbs substantially all losses before income taxes that otherwise would have
      been allocated to minority interest (see Note 11).

Loss
      per Common Share

Basic
      loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss applicable to common
      stock by 331,941,788 shares, 310,209,047 shares, and 300,341,877 shares for
      the
      years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, representing the weighted-average
      common shares outstanding during the respective periods. Diluted loss per common
      share equals basic loss per common share for the periods presented, as the
      effect of stock options and other convertible securities are antidilutive
      because the Company incurred net losses. All membership units of Charter Holdco
      are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into common stock of Charter at the
      option of the holders. As of December 31, 2006, Charter Holdco had 747,176,616
      membership units outstanding. Should the holders exchange units for shares,
      the
      effect would not be dilutive because the Company incurred net losses.

The
      39.8
      million and 116.9 million shares outstanding as of December 31, 2006 and 2005,
      respectively, pursuant to the share lending agreement described in Note 13
      are
      required to be returned, in accordance with the contractual arrangement, and
      are
      treated in basic and diluted earnings per share as if they were already returned
      and retired. Consequently, there is no impact of the shares of common stock
      lent
      under the share lending agreement in the earnings per share calculation.

Segments

SFAS
      No. 131,

Disclosure
      about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information

,
      established standards for reporting information about operating segments in
      annual financial statements and in interim financial reports issued to
      shareholders. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise
      about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated on
      a
      regular basis by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group,
      in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing
      performance of the segment.

The
      Company’s operations are managed on the basis of geographic divisional operating
      segments. The Company has evaluated the criteria for aggregation of the
      geographic operating segments under paragraph 17 of SFAS No. 131 and
      believes it meets each of the respective criteria set forth. The Company
      delivers similar products and

services
      within each of its geographic divisional operations. Each geographic and
      divisional service area utilizes similar means for delivering the programming
      of
      the Company’s services; have similarity in the type or class of customer
      receiving the products and services; distributes the Company’s services over a
      unified network; and operates within a consistent regulatory environment. In
      addition, each of the geographic divisional operating segments has similar
      economic characteristics. In light of the Company’s similar services, means for
      delivery, similarity in type of customers, the use of a unified network and
      other considerations across its geographic divisional operating structure,
      management has determined that the Company has one reportable segment, broadband
      services.

Sale
      of Assets

In
      2006,
      the Company sold certain cable television systems serving a total of
      approximately 356,000 analog video customers in 1) West Virginia and
      Virginia

to
      Cebridge Connections, Inc. (the “Cebridge Transaction”); 2) Illinois and
      Kentucky to Telecommunications Management, LLC, doing business as New Wave
      Communications (the “New Wave Transaction”) and 3) Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico
      and Utah to Orange Broadband Holding Company, LLC

(the
“Orange Transaction”) for a total sales price of approximately $971 million. The
      Company used the net proceeds from the asset sales to reduce borrowings, but
      not
      commitments, under the revolving portion of the Company’s credit facilities.
      These cable systems met the criteria for assets held for sale. As such, the
      assets were written down to fair value less estimated costs to sell, resulting
      in asset impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2006 of
      approximately $99 million related to the New Wave Transaction and the Orange
      Transaction. Also in 2006, the Company recorded asset impairment charges of
      $60
      million related to other cable systems meeting the criteria of assets held
      for
      sale.

During
      the second quarter of 2006, the Company determined, based on changes in the
      Company’s organizational and cost structure, that its asset groupings for long
      lived asset accounting purposes are at the level of their individual market
      areas, which are at a level below the Company’s geographic clustering. As a
      result, the Company has determined that the West Virginia and Virginia cable
      systems comprise operations and cash flows that for

        of operations for the West Virginia and Virginia cable systems (including
        a gain
        on sale of approximately $200 million recorded in the third quarter of 2006)

        to conform to the current presentation. Tax expense of $18 million associated
        with this gain on sale was recorded in the fourth quarter of
        2006.

      consolidated financial information for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005
      and 2004 for the West Virginia and Virginia cable systems is as follows:

In
        2005,
        the Company closed the sale of certain cable systems in Texas, West Virginia
        and
        Nebraska representing a total of approximately 33,000 analog video customers.
        During the year ended December 31, 2005, certain of those cable systems met
        the
        criteria for assets held for sale. As such, the assets were written down
        to fair
        value less estimated costs to sell resulting in asset impairment charges
        during
        the year ended December 31, 2005 of approximately $39 million.

In
      2004,
      the Company closed the sale of certain cable systems in Florida, Pennsylvania,
      Maryland, Delaware, New York and West Virginia to Atlantic Broadband Finance,
      LLC. These transactions resulted in a $106 million gain recorded as other
      income, net in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. The total
      net proceeds from

the
      sale
      of all of these systems were approximately $735 million. The proceeds were
      used
      to repay a portion of amounts outstanding under the Company’s revolving credit

The

      assets and the estimated amount of assets that will be abandoned or have minimal
      use in the future. A significant change in assumptions about the extent or
      timing of future asset retirements, or in the Company’s use of new technology
      and upgrade programs, could materially affect future depreciation expense.

Depreciation
      expense for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $1.3 billion,
      $1.4 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.

Franchises
      and Goodwill

Franchise
      rights represent the value attributed to agreements with local authorities
      that
      allow access to homes in cable service areas acquired through the purchase
      of
      cable systems. Management estimates the fair value of franchise rights at the
      date of acquisition and determines if the franchise has a finite life or an
      indefinite-life as defined by SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill
      and Other Intangible Assets

.
      Franchises that qualify for indefinite-life treatment under SFAS No. 142 are
      tested for impairment annually each October 1 based on valuations, or more
      frequently as warranted by events or changes in circumstances. Such test
      resulted in a total franchise impairment of approximately $3.3 billion during
      the third quarter of 2004. The 2005 and 2006 annual impairment tests resulted
      in
      no impairment. Franchises are aggregated into essentially inseparable asset
      groups to conduct the valuations. The asset groups generally represent
      geographic clustering of the Company’s cable systems into groups by which such
      systems are managed. Management believes such grouping represents the highest
      and best use of those assets.

The
      Company’s valuations, which are based on the present value of projected after
      tax cash flows, result in a value of property, plant and equipment, franchises,
      customer relationships, and its total entity value. The value of goodwill is
      the
      difference between the total entity value and amounts assigned to the other
      assets.

Franchises,
      for valuation purposes, are defined as the future economic benefits of the
      right
      to solicit and service potential customers (customer marketing rights), and
      the
      right to deploy and market new services, such as interactivity and telephone,
      to
      the potential customers (service marketing rights). Fair value is determined
      based on estimated discounted future cash flows using assumptions consistent
      with internal forecasts. The franchise after-tax cash flow is calculated as
      the
      after-tax cash flow generated by the potential customers obtained (less the
      anticipated customer churn), and the new services added to those customers
      in
      future periods. The sum of the present value of the franchises' after-tax cash
      flow in years 1 through 10 and the continuing value of the after-tax cash flow
      beyond year 10 yields the fair value of the franchise.

The
      Company follows the guidance of Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue 02-17,

Recognition
      of Customer Relationship Intangible Assets Acquired in a Business Combination,

in
      valuing customer relationships. Customer relationships, for valuation purposes,
      represent the value of the business relationship with existing customers (less

the
      anticipated customer churn), and are calculated by projecting future after-tax
      cash flows from these customers, including the right to deploy and market
      additional services such as interactivity and telephone to these customers.
      The
      present value of these after-tax cash flows yields the fair value of the
      customer relationships. Substantially all acquisitions occurred prior to January
      1, 2002. The Company did not record any value associated with the customer
      relationship intangibles related to those acquisitions. For acquisitions
      subsequent to January 1, 2002 the Company did assign a value to the customer
      relationship intangible, which is amortized over its estimated useful life.

In
      September 2004, the SEC staff issued EITF Topic D-108 which requires the direct
      method of separately valuing all intangible assets and does not permit goodwill
      to be included in franchise assets. The Company adopted Topic D-108 in its
      impairment assessment as of September 30, 2004. Such impairment assessment
      resulted in a total franchise impairment of approximately $3.3 billion. The
      Company recorded a cumulative effect of accounting change of $765 million
      (approximately $875 million before tax effects of $91 million and minority
      interest effects of $19 million) for the year ended December 31, 2004
      representing the portion of the Company's total franchise impairment
      attributable to no longer including goodwill with franchise assets. The effect
      of the adoption was to increase net loss and loss per share by $765 million
      and
      $2.55, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2004. The remaining $2.4
      billion of the total franchise impairment was attributable to the use of lower
      projected growth rates and the resulting revised estimates of future cash flows
      in the Company's valuation, and was recorded as impairment of franchises in
      the
      Company's accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended
      December 31, 2004. Sustained analog video customer losses by the Company in
      the
      third quarter of 2004 primarily as a result of increased competition from direct
      broadcast satellite providers and decreased growth rates in the Company's
      high-speed Internet customers in the third quarter of 2004, in part, as a result
      of increased competition from digital subscriber line service providers led
      to
      the lower projected growth rates and the revised estimates of future cash flows
      from those used at October 1, 2003.

As
      of
      December 31, 2006 and 2005, indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangible
      assets are presented in the following table:

For
      the
      year ended December 31, 2006, the net carrying amount of indefinite-lived and
      finite-lived franchises was reduced by $452 million and $2 million,
      respectively, related to cable asset sales completed in 2006 and
      indefinite-lived franchises were further reduced by $147 million as a result
      of
      the asset impairment charges recorded related to these cable asset sales. For
      the year ended December 31, 2005, the net carrying amount of indefinite-lived
      franchises was reduced by $52 million related to cable asset sales completed
      in
      2005 (see Note 4). Additionally, in 2005, approximately $13 million of
      franchises that were previously classified as finite-lived were reclassified
      to
      indefinite-lived, based on the Company’s renewal of these franchise assets in
      2005.

Franchise
      amortization expense represents the amortization relating to franchises that
      did
      not qualify for indefinite-life treatment under SFAS No. 142, including costs
      associated with franchise renewals. Franchise amortization expense for the
      years
      ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $2 million, $4 million, and $3
      million, respectively. The Company expects that amortization expense on
      franchise assets will be approximately $1 million annually for each of the
      next
      five years. Actual amortization expense in future periods could differ from
      these

The
      accreted values presented above generally represent the principal amount of
      the
      notes less the original issue discount at the time of sale, plus the accretion
      to the balance sheet date except as follows. Certain of the CIH notes, CCH
      I
      notes, and CCH II notes issued in exchange for Charter Holdings notes and
      Charter convertible notes in 2005 and 2006 are recorded for financial reporting
      purposes at values different from the current accreted value for legal purposes
      and notes indenture purposes (the amount that is currently payable if the debt
      becomes immediately due). As of December 31, 2006, the accreted value of the
      Company’s debt for legal purposes and notes indenture purposes is $18.8
      billion.

Charter
      Convertible Notes

The
      Charter convertible notes rank equally with any of Charter’s future
      unsubordinated and unsecured indebtedness, but are structurally subordinated
      to
      all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of Charter’s
      subsidiaries.

The
      4.75%
      Charter convertible notes were convertible at the option of the holder into
      shares of Class A common stock at a conversion rate of 38.0952 shares per $1,000
      principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to a price of $26.25 per share,
      subject to certain adjustments. Specifically, the adjustments included
      anti-dilutive provisions, which automatically occur based on the occurrence
      of
      specified events to provide protection rights to holders of the notes.
      Additionally, Charter could adjust the conversion ratio under certain
      circumstances when deemed appropriate. These notes were redeemable at Charter’s
      option at amounts decreasing from 101.9% to 100% of the principal amount, plus
      accrued and unpaid interest beginning on June 4, 2004, to the date of
      redemption.

During
      the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company repurchased, in private
      transactions, from a small number of institutional holders, a total of $136
      million principal amount of its 4.75% convertible senior notes due 2006,
      resulting in a gain on debt extinguishment of approximately $3
      million.

In
      June
      2006, the Company retired the remaining $20 million principal amount of
      Charter’s 4.75% convertible senior notes due 2006.

The
      5.875% convertible senior notes are convertible at any time at the option of
      the
      holder into shares of Class A common stock at an initial conversion rate of
      413.2231 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to
      a
      conversion price of approximately $2.42 per share, subject to certain
      adjustments. Specifically, the adjustments include anti-dilutive provisions,
      which cause adjustments to occur automatically based on the

occurrence
        of specified events to provide protection rights to holders of the notes.
        The
        conversion rate may also be increased (but not to exceed 462 shares per $1,000
        principal amount of notes) upon a specified change of control transaction.
        Additionally, Charter may elect to increase the conversion rate under certain
        circumstances when deemed appropriate, and subject to applicable limitations
        of
        the NASDAQ stock market. Holders who convert their notes prior to November
        16,
        2007 will receive an early conversion make whole amount in respect of their
        notes, based on a proportional share of the portfolio of pledged securities
        described below, with specified adjustments.

Charter
      Holdco used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the 5.875% convertible
      senior notes to purchase a portfolio of U.S. government securities in an amount
      which we believe will be sufficient to make the first six interest payments
      on
      the notes. These government securities were pledged to us as security for a
      mirror note issued by Charter Holdco to Charter and pledged to the trustee
      under
      the indenture governing the notes as security for our obligations thereunder.
      Such securities are being used to fund the semi-annual interest payments on
      Charter’s convertible senior notes scheduled in 2007. CCHC also holds an
      additional $450 million of Charter’s convertible senior notes.  As a
      result, if CCHC continues to hold those notes, CCHC will receive interest
      payments on the convertible senior notes from the pledged government
      securities.  The cumulative amount of interest payments expected to be
      received by CCHC may be available to be distributed to pay interest on the
      outstanding $413 million of the convertible senior notes due in 2008 and May
      2009, although CCHC may use those amounts for other purposes. The fair value
      of
      the pledged securities was $49 million and $97 million at December 31, 2006
      and
      2005, respectively.

Upon
      a
      change of control and certain other fundamental changes, subject to certain
      conditions and restrictions, Charter may be required to repurchase the notes,
      in
      whole or in part, at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued interest at
      the
      repurchase date.

We
      may
      redeem the notes in whole or in part for cash at any time at a redemption price
      equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid
      interest, deferred interest, and liquidated damages, if any, but only if for
      any
      20 trading days in any 30 consecutive trading day period the closing price
      has
      exceeded 180% of the conversion price, if such 30 trading day period begins
      prior to November 16, 2007, or 150% of the conversion price, if such 30 trading
      period begins thereafter. Holders who convert notes that we have called for
      redemption shall receive, in addition to the early conversion make whole amount,
      if applicable, the present value of the interest on the notes converted that
      would have been payable for the period from the later of November 17, 2007,
      and
      the redemption date, through the scheduled maturity date for the notes, plus
      any
      accrued deferred interest.

In
      September 2006, CCHC and CCH II completed the exchange of $450 million principal
      amount of Charter’s outstanding 5.875% senior convertible notes due 2009 for
      $188 million in cash, 45 million shares of Charter’s Class A common stock valued
      at $68 million and $146 million principal amount of 10.25% CCH II notes due
      2010. The convertible notes received in the exchange are held by CCHC. The
      exchange between Charter and CCHC and CCH II resulted in a gain on
      extinguishment of debt of approximately $20 million.

Charter
      Holdings Notes

The
      Charter Holdings notes are senior debt obligations of Charter Holdings and
      Charter Communications Capital Corporation (“Charter Capital”).

They
      rank
      equally with all other current and future unsecured, unsubordinated obligations
      of Charter Holdings and Charter Capital. They are structurally subordinated
      to
      the obligations of Charter Holdings’ subsidiaries, including the CIH notes, the
      CCH I notes, CCH II notes, the CCO Holdings notes, the Charter Operating notes,
      and the Charter Operating credit facilities.

Except
      for the 8.250% notes due April 1, 2007, the 10.00% notes due April 1, 2009,
      the
      10.75% notes due October 1, 2009 and the 9.625% notes due November 15, 2009
      which notes may not be redeemed prior to their respective maturity dates, the
      Charter Holdings notes may be redeemed at the option of Charter Holdings on
      or
      after varying dates in 2006 and 2007, in each case at a premium. The optional
      redemption price declines to 100% of the respective series’ principal amount,
      plus accrued and unpaid interest, on or after varying dates in 2007 through
      2010.

In
      March
      and June 2005, Charter Operating consummated exchange transactions with a small
      number of institutional holders of Charter Holdings 8.25% senior notes due
      pursuant to which Charter Operating issued approximately $333 million principal
      amount of new notes with terms identical to Charter Operating's 8.375% senior
      second lien notes due 2014 in exchange for approximately $346 million of the
      Charter Holdings 8.25% senior notes due 2007. The Charter Holdings notes
      received in the exchange were thereafter distributed to Charter Holdings and
      cancelled. The exchanges resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt of
      approximately $10 million.

In
      September 2005, Charter Holdings and its wholly owned subsidiaries, CCH I and
      CIH, completed the exchange of approximately $6.8 billion total principal amount
      of outstanding debt securities of Charter Holdings in a private placement for
      CCH I and CIH new debt securities. The Charter Holdings notes received in the
      exchange were thereafter distributed to Charter Holdings and cancelled. The
      exchanges resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt of approximately $490
      million.

In
      September 2006, Charter Holdings, CCH I and CCH II, completed the exchange
      of
      approximately $797 million in total principal amount of outstanding debt

      due
      2015. The Charter Holdings notes received in the exchange were thereafter

Charter
      Operating Notes

The
      Charter Operating notes are senior debt obligations of Charter Operating and
      Charter Communications Operating Capital Corp. To the extent of the value of
      the
      collateral (but subject to the prior lien of the credit facilities), they rank
      effectively senior to all of Charter Operating’s future unsecured senior
      indebtedness. The collateral currently consists of the capital stock of Charter
      Operating held by CCO Holdings, all of the intercompany obligations owing to
      CCO
      Holdings by Charter Operating or any subsidiary of Charter Operating, and
      substantially all of Charter Operating’s and the guarantors’ assets (other than
      the assets of CCO Holdings). CCO Holdings and those subsidiaries of Charter
      Operating that are guarantors of, or otherwise obligors with respect to,
      indebtedness under the Charter Operating credit facilities and related
      obligations, guarantee the Charter Operating notes.

Charter
      Operating may, prior to April 30, 2007 in the event of a qualified equity
      offering providing sufficient proceeds, redeem up to 35% of the aggregate
      principal amount of the Charter Operating notes at a redemption price of
      108.375% with respect to the 8 3/8% senior second-lien notes due 2014 and a
      redemption price of 108% with respect to the 8% senior second-lien notes due
      2012.

Charter
      Operating may, at any time and from time to time, at their option, redeem the
      outstanding 8% second lien notes due 2012, in whole or in part, at a redemption
      price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid
      interest, if any, to the redemption date, plus the Make-Whole Premium. The
      Make-Whole Premium is an amount equal to the excess of (a) the present value
      of
      the remaining interest and principal payments due on a 8% senior second-lien
      notes due 2012 to its final maturity date, computed using a discount rate equal
      to the Treasury Rate on such date plus 0.50%, over (b) the outstanding principal
      amount of such Note.

On
      or
      after April 30, 2009, Charter Operating may redeem all or a part of the 8 3/8%
      senior second lien notes at a redemption price that declines ratably from the
      initial redemption price of 104.188% to a redemption price on or after April
      30,
      2012 of 100% of the principal amount of the 8 3/8% senior second lien notes
      redeemed plus in each case accrued and unpaid interest.

In
      the
      event of specified change of control events, Charter Operating must offer to
      purchase the Charter Operating notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the
      total principal amount of the Charter Operating notes repurchased plus any
      accrued and unpaid interest thereon.

Renaissance
      Notes

In
      March
      2006, the Company exchanged $37 million of Renaissance Media Group LLC 10%
      senior discount notes due 2008 for $37 million principal amount of new Charter
      Operating 8 3/8% senior second-lien notes due 2014 issued in a private
      transaction. The terms and conditions of the new Charter Operating 8 3/8% senior
      second-lien notes due 2014 are identical to Charter Operating’s currently
      outstanding 8 3/8% senior second-lien notes due 2014. In June 2006, the Company
      retired the remaining $77 million principal amount of Renaissance Media Group
      LLC’s 10% senior discount notes due 2008.

Charter
      Operating Credit Facilities

The
      Charter Operating credit facilities provide borrowing availability of up to
      $6.85 billion as follows:

·

term
                facility with a total principal amount of $5.0 billion, repayable in
                23 equal quarterly installments, commencing September 30, 2007 and
                aggregating in each loan year to 1% of the original amount of the
                term
                facility, with the remaining balance due at final maturity in
                2013;

·

a
                revolving credit facility of $1.5 billion, with a maturity date in
                2010; and

·

a
                revolving credit facility (the “R/T Facility”) of $350.0 million,
                that converts to term loans no later than April 2007, repayable on
                the
                same terms as the term facility described
                above.

Amounts
      outstanding under the Charter Operating credit facilities bear interest, at
      Charter Operating’s election, at a base rate or the Eurodollar rate (5.36% to
      5.38% as of December 31, 2006 and 4.06% to 4.50% as of December 31, 2005),
      as
      defined, plus a margin. The margin prior to the amendment of the facility in
      April 2006 for Eurodollar loans was up to 3.00% for the Term A facility and
      revolving credit facility, and up to 3.25% for the Term B facility, and for
      base
      rate loans of up to 2.00% for the Term A facility and revolving credit facility,
      and up to 2.25% for the Term B facility. The margin on Eurodollar rate term
      loans after the amendment of the credit facilities in April 2006 is 2.625%
      and
      on base rate term loans is 1.625%. The margin on revolving credit facility
      Eurodollar rate loans is

3.00%
      and
      2.00% on base rate loans. A quarterly commitment fee of up to .75% is payable
      on
      the average daily unborrowed balance of the revolving credit facility and,
      until
      converted into term loans, the R/T facility.

The
      obligations of Charter Operating under the Charter Operating credit facilities
      (the “Obligations”) are guaranteed by Charter Operating’s immediate parent
      company, CCO Holdings, and the subsidiaries of Charter Operating, except for
      certain subsidiaries (the “non-guarantor subsidiaries”).  The Obligations
      are also secured by (i) a lien on all of the assets of Charter Operating and
      its
      subsidiaries (other than assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries), and (ii)
      a
      pledge by CCO Holdings of the equity interests owned by it in Charter Operating,
      as well as intercompany obligations owing to it by Charter Operating.

As
      of
      December 31, 2006, outstanding borrowings under the Charter Operating credit
      facilities were approximately $5.4 billion and the unused total potential
      availability was approximately $1.3 billion,

although
      the actual availability at that time was only $1.1 billion because of limits
      imposed by covenant restrictions

.

Charter
      Operating Credit Facilities — Restrictive Covenants

The
      Charter Operating credit facilities contain representations and warranties,
      and
      affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type. The
      financial covenants measure performance against standards set for leverage
      and
      interest coverage, to be tested as of the end of each quarter. Additionally,
      the
      Charter Operating credit facilities contain provisions requiring mandatory
      loan
      prepayments under specific circumstances, including in connection with certain
      sales of assets

,
      so long
      as the proceeds have not been reinvested in the business

.

The
      Charter Operating credit facilities permit Charter Operating and its
      subsidiaries to make distributions to pay interest on the Charter convertible
      notes, the CCHC note, the Charter Holdings notes, the CIH notes, the CCH I
      notes, the CCH II notes, the CCO Holdings notes, the CCHC note and the Charter
      Operating senior second-lien notes provided that, among other things, no default
      has occurred and is continuing under the Charter Operating credit facilities.
      Conditions to future borrowings include absence of a default or an event of
      default under the Charter Operating credit facilities, and the continued
      accuracy in all material respects of the representations and warranties.

Note
      Payable - Related Party

CCHC,
      LLC Note

In
      October 2005, Charter, acting through a Special Committee of Charter’s Board of
      Directors, and Mr. Allen, settled a dispute that had arisen between the parties
      with regard to the ownership of CC VIII. As part of that settlement, CCHC issued
      a subordinated exchangeable note (the “CCHC Note”) to

Charter
      Investment, Inc. (“CII”)

.
      The
      CCHC Note has a 15-year maturity. The CCHC Note has an initial accreted value
      of
      $48 million accreting at 14% compounded quarterly, except that from and after
      February 28, 2009, CCHC may pay any increase in the accreted value of the CCHC
      Note in cash and the accreted value of the CCHC Note will not increase to the
      extent such amount is paid in cash. The CCHC Note is exchangeable at CII’s
      option, at any time, for Charter Holdco Class A Common units at a rate equal
      to
      the then accreted value, divided by $2.00 (the “Exchange Rate”). Customary
      anti-dilution protections have been provided that could cause future changes
      to
      the Exchange Rate. Additionally, the Charter Holdco Class A Common units
      received will be exchangeable by the holder into Charter Class B common stock
      in
      accordance with existing agreements between CII, Charter and certain other
      parties signatory thereto. Beginning February 28, 2009, if the closing price
      of
      Charter common stock is at or above the Exchange Rate for a certain period
      of
      time as specified in the Exchange Agreement, Charter Holdco may require the
      exchange of the CCHC Note for Charter Holdco Class A Common units at the
      Exchange Rate. Additionally, CCHC has the right to redeem the CCHC Note under
      certain circumstances for cash in an amount equal to the then accreted value,
      such amount, if redeemed prior to February 28, 2009, would also include a make
      whole up to the accreted value

Minority
      Interest and Equity Interest of Charter Holdco

Charter
      is a holding company whose primary assets are a controlling equity interest
      in
      Charter Holdco, the indirect owner of the Company’s cable systems, and $413
      million and $863 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, of mirror
      notes that are payable by Charter Holdco to Charter and have the same principal
      amount and terms as those of Charter’s convertible senior notes. Minority
      interest on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2006
      and 2005 primarily represents preferred membership interests in CC VIII, an
      indirect subsidiary of Charter Holdco, of $192 million and $188 million,
      respectively. As more fully described in

Note
      22,
      this preferred interest is held by Mr. Allen, Charter’s Chairman and controlling
      shareholder, and CCH I. Approximately 5.6% of CC VIII’s income is allocated to
      minority interest.

Minority
      interest historically included the portion of Charter Holdco’s member’s equity
      not owned by Charter. However, members’ deficit of Charter Holdco was $5.9
      billion, $4.8 billion, and $4.4 billion as of December 31, 2006, 2005, and
      2004,
      respectively, thus minority interest in Charter Holdco has been eliminated.
      Minority ownership, for accounting purposes, was 48%, 52%, and 53% as of
      December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Because minority interest
      in
      Charter Holdco is substantially eliminated, Charter absorbs all losses of
      Charter Holdco. Subject to any changes in Charter Holdco’s capital structure,
      future losses will continue to be absorbed by Charter for GAAP purposes. Changes
      to minority interest consist of the following for the periods presented:

Preferred
      Stock - Redeemable

In
      November 2005, Charter repurchased 508,546 shares of its Series A Convertible
      Redeemable Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Stock”) for an aggregate purchase
      price of approximately $31 million (or $60 per share). The shares had
      liquidation preference of approximately $51 million and had accrued but unpaid
      dividends of approximately $3 million resulting in a gain of approximately
      $23
      million recorded in gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt and preferred stock.
      Following the repurchase, 36,713 shares of preferred stock remained outstanding.
      The remaining Preferred Stock is redeemable by Charter at its option and must
      be
      redeemed by Charter at any time upon a change of control, or if not previously
      redeemed or converted, on August 31, 2008. The Preferred Stock is convertible,

      of
      common stock, at an initial conversion price of $24.71 per share of common
      stock, subject to certain customary adjustments.

In
      connection with the repurchase, the holders of the Preferred Stock consented
      to
      an amendment to the Certificate of Designation governing the Preferred Stock
      that eliminated the quarterly dividends on all of the outstanding Preferred
      Stock and provided that the liquidation preference for the remaining shares
      outstanding will be $105.4063 per share, which amount shall accrete from
      September 30, 2005 at an annual rate of 7.75%, compounded quarterly. Certain
      holders of Preferred Stock also released Charter from various threatened claims
      relating to their acquisition and ownership of the Preferred Stock, including
      threatened claims for breach of contract.

Common
      Stock

The
      Company's Class A common stock and Class B common stock are identical except
      with respect to certain voting, transfer and conversion rights. Holders of
      Class
      A common stock are entitled to one vote per share and

holder
      of
      Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes for each share of Class B common
      stock held and for each Charter Holdco membership unit held. The Class B common
      stock is subject to significant transfer restrictions and is convertible on
      a
      share for share basis into Class A common stock at the option of the holder.
      Charter Holdco membership units are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis for
      shares of Class B common stock.

Charter
      issued 45 million shares of Class A Common Stock in September 2006 in connection
      with the Charter, CCHC and CCH II exchange. See Note 2.

The
      following table summarizes our share activity for the three years ended December
      31, 2006:

Charter
      issued 22.0 million and 94.9 million shares of Class A common stock during
      and 2005, respectively, in public offerings. The shares were issued pursuant
      to
      the share lending agreement, pursuant to which Charter had previously agreed
      to
      loan up to 150 million shares to Citigroup Global Markets Limited ("CGML").
      As
      of December 31, 2006, 77.1 million shares had been returned under the share
      lending agreement.

(dollars

These
      offerings of Charter’s Class A common stock were conducted to facilitate
      transactions by which investors in Charter’s 5.875% convertible senior notes due
      2009, issued on November 22, 2004, hedged their investments in the convertible
      senior notes. Charter did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of
      this
      Class A common stock. However, under the share lending agreement, Charter
      received a loan fee of $.001 for each share that it lends to CGML.

The
      issuance of 116.9 million shares pursuant to this share lending agreement is
      essentially analogous to a sale of shares coupled with a forward contract for
      the reacquisition of the shares at a future date. An instrument that requires
      physical settlement by repurchase of a fixed number of shares in exchange for
      cash is considered a forward purchase instrument. While the share lending
      agreement does not require a cash payment upon return of the shares, physical
      settlement is required (i.e., the shares borrowed must be returned at the end
      of
      the arrangement). The fair value of the 39.8 million loaned shares outstanding
      is approximately $122 million as of December 31, 2006. However, the net effect
      on shareholders’ deficit of the shares lent pursuant to the share lending
      agreement, which includes Charter’s requirement to lend the shares and the
      counterparties’ requirement to return the shares, is de

minimis
      and represents the cash received upon lending of the shares and is equal to
      the
      par value of the common stock to be issued.

Certain
      marketable equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported

      Additionally, the Company reports changes in the fair value of interest rate
      agreements designated as hedging the variability of cash flows associated with
      floating-rate debt obligations, that meet the effectiveness criteria of SFAS

      billion, respectively.

15.

Accounting
      for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

The
      Company uses interest rate risk management derivative instruments, such as
      interest rate swap agreements and interest rate collar agreements (collectively
      referred to herein as interest rate agreements) to manage its interest costs.
      The Company’s policy is to manage interest costs using a mix of fixed and
      variable rate debt. Using interest rate swap agreements, the Company has agreed
      to exchange, at specified intervals through 2007, the difference between fixed
      and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional
      principal amount. Interest rate collar agreements are used to limit the
      Company’s exposure to and benefits from interest rate fluctuations on variable
      rate debt to within a certain range of rates.

The
      Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes.
      The
      Company does, however, have certain interest rate derivative instruments that
      have been designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Such instruments
      effectively convert variable interest payments on certain debt instruments
      into
      fixed payments. For qualifying hedges, SFAS No. 133 allows derivative gains
      and losses to offset related results on hedged items in the consolidated
      statement of operations. The Company has formally documented, designated and

other
      income, net

includes
      gains of $2 million, $3 million and $4 million, respectively, which represent
      cash flow hedge ineffectiveness on interest rate hedge agreements arising from
      differences between the critical terms of the agreements and the related hedged
      obligations. Changes in the fair value of interest rate agreements designated
      as
      hedging instruments of the variability of cash flows associated with
      floating-rate debt obligations that meet the effectiveness criteria specified
      by
      SFAS No. 133 are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss. For the
      years
      ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, a loss of $1 million and gains of
      $16
      million and $42 million, respectively, related to derivative instruments
      designated as cash flow hedges, were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
      loss and minority interest. The amounts are subsequently reclassified into
      interest expense as a yield adjustment in the same period in which the related
      interest on the floating-rate debt obligations affects earnings (losses).

Certain
          interest rate derivative instruments are not designated as hedges as they
          do not
          meet the effectiveness criteria specified by SFAS No. 133. However,
          management believes such instruments are closely correlated with the respective
          debt, thus managing associated risk. Interest rate derivative instruments

includes
          gains of $4 million, $47 million, and $65 million, respectively, for interest

As
      of
      December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, the Company had outstanding $1.7
      billion, $1.8 billion, and $2.7 billion and $0, $20 million, and
      $20 million, respectively, in notional amounts of interest rate swaps and
      collars, respectively. The notional amounts of interest rate instruments do
      not
      represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, thus, are not a measure of
      exposure to credit loss. The amounts exchanged are determined by reference
      to
      the notional amount and the other terms of the contracts.

Fair
      Value of Financial Instruments

The
      Company has estimated the fair value of its financial instruments as of
      December 31, 2006 and 2005 using available market information or other
      appropriate valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment, however, is required
      in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly,
      the estimates presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements
      are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company would realize in
      a
      current market exchange.

The
      carrying amounts of cash, receivables, payables and other current assets and
      liabilities approximate fair value because of the short maturity of those
      instruments. The Company is exposed to market price risk volatility with respect
      to investments in publicly traded and privately held entities.

The
      fair
      value of interest rate agreements represents the estimated amount the Company
      would receive or pay upon termination of the agreements. Management believes
      that the sellers of the interest rate agreements will be able to meet their
      obligations under the agreements. In addition, some of the interest rate
      agreements are with certain of the participating banks under the Company’s
      credit facilities, thereby reducing the exposure to credit loss. The Company
      has
      policies regarding the financial stability and credit standing of major
      counterparties. Nonperformance by the counterparties is not anticipated nor
      would it have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
      condition or results of operations.

The
      estimated fair value of the Company’s notes and interest rate agreements at
      December 31, 2006 and 2005 are based on quoted market prices, and the fair
      value of the credit facilities is based on dealer quotations.

Stock
      Compensation Plans

The
      Company has stock option plans (the “Plans”) which provide for the grant of
      non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalent
      rights, performance units and performance shares, share awards, phantom stock
      and/or shares of restricted stock (not to exceed 20,000,000 shares of Charter
      Class A common stock), as each term is defined in the Plans. Employees,
      officers, consultants and directors of the Company and its subsidiaries and
      affiliates are eligible to receive grants under the Plans. Options granted
      generally vest over four to five years from the grant date, with 25% generally
      vesting on the anniversary of the grant date and ratably thereafter. Generally,
      options expire 10 years from the grant date. The Plans allow for the
      issuance of up to a total of 90,000,000 shares of Charter Class A common
      stock (or units convertible into Charter Class A common stock).

In
      the
      years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, certain directors were awarded
      a
      total of 574,543, 492,225 and 182,932 shares, respectively, of restricted Class
      A common stock of which 34,239 shares had been cancelled as of December 31,
      2006. The shares vest one year from the date of grant. In 2006, 2005 and 2004,
      in connection with new employment agreements, certain officers were awarded
      100,000, 2,987,500 and 50,000 shares, respectively, of restricted Class A common
      stock of which 50,000 shares had been cancelled as of December 31, 2006. The
      shares

vest
      annually over a one to three-year period beginning from the date of grant.
      As of
      December 31, 2006, deferred compensation remaining to be recognized in future
      periods totaled $12 million.

A

The
        following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding and
        exercisable as of December 31, 2006:

In
      2004,
      the Company completed an option exchange program in which the Company offered
      its employees the right to exchange all stock options (vested and unvested)
      under the 1999 Charter Communications Option Plan and 2001 Stock Incentive
      Plan
      that had an exercise price over $10 per share for shares of restricted Charter
      Class A common stock or, in some instances, cash.

The

offer
      applied to options (vested and unvested) to purchase a total of 22,929,573
      shares of Class A common stock, or approximately 48% of the Company's 47,882,365
      total options issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2003. Participation
      by
      employees was voluntary. Those members of the Company's board of directors
      who
      were not also employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries were not
      eligible to participate in the exchange offer.

The
      Company accepted for cancellation eligible options to purchase approximately
      18,137,664 shares of its Class A common stock. In exchange, the Company granted
      1,966,686 shares of restricted stock, including 460,777 performance shares
      to
      eligible employees of the rank of senior vice president and above, and paid
      a
      total cash amount of approximately $4 million (which amount includes applicable
      withholding taxes) to those employees who received cash rather than shares
      of
      restricted stock.

The
      cost
      to the Company of the stock option exchange program was approximately $10
      million, with a 2004 cash compensation expense of approximately $4 million
      and a
      non-cash compensation expense of approximately $6 million to be expensed ratably
      over the three-year vesting period of the restricted stock in the
      exchange.

In
      January 2004, the Compensation Committee of the board of directors of Charter
      approved Charter's Long-Term Incentive Program (“LTIP”), which is a program
      administered under the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan. Under the LTIP, employees
      of
      Charter and its subsidiaries whose pay classifications exceed

a
      certain
      level are eligible to receive stock options, and more senior level employees
      are
      eligible to receive stock options and performance shares. The stock options
      vest
      25% on each of the first four anniversaries of the date of grant. The
      performance shares vest on the third anniversary of the grant date and shares
      of
      Charter Class A common stock are issued, conditional upon Charter's performance
      against financial performance measures established by Charter’s management and
      approved by its board of directors as of the time of the award. Charter granted
      10.0 million shares in the year ended December 31, 2006 under this program,
      respectively, and recognized expense of $4 million. In 2005 and 2004, Charter
      granted 3.2 million and 6.9 million shares under this program and recognized
      no
      expense in 2005 or 2004 based on the Company’s assessment of the probability of
      achieving the financial performance measures established by Charter and required
      to be met for the performance shares to vest. In February 2006, the Compensation
      and Benefits Committee of Charter’s Board of Directors approved a modification
      to the financial performance measures under Charter's LTIP required to be met
      for the 2005 performance shares to vest. Such expense is being recognized over
      the remaining two year service period.

Income
        Taxes

All
      operations are held through Charter Holdco and its direct and indirect
      subsidiaries. Charter Holdco and the majority of its subsidiaries are not
      subject to income tax. However, certain of these subsidiaries are corporations
      and are subject to income tax. All of the taxable income, gains, losses,
      deductions and credits of Charter Holdco are passed through to its members:
      Charter, Charter Investment, Inc. (“CII”) and Vulcan Cable III Inc. (“Vulcan
      Cable”). Charter is responsible for its share of taxable income or loss of
      Charter Holdco allocated to Charter in accordance with the Charter Holdco
      limited liability company agreement (the “LLC Agreement”) and partnership tax
      rules and regulations. Charter also records financial statement deferred tax
      assets and liabilities related to its investments in Charter
      Holdco.

The
      LLC
      Agreement provides for certain special allocations of net tax profits and net
      tax losses (such net tax profits and net tax losses being determined under
      the
      applicable federal income tax rules for determining capital accounts). Under
      the
      LLC Agreement, through the end of 2003, net tax losses of Charter Holdco that
      would otherwise have been allocated to Charter based generally on its percentage
      ownership of outstanding common units were allocated instead to membership
      units
      held by Vulcan Cable and CII (the “Special Loss Allocations”) to the extent of
      their respective capital account balances. Since 2003, under the LLC Agreement,
      net tax losses of Charter Holdco are to be allocated to Charter, Vulcan Cable
      and CII based generally on their respective percentage ownership of outstanding
      common units to the extent of their respective capital account balances.
      Allocations of net tax losses in excess of the members’ aggregate capital
      account balances are allocated under the rules governing Regulatory Allocations,
      as described below. Subject to the Curative Allocation Provisions described
      below, the LLC Agreement further provides that, beginning at the time Charter
      Holdco generates net tax profits, the net tax profits that would otherwise
      have
      been allocated to Charter based generally on its percentage ownership of
      outstanding common membership units will instead generally be allocated to
      Vulcan Cable and CII (the “Special Profit Allocations”). The Special Profit
      Allocations to Vulcan Cable and CII will generally continue until the cumulative
      amount of the Special Profit Allocations offsets the cumulative amount of the
      Special Loss Allocations. The amount and timing of the Special Profit
      Allocations are subject to the potential application of, and interaction with,
      the Curative Allocation Provisions described in the following paragraph. The
      LLC
      Agreement generally provides that

any
      additional net tax profits are to be allocated among the members of Charter
      Holdco based generally on their respective percentage ownership of Charter
      Holdco common membership units.

Because
      the respective capital account balance of each of Vulcan Cable and CII was
      reduced to zero by December 31, 2002, certain net tax losses of Charter Holdco
      that were to be allocated for 2002, 2003, 2004 and

2005,
      to
      Vulcan Cable and CII instead have been allocated to Charter (the “Regulatory
      Allocations”). As a result of the allocation of net tax losses to Charter in
      2005, Charter’s capital account balance was reduced to zero during 2005. The LLC
      Agreement provides that once the capital account balances of all members have
      been reduced to zero, net tax losses are to be allocated to Charter, Vulcan
      Cable and CII based generally on their respective percentage ownership of
      outstanding common units. Such allocations are also considered to be Regulatory
      Allocations. The LLC Agreement further provides that, to the extent possible,
      the effect of the Regulatory Allocations is to be offset over time pursuant
      to
      certain curative allocation provisions (the “Curative Allocation Provisions”) so
      that, after certain offsetting adjustments are made, each member's capital
      account balance is equal to the capital account balance such member would have
      had if the Regulatory Allocations had not been part of the LLC Agreement. The
      cumulative amount of the actual tax losses allocated to Charter as a result
      of
      the Regulatory Allocations through the year ended December 31, 2006 is
      approximately $4.1 billion.

As
      a
      result of the Special Loss Allocations and the Regulatory Allocations referred
      to above (and their interaction with the allocations related to assets
      contributed to Charter Holdco with differences between book and tax basis),
      the
      cumulative amount of losses of Charter Holdco allocated to Vulcan Cable and

CII

is in
      excess of the amount that would have been allocated to such entities if the
      losses of Charter Holdco had been allocated among its members in proportion
      to
      their respective percentage ownership of Charter Holdco common membership units.
      The cumulative amount of such excess losses was approximately $1 billion through
      December 31, 2006.

In
      certain situations, the Special Loss Allocations, Special Profit Allocations,
      Regulatory Allocations and Curative Allocation Provisions described above could
      result in Charter paying taxes in an amount that is more or less than if Charter
      Holdco had allocated net tax profits and net tax losses among its members based
      generally on the number of

common
        membership units owned by such members. This could occur due to differences
        in
        (i) the character of the allocated income (e.g., ordinary versus capital),
        (ii) the allocated amount and timing of tax depreciation and tax
        amortization expense due to the application of section 704(c) under the Internal
        Revenue Code, (iii) the potential interaction between the Special Profit
        Allocations and the Curative Allocation Provisions, (iv) the amount and timing
        of alternative minimum taxes paid by Charter, if any, (v) the apportionment
        of the allocated income or loss among the states in which Charter Holdco
        does
        business, and (vi) future federal and state tax laws. Further, in the event
        of new capital contributions to Charter Holdco, it is possible that the tax
        effects of the Special Profit Allocations, Special Loss Allocations, Regulatory
        Allocations and Curative Allocation Provisions will change significantly
        pursuant to the provisions of the income tax regulations or the terms of
        a
        contribution agreement with respect to such contribution. Such change could
        defer the actual tax benefits to be derived by Charter with respect to the
        net
        tax losses allocated to it or accelerate the actual taxable income to Charter
        with respect to the net tax profits allocated to it. As a result, it is possible
        under certain circumstances, that Charter could receive future allocations
        of
        taxable income in excess of its currently allocated tax deductions and available
        tax loss carryforwards. The ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards
        is potentially subject to certain limitations as discussed below.

In
      addition, under their exchange agreement with Charter, Vulcan Cable and CII
      have
      the right at anytime to exchange some or all of their membership units in
      Charter Holdco for Charter’s Class B common stock, be merged with Charter
      in exchange for Charter’s Class B common stock, or be acquired by Charter in a
      non-taxable reorganization in exchange for Charter’s Class B common stock. If
      such an exchange were to take place prior to the date that the Special Profit
      Allocation provisions had fully offset the Special Loss Allocations, Vulcan
      Cable and CII could elect to cause Charter Holdco to make the remaining Special
      Profit Allocations to Vulcan Cable and CII immediately prior to the consummation
      of the exchange. In the event Vulcan Cable and CII choose not to make such
      election or to the extent such allocations are not possible, Charter would
      then
      be allocated tax profits attributable to the membership units received in such
      exchange pursuant to the Special Profit Allocation provisions. Mr. Allen
      has generally agreed to reimburse Charter for any incremental income taxes
      that
      Charter would owe as a result of such an exchange and any resulting future
      Special Profit Allocations to Charter. The ability of Charter to utilize net
      operating loss carryforwards is potentially subject to certain limitations
      as
      discussed below. If Charter were to become subject to certain limitations
      (whether as a result of an exchange described above or otherwise), and

as
      a
      result were to owe taxes resulting from the Special Profit Allocations, then
      Mr.
      Allen may not be obligated to reimburse Charter for such income
      taxes.

For
      the
      years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company recorded deferred
      income tax expense and benefits as shown below. The income tax expense is
      recognized through increases in deferred tax liabilities related to our
      investment in Charter Holdco, as well as through current federal and state
      income tax expense and increases in the deferred tax liabilities of certain
      of
      our indirect corporate subsidiaries. The income tax benefits were realized
      through reductions in the deferred tax liabilities related to Charter’s
      investment in Charter Holdco, as well as the deferred tax liabilities of certain
      of Charter’s indirect corporate subsidiaries. However, the actual tax provision
      calculation in future periods will be the result of current and future temporary
      differences, as well as future operating results.

As
      of
      December 31, 2006, the Company has deferred tax assets of $4.6 billion,
      which include $2.0 billion of financial losses in excess of tax losses allocated
      to Charter from Charter Holdco. The deferred tax assets also include $2.7
      billion of tax net operating loss carryforwards (generally expiring in years
      2007 through 2026) of Charter and its indirect corporate subsidiaries. Valuation
      allowances of $4.2 billion exist with respect to these deferred tax assets
      of
      which $2.2 billion relate to the tax net operating loss carryforwards.

The
      amount of any benefit from the Company’s tax net operating losses is dependent
      on: (1) Charter and its indirect corporate subsidiaries’ ability to generate
      future taxable income and (2) the impact of any future “ownership changes” of
      Charter's common stock. An “ownership change” as defined in the applicable
      federal income tax rules, would place significant limitations, on an annual
      basis, on the use of such net operating losses to offset any future taxable
      income the Company may generate. Such limitations, in conjunction with the
      net
      operating loss expiration provisions, could effectively eliminate the Company’s
      ability to use a substantial portion of its net operating losses to offset
      any
      future taxable income. Future transactions and the timing of such transactions
      could cause an ownership change. Such transactions include

the
      issuance of shares of common stock upon future conversion of Charter’s
      convertible senior notes, reacquisition of the shares borrowed under the share
      lending agreement by Charter (of which 77.1 million were returned through
      December 31, 2006), or acquisitions or sales of shares by certain holders of
      Charter’s shares, including persons who have held, currently hold, or accumulate
      in the future five percent or more of Charter’s outstanding stock (including
      upon an exchange by Mr. Allen or his affiliates, directly or indirectly, of
      membership units of Charter Holdco into CCI common stock). Many of the foregoing
      transactions, including whether Mr. Allen exchanges his Charter Holdco units,
      are beyond management’s control.

The
      deferred tax liability for Charter’s investment in Charter Holdco is largely
      attributable to the characterization of franchises for financial reporting
      purposes as indefinite lived. If certain exchanges, as described above, were
      to
      take place, Charter would likely record for financial reporting purposes
      additional deferred tax liability related to its increased interest in Charter
      Holdco and the related underlying indefinite lived franchise
      assets.

The
      total
      valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2006 and
      2005 was $4.2 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. In assessing the
      realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more

likely
      than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.
      Because of the uncertainties in projecting future taxable income of Charter
      Holdco, valuation allowances have been established except for deferred benefits
      available to offset certain deferred tax liabilities.

Charter
      Holdco is currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for the
      tax years ending December 31, 2003 and 2002.

In
      addition, one of the Company’s indirect corporate subsidiaries is under
      examination by the Internal Revenue Service for the tax year ended December
      31,
      2004.

The
      Company’s results (excluding Charter and its indirect corporate subsidiaries,
      with the exception of the indirect corporate subsidiary under examination)
      for
      these years are subject to this examination. Management does not expect the
      results of this examination to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
      consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

Related
      Party Transactions

The
      following sets forth certain transactions in which the Company and the
      directors, executive officers and affiliates of the Company are involved. Unless
      otherwise disclosed, management believes that each of the transactions described
      below was on terms no less favorable to the Company than could have been
      obtained from independent third parties.

Charter
      is a holding company and its principal assets are its equity interest in Charter
      Holdco and certain mirror notes payable by Charter Holdco to Charter and mirror
      preferred units held by Charter, which have the same principal amount and terms
      as those of Charter’s convertible senior notes and Charter’s outstanding
      preferred stock. In 2006, 2005 and 2004, Charter Holdco paid to Charter $51
      million, $64 million and $49 million, respectively, related to interest on
      the
      mirror notes, and Charter Holdco paid an additional $0, $3 million and $4
      million, respectively, related to dividends on the mirror preferred membership
      units. Further, during 2004 Charter Holdco issued 7,252,818 common membership
      units to Charter in cancellation of $30 million principal amount of mirror
      notes
      so as to mirror the issuance by Charter of Class A common stock in exchange
      for
      a like principal amount of its outstanding convertible notes.

Charter
      is a party to management arrangements with Charter Holdco and certain of its
      subsidiaries. Under these agreements, Charter and Charter Holdco provide
      management services for the cable systems owned or operated by their
      subsidiaries. The management services include such services as centralized
      customer billing services, data processing and related support, benefits
      administration and coordination of insurance coverage and self-insurance
      programs for medical, dental and workers’ compensation claims. Costs associated
      with providing these services are charged directly to the Company’s operating
      subsidiaries and are included within operating costs in the accompanying
      consolidated statements of operations. Such costs totaled $231 million, $205
      million, and $195 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and
      2004, respectively. All other costs incurred on the behalf of Charter’s
      operating subsidiaries are considered a part of the management fee and are
      recorded as a component of selling, general and administrative expense, in
      the
      accompanying consolidated financial statements. For the years ended
      December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, the management fee charged to the
      Company’s operating subsidiaries approximated the expenses incurred by Charter
      Holdco and Charter on behalf of the Company’s operating subsidiaries. The
      Company’s credit facilities prohibit payments of management fees in excess of
      3.5% of revenues until repayment of the outstanding indebtedness. In the event
      any portion of the management fee due and payable is not paid, it is deferred
      by
      Charter and accrued as a liability of such subsidiaries. Any deferred amount
      of
      the management fee will bear interest at the rate of 10% per year, compounded
      annually, from the date it was due and payable until the date it is paid.

Mr. Allen,
      the controlling shareholder of Charter, and a number of his affiliates have
      interests in various entities that provide services or programming to Charter’s
      subsidiaries. Given the diverse nature of Mr. Allen’s investment activities
      and interests, and to avoid the possibility of future disputes as to potential
      business, Charter and Charter Holdco, under the terms of their respective
      organizational documents, may not, and may not allow their subsidiaries to
      engage in any business transaction outside the cable transmission business
      except for certain existing approved investments. Charter or Charter Holdco
      or
      any of their subsidiaries may not pursue, or allow their subsidiaries to pursue,
      a business transaction outside of this scope, unless Mr. Allen consents to
      Charter or its subsidiaries engaging in the business transaction. The cable
      transmission business means the business of transmitting video, audio,

Mr. Allen
      or his affiliates own or have owned equity interests or warrants to purchase
      equity interests in various entities with which the Company does business or
      which provides it with products, services or programming. Among these entities
      are TechTV L.L.C. (“TechTV”), Oxygen Media Corporation (“Oxygen Media”), Digeo,
      Inc. (“Digeo”), Click2learn, Inc., Trail Blazer Inc., Action Sports Cable
      Network (“Action Sports”) and Microsoft Corporation. In May 2004, TechTV was
      sold to an unrelated third party. Mr. Allen owns 100% of the equity of
      Vulcan Ventures Incorporated (“Vulcan Ventures”) and Vulcan Inc. and is the
      president of Vulcan Ventures. Ms. Jo Allen Patton is a director and the
      President and Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Inc. and is a director and
      Vice
      President of Vulcan Ventures. Mr. Lance Conn is Executive Vice President of
      Vulcan Inc. and Vulcan Ventures. Mr. Savoy was a vice president and a director
      of Vulcan Ventures until his resignation in September 2003 and he resigned
      as a
      director of Charter in April 2004. The various cable, media, Internet and
      telephone companies in which Mr. Allen has invested may mutually benefit
      one another. The Company can give no assurance, nor should you expect, that
      any
      of these business relationships will be successful, that the Company will
      realize any benefits from these relationships or that the Company will enter
      into any business relationships in the future with Mr. Allen’s affiliated
      companies.

Mr. Allen
      and his affiliates have made, and in the future likely will make, numerous
      investments outside of the Company and its business. The Company cannot assure
      that, in the event that the Company or any of its subsidiaries enter into
      transactions in the future with any affiliate of Mr. Allen, such
      transactions will be on terms as favorable to the Company as terms it might
      have
      obtained from an unrelated third party. Also, conflicts could arise with respect
      to the allocation of corporate opportunities between the Company and
      Mr. Allen and his affiliates. The Company has not instituted any formal
      plan or arrangement to address potential conflicts of interest.

The
      Company received or receives programming for broadcast via its cable systems
      from TechTV (now G4), Oxygen Media and Trail Blazers Inc. The Company pays
      a fee
      for the programming service generally based on the number of customers receiving
      the service. Such fees for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and
      2004 were each less than 1% of total operating expenses.

TechTV.

The
      Company received from TechTV programming for distribution via its cable system
      pursuant to an affiliation agreement. In March 2004, Charter Holdco entered
      into
      agreements with Vulcan Programming and TechTV, which provided for, among other
      things, Vulcan Programming to pay approximately $10 million and purchase over
      a
      24-month period, at fair market rates, $2 million of advertising time across
      various cable networks on Charter cable systems in consideration of the
      agreements, obligations, releases and waivers under the agreements and in
      settlement of certain claims. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005,
      and
      2004, the Company recognized approximately $1 million, $1 million, and $5
      million, respectively, of the Vulcan Programming payment as an offset to
      programming expense.

Oxygen.

Oxygen
      Media LLC ("Oxygen") provides programming content to the Company pursuant to
      a
      carriage agreement. Under the carriage agreement, the Company paid Oxygen
      approximately $8 million, $9 million, and $13 million for the years ended
      December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. In addition, Oxygen paid the
      Company launch incentives for customers launched after the first year of the
      term of the carriage agreement up to a total of $4 million. The Company
      recorded approximately $0, $0.1 million, and $1 million related to these launch
      incentives as a reduction of programming expense for the years ended December
      31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

In
      2005,
      pursuant to an amended equity issuance agreement, Oxygen Media delivered 1
      million shares of Oxygen Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $33.10
      per share plus accrued dividends to Charter Holdco. The preferred stock is
      convertible into common stock after December 31, 2007 at a conversion ratio,
      the
      numerator of which is the liquidation preference and the denominator which
      is
      the fair market value per share of Oxygen Media common stock on the conversion
      date.

The
      Company recognized the guaranteed value of the investment over the life of
      the
      initial carriage agreement (which expired February 1, 2005) as a reduction
      of
      programming expense. For the years ended December 31, 2006,

2005,

      Company’s investment in Oxygen was approximately $33 million as of December 31,
      2006 and 2005.

Digeo,
      Inc

.
      In
      March 2001, Charter Ventures and Vulcan Ventures Incorporated formed DBroadband
      Holdings, LLC for the sole purpose of purchasing equity interests in Digeo.
      In
      connection with the execution of the broadband carriage agreement, DBroadband
      Holdings, LLC purchased an equity interest in Digeo funded by contributions
      from
      Vulcan Ventures Incorporated. At that time, the equity interest was subject
      to a
      priority return of capital to Vulcan Ventures up to the amount contributed
      by
      Vulcan Ventures on Charter Ventures’ behalf. After Vulcan Ventures recovered its
      amount contributed (the “Priority Return”), Charter Ventures should have had a
      100% profit interest in DBroadband Holdings, LLC. Charter Ventures was not
      required to make any capital contributions, including capital calls to
      DBroadband Holdings, LLC. DBroadband Holdings, LLC therefore was not included
      in
      the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Pursuant to an amended version
      of this arrangement, in 2003, Vulcan Ventures contributed a total of
      $29 million to Digeo, $7 million of which was contributed on Charter
      Ventures’ behalf, subject to Vulcan Ventures’ aforementioned priority return.
      Since the formation of DBroadband Holdings, LLC, Vulcan Ventures has contributed
      approximately $56 million on Charter Ventures’ behalf. On October 3, 2006,
      Vulcan Ventures and Digeo recapitalized Digeo. In connection with such
      recapitalization, DBroadband Holdings, LLC consented to the conversion of its
      preferred stock holdings in Digeo to common stock, and Vulcan Ventures
      surrendered its Priority Return to Charter Ventures. As a result, DBroadband
      Holdings, LLC is now included in the Company’s consolidated financial
      statements. Such amounts are immaterial. After the recapitalization, DBroadband
      Holdings, LLC owns 1.8% of Digeo, Inc’s common stock. Digeo, Inc. is therefore
      not included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

The
      Company paid Digeo Interactive approximately $2 million, $3 million, and $3
      million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively,
      for
      customized development of the i-channels and the local content tool kit.

On
      June
      30, 2003, Charter Holdco entered into an agreement with Motorola, Inc. for
      the
      purchase of 100,000 digital video recorder (“DVR”) units. The software for these
      DVR units is being supplied by Digeo Interactive, LLC under a license agreement
      entered into in April 2004. Pursuant to a software license agreement with Digeo
      Interactive for the right to use Digeo's proprietary software for DVR units,
      Charter paid approximately $3 million and $1 million in license and maintenance
      fees in 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Charter
      paid approximately $11 million, $10 million, and $1 million for the years ended
      December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, in capital purchases under
      an
      agreement with Digeo Interactive for the development, testing and purchase
      of
      70,000 Digeo PowerKey DVR units. Total purchase price and license and
      maintenance fees during the term of the definitive agreements are expected
      to be
      approximately $41 million. The definitive agreements are terminable at no
      penalty to Charter in certain circumstances.

      Limited Partnership in February 2000, CC VIII, Charter’s indirect limited
      liability company subsidiary, issued, after adjustments, the CC VIII
      interest with an initial value and an initial capital account of approximately
      $630 million to certain sellers affiliated with AT&T Broadband, subsequently
      owned by Comcast Corporation (the "Comcast sellers"). Mr. Allen
      granted the Comcast sellers the right to sell to him the CC VIII interest
      for approximately $630 million plus 4.5% interest annually from February
      2000 (the "Comcast put right"). In April 2002, the Comcast sellers exercised
      the
      Comcast put right in full, and this transaction was consummated on June 6,
      2003. Accordingly, Mr. Allen became the holder of the CC VIII
      interest, indirectly through an affiliate.

At
      such
      time through 2005, such interest was held at CC VIII and was subject to a
      dispute between Mr. Allen and the Company as to the ultimate ownership of the
      CC
      VIII interest. In 2005, Mr. Allen, a Special Committee of independent directors,
      Charter, Charter Holdco and certain of their affiliates, agreed to settle a
      dispute related to the CC VIII interest. Pursuant to the Settlement, CII has
      retained 30% of its CC VIII interest (the "Remaining Interests"). The Remaining
      Interests are subject to certain transfer restrictions, including requirements
      that the Remaining Interests participate in a sale with other holders or that
      allow other holders to participate in a sale of the Remaining Interests, as
      detailed in the revised CC VIII Limited Liability Company Agreement. CII
      transferred the

other
      70%
      of the CC VIII interest directly and indirectly, through Charter Holdco, to
      a
      newly formed entity, CCHC (a direct subsidiary of Charter Holdco and the direct
      parent of Charter Holdings). Of the 70% of the CC VIII interest, 7.4% has been
      transferred by CII to CCHC for the CCHC note (see Note 10). The remaining 62.6%
      has been transferred by CII to Charter Holdco, in accordance with the terms
      of
      the settlement for no additional monetary consideration. Charter Holdco
      contributed the 62.6% interest to CCHC.

As
      part
      of the Settlement, CC VIII issued approximately 49 million additional Class
      B
      units to CC V in consideration for prior capital contributions to CC VIII by
      CC
      V, with respect to transactions that were unrelated to the dispute in connection
      with CII’s membership units in CC VIII. As a result, Mr. Allen’s pro rata share
      of the profits and losses of CC VIII attributable to the Remaining Interests
      is
      approximately 5.6%.

As
      part
      of the debt exchange in September 2006 described in Note 2, CCHC contributed
      the
      CC VIII interest in the Class A preferred equity interests of CC VIII to CCH
      I.
      The CC VIII interest was pledged as security for all CCH I notes. The CC VIII
      preferred interests are entitled to a 2% accreting priority return on the
      priority capital.

Helicon.

In
      1999,
      the Company purchased the Helicon cable systems. As part of that purchase,
      Mr. Allen entered into a put agreement with a certain seller of the Helicon
      cable systems that received a portion of the purchase price in the form of
      a
      preferred membership interest in Charter Helicon, LLC with a redemption price
      of
      $25 million plus accrued interest. Under the Helicon put agreement, such
      holder had the right to sell any or all of the interest to Mr. Allen prior
      to its mandatory redemption in cash on July 30, 2009. On August 31,
      2005, 40% of the preferred membership interest was put to Mr. Allen. The
      remaining 60% of the preferred interest in Charter Helicon, LLC remained subject
      to the put to Mr. Allen. Such preferred interest was recorded in other
      long-term liabilities. On October 6, 2005, Charter Helicon, LLC redeemed all
      of
      the preferred membership interest for the redemption price of $25 million plus
      accrued interest.

Certain
      related parties, including members of the board of directors and officers,
      hold
      interests in the Company’s senior convertible debt and senior notes and discount
      notes of the Company’s subsidiary of approximately $203 million of face value at
      December 31, 2006.

      ten years, typically based on a flat fee per customer, which may be fixed for
      the term, or may in some cases escalate over the term. Programming costs
      included in the accompanying statement of operations were $1.5 billion, $1.4
      billion, and $1.3 billion, for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and

      agreements are based on a flat fee per month or have guaranteed minimum
      payments.  The table sets forth the aggregate guaranteed minimum
      commitments under

the Company's programming contracts.

(3)

“Other”
      represents other guaranteed minimum commitments, which consist primarily of
      commitments to the Company’s billing services vendors.

The
      following items are not included in the contractual obligation table due to
      various factors discussed below. However, the Company incurs these costs as
      part
      of its operations:

·

The
                Company also rents utility poles used in its operations. Generally,
                pole
                rentals are cancelable on short notice, but the Company anticipates
                that
                such rentals will recur. Rent expense incurred for pole rental attachments
                for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, was $44
                million, $44 million, and $42 million, respectively.

·

The
                Company pays franchise fees under multi-year franchise agreements
                based on
                a percentage of revenues generated from video service per year. The
                Company also pays other franchise related costs, such as public education
                grants, under multi-year agreements. Franchise fees and other
                franchise-related costs included in the accompanying statement of
                operations were $175 million, $165 million, and $159 million for
                the years
                ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004,
                respectively.

·

The
                Company also has $147 million in letters of credit, primarily to
                its
                various worker’s compensation, property and casualty, and general
                liability carriers, as collateral for reimbursement of claims. These
                letters of credit reduce the amount the Company may borrow under
                its
                credit facilities.

Litigation

In
      2004,
      the Company settled a series of lawsuits filed against Charter and certain
      of
      its former and present officers and directors (the “Settlement”). In general,
      the lawsuits alleged that Charter utilized misleading accounting practices
      and
      failed to disclose these accounting practices and/or issued false and misleading
      financial statements and press releases concerning Charter’s operations and
      prospects.

The
      Settlement provided that Charter would pay to the plaintiffs a combination
      of
      cash and equity collectively valued at $144 million, which was to include
      the fees and expenses of plaintiffs’ counsel. Charter elected to fund
      $80 million of the obligation with 13.4 million shares of Charter
      Class A common stock (having an aggregate value of approximately
      $15 million pursuant to the formula set forth in the Stipulations of
      Settlement) with the remaining balance (less an agreed upon $2 million
      discount in respect of that portion allocable to plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees)
      paid in cash. In addition, Charter paid approximately $5 million in cash to
      its insurance carrier. As a result in 2004, the Company recorded a $149 million
      litigation liability within other long-term liabilities and a $64 million
      insurance receivable as part of other non-current assets on its consolidated
      balance sheet and an $85 million special charge on its consolidated statement
      of
      operations. Charter delivered the settlement consideration to the claims
      administrator on July 8, 2005, and it was held in escrow pending resolution
      of the appeals. Those appeals are now resolved.

The
        Company is a defendant or co-defendant in several unrelated lawsuits claiming
        infringement of various patents relating to various aspects of its businesses.
        Other industry participants are also defendants in certain of these cases,
        and,
        in many cases, the Company expects that any potential liability would be
        the
        responsibility of its equipment vendors pursuant to applicable contractual
        indemnification provisions. In the event that a court ultimately determines
        that
        the Company infringes on any intellectual property rights, it may be subject
        to
        substantial damages and/or an injunction that could require the Company or
        its
        vendors to modify certain products and services the Company offers to its
        subscribers. While the Company believes the lawsuits are without merit and
        intends to defend the actions vigorously, the lawsuits could be material
        to the
        Company’s consolidated results of operations of any one period, and no assurance
        can be given that any adverse outcome would not be material to the Company’s
        consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

Charter
      is a party to other lawsuits and claims that arise in the ordinary course of
      conducting its business. The ultimate outcome of these other legal matters
      pending against the Company or its subsidiaries cannot be predicted, and
      although such lawsuits and claims are not expected individually to have a
      material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition,
      results of operations or liquidity, such lawsuits could have, in the aggregate,
      a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition,
      results of operations or liquidity.

Regulation
      in the Cable Industry

The
      operation of a cable system is extensively regulated by the Federal
      Communications Commission (“FCC”), some state governments and most local
      governments. The FCC has the authority to enforce its regulations through the
      imposition of substantial fines, the issuance of cease and desist orders and/or
      the imposition of other administrative sanctions, such as the revocation of
      FCC
      licenses needed to operate certain transmission facilities used in connection
      with cable operations. The 1996 Telecom Act altered the regulatory structure
      governing the nation’s communications providers. It removed barriers to
      competition in both the cable television market and the local telephone market.
      Among other things, it reduced the scope of cable rate regulation and encouraged
      additional competition in the video programming industry by allowing local
      telephone companies to provide video programming in their own telephone service
      areas.

Future
      legislative and regulatory changes could adversely affect the Company’s
      operations, including, without limitation, additional regulatory requirements
      the Company may be required to comply with as it offers new services such as
      telephone.

Employee
      Benefit Plan

The
      Company’s employees may participate in the Charter Communications, Inc. 401(k)
      Plan. Employees that qualify for participation can contribute up to 50% of
      their
      salary, on a pre-tax basis, subject to a maximum contribution limit as
      determined by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company matches 50% of the
      first
      5% of participant contributions. The Company made contributions to the 401(k)
      plan totaling $8 million, $6 million, and $7 million for the years ended
      December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

25.

Recently
      Issued Accounting Standards

In
      September 2006, the SEC issued SAB 108,

Considering
      the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in
      Current Year Financial Statements

,
      which
      addresses the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements in quantifying
      misstatements in current year financial statements. Misstatements are required
      to be quantified using both the balance-sheet (“iron-curtain”) and
      income-statement approach (“rollover”) and evaluated as to whether either
      approach results in a material error in light of quantitative and qualitative
      factors. SAB 108 is effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006
      and the Company adopted SAB 108 effective for the fiscal year ended December
      31,
      2006. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material impact on the Company’s
      financial statements.

In
      June
      2006, the FASB issued FIN 48,

Accounting
      for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an Interpretation of FASB Statement
      No. 109

,
      which
      provides criteria for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure
      of uncertain tax positions. A tax benefit from an uncertain position may be
      recognized only if it is “more likely than not” that the position is sustainable
      based on its technical merits. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning
      after December 15, 2006 and the Company will adopt FIN 48 effective January
      1,
      2007. The Company is currently assessing the impact of FIN 48 on its financial
      statements.

In
      September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157,

Fair
      Value Measurements

,
      which
      establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about
      fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
      November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company
      will adopt SFAS 157 effective January 1, 2008. The Company does not expect
      that
      the adoption of SFAS 157 will have a material impact on its financial
      statements.

In
      February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 159,

The

Fair
      Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities - Including an
      amendment of FASB Statement No. 115

,
      which
      allows measurement at fair value of eligible financial assets and liabilities
      that are not otherwise measured at fair value.  If the fair value option
      for an eligible item is elected, unrealized gains and losses for that item
      shall
      be reported in current earnings at each subsequent reporting date.  SFAS
      159 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to draw
      comparison between the different measurement attributes the company elects
      for
      similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years
      beginning after November 15, 2007.  Early adoption is permitted.  The
      Company is currently assessing the impact of SFAS 159 on its financial
      statements.

Charter
      does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective
      accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the
      Company’s accompanying financial statements.
