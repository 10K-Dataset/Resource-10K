PART I

Item 1.

Business.

Introduction

Charter Communications, Inc. (“Charter”) is a broadband communications company operating in the
United States, with approximately 6.22 million customers at December 31, 2004. Through our
broadband network of coaxial and fiber optic cable, we offer our customers traditional cable video
programming (analog and digital, which we refer to as “video” service), high-speed cable Internet
access (which we refer to as “high-speed data service”), advanced broadband cable services (such as
video on demand (“VOD”), high definition television service and interactive television) and, in
some of our markets, we offer telephone service (which we refer to as “telephony”). See “Business
— Products and Services” for further description of these terms, including “customers.”

At December 31, 2004, we served approximately 5.99 million analog video customers, of which
approximately 2.67 million were also digital video customers. We also served approximately 1.88
million high-speed data customers (including approximately 217,400 who received only high-speed
data services). We also provided telephony service to approximately 45,400 customers as of that
date.

At December 31, 2004, our investment in cable properties, long-term debt, accumulated deficit and
total shareholders’ deficit were $16.2 billion, $19.5 billion, $9.2 billion and $4.4 billion,
respectively. Our working capital deficit was $295 million at December 31, 2004. For the year
ended December 31, 2004, our revenues, net loss applicable to common stock and loss per common
share were approximately $5.0 billion, $4.3 billion and $14.47, respectively.

We have a history of net losses. Further, we expect to continue to report net losses for the
foreseeable future. Our net losses are principally attributable to insufficient revenue to cover
the interest costs we incur because of our high level of debt, the depreciation expenses that we
incur resulting from the capital investments we have made in our cable properties, and the
amortization and impairment of our franchise intangibles. We expect that these expenses (other
than impairment of franchises) will remain significant, and we therefore expect to continue to
report net losses for the foreseeable future. Additionally, because minority interest in Charter
Communications Holding Company, LLC (“Charter Holdco”) was substantially eliminated at December 31,
2003, beginning in the first quarter of 2004, we absorb substantially all future losses before
income taxes that otherwise would have been allocated to minority interest. This resulted in an
additional $2.4 billion of net loss for the year ended December 31, 2004. Under our existing
capital structure, future losses will continue to be absorbed by Charter.

Charter was organized as a Delaware corporation in 1999 and completed an initial public offering of
its Class A common stock in November 1999. Charter is a holding company whose principal assets are
an approximate 47% equity interest and a 100% voting interest in Charter Holdco, the direct parent
of Charter Communications Holdings, LLC (“Charter Holdings”). Charter also holds certain preferred
equity and indebtedness of Charter Holdco that mirror the terms of securities issued by Charter.
Charter’s only business is to act as the sole manager of Charter Holdco and its subsidiaries. As
sole manager, Charter controls the affairs of Charter Holdco and its subsidiaries. Certain of our
subsidiaries commenced operations under the “Charter Communications” name in 1994, and our growth
to date has been primarily due to acquisitions and business combinations, most notably acquisitions
completed from 1999 through 2001, pursuant to which we acquired a total of approximately 5.5
million customers. We do not expect to make any significant acquisitions in the foreseeable
future, but plan to evaluate opportunities to consolidate our operations through exchanges of cable
systems with other cable operators, as they arise. We may also sell certain assets from time to
time. Paul G. Allen owns 53% of Charter Holdco through affiliated entities. His membership units
are convertible at any time for shares of our Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. Paul G.
Allen controls Charter with an as-converted common equity interest of approximately 57% and a
voting control interest of 93% as of December 31, 2004.

Our principal executive offices are located at Charter Plaza, 12405 Powerscourt Drive, St. Louis,
Missouri 63131. Our telephone number is (314) 965-0555 and we have a website accessible at
www.charter.com. Since January 1, 2002, our annual reports, quarterly reports and current reports
on Form 8-K, and all amendments thereto, have been made available on our website free of charge as
soon as reasonably practicable after they have been filed. The information posted on our website
is not incorporated into this annual report.



Certain Significant Developments in 2004

In 2004, we completed several transactions that improved our liquidity. Our efforts in this regard
have resulted in the completion of a number of transactions in 2004, as follows:

Recent Events

CC V Holdings, LLC Notes

In February 2005, CC V Holdings, LLC called for redemption all of its outstanding notes, at
103.958% of principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the anticipated date of
redemption, on March 14, 2005. The total cost of redemption is expected to be approximately $122
million and is expected to be funded through borrowings under our credit facilities.

Management Changes

On January 17, 2005, Robert P. May was appointed as Interim President and Chief Executive Officer
of Charter, replacing Carl E. Vogel who, effective on the same date, resigned his position as
President, Chief Executive Officer and a member of the board of directors of Charter and each of
Charter’s subsidiaries for which Mr. Vogel served as a director and officer. Additionally, Mr. May
was appointed to the Executive Committee and the Finance Committee of Charter’s board of directors
and will continue to serve on the Board’s Strategic Planning Committee. He was also appointed as
an officer and director of Charter’s subsidiaries for which Mr. Vogel was an officer and director.

Charter’s board of directors has formed an Executive Search Committee to oversee Charter’s search
for a permanent President and Chief Executive Officer.

Derek
Chang, our Executive Vice President of Finance and Strategy and Interim
co-Chief Financial Officer, has informed Charter of his intention to
resign effective April 15, 2005.

Sale of CCO Holdings, LLC Senior Floating Rate Notes

On December 15, 2004, our subsidiaries, CCO Holdings, LLC and CCO Holdings Capital Corp., issued
and sold $550 million senior floating rate notes due 2010 in a private transaction to qualified
institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A and outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in
reliance on Regulation S. The notes have an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus 4.125%, reset and
payable quarterly. The net proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to pay down bank debt and
for general corporate purposes.

Sale of 5.875% Convertible Senior Notes

On November 22, 2004, we issued $862.5 million original principal amount of 5.875% convertible
senior notes due 2009, which are convertible into shares of our Class A common stock, par value
$.001 per share, at a rate of 413.2231 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes (or
approximately $2.42 per share), subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. On December 23,
2004, we used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the notes to redeem all of our outstanding
5.75% convertible senior notes due 2005 (total principal amount of $588 million). We also used a
portion of the proceeds from the sale of the notes to purchase certain U.S. government securities
which were pledged as security for the notes and which we expect to use to fund the first six
interest payments on the notes.

For additional terms of the notes, see “Description of Certain Indebtedness — Outstanding Notes —
Charter Communications, Inc. Notes — 5.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2009.’’



Focus for 2005

Our principal financial goal is to maximize our return on invested capital. To do so, we will
focus on increasing revenues, growing our customer base, improving customer retention and enhancing
customer satisfaction by providing reliable, high-quality service offerings, superior customer
service and attractive bundled offerings.

Specifically, in the near term, we are focusing on:

We
have begun an internal operational improvement initiative aimed at
helping us gain new customers and retain existing customers, which is
focused on customer care, technical operations and sales. We intend
to increase efforts to focus management attention on instilling a
customer service oriented culture throughout the company and to give
those areas of our operations increased priority of resources for
staffing levels, training budgets and financial incentives for
employee performance in those areas.

We believe that our high-speed data service will continue to provide a substantial portion of our
revenue growth in the near future. We also plan to continue to expand our marketing of high-speed
data service to the business community, which we believe has shown an increasing interest in
high-speed data service and private network services. Additionally, we plan to continue to prepare
additional markets for telephony launches in 2005.

We believe we offer our customers an excellent choice of services through a variety of bundled
packages, particularly with respect to our digital video and high-speed data services, as well as
telephony in certain markets. Our digital platform enables us to offer a significant number and
variety of channels, and we offer customers the opportunity to choose among groups of channel
offerings, including premium channels, and to combine selected programming with other services such
as high-speed data, high definition television (in selected markets) and VOD (in selected markets).



Organizational Structure

The chart below sets forth our organizational structure and that of our principal direct and
indirect subsidiaries. Equity ownership and voting percentages are actual percentages as of
December 31, 2004 and do not give effect to any exercise, conversion or exchange of options,
preferred stock, convertible notes or other convertible or exchangeable securities.



Charter Communications, Inc.

Certain provisions of Charter’s certification of incorporation and
Charter Holdco’s limited liability company agreement effectively require that Charter’s investment
in Charter Holdco replicate, on a “mirror” basis, Charter’s outstanding equity and debt structure.
As a result of these coordinating provisions, whenever Charter issues equity or debt, Charter
transfers the proceeds from such issuance to Charter Holdco, and Charter Holdco issues a “mirror”
security to Charter that replicates the characteristics of the security issued by Charter.
Consequently, Charter’s principal assets are an approximate 47% common equity interest and a 100%
voting interest in Charter Holdco, “mirror” notes that are payable by Charter Holdco to Charter
that have the same principal amount and terms as Charter’s convertible senior notes and preferred
units in Charter Holdco that mirror the terms and liquidation preferences of Charter’s outstanding
preferred stock. Charter Holdco, through its subsidiaries, owns cable systems and certain
strategic investments. As sole manager under applicable operating agreements, Charter controls the
affairs of Charter Holdco and most of its subsidiaries. In addition, Charter also provides
management services to Charter Holdco and its subsidiaries under a management services agreement.

groups of these operating subsidiaries, identified as follows: the Charter Operating subsidiaries,
the CC V/CC VIII companies, the CC VI companies, and the CC VII companies. The public notes
issuers, Renaissance Media Group and CC V Holdings, are within two of these groups and prior to
April 2004, each group of operating subsidiaries had a separate credit facility. The credit
facilities for the CC V/CC VIII companies, the CC VI companies and the CC VII companies were all

Video Services

Our video service offerings include the following:

High-Speed Data Services

We offer high-speed data services to our residential and commercial customers primarily via cable
modems attached to personal computers. We generally offer our high-speed data service as Charter
High-Speed Internet

TM

. We also offer traditional dial-up Internet access in a very
limited number of our markets.

We ended 2004 with 18% penetration of high-speed data homes passed, up from the 15% penetration of
high-speed data homes passed at year-end 2003. This gave us an annual percentage increase in
high-speed data customers of 20% and an increase in high-speed data revenues of 33% in the year
ended December 31, 2004.

Telephony Services

We continue to deploy voice communications services using VOIP to transmit digital voice signals
over our systems. At December 31, 2004, telephone service was available to approximately 900,000
homes, and we were marketing to approximately two-thirds of those
homes. We will continue to prepare
additional markets for VOIP launches in 2005.



Commercial Services

We offer integrated network solutions to commercial and institutional customers. These solutions
include high-speed data and video services. In addition, we offer high-speed data services to
small businesses.

Sale of Advertising

We receive revenues from the sale of local advertising on satellite-delivered networks such as
MTV®, CNN® and ESPN®. In any particular market, we generally insert local advertising on up to 39
channels. Our system rebuilds have increased the number of available channels on which we are able
to insert local advertising. We also provide cross-channel advertising to some programmers.

From time to time, certain of our vendors, including equipment vendors, have purchased advertising
from us. For the years ending December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, we had advertising revenues from
vendors of approximately $16 million, $15 million, and $79 million, respectively. These revenues
resulted from purchases at market rates pursuant to binding agreements.

Pricing of Our Products and Services

Our revenues are derived principally from the monthly fees our customers pay for the services we
offer. A one-time installation fee, which is sometimes waived or discounted during certain
promotional periods, is charged to new customers. The prices we charge vary based on the level of
service the customer chooses and the geographic market. Most of our pricing is reviewed and
adjusted on an annual basis.

In accordance with the Federal Communications Commission’s rules, the prices we charge for
cable-related equipment, such as set-top terminals and remote control devices, and for installation
services are based on actual costs plus a permitted rate of return.

Although our cable service offerings vary across the markets we serve because of various factors
including competition and regulatory factors, our services, when offered on a stand-alone basis,
are typically offered at monthly price ranges, excluding franchise fees and other taxes, as
follows:

As a result of the upgrade of our systems over the past several years, approximately 92% of our
homes passed are served by systems that have bandwidth of 550 megahertz or greater. This bandwidth
capacity enables us to offer digital television, high-speed data services and other advanced
services. It also enables us to offer up to 82 analog channels, and even more channels when our
bandwidth is used for digital signal transmissions. Our increased bandwidth also permits two-way
communication for Internet access, interactive services, and potentially, telephony services.

As part of our systems upgrade and partly as a result of system sales, we reduced the number of
headends that serve our customers from 1,138 at January 1, 2001 to 744 at December 31, 2004.
Because headends are the control centers of a cable system, where incoming signals are amplified,
converted, processed and combined for transmission to the customer, reducing the number of headends
reduces related equipment, service personnel and maintenance expenditures. We believe that the
headend consolidation, together with our other upgrades, allows us to provide enhanced picture
quality and greater system reliability. As a result of the upgrade, approximately 84% of our
customers were served by headends serving at least 10,000 customers as of December 31, 2004.

As of December 31, 2004, our cable systems consisted of approximately 222,100 strand miles,
including approximately 53,600 strand miles of fiber optic cable, passing approximately 12.1
million households and served approximately 6.2 million customers.

We adopted the hybrid fiber coaxial cable (“HFC”) architecture as the standard for our systems
upgrades. HFC architecture combines the use of fiber optic cable with coaxial cable. Fiber optic
cable is a communication medium that uses glass fibers to transmit signals over long distances with
minimum signal loss or distortion. Fiber optic cable has excellent broadband frequency
characteristics, noise immunity and physical durability and can carry hundreds of video, data and
voice channels over extended distances. Coaxial cable is less expensive and requires a more
extensive signal amplification in order to obtain the desired transmission levels for delivering
channels. In most systems, we deliver our signals via fiber optic cable from the headend to a
group of nodes, and use coaxial cable to deliver the signal from individual nodes to the homes
passed served by that node. Our system design enables a maximum of 500 homes passed to be served
by a single node. Currently, our average node serves approximately 385 homes passed. Our system
design provides for six strands of fiber to each node, with two strands activated and four strands
reserved for spares and future services. We believe that this hybrid network design provides high
capacity and superior signal quality. The design also provides reserve capacity for the addition
of future services.

The primary advantages of HFC architecture over traditional coaxial-only cable networks include:

•

increased bandwidth capacity, for more channels and other services;

•

dedicated bandwidth for two-way services, which avoids reverse signal
interference problems that can occur with two-way communication
capability; and

•

improved picture quality and service reliability.

We currently maintain a national network operations center to monitor our data networks and to
further our strategy of providing high quality service. Centralized monitoring is increasingly
important as we increase the number of high-speed data customers utilizing two-way high-speed data
service. Our local dispatch centers focus primarily on monitoring the HFC plant.

Management of Our Systems

Many of the functions associated with our financial management are centralized, including
accounting, billing, finance and acquisitions, payroll, accounts payable and benefit
administration, information system design and support, internal audit, purchasing, marketing,
programming contract administration and Internet service, network and circuits administration. We
operate with four divisions. Each division is supported by operational, financial, marketing and
engineering functions.

Customer Care

We have 36 customer service locations, including 14 divisional contact centers that serve
approximately 97% of our customers. Our customer care centers are managed divisionally by a Vice
President of Customer Care and are



supported by a corporate care team, which oversees and supports deployment and execution of care
strategies and initiatives on a company-wide basis. This reflects a substantial consolidation of
our customer care function from over 300 service centers in 2001. We believe that this
consolidation will allow us to improve the consistency of our service delivery and customer satisfaction by
reducing or eliminating the logistical challenges and poor economies of scale inherent in
maintaining and supervising a larger number of separately managed service centers.

Specifically, through this consolidation, we are now able to service our customers 24 hours a day,
seven days a week and utilize technologically advanced equipment that we believe enhances
interactions with our customers through more intelligent call routing, data management, and
forecasting and scheduling capabilities. We believe this consolidation also allows us to more
effectively provide our customer care specialists with ongoing training intended to improve
complaint resolution, equipment troubleshooting, sales of new and additional services, and customer
retention.

We
believe that, despite our consolidation, we have not yet sufficiently
improved in the area of customer care, and that this lack of
improvement has in part led to a continued net loss of customers.
Accordingly, we have begun an internal operational improvement
initiative aimed at helping us gain new customers and retain existing
customers, which is focused on customer care, among other areas. We
intend to increase our efforts to focus management attention on
instilling a customer service oriented culture throughout the company
and to give those areas of our operations increased priority of
resources for staffing levels, training budgets and financial
incentives for employee performance in those areas.

In a further effort to better serve our customers, we have also entered into outsource partnership
agreements with two key outsource providers. We believe the establishment of these relationships
expands our ability to achieve our service objectives and increases our ability to support
marketing activities by providing additional capacity available to support customer inquiries.

We also utilize our website to enhance customer care by enabling customers to view and pay their
bills online, obtain useful information and perform various equipment troubleshooting procedures.

Sales and Marketing

In the third quarter of 2004, Charter shifted primary responsibility for implementing sales and
marketing strategies to the divisional and system level, with a single corporate team to ensure
compliance with guidelines established by the corporate marketing department designed to promote
national branding consistency. Our marketing infrastructure is intended to promote interaction,
information flow and sharing of best practices between our corporate office and our field offices,
which make strategic decisions as to when and how marketing programs will be implemented.

Due to our focus in 2003 on certain other operational matters and due to certain financial
constraints, we reduced spending in 2003 on marketing our products and services. Marketing
expenditures increased 14% for the year ended December 31, 2004 to $122 million. We expect to
increase our spending on marketing in 2005.

We monitor government regulation, customer perception, competition, pricing and product
preferences, among other factors, to increase our responsiveness to our customers. Our coordinated
marketing strategies include door-to-door solicitation, telemarketing, media advertising,
e-marketing, direct mail solicitation and retail locations. In 2004, we increased our focus on
marketing and selling our services through consumer electronics retailers and other retailers that
sell televisions or cable modems.

In January 2004, we introduced the first national branding campaign in Charter’s history. The “Get
Hooked” branding initiative was a key focal point of our national marketing campaigns in 2004 with
the aim of promoting deeper market penetration and increased revenue per customer. In 2004, our
corporate team produced eight national “Get Hooked” marketing campaigns designed to:

•

Promote awareness and loyalty among existing customers and attract new customers;

•

Announce the availability of our advanced services as we roll them out in our systems;

•

Promote our advanced services (such as DVR, high definition television, telephony, VOD
and SVOD) with the goal that our customers will view their cable connection as one-stop
shopping for video, voice, high-speed data and interactive services; and

•

Promote our bundling of digital video and high-speed data services and pricing
strategies.

Programming

General

We believe that offering a wide variety of programming is an important factor that influences a
customer’s decision to subscribe to and retain our cable services. We rely on market research,
customer demographics and local programming preferences to determine channel offerings in each of
our markets. We obtain basic and premium



programming from a number of suppliers, usually pursuant to a written contract. Our programming
contracts generally continue for a fixed period of time, usually from three to ten years, and are
subject to negotiated renewal. Some program suppliers offer financial incentives to support the
launch of a channel and ongoing marketing support or launch fees. We also negotiate volume
discount pricing structures. Programming costs are usually payable each month based on
calculations performed by us and are subject to adjustment based on the results of periodic audits
by the programmers.

Costs

Programming tends to be made available to us for a license fee, which is generally paid based on
the number of customers to whom we make such programming available. Such license fees may include
“volume” discounts available for higher numbers of customers, as well as discounts for channel
placement or service penetration. Some channels are available without cost to us for a limited
period of time, after which we pay for the programming. For home shopping channels, we receive a
percentage of the amount our customers spend on home shopping purchases.

Our cable programming costs have increased, in every year we have operated, in excess of customary
inflationary and cost-of-living type increases. We expect them to continue to increase due to a
variety of factors, including: annual increases imposed by
programmers and additional programming being provided to customers as a result of
system rebuilds and bandwidth reallocation, both of which increase
channel capacity.

In particular, sports programming costs have increased significantly over the past several years.
In addition, contracts to purchase sports programming sometimes contain built-in cost increases for
programming added during the term of the contract.

Historically, we have absorbed increased programming costs in large part through increased prices
to our customers. However, with the impact of competition and other marketplace factors, there is
no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so. In order to maintain or mitigate
reductions of margins despite increasing programming costs, we plan to continue to migrate certain
program services from our analog level of service to our digital tiers. As we migrate our
programming to our digital tier packages, certain programming that was previously available to all
of our customers via an analog signal, may be part of an elective digital tier package. As a
result, the customer base upon which we pay programming fees will proportionately decrease, and the
overall expense for providing that service would likewise decrease. Reductions in the size of
certain programming customer bases may result in the loss of specific volume discount benefits.

As measured by programming costs, and excluding premium services (substantially all of which were
renegotiated and renewed in 2003), as of December 31, 2004 approximately 10% of our current
programming contracts were expired, and approximately another 34% are scheduled to expire by
the end of 2005. We plan to seek to renegotiate the terms of our agreements with certain
programmers as these agreements come due for renewal. There can be no assurance that these
agreements will be renewed on favorable or comparable terms. To the extent that we are unable to
reach agreement with certain programmers on terms that we believe are reasonable, we may be forced
to remove such programming channels from our line-up, which could result in a further loss of
customers. In addition, our inability to fully pass these programming cost increases on to our
customers would have an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating margins.

Franchises

As of December 31, 2004, our systems operated pursuant to a total of approximately 4,200
franchises, permits and similar authorizations issued by local and state governmental authorities.
Each franchise is awarded by a governmental authority and such governmental authority often must
approve a transfer to another party. Most franchises are subject to termination proceedings in the
event of a material breach. In addition, most franchises require us to pay the granting authority
a franchise fee of up to 5.0% of revenues as defined in the various agreements, which is the
maximum amount that may be charged under the applicable federal law. We are entitled to and
generally do pass this fee through to the customer.

Prior to the scheduled expiration of most franchises, we initiate renewal proceedings with the
granting authorities. This process usually takes three years but can take a longer period of time.
The Communications Act provides for an orderly franchise renewal process in which granting
authorities may not unreasonably withhold renewals. In



connection with the franchise renewal process, many governmental authorities require the cable
operator to make certain commitments. Historically we have been able to renew our franchises
without incurring significant costs, although any particular franchise may not be renewed on
commercially favorable terms or otherwise. Our failure to obtain renewals of our franchises,
especially those in the major metropolitan areas where we have the most customers, could have a
material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or our
liquidity, including our ability to comply with our debt covenants. Approximately 11% of our
franchises, covering approximately 10% of our analog video customers were expired at December 31,
2004. Approximately 8% of additional franchises, covering approximately 9% of additional analog
video customers will expire on or before December 31, 2005, if not renewed prior to expiration. We
expect to renew substantially all of these franchises.

Under the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the “1996 Telecom Act”), state and local authorities are
prohibited from limiting, restricting or conditioning the provision of telecommunications services.
They may, however, impose “competitively neutral” requirements and manage the public
rights-of-way. Granting authorities may not require a cable operator to provide telecommunications
services or facilities, other than institutional networks, as a condition of an initial franchise
grant, a franchise renewal, or a franchise transfer. The 1996 Telecom Act also limits franchise
fees to an operator’s cable-related revenues and clarifies that they do not apply to revenues that
a cable operator derives from providing new telecommunications services. In a March 2002 decision,
the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) held that revenue derived from the provision of cable
modem service should not be added to franchise fee payments already limited by federal law to 5% of
traditional cable service revenue. The same decision tentatively limited local franchising
authority regulation of cable modem service. On October 6, 2003, the United States Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit vacated in part the FCC’s March 2002 decision and remanded for
further proceedings. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the portion of the FCC’s March 2002 decision
holding that cable modem service is not a “cable service.” Although the Ninth Circuit’s decision
should not subject cable operators to additional cable franchise fee requirements for the provision
of cable modem service, it could possibly result in other telecommunications regulation.

Competition

We face competition in the areas of price, service offerings, and service reliability. We compete
with other providers of television signals and other sources of home entertainment. In addition,
as we continue to expand into additional services such as high-speed Internet access and telephony,
we face competition from other providers of each type of service. We operate in a very competitive
business environment, which can adversely affect our business and operations.

In terms of competition for customers, we view ourselves as a member of the broadband
communications industry, which encompasses multi-channel video for television and related broadband
services, such as high-speed data and other interactive video services. In the broadband industry,
our principal competitor for video services throughout our territory is direct broadcast satellite
(“DBS”), and in markets where it is available, our principal competitor for data services is
digital subscriber line (“DSL”). We do not consider other cable operators to be significant
one-on-one competitors in the market overall, as traditional overbuilds are infrequent and spotty
geographically (although in a particular market, a cable operator overbuilder would likely be a
significant competitor at the local level). As of December 31, 2004, we are aware of traditional
overbuild situations in service areas covering approximately 5% of our total homes passed and
potential overbuilds in areas servicing approximately 2% of our total homes passed.

Although cable operators tend not to be direct competitors for customers, their relative size may
affect the competitive landscape in terms of how a cable company competes against non-cable
competitors in the market place as well as in relationships with vendors who deal with cable
operators. For example, a larger cable operator might have better access to and pricing for the
multiple types of services cable companies offer. Also, a larger entity might have different
access to financial resources and acquisition opportunities.

Our key competitors include:

DBS

Direct broadcast satellite is a significant competitor to cable systems. The DBS industry has
grown rapidly over the last several years, far exceeding the growth rate of the cable television
industry, and now serves more than 24 million subscribers nationwide. DBS service allows the
subscriber to receive video services directly via satellite using a relatively small dish antenna.
Consistent with increasing consolidation in the communications industry, News Corp., one of the
world’s largest media companies, acquired a controlling interest in DIRECTV, Inc. (“DirecTV”) in
2003, the largest domestic DBS company. This business combination could further strengthen



DirecTV’s competitive posture, particularly through favorable programming arrangements with various
News Corp. affiliates and subsidiaries, such as the Fox television network. Additionally, EchoStar
and DirecTV both have entered into joint marketing agreements with major telecommunications
companies to offer bundled packages combining phone service, DSL and DBS services.

Video compression technology and high powered satellites allow DBS providers to offer more than 200
digital channels from a single transponder satellite, thereby surpassing the typical analog cable
system. In 2003, major DBS competitors offered a greater variety of channel packages, and were
especially competitive at the lower end pricing, such as a monthly price of approximately $30 for
75 channels compared to approximately $40 for the closest comparable package in most of our
markets. In addition, while we continue to believe that the initial investment by a DBS customer
exceeds that of a cable customer, the initial equipment cost for DBS has decreased substantially,
as the DBS providers have aggressively marketed offers to new customers of incentives for
discounted or free equipment, installation and multiple units. DBS providers are able to offer
service nationwide and are able to establish a national image and branding with standardized
offerings, which together with their ability to avoid franchise fees of up to 5% of revenues and
property tax, leads to greater efficiencies and lower costs in the lower tiers of service.
However, we believe that most consumers continue to prefer our stronger local presence in our
markets. We believe that cable-delivered VOD and SVOD service are superior to DBS service because
cable headends can store thousands of titles which customers can access and control independently,
whereas DBS technology can only make available a much smaller number of titles with DVR-like
customer control. We also believe that our higher tier products, particularly our bundled premium
packages, are price-competitive with DBS packages and that many consumers prefer our ability to
economically bundle video packages with data packages. Further, cable providers have the potential
in some areas to provide a more complete “whole house” communications package when combining video,
high-speed data and voice. We believe that this, combined with the introduction of more new
products that DBS cannot offer (local high definition television and local interactive television)
differentiates us from DBS competitors and could enable us to win back some of our former customers
who migrated to satellite. Recent joint marketing arrangements between DBS providers and
telecommunications carriers allow similar bundling of services in certain areas.

DBS companies historically were prohibited from retransmitting popular local broadcast programming.
However, a change to the copyright laws in 1999, which was continued in 2004, eliminated this
legal impediment. As a result, DBS companies now may retransmit such programming, once they have
secured retransmission consent from the popular broadcast stations they wish to carry, and honor
mandatory carriage obligations of less popular broadcast stations in the same television markets.
In response to the legislation, DirecTV and EchoStar have been carrying the major network stations
in many of the nation’s television markets. DBS, however, is limited in the local programming it
can provide because of the current capacity limitations of satellite technology. DBS companies do
not offer local broadcast programming in every U.S. market, although the number of markets covered
is increasing.

DBS providers have made attempts at widespread deployment of high-speed Internet access services
via satellite but those services have been technically constrained and of limited appeal. However,
DBS providers have entered into joint marketing arrangements with
telecommunications carriers
allowing them to offer terrestrial DSL services in many markets.

DSL and other Broadband Services

Digital subscriber line service allows Internet access to subscribers at data transmission speeds
greater than those available over conventional telephone lines. DSL service therefore is
competitive with high-speed Internet access over cable systems. Most telephone companies which
already have plant, an existing customer base, and other operational functions in place (such as,
billing, service personnel, etc.) offer DSL service. DSL actively markets its service and many
providers have offered promotional pricing with a one-year service agreement. The FCC has
initiated a rulemaking proceeding that could materially reduce existing regulation of DSL service,
essentially freeing such service from traditional telecommunications regulation. It is also
possible that federal legislation could reduce regulation of Internet services offered by incumbent
telephone companies. Legislative action and the FCC’s decisions and policies in this area are
subject to change. We expect DSL to remain a significant competitor to our data services. In
addition, the further deployment of fiber by telephone companies into their networks will enable
them to provide higher bandwidth Internet service than provided over traditional DSL lines.

DSL and other forms of high-speed Internet access provide competition to our high-speed data
service. For example, as discussed above, satellite-based delivery options are in development. In
addition, local wireless Internet services have recently begun to operate in many markets using
available unlicensed radio spectrum. This service option, popularly known as “wi-fi”, offers
another alternative to cable-based Internet access.



High-speed Internet access facilitates the streaming of video into homes and businesses. As the
quality and availability of video streaming over the Internet improves, video streaming likely will
compete with the traditional delivery of video programming services over cable systems. It is
possible that programming suppliers will consider bypassing cable operators and market their
services directly to the consumer through video streaming over the Internet.

We believe that pricing for residential and commercial data services on our system is generally
comparable to that for similar DSL services and that some residential customers prefer our ability
to bundle data services with video services. However, DSL providers may currently be in a better
position to offer data services to businesses since their networks tend to be more complete in
commercial areas. They also have the ability to bundle telephony with data services for a higher
percentage of their customers, and that ability is appealing to many consumers. Joint marketing
arrangements between DSL providers and DBS providers may allow some additional bundling of
services. Moreover, major telephone companies, such as SBC and Verizon, are now deploying fiber
deep into their networks that will enable them to offer high bandwidth video services over their
networks, in addition to established voice and Internet services.

Broadcast Television

Cable television has long competed with broadcast television, which consists of television signals
that the viewer is able to receive without charge using an “off-air” antenna. The extent of such
competition is dependent upon the quality and quantity of broadcast signals available through
“off-air” reception compared to the services provided by the local cable system. Traditionally,
cable television has provided a higher picture quality and more channel offerings than broadcast
television. However, the recent licensing of digital spectrum by the FCC will provide traditional
broadcasters with the ability to deliver high definition television pictures and multiple
digital-quality program streams, as well as advanced digital services such as subscription video
and data transmission.

Traditional Overbuilds

Cable systems are operated under non-exclusive franchises granted by local authorities. More than
one cable system may legally be built in the same area. It is possible that a franchising
authority might grant a second franchise to another cable operator and that such a franchise might
contain terms and conditions more favorable than those afforded us. In addition, entities willing
to establish an open video system, under which they offer unaffiliated programmers
non-discriminatory access to a portion of the system’s cable system, may be able to avoid local
franchising requirements. Well financed businesses from outside the cable industry, such as public
utilities that already possess fiber optic and other transmission lines in the areas they serve,
may over time become competitors. There are a number of cities that have constructed their own
cable systems, in a manner similar to city-provided utility services. There also has been interest
in traditional overbuilds by private companies. Constructing a competing cable system is a capital
intensive process which involves a high degree of risk. We believe that in order to be successful,
a competitor’s overbuild would need to be able to serve the homes and businesses in the overbuilt
area on a more cost-effective basis than we can. Any such overbuild operation would require either
significant access to capital or access to facilities already in place that are capable of
delivering cable television programming.

As of December 31, 2004, we are aware of overbuild situations impacting approximately 5% of our
total homes passed and potential overbuild situations in areas servicing approximately 2% of our
total homes passed. Additional overbuild situations may occur in other systems. In response to
such overbuilds, these systems have been designated priorities for the upgrade of cable plant and
the launch of new and enhanced services. As of December 31, 2004, we have upgraded many of these
systems to at least 750 megahertz two-way HFC architecture.

Telephone Companies and Utilities

The competitive environment has been significantly affected by technological developments and
regulatory changes enacted under the 1996 Telecom Act, which is designed to enhance competition in
the cable television and local telephone markets. Federal cross-ownership restrictions
historically limited entry by local telephone companies into the cable business. The 1996 Telecom
Act modified this cross-ownership restriction, making it possible for local exchange carriers, who
have considerable resources, to provide a wide variety of video services competitive with services
offered by cable systems.

Telephone companies can lawfully enter the cable television business, and although activity in this
area historically has been quite limited, recent announcements by telephone companies indicate a
growing interest in offering a video



product. Local exchange carriers do already provide facilities for the transmission and
distribution of voice and data services, including Internet services, in competition with our
existing or potential interactive services ventures and businesses. In addition, major telephone
companies, such as SBC and Verizon, are now deploying fiber into their networks that will enable
them to offer video services over their networks, in addition to established voice and Internet
services. Some telephone companies have begun more extensive deployment of fiber in their networks
that will enable them to begin providing video services, as well as telephony and Internet access
service. At least one major telephone company, SBC, plans to provide Internet protocol video over
its upgraded network. SBC contends that its use of this technology should allow it to provide
video service without a cable franchise as required under Title VI of the Communications Act.
Other telephone companies deploying fiber more extensively are attempting through various means to
weaken or streamline the franchising requirements applicable to them. If telephone companies are
successful in avoiding or weakening the franchise and other regulatory requirements applicable to
Charter, their competitive posture would be enhanced. We cannot predict the likelihood of success
of the broadband services offered by our competitors or the impact on us of such competitive
ventures. The large scale entry of major telephone companies as direct competitors in the video
marketplace could adversely affect the profitability and valuation of established cable systems.

As we expand our offerings to include Internet access and other telecommunications services, we
will be subject to competition from other telecommunications providers. The telecommunications
industry is highly competitive and includes competitors with greater financial and personnel
resources, who have brand name recognition and long-standing relationships with regulatory
authorities and customers. Moreover, mergers, joint ventures and alliances among franchise,
wireless or private cable operators, local exchange carriers and others may result in providers
capable of offering cable television, Internet, and telecommunications services in direct
competition with us. For example, major local exchange carriers have entered into arrangements
with EchoStar and DirecTV in which they will market packages combining phone service, DSL and DBS
services.

Additionally, we are subject to competition from utilities which possess fiber optic transmission
lines capable of transmitting signals with minimal signal distortion. Utilities are also
developing broadband over power line technology, which will allow the provision of Internet and
other broadband services to homes and offices.

Private Cable

Additional competition is posed by satellite master antenna television systems, or SMATV systems,
serving multiple dwelling units, or MDUs, such as condominiums, apartment complexes, and private
residential communities. These private cable systems may enter into exclusive agreements with such
MDUs, which may preclude operators of franchise systems from serving residents of such private
complexes. Private cable systems can offer both improved reception of local television stations
and many of the same satellite-delivered program services that are offered by cable systems. SMATV
systems currently benefit from operating advantages not available to franchised cable systems,
including fewer regulatory burdens and no requirement to service low density or economically
depressed communities. Exemption from regulation may provide a competitive advantage to certain of
our current and potential competitors.

Wireless Distribution

Cable systems also compete with wireless program distribution services such as multi-channel
multipoint distribution systems or “wireless cable,” known as MMDS, which uses low-power microwave
frequencies to transmit television programming over-the-air to paying customers. Wireless
distribution services generally provide many of the programming services provided by cable systems,
and digital compression technology increases significantly the channel capacity of their systems.
Both analog and digital MMDS services, however, require unobstructed “line of sight” transmission
paths and MMDS ventures have been quite limited to date.

The FCC has completed its auction of Multichannel Video Distribution & Data Service (“MVDDS”)
licenses. MVDDS is a new terrestrial video and data fixed wireless service that the FCC hopes will
spur competition in the cable and DBS industries.

Regulation and Legislation

The following summary addresses the key regulatory and legislative developments affecting the cable
industry. Cable system operations are extensively regulated by the FCC, some state governments and
most local governments. A failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to substantial
penalties. Our business can be dramatically impacted by changes to the existing regulatory
framework, whether triggered by legislative,



administrative, or judicial rulings. Congress and the FCC have expressed a particular interest in
increasing competition in the communications field generally and in the cable television field
specifically. The 1996 Telecom Act altered the regulatory structure governing the nation’s
communications providers. It removed barriers to competition in both the cable television market
and the local telephone market. At the same time, the FCC has pursued spectrum licensing options
designed to increase competition to the cable industry by wireless multichannel video programming
distributors. We could be materially disadvantaged in the future if we are subject to new
regulations that do not equally impact our key competitors.

Congress and the FCC have frequently revisited the subject of communications regulation, and they
are likely to do so in the future. In addition, franchise agreements with local governments must
be periodically renewed, and new operating terms may be imposed. Future legislative, regulatory,
or judicial changes could adversely affect our operations. We can provide no assurance that the
already extensive regulation of our business will not be expanded in the future.

Cable Rate Regulation

The cable industry has operated under a federal rate regulation regime for more than a decade. The
regulations currently restrict the prices that cable systems charge for basic service and
associated equipment. All other cable offerings are now universally exempt from rate regulation.
Although rate regulation operates pursuant to a federal formula, local governments, commonly
referred to as local franchising authorities, are primarily responsible for administering this
regulation. The majority of our local franchising authorities have never certified to regulate
basic cable rates, but they retain the right to do so (and order rate reductions and refunds),
except in those specific communities facing “effective competition.” Federal law defines effective
competition as existing in a variety of circumstances that historically were rarely satisfied, but
are increasingly likely to be satisfied with the recent increase in DBS competition.

There have been frequent calls to impose expanded rate regulation on the cable industry.
Confronted with rapidly increasing cable programming costs, it is possible that Congress may adopt
new constraints on the retail pricing or packaging of cable programming. Such constraints could
adversely affect our operations.

The federal rate regulations also require cable operators to maintain a “geographically uniform”
rate within each community, except in those communities facing effective competition. As we
attempt to respond to a changing marketplace with competitive pricing practices, we may face legal
restraints and challenges that impede our ability to compete.

Must Carry/Retransmission Consent

Federal law currently includes “must carry” regulations, which require cable systems to carry
certain local broadcast television stations that the cable operator would not select voluntarily.
Alternatively, popular commercial television stations can prohibit cable carriage unless the cable
operator first negotiates for “retransmission consent,” which may be conditioned on significant
payments or other concessions. Either option has a potentially adverse effect on our business.
The burden associated with must carry could increase significantly if cable systems were required
to simultaneously carry both the analog and digital signals of each television station (dual
carriage), as the broadcast industry transitions from an analog to a digital format.

The burden could also increase significantly if cable systems become required to carry multiple
program streams included within a single digital broadcast transmission (multicast carriage).
Additional government-mandated broadcast carriage obligations could disrupt existing programming
commitments, interfere with our preferred use of limited channel capacity and limit our ability to
offer services that would maximize customer appeal and revenue potential. Although the FCC issued
a decision on February 10, 2005, confirming an earlier ruling against mandating either dual
carriage or multicast carriage, that decision could be appealed or Congress could legislate
additional carriage obligations.

Access Channels

Local franchise agreements often require cable operators to set aside certain channels for public,
educational and governmental access programming. Federal law also requires cable systems to
designate a portion of their channel capacity for commercial leased access by unaffiliated third
parties. Increased activity in this area could further burden the channel capacity of our cable
systems.



Access to Programming

The FCC recently extended a regulation prohibiting video programmers affiliated with cable
companies from favoring cable operators over new competitors and requiring such programmers to sell
their satellite-delivered programming to other multichannel video distributors. This provision
limits the ability of vertically integrated cable programmers to offer exclusive programming
arrangements to cable companies. DBS providers traditionally had no similar restriction on
exclusive programming, but the FCC recently imposed that restriction as part of its approval of the
DirecTV-News Corp. merger.

The FCC has also adopted regulations to avoid unreasonable conduct in retransmission consent
negotiations between broadcasters and multichannel video programming distributors, including cable
and DBS. It imposed special conditions on the DirectTV-News Corp. merger, including a requirement
that Fox affiliated broadcast stations enter into commercial arbitration for disputes over
retransmission consent. Given the heightened competition and media consolidation that Charter
faces, it is possible that we will find it increasingly difficult to gain access to popular
programming at favorable terms. Such difficulty could adversely impact our business.

Ownership Restrictions

Federal regulation of the communications field traditionally included a host of ownership
restrictions, which limited the size of certain media entities and restricted their ability to
enter into competing enterprises. Through a series of legislative, regulatory, and judicial
actions, most of these restrictions recently were eliminated or substantially relaxed. For
example, historic restrictions on local exchange carriers offering cable service within their
telephone service area, as well as those prohibiting broadcast stations from owning cable systems
within their broadcast service area, no longer exist. Changes in this regulatory area, including
some still subject to judicial review, could alter the business landscape in which we operate, as
formidable new competitors (including electric utilities, local exchange carriers, and
broadcast/media companies) may increasingly choose to offer cable services.

The FCC previously adopted regulations precluding any cable operator from serving more than 30% of
all domestic multichannel video subscribers and from devoting more than 40% of the activated
channel capacity of any cable system to the carriage of affiliated national video programming
services. These cable ownership restrictions were invalidated by the courts, and the FCC is now
considering adoption of replacement regulations.

Internet Service

Over the past several years, proposals have been advanced at the FCC and Congress that would
require cable operators offering Internet service to provide non-discriminatory access to
unaffiliated Internet service providers. Several local franchising authorities actually adopted
mandatory “open access” requirements, but various federal courts rejected each of these actions,
relying on different legal theories. It remains unclear today precisely what regulatory regime
ultimately will be applied to the cable industry’s high-speed Internet service. The FCC has ruled
that cable modem service is an interstate “information service,” rather than a “cable” or
“telecommunications service.” This classification left cable modem service exempt from the burdens
associated with traditional cable and telecommunications regulation. The United States Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit however, vacated in part the FCC’s ruling and remanded for further
proceedings. The Ninth Circuit held that cable modem service is not “cable service,” but is part
“telecommunications service” and part “information service.” That decision has been appealed to
the Supreme Court, which has agreed to hear the case. The Ninth Circuit decision, if not
overturned, could potentially result in adverse regulatory treatment, including the imposition of
“open access” requirements on the cable industry’s Internet access service.

Although the FCC previously suggested that regulatory forbearance of cable modem service would be
appropriate, regardless of the technical classification ultimately assigned to it, a number of
technology companies continue to press the FCC to subject cable modem service to certain
“nondiscrimination principles.” The final regulatory status of cable modem service remains
uncertain. Its outcome could materially affect our business. It could also affect whether local
franchising authorities can collect franchise fees on cable modem service and whether cable systems
will have any payment obligations to the federal government’s universal service fund and be subject
to other common carrier regulations.

As the Internet has matured, it has become the subject of increasing regulatory interest. There is
now a host of federal laws affecting Internet service, including the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act, which affords copyright owners certain rights against us that could adversely affect our
relationship with any customer accused of violating



copyright laws. Recently enacted Anti-Spam legislation also imposes new obligations on our
operations. The adoption of new Internet regulations could adversely affect our business.

Phone Service

The 1996 Telecom Act created a more favorable regulatory environment for us to provide
telecommunications services. In particular, it limited the regulatory role of local franchising
authorities and established requirements ensuring that we could interconnect with other telephone
companies to provide a viable service. Many implementation details remain unresolved, and there
are substantial regulatory changes being considered that could impact, in both positive and
negative ways, our primary telecommunications competitors and our own entry into the field of phone
service. The FCC and state regulatory authorities are considering, for example, whether common
carrier regulation traditionally applied to incumbent local exchange carriers should be modified.
The FCC recently decided that alternative voice technologies, like certain types of VOIP, should be
regulated only at the federal level, rather than by individual states. As the FCC generally does
not favor extensive regulation of such services, this decision appears to be a positive development
for VOIP offerings. It is unclear how these regulatory matters ultimately will be resolved and how
they will affect our potential expansion into phone service.

Pole Attachments

The Communications Act requires most utilities to provide cable systems with access to poles and
conduits and simultaneously regulates the rates charged for this access. The Act specifies that
significantly higher rates apply if the cable plant is providing telecommunications service, as
well as traditional cable service. The FCC has clarified that a cable operator’s favorable pole
rates are not endangered by the provision of Internet access. Although that determination was
upheld by the United States Supreme Court, a subsequent decision by the United States Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit regarding the proper regulatory classification of Internet service
has once again created controversy in this area. The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear an
appeal of that decision. It remains possible that the underlying pole attachment formula, or its
application to Internet and telecommunications offerings, will be modified in a manner that
substantially increases our pole attachment costs.

Cable Equipment

The FCC has undertaken several steps to promote competition in the delivery of cable equipment and
compatibility with new digital technology. The FCC has expressly ruled that cable customers must
be allowed to purchase set-top terminals from third parties and established a multi-year phase-in
during which security functions (which would remain in the operator’s exclusive control) would be
unbundled from the basic converter functions, which could then be provided by third party vendors.
The first phase of implementation has already passed. A prohibition on cable operators leasing
digital set-top terminals that integrate security and basic navigation functions is currently
scheduled to go into effect as of July 1, 2006, although the FCC may extend the deadline.

The FCC has adopted rules implementing an agreement between major cable operators and manufacturers
of consumer electronics on “plug and play” specifications for one-way digital televisions. The
rules require cable operators to provide “CableCard” security modules and support to customer owned
digital televisions and similar devices already equipped with built-in set-top terminal
functionality. Cable operators must support basic home recording rights and copy protection rules
for digital programming content. The FCC has adopted companion “broadcast flag” rules, requiring
cable carriage of a code embedded in digital broadcast programming that will regulate the further
use of copyright programming, although the FCC’s jurisdiction to impose broadcast flag rules is
currently being challenged in court.

The FCC is conducting additional related rulemakings, and the cable and consumer electronics
industries are currently negotiating an agreement that would establish additional “plug and play”
specifications for two-way digital televisions.

The FCC rules are subject to challenge and inter-industry negotiations are ongoing. It is unclear
how this process will develop and how it will affect our offering of cable equipment and our
relationship with our customers.

Other Communications Act Provisions and FCC Regulatory Matters

In addition to the Communications Act provisions and FCC regulations noted above, there are other
statutory provisions and FCC regulations affecting our business. The Communications Act, for
example, includes cable-specific privacy obligations. The Act carefully limits our ability to
collect and disclose personal information.



FCC regulations include a variety of additional areas, including, among other things: (1) equal
employment opportunity obligations; (2) customer service standards; (3) technical service
standards; (4) mandatory blackouts of certain network, syndicated and sports programming; (5)
restrictions on political advertising; (6) restrictions on advertising in children’s programming;
(7) restrictions on origination cablecasting; (8) restrictions on carriage of lottery programming;
(9) sponsorship identification obligations; (10) closed captioning of video programming; (11)
licensing of systems and facilities; and (12) maintenance of public files; and (13) emergency alert
systems.

It is possible that Congress or the FCC will expand or modify its regulation of cable systems in
the future, and we cannot predict at this time how that might impact our business. For example,
there have been recent discussions about imposing “indecency” restrictions directly on cable
programming.

Copyright

Cable systems are subject to federal copyright licensing covering carriage of television and radio
broadcast signals. The possible modification or elimination of this compulsory copyright license
is the subject of continuing legislative review and could adversely affect our ability to obtain
desired broadcast programming. We cannot predict the outcome of this legislative activity.
Moreover, the Copyright Office has not yet provided any guidance as to the how the compulsory
copyright license should apply to newly offered digital broadcast signals.

Copyright clearances for non-broadcast programming services are arranged through private
negotiations. Cable operators also must obtain music rights for locally originated programming and
advertising from the major music performing rights organizations. These licensing fees have been
the source of litigation in the past, and we cannot predict with certainty whether license fee
disputes may arise in the future.

Franchise Matters

Cable systems generally are operated pursuant to nonexclusive franchises granted by a municipality
or other state or local government entity in order to cross public rights-of-way. Cable franchises
generally are granted for fixed terms and in many cases include monetary penalties for
noncompliance and may be terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions.

The specific terms and conditions of cable franchises vary materially between jurisdictions. Each
franchise generally contains provisions governing cable operations, franchise fees, system
construction, maintenance, technical performance, and customer service standards. A number of
states subject cable systems to the jurisdiction of centralized state government agencies, such as
public utility commissions. Although local franchising authorities have considerable discretion in
establishing franchise terms, there are certain federal protections. For example, federal law caps
local franchise fees and includes renewal procedures designed to protect incumbent franchisees from
arbitrary denials of renewal. Even if a franchise is renewed, however, the local franchising
authority may seek to impose new and more onerous requirements as a condition of renewal.
Similarly, if a local franchising authority’s consent is required for the purchase or sale of a
cable system, the local franchising authority may attempt to impose more burdensome requirements as
a condition for providing its consent.

Employees

As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately 15,500 full-time equivalent employees. At December
31, 2004, approximately 100 of our employees were represented by collective bargaining agreements.
We have never experienced a work stoppage. At December 31, 2003, these numbers were approximately
15,500 and approximately 300, respectively.

The corporate office, which includes employees of Charter and Charter Holdco, is responsible for
coordinating and overseeing our operations. The corporate office performs certain financial and
administrative functions on a centralized basis such as accounting, taxes, billing, finance and
acquisitions, payroll and benefit administration, information system design and support, internal
audit, purchasing, marketing and programming contract administration and oversight and coordination
of external auditors and consultants. The corporate office performs these services on a cost
reimbursement basis pursuant to a management services agreement. See “Item 13. Certain
Relationships and Related Transactions — Transactions Arising out of Our Organizational Structure
and Mr. Allen’s Investment in Charter and Its Subsidiaries — Intercompany Management Agreements”
and “— Mutual Services Agreements.”



Item 2.

Properties.

Our principal physical assets consist of cable distribution plant and equipment, including signal
receiving, encoding and decoding devices, headend reception facilities, distribution systems and
customer drop equipment for each of our cable systems.

Our cable plant and related equipment are generally attached to utility poles under pole rental
agreements with local public utilities and telephone companies, and in certain locations are buried
in underground ducts or trenches. We own or lease real property for signal reception sites and own
most of our service vehicles.

Historically, our subsidiaries have owned the real property and buildings for our data centers,
customer contact centers and our divisional administrative offices. Since early 2003 we have
reduced our total real estate portfolio square footage by approximately 17% and have decreased our
operating annual lease costs by approximately 30%. We plan to continue reducing our number of
administrative offices and lease the space, where possible, while attempting to sell those existing
locations that we believe are no longer required. Our subsidiaries generally have leased space for
business offices throughout our operating divisions. Our headend and tower locations are located
on owned or leased parcels of land, and we generally own the towers on which our equipment is
located. Charter Holdco owns the real property and building for our principal executive offices.

The physical components of our cable systems require maintenance as well as periodic upgrades to
support the new services and products we introduce. See “Item 1. Business – Our Network
Technology.” We believe that our properties are generally in good operating condition and are
suitable for our business operations.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings.

Securities Class Actions and Derivative Suits

Fourteen putative federal class action lawsuits (the “Federal Class Actions”) were filed against
Charter and certain of its former and present officers and directors in various jurisdictions
allegedly on behalf of all purchasers of Charter’s securities during the period from either
November 8 or November 9, 1999 through July 17 or July 18, 2002. Unspecified damages were sought
by the plaintiffs. In general, the lawsuits alleged that Charter utilized misleading accounting
practices and failed to disclose these accounting practices and/or issued false and misleading
financial statements and press releases concerning Charter’s operations and prospects. The Federal
Class Actions were specifically and individually identified in public filings made by Charter prior
to the date of this annual report.

In October 2002, Charter filed a motion with the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (the
“Panel”) to transfer the Federal Class Actions to the Eastern District of Missouri. On March 12,
2003, the Panel transferred the six Federal Class Actions not filed in the Eastern District of
Missouri to that district for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings with the eight
Federal Class Actions already pending there. The Panel’s transfer order assigned the Federal Class
Actions to Judge Charles A. Shaw. By virtue of a prior court order, StoneRidge Investment Partners
LLC became lead plaintiff upon entry of the Panel’s transfer order. StoneRidge subsequently filed
a Consolidated Amended Complaint. The Court subsequently consolidated the Federal Class Actions
into a single action (the “Consolidated Federal Class Action”) for pretrial purposes. On June 19,
2003, following a status and scheduling conference with the parties, the Court issued a Case
Management Order setting forth a schedule for the pretrial phase of the Consolidated Federal Class
Action. Motions to dismiss the Consolidated Amended Complaint were filed. On February 10, 2004,
in response to a joint motion made by StoneRidge and Defendants Charter, Vogel and Allen, the Court
entered an order providing, among other things, that: (1) the parties who filed such motion engage
in a mediation within ninety (90) days; and (2) all proceedings in the Consolidated Federal Class
Actions were stayed until May 10, 2004. On May 11, 2004, the Court extended the stay in the
Consolidated Federal Class Action for an additional sixty (60) days. On July 12, 2004, the parties
submitted a joint motion to again extend the stay, this time until September 10, 2004. The Court
granted that extension on July 20, 2004. On August 5, 2004, Stoneridge, Charter and the individual
defendants who were the subject of the suit entered into a Memorandum of Understanding setting
forth agreements in principle to settle the Consolidated Federal Class Action. These parties
subsequently entered into Stipulations of Settlement dated as of January 24, 2005 (described more
fully below) which incorporate the terms of the August 5, 2004 Memorandum of Understanding.

The Consolidated Federal Class Action is entitled:



•

In re Charter Communications, Inc. Securities Litigation, MDL Docket No. 1506 (All
Cases), StoneRidge Investments Partners, LLC, Individually and On Behalf of All Others
Similarly Situated, v. Charter Communications, Inc., Paul Allen, Jerald L. Kent, Carl E.
Vogel, Kent Kalkwarf, David G. Barford, Paul E. Martin, David L. McCall, Bill Shreffler,
Chris Fenger, James H. Smith, III, Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., Motorola, Inc. and Arthur
Andersen, LLP, Consolidated Case No. 4:02-CV-1186-CAS.

On September 12, 2002, a shareholders derivative suit (the “State Derivative Action”) was filed in
the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis, State of Missouri (the “Missouri State Court”), against
Charter and its then current directors, as well as its former auditors. A substantively identical
derivative action was later filed and consolidated into the State Derivative Action. The
plaintiffs allege that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties by failing to
establish and maintain adequate internal controls and procedures. Unspecified damages, allegedly
on Charter’s behalf, are sought by the plaintiffs.

The consolidated State Derivative Action is entitled:

•

Kenneth Stacey, Derivatively on behalf of Nominal Defendant Charter Communications,
Inc., v. Ronald L. Nelson, Paul G. Allen, Marc B. Nathanson, Nancy B. Peretsman, William
Savoy, John H. Tory, Carl E. Vogel, Larry W. Wangberg, and Charter Communications, Inc.

On March 12, 2004, an action substantively identical to the State Derivative Action was filed in
the Missouri State Court, against Charter and certain of its current and former directors, as well
as its former auditors. The plaintiffs in that case alleged that the individual defendants
breached their fiduciary duties by failing to establish and maintain adequate internal controls and
procedures. Unspecified damages, allegedly on Charter’s behalf, were sought by plaintiffs. On
July 14, 2004, the Court consolidated this case with the State Derivative Action.

This action is entitled:

•

Thomas Schimmel, Derivatively on behalf on Nominal Defendant Charter Communications,
Inc., v. Ronald L. Nelson, Paul G. Allen, Marc B. Nathanson, Nancy B. Peretsman, William D.
Savoy, John H. Tory, Carl E. Vogel, Larry W. Wangberg, and Arthur Andersen, LLP, and
Charter Communications, Inc.

Separately, on February 12, 2003, a shareholders derivative suit (the “Federal Derivative Action”),
was filed against Charter and its then current directors in the United States District Court for
the Eastern District of Missouri. The plaintiff in that suit alleged that the individual
defendants breached their fiduciary duties and grossly mismanaged Charter by failing to establish
and maintain adequate internal controls and procedures. Unspecified damages, allegedly on
Charter’s behalf, were sought by the plaintiffs.



The Federal Derivative Action is entitled:

•

Arthur Cohn, Derivatively on behalf of Nominal Defendant Charter Communications, Inc.,
v. Ronald L. Nelson, Paul G. Allen, Marc B. Nathanson, Nancy B. Peretsman, William Savoy,
John H. Tory, Carl E. Vogel, Larry W. Wangberg, and Charter Communications, Inc.

As noted above, Charter entered into Memoranda of Understanding on August 5, 2004 setting forth
agreements in principle regarding settlement of the Consolidated Federal Class Action, the State
Derivative Action(s) and the Federal Derivative Action (the “Actions”). Charter and various other
defendants in those actions subsequently entered into Stipulations of Settlement dated as of
January 24, 2005, setting forth a settlement of the Actions in a manner consistent with the terms
of the Memoranda of Understanding. The Stipulations of Settlement, along with various supporting
documentation, were filed with the Court on February 2, 2005. The Stipulations of Settlement
provide that, in exchange for a release of all claims by plaintiffs against Charter and its former
and present officers and directors named in the Actions, Charter will pay to the plaintiffs a
combination of cash and equity collectively valued at $144 million, which will include the fees and
expenses of plaintiffs’ counsel. Of this amount, $64 million will be paid in cash (by Charter’s
insurance carriers) and the balance will be paid in shares of Charter Class A common stock having
an aggregate value of $40 million and ten-year warrants to purchase shares of Charter Class A
common stock having an aggregate warrant value of $40 million, with such values in each case being
determined pursuant to formulas set forth in the Stipulations of Settlement. The warrants would
have an exercise price equal to 150% of the fair market value (as defined) of Charter Class A
common stock as of the date of the entry of the order of final judgment approving the settlement.
In addition, Charter expects to issue additional shares of its Class A common stock to its
insurance carrier having an aggregate value of $5 million. As part of the settlements, Charter
will also commit to a variety of corporate governance changes, internal practices and public
disclosures, some of which have already been undertaken and none of which are inconsistent with
measures Charter is taking in connection with the recent conclusion of the SEC investigation
described below. Documents related to the settlement of the Actions have now been executed and
filed. On February 15, 2005, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri
gave preliminary approval to the settlement of the Actions. The settlement of each of the lawsuits
remains conditioned upon, among other things, final judicial approval of the settlements following
notice to the class, and dismissal with prejudice of the consolidated derivative actions now
pending in Missouri State Court, which are related to the Federal Derivative Action. In the event
that the valuation formula in the Stipulations provides for a per share value of less than $2.25,
Charter may elect to terminate the settlement.

In addition to the Federal Class Actions, the State Derivative Action(s), the new Missouri State
Court derivative action and the Federal Derivative Action, six putative class action lawsuits were
filed against Charter and certain of its then current directors and officers in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware (the “Delaware Class Actions”). The lawsuits were filed after
the filing of a Schedule 13D amendment by Mr. Allen indicating that he was exploring a number of
possible alternatives with respect to restructuring or expanding his ownership interest in Charter.
We believe the plaintiffs speculated that Mr. Allen might have been contemplating an unfair bid
for shares of Charter or some other sort of going private transaction on unfair terms and generally
alleged that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by participating in or acquiescing to
such a transaction. The lawsuits, which are substantively identical, were brought on behalf of
Charter’s securities holders as of July 29, 2002, and sought unspecified damages and possible
injunctive relief. However, no such transaction by Mr. Allen has been presented. On April 30,
2004, orders of dismissal without prejudice were entered in each of the Delaware Class Actions.

The Delaware Class Actions consist of:

•

Eleanor Leonard, v. Paul G. Allen, Larry W. Wangberg, John H. Tory, Carl E. Vogel, Marc
B. Nathanson, Nancy B. Peretsman, Ronald L. Nelson, William Savoy, and Charter

2002.

Government Investigations

In August 2002, Charter became aware of a grand jury investigation being conducted by the U.S.
Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Missouri into certain of its accounting and reporting
practices, focusing on how Charter reported customer numbers, and its reporting of amounts received
from digital set-top terminal suppliers for advertising. The U.S. Attorney’s Office has publicly
stated that Charter is not a target of the investigation. Charter was also advised by the U. S.
Attorney’s Office that no current officer or member of its board of directors is a target of the
investigation. On July 24, 2003, a federal grand jury charged four former officers of Charter with
conspiracy and mail and wire fraud, alleging improper accounting and reporting practices focusing
on revenue from digital set-top terminal suppliers and inflated customer account numbers. Trial
was set for February 7, 2005. Subsequently, each of the indicted former officers pled guilty to
single conspiracy counts related to the original mail and wire fraud charges and are awaiting
sentencing. We are fully cooperating with the investigation.

On November 4, 2002, Charter received an informal, non-public inquiry from the staff of the SEC.
The SEC issued a formal order of investigation dated January 23, 2003, and subsequently served
document and testimony subpoenas on Charter and a number of its former employees. The
investigation and subpoenas generally concerned Charter’s prior reports with respect to its
determination of the number of customers, and various of its accounting policies and practices
including its capitalization of certain expenses and dealings with certain vendors, including
programmers and digital set-top terminal suppliers. On July 27, 2004, the SEC and Charter reached
a final agreement to settle the investigation. In the Settlement Agreement and Cease and Desist
Order, Charter agreed to entry of an administrative order prohibiting any future violations of
United States securities laws and requiring certain other remedial internal practices and public
disclosures. Charter neither admitted nor denied any wrongdoing, and the SEC assessed no fine
against Charter.

Indemnification

Charter is generally required to indemnify each of the named individual defendants in connection
with the matters described above pursuant to the terms of its bylaws and (where applicable) such
individual defendants’ employment agreements. In accordance with these documents, in connection
with the pending grand jury investigation, the now settled SEC investigation and the above
described lawsuits, some of Charter’s current and former directors and current and former officers
have been advanced certain costs and expenses incurred in connection with their defense. See “Item
13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions – Indemnification Advances” for greater detail.
On February 22, 2005, Charter filed suit against four of its former officers who were indicted in
the course of the grand jury investigation. These suits seek to recover the legal fees and other
related expenses advanced to these individuals by Charter for the grand jury investigation, SEC
investigation and class action and related lawsuits.

Other Litigation

In October 2001, two customers, Nikki Nicholls and Geraldine M. Barber, filed a class action suit
against Charter Holdco in South Carolina Court of Common Pleas (the “South Carolina Class Action”),
purportedly on behalf of a class of Charter Holdco’s customers, alleging that Charter Holdco
improperly charged them a wire maintenance fee without request or permission. They also claimed
that Charter Holdco improperly required them to rent analog and/or digital set-top terminals even
though their television sets were “cable ready.” A substantively identical case was filed in the
Superior Court of Athens — Clarke County, Georgia by Emma S. Tobar on March 26, 2002 (the “Georgia
Class Action”), alleging a nationwide class for these claims. Charter Holdco removed the South
Carolina Class Action to the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina in
November 2001, and moved to dismiss the suit in December 2001. The federal judge remanded the case
to the South Carolina Court of Common



Pleas in August 2002 without ruling on the motion to dismiss. The plaintiffs subsequently moved
for a default judgment, arguing that upon return to state court, Charter Holdco should have, but
did not file a new motion to dismiss. The state court judge granted the plaintiff’s motion over
Charter Holdco’s objection in September 2002. Charter Holdco immediately appealed that decision to
the South Carolina Court of Appeals and the South Carolina Supreme Court, but those courts ruled
that until a final judgment was entered against Charter Holdco, they lacked jurisdiction to hear
the appeal.

In January 2003, the Court of Common Pleas granted the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification.
In October and November 2003, Charter Holdco filed motions (a) asking that court to set aside the
default judgment, and (b) seeking dismissal of plaintiffs’ suit for failure to state a claim. In
January 2004, the Court of Common Pleas granted in part and denied in part Charter Holdco’s motion
to dismiss for failure to state a claim. It also took under advisement Charter Holdco’s motion to
set aside the default judgment. In April 2004, the parties to both the Georgia and South Carolina
Class Actions participated in a mediation. The mediator made a proposal to the parties to settle
the lawsuits. In May 2004, the parties accepted the mediator’s proposal and reached a tentative
settlement, subject to final documentation and court approval. As a result of the tentative
settlement, we recorded a special charge of $9 million in our consolidated statement of operations
in the first quarter of 2004. On July 8, 2004, the Superior Court of Athens — Clarke County,
Georgia granted a motion to amend the Tobar complaint to add Nicholls, Barber and April Jones as
plaintiffs in the Georgia Class Action and to add any potential class members in South Carolina.
The court also granted preliminary approval of the proposed settlement on that date. On August 2,
2004, the parties submitted a joint request to the South Carolina Court of Common Pleas to stay the
South Carolina Class Action pending final approval of the settlement and on August 17, 2004, that
court granted the parties’ request. On November 10, 2004, the court granted final approval of the
settlement, rejecting positions advanced by two objectors to the settlement. On December 13, 2004
the court entered a written order formally approving that settlement. On January 11, 2005, certain
class members appealed the order entered by the Georgia court. That appeal was dismissed on or
about February 3, 2005. Additionally, one of the objectors to this settlement recently filed a
similar, but not identical, lawsuit.

The South Carolina Class Action was entitled:

•

Nikki Nicholls and Geraldine M. Barber, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly
situated v. Charter Communications Holding Company, LLC and City of Spartanburg filed on
October 29, 2001.

The Georgia Class Action is now entitled:

•

Emma S. Tobar, Nikki Nicholls, Geraldine M. Barber and April Jones, on behalf of
themselves and all others similarly situated v. Charter Communications Holding Company,
LLC, et al, originally filed on March 26, 2002.

Outcome

In addition to the matters set forth above, Charter is also party to other lawsuits and claims that
arose in the ordinary course of conducting its business. In the opinion of management, after
taking into account recorded liabilities, the outcome of these other lawsuits and claims are not
expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of
operations or our liquidity.

(B) Holders

As of December 31, 2004, there were 3,793 holders of record of our Class A common stock, one holder
of our Class B common stock, and 13 holders of record of our Series A Convertible Redeemable
Preferred Stock.

(C) Dividends

Charter has not paid stock or cash dividends on any of its common stock, and we do not intend to
pay cash dividends on common stock for the foreseeable future. Except for the cash dividends we
pay on our outstanding Series A convertible redeemable preferred stock, we intend to retain future
earnings, if any, to finance our business. Additionally, Charter is prohibited from declaring or
paying cash dividends on any class of stock on par with or junior to the Series A convertible
redeemable preferred stock, including the common stock, unless the cumulative dividends on the
preferred stock and any accrued dividends on stock on par with the preferred stock for any past or
current period have been paid or set aside in full.

Charter Holdco may make pro rata distributions to all holders of its common membership units,
including Charter. Covenants in the indentures and credit agreements governing the debt
obligations of Charter Communications Holdings and its subsidiaries restrict their ability to make
distributions to us, and accordingly, limit our ability to declare or pay cash dividends. See
“Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

(D) Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities

During 2004, there were no unregistered sales of securities of the registrant other than those
previously reported on a Form 10-Q or Form 8-K.

(a)

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the 2004 presentation.

(b)

In 2002, the Company restated its consolidated financial statements for 2001 and prior. The
restatements were primarily related to the following categories: (i) launch incentives from
programmers; (ii) customer incentives and inducements; (iii) capitalized labor and overhead
costs; (iv) customer acquisition costs; (v) rebuild and upgrade of cable systems; (vi)
deferred tax liabilities/franchise assets; and (vii) other adjustments. These adjustments
reduced revenue for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 by $146 million and $108
million, respectively. The Company’s consolidated net loss decreased by $11 million for the
year ended December 31, 2001. Net loss increased by $29 million for the year ended December
31, 2000, primarily due to adjustments related to the original accounting for acquisitions and
for elements of the rebuild and upgrade activities.

Comparability of the above information from year to year is affected by acquisitions and
dispositions completed by us. See Note 2 and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements
contained in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” and “Item 7. Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital
Resources.”

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Reference is made to “Certain Trends and Uncertainties” of this section and “Cautionary Statement
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” which describes important factors that could cause actual
results to differ from expectations and non-historical information contained herein. In addition,
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial
statements of Charter Communications, Inc. and subsidiaries as of and for the years ended December
31, 2004, 2003 and 2002.

Introduction

In 2004, we completed several transactions that improved our liquidity. Our efforts in this regard
have resulted in the completion of a number of transactions in 2004, as follows:

During the years 1999 through 2001, we grew significantly, principally through acquisitions of
other cable businesses financed by debt and, to a lesser extent, equity. We have no current plans
to pursue any significant acquisitions. However, we may pursue exchanges of non-strategic assets
or divestitures, such as the sale of cable systems to Atlantic Broadband Finance, LLC discussed
above. We therefore do not believe that our historical growth rates are accurate indicators of
future growth.

The industry’s and our most significant operational challenges in 2004 and 2003 included
competition from DBS providers and DSL service providers. See “Business — Competition.’’ We
believe that competition from DBS has resulted in net analog video customer losses and decreased
growth rates for digital video customers. Competition from DSL providers combined with limited
opportunities to expand our customer base now that approximately 28% of our analog video customers
subscribe to our high-speed data services has resulted in decreased growth rates for high-speed
data customers. In the recent past, we have grown revenues by offsetting video customer losses
with price increases and sales of incremental advanced services such as high-speed data, video on
demand, digital video recorders and high definition television. We expect to continue to grow
revenues through continued growth in high-speed data and incremental new services including VOIP
telephony, high definition television, VOD and DVR service.



Historically, our ability to fund operations and investing activities has depended on our continued
access to credit under our subsidiaries’ credit facilities. We expect we will continue to borrow
under our subsidiaries’ credit facilities from time to time to fund cash needs. The occurrence of
an event of default under our subsidiaries’ credit facilities could result in borrowings from these
facilities being unavailable to us and could, in the event of a payment default or acceleration,
trigger events of default under our notes and our subsidiaries’ outstanding notes and would have a
material adverse effect on us. Approximately $30 million of indebtedness under our subsidiaries’
credit facilities is scheduled to mature during 2005. We expect to fund payment of such
indebtedness through borrowings under our subsidiaries’ revolving credit facilities.

Overview of Operations

Approximately 86% of our revenues for the each of the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 are
attributable to monthly subscription fees charged to customers for our video, high-speed data,
telephone and commercial services provided by our cable systems. Generally, these customer
subscriptions may be discontinued by the customer at any time. The remaining 14% of revenue is
derived primarily from advertising revenues, franchise fee revenues, which are collected by us but
then paid to local franchising authorities, pay-per-view and VOD programming where users are
charged a fee for individual programs viewed, installation or reconnection fees charged to
customers to commence or reinstate service, and commissions related to the sale of merchandise by
home shopping services. We have increased revenues during the past three years, primarily through
the sale of digital video and high-speed data services to new and existing customers and price
increases on video services offset in part by dispositions of systems. Going forward, our goal is
to increase revenues by stabilizing our analog video customer base, implementing price increases on
certain services and packages and increasing the number of our customers who purchase high-speed
data services, digital video and new products and services such as VOIP telephony, VOD, high
definition television and DVR service. To accomplish this, we are increasing prices for certain
services and we are offering new bundling of services combining digital video and our advanced
services (such as high-speed data service and high definition television) at what we believe are
attractive price points. See “Business — Sales and Marketing” for more details.

Our success in our efforts to grow revenues and improve margins will be impacted by our ability to
compete against companies with often fewer regulatory burdens, easier access to financing, greater
personnel resources, greater brand name recognition and long-established relationships with
regulatory authorities and customers. Additionally, controlling our cost of operations is
critical, particularly cable programming costs, which have historically increased at rates in
excess of inflation and are expected to continue to increase. See “Business — Programming” for
more details. We are attempting to control our costs of operations by maintaining strict controls
on expenses. More specifically, we are focused on managing our cost structure by renegotiating
programming agreements to reduce the rate of historical increases in programming cost, managing our
workforce to control increases and improve productivity, and leveraging our size in purchasing
activities.

Our expenses primarily consist of operating costs, selling, general and administrative expenses,
depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense. Operating costs primarily include
programming costs, the cost of our workforce, cable service related expenses, advertising sales
costs, franchise fees and expenses related to customer billings. Our income from operations
decreased from $516 million for year ended December 31, 2003 to loss from operations of $2.0
billion for the year ended December 31, 2004. We had a negative operating margin (defined as
income (loss) from operations divided by revenues) of 41% for the year ended December 31, 2004
whereas for the year ended December 31, 2003, we had a positive operating margin of 11%. The
decline in income from operations and operating margin for the year end December 31, 2004 is
principally due to the impairment of franchises of $2.4 billion recorded in the third quarter of
2004. The year ended December 31, 2004 also includes a gain on the sale of certain cable systems
to Atlantic Broadband Finance, LLC which is substantially offset by an increase in option
compensation expense and special charges when compared to the year ended December 31, 2003. For
the year ended December 31, 2003, income from operations was $516 million and for the year ended
December 31, 2002, our loss from operations was $4.3 billion. Operating margin was 11% for the
year ended December 31, 2003, whereas for the year ending December 31, 2002, we had negative
operating margin of 95%. The improvement in income from operations and operating margin from 2002
to 2003 was principally due to a $4.6 billion franchise impairment charge in the fourth quarter of
2002 which did not recur in 2003 and the recognition of gains in 2003 of $93 million related to
unfavorable contracts and other settlements and gain on sale of system. Although we do not expect
charges for impairment in the future of comparable magnitude, potential charges could occur due to
changes in market conditions.

We have a history of net losses. Further, we expect to continue to report net losses for the
foreseeable future. Our net losses are principally attributable to insufficient revenue to cover
the interest costs on our high level of debt, the



depreciation expenses that we incur resulting from the capital investments we have made in our
cable properties, and the amortization and impairment of our franchise intangibles. We expect that
these expenses (other than impairment of franchises) will remain significant, and we therefore
expect to continue to report net losses for the foreseeable future. Additionally, because minority
interest in Charter Holdco was substantially eliminated at December 31, 2003, beginning in the
first quarter of 2004, we began to absorb substantially all future losses before income taxes that
otherwise would have been allocated to minority interest. This resulted in an additional $2.4
billion of net loss for the year ended December 31, 2004. Under our existing capital structure,
future losses will continue to be absorbed by Charter.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Certain of our accounting policies require our management to make difficult, subjective or complex
judgments. Management has discussed these policies with the Audit Committee of Charter’s board of
directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the following disclosure. We consider the following
policies to be the most critical in understanding the estimates, assumptions and judgments that are
involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could affect our results
of operations, financial condition and cash flows:

In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimates or
judgment but are not deemed critical, such as the allowance for doubtful accounts, but changes in
judgment, or estimates in these other items could also have a material impact on our financial
statements.

Capitalization of labor and overhead costs.

The cable industry is capital intensive, and a large
portion of our resources are spent on capital activities associated with extending, rebuilding, and
upgrading our cable network. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the net carrying amount of our
property, plant and equipment (consisting primarily of cable network assets) was approximately $6.3
billion (representing 36% of total assets) and $7.0 billion (representing 33% of total assets),
respectively. Total capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were
approximately $924 million, $854 million and $2.2 billion, respectively.

Costs associated with network construction, initial customer installations, installation
refurbishments and the addition of network equipment necessary to provide advanced services are
capitalized. Costs capitalized as part of initial customer installations include materials, direct
labor, and certain indirect costs. These indirect costs are associated with the activities of
personnel who assist in connecting and activating the new service and consist of compensation and
overhead costs associated with these support functions. The costs of disconnecting service at a
customer’s dwelling or reconnecting service to a previously installed dwelling are charged to
operating expense in the period incurred. Costs for repairs and maintenance are charged to
operating expense as incurred, while equipment replacement and betterments, including replacement
of cable drops from the pole to the dwelling, are capitalized.

We make judgments regarding the installation and construction activities to be capitalized. We
capitalize direct labor and certain indirect costs (“overhead’’) using standards developed from
actual costs and applicable operational data. We calculate standards for items such as the labor
rates, overhead rates and the actual amount of time required to perform a capitalizable activity.
For example, the standard amounts of time required to perform capitalizable activities are based on
studies of the time required to perform such activities. Overhead rates are established based on
an analysis of the nature of costs incurred in support of capitalizable activities and a
determination of the portion of costs that is directly attributable to capitalizable activities.
The impact of changes that resulted from these studies were not significant in the periods
presented.

Labor costs directly associated with capital projects are capitalized. We capitalize direct labor
costs associated with personnel based upon the specific time devoted to network construction and
customer installation activities. Capitalizable activities performed in connection with customer
installations include such activities as:

•

Scheduling a “truck roll” to the customer’s dwelling for service connection;



•

Verification of serviceability to the customer’s dwelling (i.e., determining whether the
customer’s dwelling is capable of receiving service by our cable network and/or receiving
advanced or data services);

•

Customer premise activities performed by in-house field technicians and third-party
contractors in connection with customer installations, installation of network equipment in
connection with the installation of expanded services and equipment replacement and
betterment; and

•

Verifying the integrity of the customer’s network connection by initiating test signals
downstream from the headend to the customer’s digital set-top terminal.

Judgment is required to determine the extent to which overhead is incurred as a result of specific
capital activities, and therefore should be capitalized. The primary costs that are included in
the determination of the overhead rate are (i) employee benefits and payroll taxes associated with
capitalized direct labor, (ii) direct variable costs associated with capitalizable activities,
consisting primarily of installation and construction vehicle costs, (iii) the cost of support
personnel, such as dispatch, that directly assist with capitalizable installation activities, and
(iv) indirect costs directly attributable to capitalizable activities.

While we believe our existing capitalization policies are appropriate, a significant change in the
nature or extent of our system activities could affect management’s judgment about the extent to
which we should capitalize direct labor or overhead in the future. We monitor the appropriateness
of our capitalization policies, and perform updates to our internal studies on an ongoing basis to
determine whether facts or circumstances warrant a change to our capitalization policies. We
capitalized direct labor and overhead of $164 million, $174 million and $335 million, respectively,
for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. Capitalized internal direct labor and
overhead costs substantially decreased in 2004 and 2003 compared to 2002 primarily due to the
substantial completion of the upgrade of our systems and a decrease in the amount of capitalizable
installation costs.

Useful lives of property, plant and equipment.

We evaluate the appropriateness of estimated useful
lives assigned to our property, plant and equipment, based on annual studies of such useful lives,
and revise such lives to the extent warranted by changing facts and circumstances. Any changes in
estimated useful lives as a result of these studies, which were not significant in the periods
presented, will be reflected prospectively beginning in the period in which the study is completed.
The effect of a one-year decrease in the weighted average remaining useful life of our property,
plant and equipment would be an increase in depreciation expense for the year ended December 31,
2004 of approximately $296 million. The effect of a one-year increase in the weighted average
useful life of our property, plant and equipment would be a decrease in depreciation expense for
the year ended December 31, 2004 of approximately $198 million.

Depreciation expense related to property, plant and equipment totaled $1.5 billion, $1.5 billion
and $1.4 billion, representing approximately 21%, 34% and 16% of costs and expenses, for the years
ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Depreciation is recorded using the
straight-line composite method over management’s estimate of the estimated useful lives of the related assets
as listed below:

Cable distribution systems

7-20 years

Customer equipment and installations

3-5 years

Vehicles and equipment

1-5 years

Buildings and leasehold improvements

5-15 years

Furniture
and fixtures

5 years

Impairment of property, plant and equipment, franchises and goodwill.

As discussed above, the net
carrying value of our property, plant and equipment is significant. We also have recorded a
significant amount of cost related to franchises, pursuant to which we are granted the right to
operate our cable distribution network throughout our service areas. The net carrying value of
franchises as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 was approximately $9.9 billion (representing 56% of
total assets) and $13.7 billion (representing 64% of total assets), respectively. Furthermore, our
noncurrent assets include approximately $52 million of goodwill.

We adopted SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002. SFAS No. 142 requires that franchise intangible assets
that meet specified indefinite-life criteria no longer be amortized against earnings, but instead
must be tested for impairment annually based on valuations, or more frequently as warranted by
events or changes in circumstances. In determining whether our franchises have an indefinite-life,
we considered the exclusivity of the franchise, the expected costs of franchise renewals, and the
technological state of the associated cable systems with a view to whether or not we are in
compliance with any technology upgrading requirements. We have concluded that as of December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002 more than 99% of our franchises qualify for indefinite-life treatment under



SFAS No. 142, and that less than one percent of our franchises do not qualify for indefinite-life
treatment due to technological or operational factors that limit their lives. Costs of
finite-lived franchises, along with costs associated with franchise renewals, are amortized on a
straight-line basis over 10 years, which represents management’s best estimate of the average
remaining useful lives of such franchises. Franchise amortization expense was $4 million for the
year ended December 31, 2004 and $9 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002.
We expect that amortization expense on franchise assets will be approximately $3 million annually
for each of the next five years. Actual amortization expense in future periods could differ from
these estimates as a result of new intangible asset acquisitions or divestitures, changes in useful
lives and other relevant factors. Our goodwill is also deemed to have an indefinite life under
SFAS No. 142.

SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

, requires that we evaluate
the recoverability of our property, plant and equipment and franchise assets which did not qualify
for indefinite-life treatment under SFAS No. 142 upon the occurrence of events or changes in
circumstances which indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Such
events or changes in circumstances could include such factors as the impairment of our
indefinite-life franchises under SFAS No. 142, changes in technological advances, fluctuations in
the fair value of such assets, adverse changes in relationships with local franchise authorities,
adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results. Under SFAS No. 144, a long-lived
asset is deemed impaired when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the projected undiscounted
future cash flows associated with the asset. No impairments of long-lived assets were recorded in
the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 or 2002. We were also required to evaluate the
recoverability of our indefinite-life franchises, as well as goodwill, as of January 1, 2002 upon
adoption of SFAS No. 142, and on an annual basis or more frequently as deemed necessary.

Under both SFAS No. 144 and SFAS No. 142, if an asset is determined to be impaired, it is required
to be written down to its estimated fair market value. We determine fair market value based on
estimated discounted future cash flows, using reasonable and appropriate assumptions that are
consistent with internal forecasts. Our assumptions include these and other factors: penetration
rates for analog and digital video and high-speed data, revenue growth rates, expected operating
margins and capital expenditures. Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate future
cash flows, and such estimates include inherent uncertainties, including those relating to the
timing and amount of future cash flows and the discount rate used in the calculation.

Based on the guidance prescribed in Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 02-7,

Unit of
Accounting for Testing of Impairment of Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

, franchises were
aggregated into essentially inseparable asset groups to conduct the valuations. The asset groups
generally represent geographic clustering of our cable systems into groups by which such systems
are managed. Management believes such groupings represent the highest and best use of those
assets. We determined that our franchises were impaired upon adoption of SFAS No. 142 on January
1, 2002 and as a result recorded the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of $206
million (approximately $572 million before minority interest effects of $306 million and tax
effects of $60 million). As required by SFAS No. 142, the standard has not been retroactively
applied to results for the period prior to adoption.

Our valuations, which are based on the present value of projected after tax cash flows, result in a
value of property, plant and equipment, franchises, customer relationships and our total entity
value. The value of goodwill is the difference between the total entity value and amounts assigned
to the other assets. The use of different valuation assumptions or definitions of franchises or
customer relationships, such as our inclusion of the value of selling additional services to our
current customers within customer relationships versus franchises, could significantly impact our
valuations and any resulting impairment.

Franchises, for valuation purposes, are defined as the future economic benefits of the right to
solicit and service potential customers (customer marketing rights), and the right to deploy and
market new services such as interactivity and telephony to the potential customers (service
marketing rights). Fair value is determined based on estimated discounted future cash flows using
assumptions consistent with internal forecasts. The franchise after-tax cash flow is calculated as
the after-tax cash flow generated by the potential customers obtained and the new services added to
those customers in future periods. The sum of the present value of the franchises’ after-tax cash
flow in years 1 through 10 and the continuing value of the after-tax cash flow beyond year 10
yields the fair value of the franchise. Prior to the adoption of EITF Topic D-108,

Use of the
Residual Method to Value Acquired Assets Other than Goodwill

, discussed below, we followed a
residual method of valuing our franchise assets, which had the effect of including goodwill with
the franchise assets.

We follow the guidance of EITF Issue 02-17,

Recognition of Customer Relationship Intangible Assets
Acquired in a Business Combination,

in valuing customer relationships. Customer relationships, for
valuation purposes, represent



the value of the business relationship with our existing customers and are calculated by projecting
future after-tax cash flows from these customers including the right to deploy and market
additional services such as interactivity and telephony to these customers. The present value of
these after-tax cash flows yields the fair value of the customer relationships. Substantially all
our acquisitions occurred prior to January 1, 2002. We did not record any value associated with
the customer relationship intangibles related to those acquisitions. For acquisitions subsequent
to January 1, 2002, we did assign a value to the customer relationship intangible, which is
amortized over its estimated useful life.

In September 2004, EITF Topic D-108,

Use of the Residual Method to Value Acquired Assets Other than
Goodwill

, was issued, which requires the direct method of separately valuing all intangible assets
and does not permit goodwill to be included in franchise assets. We performed an impairment
assessment as of September 30, 2004, and adopted Topic D-108 in that assessment resulting in a
total franchise impairment of approximately $3.3 billion. We recorded a cumulative effect of
accounting change of $765 million (approximately $875 million before tax effects of $91 million and
minority interest effects of $19 million) for the year ended December 31, 2004 representing the
portion of our total franchise impairment attributable to no longer including goodwill with
franchise assets. The effect of the adoption was to increase net loss and loss per share by $765
million and $2.55 for the year ended December 31, 2004. The remaining $2.4 billion of the total
franchise impairment was attributable to the use of lower projected growth rates and the resulting
revised estimates of future cash flows in our valuation and was recorded as impairment of
franchises in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004.
Sustained analog video customer losses by us and our industry peers in the third quarter of 2004
primarily as a result of increased competition from DBS providers and decreased growth rates in our
and our industry peers’ high speed data customers in the third quarter of 2004, in part as a result
of increased competition from DSL providers, led us to lower our projected growth rates and
accordingly revise our estimates of future cash flows from those used at October 1, 2003. See
“Business — Competition.”

The valuation completed at October 1, 2003 showed franchise values in excess of book value and thus
resulted in no impairment. Our annual impairment assessment as of October 1, 2002, based on
revised estimates from January 1, 2002 of future cash flows and projected long-term growth rates in
our valuation, led to the recognition of a $4.6 billion impairment charge in the fourth quarter of
2002.

The valuations used in our impairment assessments involve numerous assumptions as noted above.
While economic conditions, applicable at the time of the valuation, indicate the combination of
assumptions utilized in the valuations are reasonable, as market conditions change so will the
assumptions with a resulting impact on the valuation and consequently the potential impairment
charge.

Income Taxes.

All operations are held through Charter Holdco and its direct and indirect
subsidiaries. Charter Holdco and the majority of its subsidiaries are not subject to income tax.
However, certain of these subsidiaries are corporations and are subject to income tax. All of the
taxable income, gains, losses, deductions and credits of Charter Holdco are passed through to its
members: Charter, Charter Investment, Inc. and Vulcan Cable III Inc. Charter is responsible for
its share of taxable income or loss of Charter Holdco allocated to it in accordance with the
Charter Holdco limited liability company agreement (“LLC Agreement”) and partnership tax rules and
regulations.



The LLC Agreement provided for certain special allocations of net tax profits and net tax losses
(such net tax profits and net tax losses being determined under the applicable federal income tax
rules for determining capital accounts). Under the LLC Agreement, through the end of 2003, net tax
losses of Charter Holdco that would otherwise have been allocated to Charter based generally on its
percentage ownership of outstanding common units were allocated instead to membership units held by
Vulcan Cable III Inc. and Charter Investment, Inc. (the “Special Loss Allocations”) to the extent
of their respective capital account balances. After 2003, under the LLC Agreement, net tax losses
of Charter Holdco are allocated to Charter, Vulcan Cable III Inc. and Charter Investment, Inc.
based generally on their respective percentage ownership of outstanding common units to the extent
of their respective capital account balances. The LLC Agreement further provides that, beginning
at the time Charter Holdco generates net tax profits, the net tax profits that would otherwise have
been allocated to Charter based generally on its percentage ownership of outstanding common
membership units will instead generally be allocated to Vulcan Cable III Inc. and Charter
Investment, Inc. (the “Special Profit Allocations”). The Special Profit Allocations to Vulcan
Cable III Inc. and Charter Investment, Inc. will generally continue until the cumulative amount of
the Special Profit Allocations offsets the cumulative amount of the Special Loss Allocations. The
amount and timing of the Special Profit Allocations are subject to the potential application of,
and interaction with, the Curative Allocation Provisions described in the following paragraph. The
LLC Agreement generally provides that any additional net tax profits are to be allocated among the
members of Charter Holdco based generally on their respective percentage ownership of Charter
Holdco common membership units.

Because the respective capital account balance of each of Vulcan Cable III Inc. and Charter
Investment, Inc. was reduced to zero by December 31, 2002, certain net tax losses of Charter Holdco
that were to be allocated for 2002, 2003, 2004 and possibly later
years, subject to resolution of the issue described in “Certain
Relationships and Related Transactions — Transactions Arising
out of Our Organizational Structure and Mr. Allen’s Investment
in Charter Communications, Inc. and Its Subsidiaries — Equity Put Rights —
CC VIII,” to Vulcan Cable III Inc.
and Charter Investment, Inc. instead have been and will be allocated to Charter (the “Regulatory Allocations”).
The LLC Agreement further provides that, to the extent possible, the effect of the Regulatory
Allocations is to be offset over time pursuant to certain curative allocation provisions (the
“Curative Allocation Provisions”) so that, after certain offsetting adjustments are made, each
member’s capital account balance is equal to the capital account balance such member would have had
if the Regulatory Allocations had not been part of the LLC Agreement. The cumulative amount of the
actual tax losses allocated to Charter as a result of the Regulatory Allocations through the year
ended December 31, 2004 is approximately $4.0 billion.

As a result of the Special Loss Allocations and the Regulatory Allocations referred to above, the
cumulative amount of losses of Charter Holdco allocated to Vulcan Cable III Inc. and Charter
Investment, Inc. is in excess of the amount that would have been allocated to such entities if the
losses of Charter Holdco had been allocated among its members in proportion to their respective
percentage ownership of Charter Holdco common membership units. The cumulative amount of such
excess losses was approximately $2.1 billion through December 31, 2003 and $1.0 billion through
December 31, 2004.

In certain situations, the Special Loss Allocations, Special Profit Allocations, Regulatory
Allocations and Curative Allocation Provisions described above could result in Charter paying taxes
in an amount that is more or less than if Charter Holdco had allocated net tax profits and net tax
losses among its members based generally on the number of common membership units owned by such
members. This could occur due to differences in (i) the character of the allocated income (e.g.,
ordinary versus capital), (ii) the allocated amount and timing of tax depreciation and tax
amortization expense due to the application of section 704(c) under the Internal Revenue Code,
(iii) the potential interaction between the Special Profit Allocations and the Curative Allocation
Provisions, (iv) the amount and timing of alternative minimum taxes paid by Charter, if any, (v)
the apportionment of the allocated income or loss among the states in which Charter Holdco does
business, and (vi) future federal and state tax laws. Further, in the event of new capital
contributions to Charter Holdco, it is possible that the tax effects of the Special Profit
Allocations, Special Loss Allocations, Regulatory Allocations and Curative Allocation Provisions
will change significantly pursuant to the provisions of the income
tax regulations or the terms of a contribution agreement with respect
to such contribution. Such change
could defer the actual tax benefits to be derived by Charter with respect to the net tax losses
allocated to it or accelerate the actual taxable income to Charter with respect to the net tax
profits allocated to it. As a result, it is possible under certain circumstances, that Charter
could receive future allocations of taxable income in excess of its currently allocated tax
deductions and available tax loss carryforwards. The ability to utilize net operating loss
carryforwards is potentially subject to certain limitations as discussed below.

In addition, under their exchange agreement with Charter, Vulcan Cable III Inc. and Charter
Investment, Inc. may exchange some or all of their membership units in Charter Holdco for Charter’s
Class B common stock, be merged with Charter, or be acquired by Charter in a non-taxable
reorganization. If such an exchange were to take place prior to the date that the Special Profit
Allocation provisions had fully offset the Special Loss Allocations, Vulcan



Cable III Inc. and Charter Investment, Inc. could elect to cause Charter Holdco to make the
remaining Special Profit Allocations to Vulcan Cable III Inc. and Charter Investment, Inc.
immediately prior to the consummation of the exchange. In the event Vulcan Cable III Inc. and
Charter Investment, Inc. choose not to make such election or to the extent such allocations are not
possible, Charter would then be allocated tax profits attributable to the membership units received
in such exchange pursuant to the Special Profit Allocation provisions. Mr. Allen has generally
agreed to reimburse Charter for any incremental income taxes that Charter would owe as a result of
such an exchange and any resulting future Special Profit Allocations
to Charter. The ability of Charter to utilize net operating loss
carryforwards is potentially subject to certain limitations
(See “Certain Trends and Uncertainties — Utilization of Net
Operating Loss Carryforwards”.) If Charter were to become
subject to such limitations (whether as a result of an exchange
described above or otherwise), and as a result were to owe taxes
resulting from the Special Profit Allocations, then Mr. Allen
may not be obligated to reimburse Charter for such income taxes.

As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, we have recorded net deferred income tax liabilities of $216
million and $417 million, respectively. Additionally, as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, we have
deferred tax assets of $3.5 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, which primarily relate to
financial and tax losses allocated to Charter from Charter Holdco. We are required to record a
valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income
tax assets will not be realized. Given the uncertainty surrounding our ability to utilize our
deferred tax assets, these items have been offset with a
corresponding valuation allowance of $3.2
billion and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for the tax years ending
December 31, 1999 and 2000. Management does not expect the results of this examination to have a
material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or our
liquidity, including our ability to comply with our debt covenants.

Litigation.

Legal contingencies have a high degree of uncertainty. When a loss from a contingency
becomes estimable and probable, a reserve is established. The reserve reflects management’s best
estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matter and is revised accordingly as
facts and circumstances change and, ultimately when the matter is brought to closure. We have
established reserves for certain matters including those described in “Business — Legal
Proceedings.’’ If any of the litigation matters described in “Business — Legal Proceedings’’ is
resolved unfavorably resulting in payment obligations in excess of management’s best estimate of
the outcome, such resolution could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
condition, results of operations or our liquidity.

Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003

Revenues.

Revenues increased by $158 million, or 3%, from $4.8 billion for the year ended December
31, 2003 to $5.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004. This increase is principally the
result of an increase of 318,800 and 2,800 high-speed data customers and digital video customers,
respectively, as well as price increases for video and high-speed data services, and is offset
partially by a decrease of 439,800 analog video customers. Included in the reduction in analog
video customers and reducing the increase in digital video and high-speed data customers are
230,800 analog video customers, 83,300 digital video customers and 37,800 high-speed data customers
sold in the cable system sales to Atlantic Broadband Finance, LLC, which closed in March and April
2004 (collectively, with the cable system sale to WaveDivision Holdings, LLC in October 2003,
referred to herein as the “Systems Sales”). The Systems Sales reduced the increase in revenues by
$160 million. Our goal is to increase revenues by improving



customer service which we believe will stabilize our analog video customer base, implementing price
increases on certain services and packages and increasing the number of our customers who purchase
high-speed data services, digital video and advanced products and services such as VOIP telephony,
VOD, high definition television and DVR service.

Average monthly revenue per analog video customer increased from $61.92 for the year ended December
31, 2003 to $68.02 for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily as a result of price increases
and incremental revenues from advanced services. Average monthly revenue per analog video customer
represents total annual revenue, divided by twelve, divided by the average number of analog video
customers during the respective period.

Revenues by service offering were as follows (dollars in millions):

Video revenues consist primarily of revenues from analog and digital video services provided to our
non-commercial customers. Video revenues decreased by $88 million, or 3%, from $3.5 billion for
the year ended December 31, 2003 to $3.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004.
Approximately $116 million of the decrease was the result of the Systems Sales and approximately an
additional $65 million related to a decline in analog video customers. These decreases were offset
by increases of approximately $66 million resulting from price increases and incremental video
revenues from existing customers and approximately $27 million resulting from an increase in
digital video customers.

Revenues from high-speed data services provided to our non-commercial customers increased $185
million, or 33%, from $556 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $741 million for the
year ended December 31, 2004. Approximately $163 million of the increase related to the increase
in the average number of customers receiving high-speed data services, whereas approximately $35
million related to the increase in average price of the service. The increase in high-speed data
revenues was reduced by approximately $12 million as a result of the Systems Sales.

Advertising sales revenues consist primarily of revenues from commercial advertising customers,
programmers and other vendors. Advertising sales increased $26 million, or 10%, from $263 million
for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $289 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 primarily
as a result of an increase in national advertising campaigns and election related advertising. The
increase was offset by a decrease of $7 million as a result of the System Sales. For the years
ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, we received $16 million and $15 million, respectively, in
advertising revenue from vendors.

Commercial revenues consist primarily of revenues from cable video and high-speed data services to
our commercial customers. Commercial revenues increased $34 million, or 17%, from $204 million for
the year ended December 31, 2003, to $238 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily
as a result of an increase in commercial high-speed data revenues. The increase was reduced by
approximately $14 million as a result of the Systems Sales.

Other revenues consist of revenues from franchise fees, telephony revenue, equipment rental,
customer installations, home shopping, dial-up Internet service, late payment fees, wire
maintenance fees and other miscellaneous revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003,
franchise fees represented approximately 49% and 48%, respectively, of total other revenues. Other
revenues increased $1 million from $335 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $336
million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily the



result of an increase in home shopping and infomercial revenue and was partially offset by
approximately $11 million as a result of the Systems Sales.

Operating expenses

.

Operating expenses increased $128 million, or 7%, from $2.0 billion for the
year ended December 31, 2003 to $2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in
operating expenses was reduced by approximately $59 million as a result of the System Sales.
Programming costs included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $1.3
billion and $1.2 billion, representing 63% and 64% of total operating expenses for the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Key expense components as a percentage of revenues were

Programming costs consist primarily of costs paid to programmers for analog, premium and digital
channels and pay-per-view programming. The increase in programming costs of $70 million, or 6%,
for the year ended December 31, 2004 over the year ended December 31, 2003 was a result of price
increases, particularly in sports programming, an increased number of channels carried on our
systems, and an increase in digital video customers, partially offset by a decrease in analog video
customers. Additionally, the increase in programming costs was reduced by $42 million as a result
of the Systems Sales. Programming costs were offset by the amortization of payments received from
programmers in support of launches of new channels of $59 million and $62 million for the year
ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Programming costs for the year ended December 31,
2004 also include a $5 million reduction related to the settlement of a dispute with TechTV, Inc.,
a related party. See Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements contained in “Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

In every year we have operated, our cable programming costs have increased in excess of the U.S.
inflation and cost-of-living increases, and we expect them to continue to increase because of a
variety of factors, including inflationary or negotiated annual increases, additional programming being provided to customers and increased
costs to purchase or produce programming. In 2005, we expect programming costs to increase at a
higher rate than in 2004. These costs will be determined in part on the outcome of programming
negotiations in 2005 and will likely be subject to offsetting events or otherwise affected by
factors similar to the ones mentioned in the preceding paragraph. Our increasing programming costs
will result in declining operating margins for our video services to the extent we are unable to
pass on cost increases to our customers. We expect to partially offset any resulting margin
compression from our traditional video services with revenue from advanced video services,
increased high-speed data revenues, advertising revenues and commercial service revenues.

Advertising sales expenses consist of costs related to traditional advertising services provided to
advertising customers, including salaries, benefits and commissions. Advertising sales expenses
increased $10 million, or 11%, primarily as a result of increased salary, benefit and commission
costs. The increase in advertising sales expenses was reduced by $2 million as a result of the
System Sales. Service costs consist primarily of service personnel salaries and benefits,
franchise fees, system utilities, Internet service provider fees, maintenance and pole rental
expense. The increase in service costs of $48 million, or 8%, resulted primarily from additional
activity associated with ongoing infrastructure maintenance. The increase in service costs was
reduced by $15 million as a result of the System Sales.

Selling, general and administrative expenses.

Selling, general and administrative expenses
increased by $31 million, or 3%, from $940 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $971
million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in selling, general and administrative
expenses was reduced by $22 million as a result of the System Sales. Key components of expense as
a percentage of revenues were as follows (dollars in millions):

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits, rent expense,
billing costs, call center costs, internal network costs, bad debt expense and property taxes. The
increase in general and administrative expenses of $16 million, or 2%, resulted primarily from
increases in costs associated with our commercial business of $21 million, third party call center
costs resulting from increased emphasis on customer service of $10 million and bad debt expense of
$10 million offset by decreases in costs associated with salaries and benefits of $21 million and
rent expense of $3 million.

Marketing expenses increased $15 million, or 14%, as a result of an increased investment in
marketing and branding campaigns.

Depreciation and amortization.

Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $42 million, or
3%, to $1.5 billion in 2004. The increase in depreciation related to an increase in capital
expenditures, which was partially offset by lower depreciation as the result of the Systems Sales.

Impairment of franchises.

We performed an impairment assessment during the third quarter of 2004.
The use of lower projected growth rates and the resulting revised estimates of future cash flows in
our valuation, primarily as a result of increased competition, led to the recognition of a $2.4
billion impairment charge for the year ended December 31, 2004.

(Gain) loss on sale of assets, net.

Gain on sale of assets of $86 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004 primarily represents the pretax gain of $104 million realized on the sale of
systems to Atlantic Broadband Finance, LLC which closed in March and April 2004 offset by losses
recognized on the disposition of plant and equipment. Loss on sale of assets of $5 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003 represents the loss recognized on the disposition of plant and
equipment offset by a gain of $21 million recognized on the sale of cable systems in Port Orchard,
Washington which closed on October 1, 2003.

Option compensation expense, net.

Option compensation expense of $31 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004 primarily represents $22 million related to options granted and expensed in
accordance with SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.

Additionally, during the
year ended December 31, 2004, we expensed approximately $8 million related to a stock option
exchange program, under which our employees were offered the right to exchange all stock options
(vested and unvested) issued under the 1999 Charter Communications Option Plan and 2001 Stock
Incentive Plan that had an exercise price over $10 per share for shares of restricted Charter Class
A common stock or, in some instances, cash. The exchange offer closed in February 2004. Option
compensation expense of $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 primarily represents
options expensed in accordance with SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.

See
Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements contained in “Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data” for more information regarding our option compensation plans.

Special charges, net

.

Special charges of $104 million for the year ended December 31, 2004
represents approximately $85 million of aggregate value of the Charter Class A common stock and
warrants to purchase Charter Class A common stock contemplated to be issued as part of a settlement
of the consolidated federal class actions, state derivative actions and federal derivative action
lawsuits, approximately $10 million of litigation costs related to the tentative settlement of a
South Carolina national class action suit, all of which settlements are subject to final
documentation and court approval and approximately $12 million of severance and related costs of
our workforce reduction and realignment. Special charges for the year ended December 31, 2004 were
offset by $3 million received from a third party in settlement of a dispute. Special charges of
$21 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 represents approximately $26 million of severance
and related costs of our workforce reduction



partially offset by a $5 million credit from a settlement from the Internet service provider
Excite@Home related to the conversion of about 145,000 high-speed data customers to our Charter
Pipeline service in 2001.

Unfavorable contracts and other settlements

.

Unfavorable contracts and other settlements of $5
million for the year ended December 31, 2004 relates to changes in estimated legal reserves
established in connection with prior business combinations, which based on an evaluation of current
facts and circumstances, are no longer required.

Unfavorable contracts and other settlements of $72 million for the year ended December 31, 2003
represents the settlement of estimated liabilities recorded in connection with prior business
combinations. The majority of this benefit (approximately $52 million) is due to the renegotiation
in 2003 of a major programming contract, for which a liability had been recorded for the above
market portion of that agreement in conjunction with the Falcon acquisition in 1999 and the Bresnan
acquisition in 2000. The remaining benefit relates to the reversal of previously recorded
liabilities, which are no longer required.

Interest expense, net.

Net interest expense increased by $113 million, or 7%, from $1.6 billion for
the year ended December 31, 2003 to $1.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004. The
increase in net interest expense was a result of an increase in our average borrowing rate from
7.99% in the year ended December 31, 2003 to 8.66% in the year ended December 31, 2004 partially
offset by a decrease of $306 million in average debt outstanding from $18.9 billion in 2003 to
$18.6 billion in 2004.

Gain (loss) on derivative instruments and hedging activities, net.

Net gain on derivative
instruments and hedging activities increased $4 million from a gain of $65 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003 to a gain of $69 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The
increase is primarily the result of an increase in gains on interest rate agreements that do not
qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,

which increased from a gain of $57 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to a
gain of $65 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. This was coupled with a decrease in
gains on interest rate agreements, as a result of hedge ineffectiveness on designated hedges, which
increased from $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004.

Loss on debt to equity conversions

.

Loss on debt to equity conversions of $23 million for the year
ended December 31, 2004 represents the loss recognized from privately negotiated exchanges of a
total of $30 million principal amount of Charter’s 5.75% convertible senior notes held by two
unrelated parties for shares of Charter Class A common stock. The exchange resulted in the
issuance of more shares in the exchange transaction than would have been issuable under the
original terms of the convertible senior notes.

Gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt.

Loss on extinguishment of debt of $31 million for the year
ended December 31, 2004 represents the write-off of deferred financing fees and third party costs
related to the Charter Communications Operating refinancing in April 2004 and the redemption of our
5.75% convertible senior notes due 2005 in December 2004. Gain on extinguishment of debt of $267
million for the year ended December 31, 2003 represents the gain realized on the purchase of an
aggregate $609 million principal amount of our outstanding convertible senior notes and $1.3
billion principal amount of Charter Holdings’ senior notes and senior discount notes in
consideration for an aggregate of $1.6 billion principal amount of 10.25% notes due 2010 issued by
our indirect subsidiary, CCH II. The gain is net of the write-off of deferred financing costs
associated with the retired debt of $27 million.

Other, net.

Net other expense decreased by $19 million from $16 million in 2003 to income of $3
million in 2004. Other expense in 2003 included $11 million associated with amending a revolving
credit facility of our subsidiaries and costs associated with terminated debt transactions that did
not recur in 2004. In addition, gains on equity investments increased $7 million in 2004 over
2003.

Minority interest.

Minority interest represents the 2% accretion of the preferred membership
interests in our indirect subsidiary, CC VIII, LLC, and since June 6, 2003, the pro rata share of
the profits and losses of CC VIII, LLC. See “Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related
Transactions — Transactions Arising out of Our Organizational Structure and Mr. Allen’s Investment
in Charter Communications, Inc. and Its Subsidiaries — Equity Put Rights — CC VIII.” Reported
losses allocated to minority interest on the statement of operations are limited to the extent of
any remaining minority interest on the balance sheet related to Charter Holdco. Because minority
interest in Charter Holdco was substantially eliminated at December 31, 2003, beginning in the
first quarter of 2004, Charter began to absorb substantially all future losses before income taxes
that otherwise would have been allocated to minority interest. For the year ended December 31,
2003, 53.5% of our losses were allocated to minority interest. As a result of negative equity at
Charter Holdco during the year ended December 31, 2004, no additional losses were



allocated to minority interest, resulting in an additional $2.4 billion of net losses. Under our
existing capital structure, future losses will be substantially absorbed by Charter.

Income tax benefit.

Income tax benefit of $103 million and $110 million was recognized for the
years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The income tax benefits were realized as a
result of decreases in certain deferred tax liabilities related to our investment in Charter Holdco
as well as decreases in the deferred tax liabilities of certain of our indirect corporate
subsidiaries.

The income tax benefit recognized in the year ended December 31, 2004 was directly related to the
impairment of franchises as discussed above because the deferred tax liabilities decreased as a
result of the write-down of franchise assets for financial statement purposes and not for tax
purposes. We do not expect to recognize a similar benefit associated with the impairment of
franchises in future periods. However, the actual tax provision calculations in future periods
will be the result of current and future temporary differences, as well as future operating
results.

The income tax benefit recognized in the year ended December 31, 2003 was directly related to the
tax losses allocated to Charter from Charter Holdco. In the second quarter of 2003, Charter
started receiving tax loss allocations from Charter Holdco. Previously, the tax losses had been
allocated to Vulcan Cable III Inc. and Charter Investment, Inc. in accordance with the Special Loss
Allocations provided under the Charter Holdco limited liability company agreement. We do not
expect to recognize a similar benefit related to our investment in Charter Holdco after 2003
related to tax loss allocations received from Charter Holdco, due to limitations associated with
our ability to offset future tax benefits against the remaining deferred tax liabilities. However,
the actual tax provision calculations in future periods will be the result of current and future
temporary differences, as well as future operating results.

Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax.

Cumulative effect of accounting change of $765
million (net of minority interest effects of $19 million and tax effects of $91 million) in 2004
represents the impairment charge recorded as a result of our adoption of Topic D-108.

Net loss.

Net loss increased by $4.1 billion from $238 million in 2003 to $4.3 billion in 2004 as a
result of the factors described above. The impact to net loss in 2004 of the impairment of
franchises, cumulative effect of accounting change and the reduction in losses allocated to
minority interest was to increase net loss by approximately $5.3 billion. The impact to net loss
in 2003 of the gain on the sale of systems, unfavorable contracts and settlements and gain on debt
exchange, net of income tax impact, was to decrease net loss by $168 million.

Preferred stock dividends.

On August 31, 2001, in connection with the Cable USA acquisition,
Charter issued 505,664 shares (and on February 28, 2003 issued an additional 39,595 shares) of
Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock, on which it pays a quarterly cumulative cash
dividend at an annual rate of 5.75% on a liquidation preference of $100 per share.

Loss per common share.

The loss per common share increased by $13.65, from $0.82 per common share
for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $14.47 per common share for the year ended December 31,
2004 as a result of the factors described above.

Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002

Revenues.

Revenues increased by $253 million, or 6%, from $4.6 billion for the year ended December
31, 2002 to $4.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003. This increase is principally the
result of an increase of 427,500 high-speed data customers, as well as price increases for video
and high-speed data services, and is offset partially by a decrease of 147,500 and 10,900 in analog
and digital video customers, respectively. Included within the decrease of analog and digital
video customers and reducing the increase of high-speed data customers are 25,500 analog video
customers, 12,500 digital video customers and 12,200 high-speed data customers sold in the Port
Orchard, Washington sale on October 1, 2003.

Average monthly revenue per analog video customer increased from $56.91 for the year ended December
31, 2002 to $61.92 for the year ended December 31, 2003 primarily as a result of price increases
and incremental revenues from advanced services. Average monthly revenue per analog video customer
represents total annual revenue, divided by twelve, divided by the average number of analog video
customers during the respective period.

Video revenues consist primarily of revenues from analog and digital video services provided to our
non-commercial customers. Video revenues increased by $41 million, or 1%, for the year ended
December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. Video revenues increased
approximately $65 million due to price increases and incremental video revenues from existing
customers and $82 million as a result of increases in the average number of digital video
customers, which were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $106 million as a result of a
decline in analog video customers.

Revenues from high-speed data services provided to our non-commercial customers increased $219
million, or 65%, from $337 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to $556 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003. Approximately $206 million of the increase related to the increase
in the average number of customers, whereas approximately $13 million related to the increase in
the average price of the service. The increase in customers was primarily due to the addition of
high-speed data customers in our existing service areas. We were also able to offer this service
to more of our customers, as the estimated percentage of homes passed that could receive high-speed
data service increased from 82% as of December 31, 2002 to 87% as of December 31, 2003 as a result
of our system upgrades.

Advertising sales revenues consist primarily of revenues from commercial advertising customers,
programmers and other vendors. Advertising sales decreased $39 million, or 13%, from $302 million
for the year ended December 31, 2002, to $263 million for the year ended December 31, 2003
primarily as a result of a decrease in advertising from vendors of approximately $64 million offset
partially by an increase in local advertising sales revenues of approximately $25 million. For the
years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, we received $15 million and $79 million, respectively, in
advertising revenue from vendors.

Commercial revenues consist primarily of revenues from video and high-speed data services to our
commercial customers. Commercial revenues increased $43 million, or 27%, from $161 million for the
year ended December 31, 2002, to $204 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, primarily due
to an increase in commercial high-speed data revenues.

Other revenues consist of revenues from franchise fees, equipment rental, customer installations,
home shopping, dial-up Internet service, late payment fees, wire maintenance fees and other
miscellaneous revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, franchise fees represented
approximately 48% and 46%, respectively, of total other revenues. Other revenues decreased $11
million, or 3%, from $346 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to $335 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in franchise fees after an
FCC ruling in March 2002, no longer requiring the collection of franchise fees for high-speed data
services . Franchise fee revenues are collected from customers and remitted to franchise
authorities.

The decrease in accounts receivable of 27% compared to the increase in revenues of 6% is primarily
due to the timing of collection of receivables from programmers for fees associated with the
launching of their networks coupled with our tightened credit and collections policy. These fees
from programmers are not recorded as revenue but, rather, are recorded as reductions of programming
expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Programmer receivables decreased
$40 million, or 57%, from $70 million as of December 31, 2002 to $30 million as of December 31,
2003.



Operating expenses

.

Operating expenses increased $145 million, or 8%, from $1.8 billion for the
year ended December 31, 2002 to $2.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003. Programming
costs included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $1.2 billion and $1.2
billion, representing 64% and 65% of total operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2003
and 2002, respectively. Key expense components as a percentage of revenues are as follows (dollars

Programming costs consist primarily of costs paid to programmers for analog, premium and digital
channels and pay-per-view programs. The increase in programming costs of $83 million, or 7%, was
due to price increases, particularly in sports programming, and due to an increased number of
channels carried on our systems, partially offset by decreases in analog and digital video
customers. Programming costs were offset by the amortization of payments received from programmers
in support of launches of new channels against programming costs of $62 million and $57 million for
the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Advertising sales expenses consist of costs related to traditional advertising services provided to
advertising customers, including salaries and benefits and commissions. Advertising sales expenses
increased $1 million, or 1%, primarily due to increased sales commissions, taxes and benefits.
Service costs consist primarily of service personnel salaries and benefits, franchise fees, system
utilities, Internet service provider fees, maintenance and pole rental expense. The increase in
service costs of $61 million, or 11%, resulted primarily from additional activity associated with
ongoing infrastructure maintenance and customer service, including activities associated with our
promotional programs.

Selling, general and administrative expenses.

Selling, general and administrative expenses
decreased by $23 million, or 2%, from $963 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to $940
million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Key components of expense as a percentage of
revenues are as follows (dollars in millions):

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits, rent expense,
billing costs, call center costs, internal network costs, bad debt expense and property taxes. The
increase in general and administrative expenses of $23 million, or 3%, resulted primarily from
increases in salaries and benefits of $4 million, call center costs of $25 million and internal
network costs of $16 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in bad debt and
collection expense of $27 million as a result of our strengthened credit policies.

Marketing expenses decreased $46 million, or 30%, due to reduced promotional activity related to
our service offerings including reductions in advertising, telemarketing and direct sales
activities.

Depreciation and amortization.

Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $17 million, or
1%, from $1.4 billion in 2002 to $1.5 billion in 2003 due primarily to an increase in depreciation
expense related to additional capital expenditures in 2003 and 2002.



Impairment of franchises.

We performed our annual impairment assessments on October 1, 2002 and
2003. Revised estimates of future cash flows and the use of a lower projected long-term growth
rate in our valuation led to a $4.6 billion impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2002. Our
2003 assessment performed on October 1, 2003 did not result in an impairment.

Loss on sale of assets, net.

Loss on sale of assets for the year ended December 31, 2003
represents $26 million of losses related to the disposition of fixed assets offset by the $21
million gain recognized on the sale of cable systems in Port Orchard, Washington on October 1,
2003. Loss on sale of assets for the year ended December 31, 2002 represents losses related to the
disposition of fixed assets.

Option compensation expense, net.

Option compensation expense decreased by $1 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31, 2002. Option compensation expense
includes expense related to exercise prices on certain options that were issued prior to our
initial public offering in 1999 that were less than the estimated fair values of our common stock
at the time of grant. Compensation expense is being recognized over the vesting period of such
options and will continue to be recorded until the last vesting period lapses in April 2004. On
January 1, 2003, we adopted SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,

using the
prospective method under which we will recognize compensation expense of a stock-based award to an
employee over the vesting period based on the fair value of the award on the grant date.

Special charges, net.

Special charges of $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 represent
approximately $26 million of severance and related costs of our ongoing initiative to reduce our
workforce partially offset by a $5 million credit from a settlement from the Internet service
provider Excite@Home related to the conversion of about 145,000 high-speed data customers to our
Charter Pipeline service in 2001. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we recorded a special charge of
$35 million, of which $31 million was associated with our workforce reduction program. The
remaining $4 million was related to legal and other costs associated with our shareholder lawsuits
and governmental investigations.

Unfavorable contracts and other settlements.

Unfavorable contracts and other settlements of $72
million for the year ended December 31, 2003 represents the settlement of estimated liabilities
recorded in connection with prior business combinations. The majority of this benefit
(approximately $52 million) is due to the renegotiation in 2003 of a major programming contract,
for which a liability had been recorded for the above market portion of that agreement in
connection with a 1999 and a 2000 acquisition. The remaining benefit relates to the reversal of
previously recorded liabilities, which, based on an evaluation of current facts and circumstances,
are no longer required.

Interest expense, net.

Net interest expense increased by $54 million, or 4%, from $1.5 billion for
the year ended December 31, 2002 to $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003. The
increase in net interest expense was a result of increased average debt outstanding in 2003 of
$18.9 billion compared to $17.8 billion in 2002, partially offset by a decrease in our average
borrowing rate from 8.02% in 2002 to 7.99% in 2003. The increased debt was primarily used for
capital expenditures.

Gain (loss) on derivative instruments and hedging activities, net.

Net gain on derivative
instruments and hedging activities increased $180 million from a loss of $115 million for the year
ended December 31, 2002 to a gain of $65 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The
increase is primarily due to an increase in gains on interest rate agreements, which do not qualify
for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,

which increased from a loss of $101 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to a
gain of $57 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.

Gain on debt exchange, net.

Net gain on debt exchange of $267 million for the year ended December
31, 2003 represents the gain realized on the purchase, in a non-monetary transaction, of a total of
$609 million principal amount of our outstanding convertible senior notes and $1.3 billion
principal amount of Charter Holdings’ senior notes and senior discount notes in consideration for a
total of $1.6 billion principal amount of 10.25% notes due 2010 issued by our indirect subsidiary,
CCH II. The gain is net of the write-off of deferred financing costs associated with the retired
debt of $27 million.

Other expense, net.

Other expense increased by $12 million from $4 million in 2002 to $16 million
in 2003. This increase is primarily due to increases in costs associated with amending a revolving
credit facility of our subsidiaries and costs associated with terminated debt transactions.



Minority interest.

Minority interest represents the allocation of losses to the minority interest
based on ownership of Charter Holdco, the 10% dividend on preferred membership units in our
indirect subsidiary, Charter Helicon, LLC and the 2% accretion of the preferred membership
interests in our indirect subsidiary, CC VIII, LLC, and since June 6, 2003, the pro rata share of
the profits of CC VIII, LLC. See “Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions —
Transactions Arising out of Our Organizational Structure and Mr. Allen’s Investment in Charter
Communications, Inc. and Its Subsidiaries — Equity Put Rights — CC VIII.”

Income tax benefit.

Income tax benefit of $110 million and $460 million was recognized for the
years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The income tax benefits were realized as a
result of decreases in certain deferred tax liabilities related to our investment in Charter Holdco
as well as decreases in the deferred tax liabilities of certain of our indirect corporate
subsidiaries.

The income tax benefit recognized in the year ended December 31, 2003 was directly related to the
tax losses allocated to Charter from Charter Holdco. In the second quarter of 2003, Charter
started receiving tax loss allocations from Charter Holdco. Previously, the tax losses had been
allocated to Vulcan Cable III Inc. and Charter Investment, Inc. in accordance with the Special Loss
Allocations provided under the Charter Holdco limited liability company agreement. We do not
expect to recognize a similar benefit after 2003 related to tax loss allocations received from
Charter Holdco, due to limitations associated with our ability to offset future tax benefits
against the remaining deferred tax liabilities. However, the actual tax provision calculations in
future periods will be the result of current and future temporary differences, as well as future
operating results.

The income tax benefit recognized in the year ended December 31, 2002 was directly related to the
impairment of franchises associated with the adoption of SFAS No. 142.

Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax.

Cumulative effect of accounting change in 2002
represents the impairment charge recorded as a result of adopting SFAS No. 142.

Net loss.

Net loss decreased by $2.3 billion, or 91%, from $2.5 billion in 2002 to $238 million in
2003 as a result of the factors described above. The impact of the gain on sale of system,
unfavorable contracts and settlements and gain on debt exchange, net of minority interest and
income tax impacts, was to decrease net loss by $168 million in 2003. The impact of the impairment
of franchises and the cumulative effect of accounting change, net of minority interest and income
tax impacts, was to increase net loss by $1.6 billion in 2002.

Preferred stock dividends.

On August 31, 2001, in connection with the Cable USA acquisition,
Charter issued 505,664 shares (and on February 28, 2003 issued an additional 39,595 shares) of
Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock, on which it pays a quarterly cumulative cash
dividend at an annual rate of 5.75% on a liquidation preference of $100 per share.

Loss per common share.

Loss per common share decreased by $7.73, from $8.55 per common share for
the year ended December 31, 2002 to $0.82 per common share for the year ended December 31, 2003 as
a result of the factors described above.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Introduction

This section contains a discussion of our liquidity and capital resources, including a discussion
of our cash position, sources and uses of cash, access to credit facilities and other financing
sources, historical financing activities, cash needs, capital expenditures and outstanding debt.

Overview

We have a significant level of debt. In 2005, $30 million of our debt matures, and in 2006, an
additional $186 million matures. In 2007 and beyond, significant additional amounts will become
due under our remaining long-term debt obligations.

Our business requires significant cash to fund debt service costs, capital expenditures and ongoing
operations. We have historically funded our debt service costs, operating activities and capital
requirements through cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under the credit facilities
of our subsidiaries, sales of assets, issuances of debt and equity securities and cash on hand.
However, the mix of funding sources changes from period to period. For



the year ended December 31, 2004, we generated $472 million of net cash flows from operating
activities after paying cash interest of $1.3 billion. In addition, we generated approximately
$744 million in 2004 from sales of assets, substantially all of which was used to fund operations,
including capital expenditures. Finally, we had net cash flows from financing activities of $294
million, which included, among other things, the proceeds from the issuance in December of $550
million of CCO Holdings notes. This debt issuance was the primary reason cash on hand increased by
$523 million to $650 million at December 31, 2004. Approximately $622 million was used to repay
outstanding borrowings under the Charter Operating revolving credit facility, through a series of
transactions executed in February 2005. We expect that our mix of sources of funds will continue
to change in the future based on overall needs relative to our cash flow and on the availability of
funds under the credit facilities of our subsidiaries, our access to the debt and equity markets,
the timing of possible asset sales and our ability to generate cash flows from operating
activities.

We expect that cash on hand, cash flows from operating activities and the amounts available under
our credit facilities will be adequate to meet our cash needs in 2005. Cash flows from operating
activities and amounts available under our credit facilities may not be sufficient to permit us to
fund our operations and satisfy our principal repayment obligations that come due in 2006 and, we
believe, such amounts will not be sufficient to fund our operations and satisfy such repayment
obligations thereafter.

It is likely that we will
require additional funding to repay debt maturing after 2006. We are working with our financial advisors to address such funding requirements.
However, there can be no assurance that such funding will be available to us. Although Mr. Allen
and his affiliates have purchased equity from us in the past, Mr. Allen and his affiliates are not
obligated to purchase equity from, contribute to or loan funds to us in the future.

Credit Facilities and Covenants

Our ability to operate depends upon, among other things, our continued access to capital, including
credit under the Charter Operating credit facilities. These credit facilities, along with our and
our subsidiaries’ indentures, are subject to certain restrictive covenants, some of which require
us to maintain specified financial ratios and meet financial tests and to provide audited financial
statements with an unqualified opinion from our independent auditors. As of December 31, 2004, we
were in compliance with the covenants under our indentures and under the credit facilities and
indentures of our subsidiaries, and we expect to remain in compliance with those covenants for the
next twelve months. As of December 31, 2004, we had borrowing availability under our credit
facilities of $804 million, none of which was restricted due to covenants. Continued access to our
credit facilities is subject to our remaining in compliance with the applicable covenants of these
credit facilities, including covenants tied to our operating performance. If our operating
performance results in non-compliance with these covenants, or if any of certain other events of
non-compliance under these credit facilities or indentures governing our debt occurs, funding under
the credit facilities may not be available and defaults on some or potentially all of our debt
obligations could occur. An event of default under the covenants governing any of our debt
instruments could result in the acceleration of our payment obligations under that debt and, under
certain circumstances, in cross-defaults under our other debt obligations, which could have a
material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.

The Charter Operating credit facilities require us to redeem the CC V Holdings notes within 45 days
after the first date that the Charter Holdings leverage ratio is less than 8.75 to 1.0. In
satisfaction of this requirement, CC V Holdings, LLC has called for redemption all of its
outstanding notes, at 103.958% of principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
redemption, which is expected to be March 14, 2005. The total cost of the redemption including
accrued and unpaid interest is expected to be $122 million. We intend to fund the redemption with
borrowings under our credit facilities.

Specific Limitations

Our ability to make interest payments on our convertible senior notes, and, in 2006 and 2009, to
repay the outstanding principal of our convertible senior notes, will depend on our ability to
raise additional capital and/or on receipt of payments or distributions from Charter Holdco or its
subsidiaries, including CCH II, CCO Holdings and Charter Operating. The indentures governing the
CCH II notes, CCO Holdings notes, and Charter Operating notes, however, restrict these entities and
their subsidiaries from making distributions to their parent companies (including us) for payment
of interest and principal on our convertible senior notes, in each case unless there is no default
under the applicable indenture and a specified leverage ratio test is met at the time of such
event. CCH II, CCO Holdings and Charter Operating meet the applicable leverage ratio test under
each of their



respective indentures, and as a result are not prohibited from making any such distributions to
their respective direct parent.

The indentures governing the Charter Holdings notes permit Charter Holdings to make distributions
to Charter Holdco for payment of interest or principal on the convertible senior notes, only if,
after giving effect to the distribution, Charter Holdings can incur additional debt under the
leverage ratio of 8.75 to 1.0, there is no default under the Charter Holdings’ indentures and other
specified tests are met. For the quarter ended December 31, 2004, there was no default under
Charter Holdings’ indentures and other specified tests were met. In addition, Charter Holdings met
the leverage ratio of 8.75 to 1.0 based on December 31, 2004 financial results. As a result,
distributions from Charter Holdings to Charter or Charter Holdco are not currently restricted.
Such distributions will again be restricted, however, if Charter Holdings fails to meet its
leverage ratio test at the time of such event. In the past Charter Holdings has from time to time
failed to meet this leverage ratio test, and there can be no assurance that Charter Holdings will
satisfy this test in the future.

During periods when such distributions are restricted, the indentures governing the Charter
Holdings notes permit Charter Holdings and its subsidiaries to make specified investments in
Charter Holdco or Charter, up to an amount determined by a formula, as long as there is no default
under the indentures. As of December 31, 2004, Charter Holdco had $106 million in cash on hand and
was owed $29 million in intercompany loans from its subsidiaries, which were available to pay
interest on Charter’s 4.75% convertible senior notes, which is expected to be approximately $7
million in 2005. In addition, Charter has $144 million of securities pledged as security for the
first six interest payments on Charter’s 5.875% convertible senior notes.

Our significant amount of debt could negatively affect our ability to access additional capital in
the future. No assurances can be given that we will not experience liquidity problems if we do not
obtain sufficient additional financing on a timely basis as our debt becomes due or because of
adverse market conditions, increased competition or other unfavorable events. If, at any time,
additional capital or borrowing capacity is required beyond amounts internally generated or
available under our credit facilities or through additional debt or equity financings, we would
consider:

If the above strategies are not successful, we could be forced to restructure our obligations or
seek protection under the bankruptcy laws. In addition, if we need to raise additional capital
through the issuance of equity or find it necessary to engage in a recapitalization or other
similar transaction, our shareholders could suffer significant dilution and our noteholders might
not receive principal and interest payments to which they are contractually entitled.

Sale of Assets

In March 2004, we closed the sale of certain cable systems in Florida, Pennsylvania, Maryland,
Delaware and West Virginia to Atlantic Broadband Finance, LLC. We closed the sale of an additional
cable system in New York to Atlantic Broadband Finance, LLC in April 2004. Subject to post-closing
contractual adjustments, the total net proceeds from the sale of all of these systems were
approximately $733 million. The proceeds received to date were used to repay a portion of our
credit facilities.

The following items are not included in the contractual obligations table because the obligations
are not fixed and/or determinable due to various factors discussed below. However, we incur these
costs as part of our operations:

•

We also rent utility poles used in our operations. Generally, pole rentals are
cancelable on short notice, but we anticipate that such rentals will recur. Rent expense
incurred for pole rental attachments for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
was $43 million, $40 million and $41 million, respectively.

•

We pay franchise fees under multi-year franchise agreements based on a percentage of
revenues earned from video service per year. We also pay other franchise related costs,
such as public education grants under multi-year agreements. Franchise fees and other
franchise-related costs included in the accompanying statement of operations were $164
million, $162 million and $160 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively.

•

We also have $166 million in letters of credit, primarily to our various worker’s
compensation, property casualty and general liability carriers as collateral for
reimbursement of claims. These letters of credit reduce the amount we may borrow under our
credit facilities.

Historical Operating, Financing and Investing Activities



We held $650 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2004 compared to $127 million
as of December 31, 2003. The increase in cash and cash equivalents reflects the proceeds of the
sale of the CCO Holdings notes in December 2004. Approximately $622 million was used to repay
outstanding borrowings under the Charter Operating revolving credit facility through a series of
transactions executed in February 2005.

Operating Activities.

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $293 million, or 38%,
from $765 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $472 million for the year ended December
31, 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2004, net cash provided by operating activities
decreased primarily as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities that provided $83
million less cash during the year ended December 31, 2004 than the corresponding period in 2003 and
an increase in cash interest expense of $203 million over the corresponding prior period. The
change in operating assets and liabilities is primarily the result of the benefit in the year ended
December 31, 2003 from collection of receivables from programmers related to network launches,
while accounts receivable remained essentially flat in the year ended December 31, 2004.

Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $765
million and $748 million, respectively. Operating activities provided $17 million more cash in
2003 than in 2002 primarily due to an increase in revenue over cash costs year over year partially
offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities that provided $82 million less cash in 2003
than in 2002.

Investing Activities.

Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004
and 2003 was $243 million and $817 million, respectively. Investing activities used $574 million
less cash during the year ended December 31, 2004 than the corresponding period in 2003 primarily
as a result of cash provided by proceeds from the sale of certain cable systems to Atlantic
Broadband Finance, LLC offset by increased cash used for capital expenditures.

Net cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $817
million and $2.4 billion, respectively. Investing activities used $1.5 billion less cash in 2003
than in 2002 primarily as a result of reductions in capital expenditures and acquisitions.
Purchases of property, plant and equipment used $1.3 billion less cash in 2003 than in 2002 as a
result of reduced rebuild and upgrade activities and our efforts to reduce capital expenditures.
Payments for acquisitions used $139 million less cash in 2003 than in 2002.

Financing Activities.

Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31,
2004 was $294 million and the net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31,
2003 was $142 million. The increase in cash provided during the year ended December 31, 2004, as
compared to the corresponding period in 2003, was primarily the result of an increase in borrowings
of long-term debt and proceeds from issuance of debt reduced by repayments of long-term debt.

Net cash used in financing activities was $142 million for the year ended December 31, 2003,
whereas net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $1.9
billion. Financing activities provided $2.1 billion less cash in 2003 than in 2002. The decrease
in cash provided in 2003 compared to 2002 was primarily due to a decrease in borrowings of
long-term debt.

Capital Expenditures

We have significant ongoing capital expenditure requirements. However, we experienced a
significant decline in such requirements starting in 2003. This decline was primarily the result
of a substantial reduction in rebuild costs as our network had been largely upgraded and rebuilt in
prior years. Capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions of cable systems, were $924 million,
$854 million and $2.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
The majority of the capital expenditures in 2004 and 2003 related to our customer premise equipment
costs. The majority of the capital expenditures in 2002 related to our rebuild and upgrade program
and purchases of customer premise equipment. See the table below for more details.

Upgrading our cable systems has enabled us to offer digital television, high-speed data services,
VOD, interactive services, additional channels and tiers, and expanded pay-per-view options to a
larger customer base. Our capital expenditures are funded primarily from cash flows from operating
activities, the issuance of debt and borrowings under credit facilities. In addition, during the
years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, our liabilities related to capital expenditures
decreased $43 million, $33 million and $55 million, respectively.



During 2005, we expect
capital expenditures to increase to approximately $1 billion. The increase in
capital expenditures for 2005 compared to 2004 is the result of expected increases in telephony
services and deployment of advanced digital boxes. We expect that the nature of these expenditures
will continue to be composed primarily of purchases of customer premise equipment and for scalable
infrastructure costs. We expect to fund capital expenditures for 2005 primarily from cash flows
from operating activities and borrowings under our credit facilities.

We have adopted capital expenditure disclosure guidance, which was developed by eleven publicly
traded cable system operators, including Charter, with the support of the National Cable &
Telecommunications Association (“NCTA”). The new disclosure is intended to provide more
consistency in the reporting of operating statistics in capital expenditures and customers among
peer companies in the cable industry. These disclosure guidelines are not required disclosure
under GAAP, nor do they impact our accounting for capital expenditures under GAAP.

The following table presents our major capital expenditures categories in accordance with NCTA
disclosure guidelines for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 (dollars in millions):

In general, the obligors have the right to redeem all of the notes set forth in the above
table (except with respect to the 5.875% convertible senior notes due 2009 and the Charter
Holdings notes with terms of eight years) in whole or part at their option, beginning at
various times prior to their stated maturity dates, subject to certain conditions, upon the
payment of the outstanding principal amount (plus a specified redemption premium) and all
accrued and unpaid interest. The 5.875% convertible senior notes are redeemable if the
closing price of our Class A common stock exceeds the conversion price by certain percentages
as described below. For additional information, see Note 9 to our consolidated financial
statements contained in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

(c)

The 4.75% convertible senior notes and the 5.875% convertible senior notes are convertible at
the option of the holders into shares of Class A common stock at a conversion rate, subject to
certain adjustments, of 38.0952 and 413.2231 shares, respectively, per $1,000 principal amount
of notes, which is equivalent to a price of $26.25 and $2.42 per share, respectively. Certain
anti-dilutive provisions cause adjustments to occur



automatically upon the occurrence of specified events. Additionally, the conversion ratio may
be adjusted by us when deemed appropriate.

(d)

The Charter Operating credit facilities require us to redeem the CC V Holdings notes within
45 days after the first date that the Charter Holdings leverage ratio is less than 8.75 to
1.0. In satisfaction of this requirement. CC V Holdings, LLC has called for redemption all of
its outstanding notes, at 103.958% of principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to
the date of redemption, which is anticipated to be March 14, 2005. We are not required to
redeem any of the other notes listed above prior to their stated maturity dates.

As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, our long-term debt totaled approximately $19.5
billion and $18.6 billion, respectively. This debt was comprised of approximately $5.5 billion and
$7.2 billion of credit facility debt, $13.3 billion and $11.2 billion principal amount of
high-yield notes and $1.0 billion and $774 million principal amount of convertible senior notes at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the weighted average interest rate on the credit facility debt
was approximately 6.8% and 5.4%, the weighted average interest rate on our high-yield notes was
approximately 9.2% and 10.3%, and the weighted average interest rate on the convertible senior
notes was approximately 5.7% and 5.5%, respectively, resulting in a blended weighted average
interest rate of 8.8% and 8.2%, respectively. The interest rate on approximately 83% and 80% of
the total principal amount of our debt was effectively fixed, including the effects of our interest
rate hedge agreements as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The fair value of our
high-yield notes was $12.2 billion and $9.9 billion at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
The fair value of our convertible senior notes was $1.1 billion and $732 million at December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively. The fair value of our credit facilities is $5.5 billion and $6.9
billion at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The fair value of high-yield and convertible
notes is based on quoted market prices, and the fair value of the credit facilities is based on
dealer quotations.

Charter Operating Credit Facilities — General

The Charter Operating credit facilities were amended and restated concurrently with the sale of
$1.5 billion senior second-lien notes in April 2004, among other things, to defer maturities and
increase availability under these facilities and to enable Charter Operating to acquire the
interests of the lenders under the CC VI Operating, CC VIII Operating and Falcon credit facilities,
thereby consolidating all credit facilities under one amended and restated Charter Operating credit
agreement.

The Charter Operating credit facilities:

•

provide borrowing availability of up to $6.5 billion; and

•

provide for two term facilities:

(i)

a Term A facility with a total principal amount of $2.0 billion, of which 12.5%
matures in 2007, 30% matures in 2008, 37.5% matures in 2009 and 20% matures in 2010;
and

(ii)

a Term B facility with a total principal amount of $3.0 billion, which shall be
repayable in 27 equal quarterly installments aggregating in each loan year to 1% of the
original amount of the Term B facility, with the remaining balance due at final
maturity in 2011; and

•

provide for a revolving credit facility, in a total amount of $1.5 billion, with a
maturity date in 2010.

Amounts outstanding under the Charter Operating credit facilities bear interest, at Charter
Operating’s election, at a base rate or the Eurodollar rate, as defined, plus a margin for
Eurodollar loans of up to 3.00% for the Term A facility and revolving credit facility, and up to
3.25% for the Term B facility, and for base rate loans of up to 2.00% for the Term A facility and
revolving credit facility, and up to 2.25% for the Term B facility. A quarterly commitment fee of
up to .75% is payable on the average daily unborrowed balance of the revolving credit facilities.

The obligations of our subsidiaries under the Charter Operating credit facilities (the
“Obligations”) are guaranteed by Charter Operatings’ immediate parent company, CCO Holdings, and
the subsidiaries of Charter Operating, except for immaterial subsidiaries and subsidiaries
precluded from guaranteeing by reason of the provisions of other indebtedness to which they are
subject (the “non-guarantor subsidiaries, primarily Renaissance and CCV Holdings and their subsidiaries”). The Obligations are also secured by (i) a lien on all
of the assets of Charter Operating and its subsidiaries (other than assets of the non-guarantor
subsidiaries), to the extent such lien can be perfected under the Uniform Commercial Code by the
filing of



a financing statement, and (ii) by a pledge by CCO Holdings of the equity interests owned by it in
Charter Operating or any of Charter Operating’s subsidiaries, as well as intercompany obligations
owing to it by any of such entities. Upon the Charter Holdings Leverage Ratio (as defined in the
indenture governing the Charter Holdings senior notes and senior discount notes) being under 8.75
to 1.0, the Charter Operating credit facilities require that the 11.875% notes due 2008 issued by
CC V Holdings, LLC be redeemed. Because such Leverage Ratio was determined to be under 8.75 to 1.0
in February 2005, CC V Holdings, LLC has called for redemption of such notes with an anticipated
redemption date of March 14, 2005. Following such redemption and provided the Leverage Ratio of
Charter Holdings remains under 8.75 to 1.0, CC V Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries (other than
non-guarantor subsidiaries) will guarantee the Obligations and grant a lien on all of their assets
as to which a lien can be perfected under the Uniform Commercial Code by the filing of a financing
statement.

Charter Operating Credit Facilities — Restrictive Covenants

The Charter Operating credit facilities contain representations and warranties, and affirmative and
negative covenants customary for financings of this type. The financial covenants measure
performance against standards set for leverage, debt service coverage, and interest coverage,
tested as of the end of each quarter. The maximum allowable leverage ratio is 4.25 to 1.0 until
maturity, tested as of the end of each quarter beginning September 30, 2004. Additionally, the
Charter Operating credit facilities contain provisions requiring mandatory loan prepayments under
specific circumstances, including when significant amounts of assets are sold and the proceeds are
not reinvested in assets useful in the business of the borrower within a specified period, and upon
the incurrence of certain indebtedness when the ratio of senior first lien debt to operating cash
flow is greater than 2.0 to 1.0.

The Charter Operating credit facilities permit Charter Operating and its subsidiaries to make
distributions to pay interest on the Charter Operating senior second-lien notes, the CCH II senior
notes, the CCO Holdings senior notes, the Charter convertible senior notes and the Charter Holdings
senior notes, provided that, among other things, no default has occurred and is continuing under
the Charter Operating credit facilities. Conditions to future borrowings include absence of a
default or an event of default under the Charter Operating credit facilities and the continued
accuracy in all material respects of the representations and warranties, including the absence
since December 31, 2003 of any event, development or circumstance that has had or could reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business.

The events of default under the Charter Operating credit facilities include, among other things:



Outstanding Notes

Charter Communications, Inc. Notes

4.75% Charter Convertible Notes due 2006

In May 2001, Charter issued 4.75% convertible senior notes with a total principal amount at
maturity of $633 million. As of December 31, 2004, there was $156 million in total principal
amount of these notes outstanding. The 4.75% convertible notes rank equally with any of our future
unsubordinated and unsecured indebtedness, but are structurally subordinated to all existing and
future indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries.

The 4.75% convertible notes are convertible at the option of the holder into shares of Class A
common stock at a conversion rate of 38.0952 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which is
equivalent to a price of $26.25 per share, subject to certain adjustments. Specifically, the
adjustments include anti-dilutive provisions, which automatically occur based on the occurrence of
specified events to provide protection rights to holders of the notes. Additionally, Charter may
adjust the conversion ratio under certain circumstances when deemed appropriate. These notes are
redeemable at our option at amounts decreasing from 101.9% to 100% of the principal amount, plus
accrued and unpaid interest beginning on June 4, 2004, to the date of redemption. Interest is
payable semiannually on December 1 and June 1, beginning December 1, 2001, until maturity on June
1, 2006.

Upon a change of control, subject to certain conditions and restrictions, Charter may be required
to repurchase the notes, in whole or in part, at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued
interest at the repurchase date.

Charter 5.875% Convertible Senior Notes due 2009

In November 2004, Charter issued 5.875% convertible senior notes due 2009 with a total original
principal amount of $862.5 million. The 5.875% convertible senior notes are unsecured (except with
respect to the collateral as described below) and rank equally with our existing and future
unsubordinated and unsecured indebtedness (except with respect to the collateral described below),
but are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of
our subsidiaries. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears.

The 5.875% convertible senior notes are convertible at any time at the option of the holder into
shares of Class A common stock at an initial conversion rate of 413.2231 shares per $1,000
principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $2.42 per
share, subject to certain adjustments. Specifically, the adjustments include anti-dilutive
provisions, which cause adjustments to occur automatically based on the occurrence of specified
events to provide protection rights to holders of the notes. The conversion rate may also be
increased (but not to exceed 462 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes) upon a specified
change of control transaction. Additionally, Charter may elect to increase the conversion rate
under certain circumstances when deemed appropriate and subject to applicable limitations of the
NASDAQ stock market. Holders who convert their notes prior to November 16, 2007 will receive an
early conversion make whole amount in respect of their notes based on a proportional share of the
portfolio of pledged securities described below, with specified adjustments.

No holder of notes will be entitled to receive shares of our Class A common stock on conversion to
the extent that receipt of the shares would cause the converting holder to become, directly or
indirectly, a “beneficial holder’’ (within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) of more than 4.9% of the outstanding shares of our
Class A common stock if such conversion would take place prior to November 16, 2008, or more than
9.9% thereafter.

If a holder tenders a note for conversion, we may direct that holder (unless we have called those
notes for redemption) to a financial institution designated by us to conduct a transaction with
that institution, on substantially the same terms that the holder would have received on
conversion. But if any such financial institution does not accept such notes or does not deliver
the required conversion consideration, we remain obligated to convert the notes.

Charter Holdco used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the notes to purchase a portfolio of
U.S. government securities in an amount which we believe will be sufficient to make the first six
interest payments on the notes. These government securities were pledged to us as security for a
mirror note issued by Charter Holdco to Charter and pledged to the trustee under the indenture
governing the notes as security for our obligations thereunder. We expect to use such securities
to fund the first six interest payments under the notes. The pledged securities totaled $144
million at December 31, 2004. Any holder that converts its notes prior to the third anniversary of
the issue



date will be entitled to receive, in addition to the requisite number of shares upon conversion, an
interest make whole payment equal to the cash proceeds from the sale by the trustee of that portion
of the remaining pledged U.S. government securities which secure interest payments on the notes so
converted, subject to certain limitations with respect to notes that
have not been sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933.

Upon a change of control and certain other fundamental changes, subject to certain conditions and
restrictions, Charter may be required to repurchase the notes, in whole or in part, at 100% of
their principal amount plus accrued interest at the repurchase date.

We have filed a shelf registration statement for resale of the notes and shares issuable on
conversion of the notes by the holders, and we are required to use our reasonable best efforts to
cause that registration statement to be declared effective on or before April 21, 2005. We have
also filed a registration statement for use by Citigroup Global Markets Inc. to sell up to 150
million shares of our Class A common stock that we will loan to an affiliate of Citigroup Global
Markets, Inc. pursuant to a share lending agreement, and we are obligated to use our reasonable
best efforts to have such registration statement declared effective on or before April 1, 2005. In
the event we fail to meet our obligations with respect to registration statements becoming
effective on or prior to the date specified, liquidated damages will accrue in respect of the
notes. Charter may elect to accrete the principal amount of the notes in lieu of paying cash for
any liquidated damages that accrue, and may also elect to defer any interest accruing for any
accreted portion exceeding the original principal amount of the notes. We will pay no interest on
any such deferred interest.

Following the earlier of the sale of the notes pursuant to an effective registration statement or
the date two years following the issue date, we may redeem the notes in whole or in part for cash
at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount plus accrued and
unpaid interest, deferred interest and liquidated damages, if any, but only if for any 20 trading
days in any 30 consecutive trading day period the closing price has exceeded 180% of the conversion
price, if such 30 trading day period begins prior to November 16, 2007 or 150% of the conversion
price, if such 30 trading period begins thereafter. Holders who convert notes that we have called
for redemption shall receive, in addition to the early conversion make whole amount, if applicable,
the present value of the interest on the notes converted that would have been payable for the
period from the later of November 17, 2007 and the redemption date through the scheduled maturity
date for the notes, plus any accrued deferred interest.

Summary of Restrictive Covenants under Charter Holdings High-Yield Notes.

The limitations on incurrence of debt and issuance of preferred stock contained in Charter
Holdings’ indentures permit Charter Holdings and its subsidiaries to incur additional debt or issue
preferred stock, so long as there is no default under the Charter Holdings indentures. These
limitations restrict the incurrence of debt unless, after giving effect to the incurrence, the
Charter Holdings Leverage Ratio would be below 8.75 to 1.0. In addition, regardless of whether the
leverage ratio could be met, so long as no default exists or would result from the incurrence or
issuance, Charter Holdings and its restricted subsidiaries are permitted to issue:

Indebtedness under a single facility or agreement may be incurred in part under one of the
categories listed above and in part under another. Accordingly, indebtedness under our credit
facilities is incurred under a combination of the categories of permitted indebtedness listed
above.

The restricted subsidiaries of Charter Holdings are generally not permitted to issue debt
securities contractually subordinated to other debt of the issuing subsidiary or preferred stock,
in either case in any public or Rule 144A offering.

The Charter Holdings indentures permit Charter Holdings and its restricted subsidiaries to incur
debt under one category, and later reclassify that debt into another category. The Charter
Operating credit facilities generally impose more restrictive limitations on incurring new debt
than Charter Holdings’ indentures, so our subsidiaries that are subject to the Charter Operating
credit agreements may not be permitted to utilize the full debt incurrence that would otherwise be
available under the Charter Holdings indenture covenants.

Generally, under Charter Holdings’ high-yield indentures:

•

Charter Holdings and its restricted subsidiaries are generally permitted to pay
dividends on equity interests, repurchase interests, or make other specified restricted
payments only if, after giving effect to the transaction, the Charter Holdings Leverage
Ratio would be below 8.75 to 1.0 and if no default exists or would exist as a consequence
of such incurrence. If those conditions are met, restricted payments in a total amount of
up to 100% of Charter Holding’s consolidated EBITDA, as defined, minus 1.2 times its
consolidated interest expense, plus 100% of new cash and non-cash equity proceeds received
by Charter Holdings and not allocated to the debt incurrence covenant or to permitted
investments, all cumulatively from March 1999, the date of the first Charter Holdings
indenture, plus $100 million.



In addition, Charter Holdings may make distributions or restricted payments, so long as no default
exists or would be caused by transactions:

•

to repurchase management equity interests in amounts not to exceed $10 million per
fiscal year,

•

regardless of the existence of any default, to pay pass-through tax liabilities in
respect of ownership of equity interests in Charter Holdings or its restricted
subsidiaries, or

•

to make other specified restricted payments including merger fees up to 1.25% of the
transaction value, repurchases using concurrent new issuances, and certain dividends on
existing subsidiary preferred equity interests.

Charter Holdings and its restricted subsidiaries may not make investments except permitted
investments if there is a default under the indentures or if, after giving effect to the
transaction, the Charter Holdings Leverage Ratio would be below 8.75 to 1.0.

Permitted investments include:

•

investments by Charter Holdings in restricted subsidiaries or by restricted subsidiaries
in Charter Holdings,

•

investments in productive assets (including through equity investments) aggregating up
to $150 million since March 1999,

•

investments aggregating up to 100% of new cash equity proceeds received by Charter
Holdings since March 1999 and not allocated to the debt incurrence or restricted payments
covenant, and

•

other investments up to $50 million since March 1999.

Charter Holdings is not permitted to grant liens on its assets other than specified permitted
liens. Permitted liens include liens securing debt and other obligations incurred under our
subsidiaries’ credit facilities, liens securing the purchase price of new assets, other liens
securing indebtedness up to $50 million and specified liens incurred in the ordinary course of
business. The lien covenant does not restrict liens on assets of subsidiaries of Charter Holdings.

Charter Holdings and Charter Capital, its co-issuer, are generally not permitted to sell all or
substantially all of their assets or merge with or into other companies unless their leverage ratio
after any such transaction would be no greater than their leverage ratio immediately prior to the
transaction, or unless Charter Holdings Leverage Ratio would be below 8.75 to 1.0, no default
exists, and the surviving entity is a U.S. entity that assumes the Charter Holdings notes.

Charter Holdings and its restricted subsidiaries may generally not otherwise sell assets or, in the
case of restricted subsidiaries, issue equity interests, unless they receive consideration at least
equal to the fair market value of the assets or equity interests, consisting of at least 75% in
cash, assumption of liabilities, securities converted into cash within 60 days or productive
assets. Charter Holdings and its restricted subsidiaries are then required within 365 days after
any asset sale either to commit to use the net cash proceeds over a specified threshold to acquire
assets, including current assets, used or useful in their businesses or use the net cash proceeds
to repay debt, or to offer to repurchase the Charter Holdings notes with any remaining proceeds.

Charter Holdings and its restricted subsidiaries may generally not engage in sale and leaseback
transactions unless, at the time of the transaction, Charter Holdings could have incurred secured
indebtedness in an amount equal to the present value of the net rental payments to be made under
the lease, and the sale of the assets and application of proceeds is permitted by the covenant
restricting asset sales.

Charter Holdings’ restricted subsidiaries may generally not enter into restrictions on their
ability to make dividends or distributions or transfer assets to Charter Holdings on terms that are
materially more restrictive than those governing their debt, lien, asset sale, lease and similar
agreements existing when they entered into the indentures, unless those restrictions are on
customary terms that will not materially impair Charter Holdings’ ability to repay the high-yield
notes.



The restricted subsidiaries of Charter Holdings are generally not permitted to guarantee or pledge
assets to secure debt of Charter Holdings, unless the guarantying subsidiary issues a guarantee of
the notes of comparable priority and tenor, and waives any rights of reimbursement, indemnity or
subrogation arising from the guarantee transaction for at least one year.

The indentures also restrict the ability of Charter Holdings and its restricted subsidiaries to
enter into certain transactions with affiliates involving consideration in excess of $15 million
without a determination by the board of directors of Charter Holdings that the transaction is on
terms no less favorable than arms length, or transactions with affiliates involving over $50
million without receiving an independent opinion as to the fairness of the transaction to the
holders of the Charter Holdings notes.

CCH II, LLC Notes

In September 2003, CCH II and CCH II Capital Corp. jointly issued approximately $1.6 billion total
principal amount of 10.25% senior notes due 2010. The CCH II notes are general unsecured
obligations of CCH II and CCH II Capital Corp. They rank equally with all other current or future
unsubordinated obligations of CCH II and CCH II Capital Corp. The CCH II notes are structurally subordinated to all obligations of subsidiaries of CCH II, including the CCO Holdings notes, the
Renaissance notes, the CC V Holdings notes, the Charter Operating credit facilities and the Charter
Operating notes.

Interest on the CCH II notes accrues at 10.25% per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears on
each March 15 and September 15, commencing on March 15, 2004.

At any time prior to September 15, 2006, the issuers of the CCH II notes may redeem up to 35% of
the total principal amount of the CCH II notes on a pro rata basis at a redemption price equal to
110.25% of the principal amount of CCH II notes redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest.

On or after September 15, 2008, the issuers of the CCH II notes may redeem all or a part of the
notes at a redemption price that declines ratably from the initial redemption price of 105.125% to
a redemption price on or after September 15, 2009 of 100% of the principal amount of the CCH II
notes redeemed, plus, in each case, any accrued and unpaid interest.

In the event of specified change of control events, CCH II must offer to purchase the outstanding
CCH II notes from the holders at a purchase price equal to 101% of the total principal amount of
the notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest.

The indenture governing the CCH II notes contains restrictive covenants that limit certain
transactions or activities by CCH II and its restricted subsidiaries, including the covenants
summarized below. Substantially all of CCH II’s direct and indirect subsidiaries are currently
restricted subsidiaries.

The covenant in the indenture governing the CCH II notes that restricts incurrence of debt and
issuance of preferred stock permits CCH II and its subsidiaries to incur or issue specified amounts
of debt or preferred stock, if, after giving effect to the incurrence, CCH II could meet a leverage
ratio (ratio of consolidated debt to four times EBITDA from the most recent fiscal quarter for
which internal financial reports are available) of 5.5 to 1.0.

In addition, regardless of whether the leverage ratio could be met, so long as no default exists or
would result from the incurrence or issuance, CCH II and its restricted subsidiaries are permitted
to incur or issue:

•

up to $9.75 billion of debt under credit facilities, including debt under credit
facilities outstanding on the issue date of the CCH II notes,

•

up to $75 million of debt incurred to finance the purchase or capital lease of new assets,

•

up to $300 million of additional debt for any purpose, and

•

other items of indebtedness for specific purposes such as intercompany debt, refinancing
of existing debt, and interest rate swaps to provide protection against fluctuation in
interest rates.



The restricted subsidiaries of CCH II are generally not permitted to issue debt securities
contractually subordinated to other debt of the issuing subsidiary or preferred stock, in either
case in any public or Rule 144A offering.

The CCH II indenture permits CCH II and its restricted subsidiaries to incur debt under one
category, and later reclassify that debt into another category. Our and our subsidiaries’ credit
agreements generally impose more restrictive limitations on incurring new debt than the CCH II
indenture, so we and our subsidiaries that are subject to credit agreements are not permitted to
utilize the full debt incurrence that would otherwise be available under the CCH II indenture
covenants.

Generally, under the CCH II indenture, CCH II and its restricted subsidiaries are permitted to pay
dividends on equity interests, repurchase interests, or make other specified restricted payments
only if CCH II can incur $1.00 of new debt under the leverage ratio test, which requires that CCH
II meet a 5.5 to 1.0 leverage ratio after giving effect to the transaction, and if no default
exists or would exist as a consequence of such incurrence. If those conditions are met, restricted
payments in a total amount of up to 100% of CCH II’s consolidated EBITDA, as defined, minus 1.3
times its consolidated interest expense, plus 100% of new cash and non-cash equity proceeds
received by CCH II and not allocated to the debt incurrence covenant, all cumulatively from the
fiscal quarter commenced July 1, 2003, plus $100 million.

In addition, CCH II may make distributions or restricted payments, so long as no default exists or
would be caused by transactions:

The indenture governing the CCH II notes restricts CCH II and its restricted subsidiaries from
making investments, except specified permitted investments, or creating new unrestricted
subsidiaries, if there is a default under the indenture or if CCH II could not incur $1.00 of new
debt under the 5.5 to 1.0 leverage ratio test described above after giving effect to the
transaction.

Permitted investments include:



CCH II is not permitted to grant liens on its assets other than specified permitted liens.
Permitted liens include liens securing debt and other obligations incurred under our subsidiaries’
credit facilities, liens securing the purchase price of new assets, other liens securing
indebtedness up to $50 million and specified liens incurred in the ordinary course of business.
The lien covenant does not restrict liens on assets of subsidiaries of CCH II.

debt and issuance of preferred stock permits CCO Holdings and its subsidiaries to incur or issue
specified amounts of debt or preferred stock, if, after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence
or issuance, CCO Holdings could meet a leverage ratio (ratio of consolidated debt to four times
EBITDA, as defined, from the most recent fiscal quarter for which internal financial reports are
available) of 4.5 to 1.0.

In addition, regardless of whether the leverage ratio could be met, so long as no default exists or
would result from the incurrence or issuance, CCO Holdings and its restricted subsidiaries are
permitted to incur or issue:

•

up to $9.75 billion of debt under credit facilities, including debt under credit
facilities outstanding on the issue date of the CCO Holdings senior notes,

•

up to $75 million of debt incurred to finance the purchase or capital lease of new assets,

•

up to $300 million of additional debt for any purpose, and

•

other items of indebtedness for specific purposes such as intercompany debt, refinancing
of existing debt, and interest rate swaps to provide protection against fluctuation in
interest rates.

The restricted subsidiaries of CCO Holdings are generally not permitted to issue debt securities
contractually subordinated to other debt of the issuing subsidiary or preferred stock, in either
case in any public or Rule 144A offering.

The CCO Holdings indenture permits CCO Holdings and its restricted subsidiaries to incur debt under
one category, and later reclassify that debt into another category. The Charter Operating credit
facilities generally impose more restrictive limitations on incurring new debt than CCO Holdings’
indenture, so our subsidiaries that are subject to credit facilities are not permitted to utilize
the full debt incurrence that would otherwise be available under the CCO Holdings indenture
covenants.

Generally, under CCO Holdings’ indenture:

•

CCO Holdings and its restricted subsidiaries are permitted to pay dividends on equity
interests, repurchase interests, or make other specified restricted payments only if CCO
Holdings can incur $1.00 of new debt under the leverage ratio test, which requires that CCO
Holdings meet a 4.5 to 1.0 leverage ratio after giving effect to the transaction, and if no
default exists or would exist as a consequence of such incurrence. If those conditions are
met, restricted payments in a total amount of up to 100% of CCO Holdings’ consolidated
EBITDA, as defined, minus 1.3 times its consolidated interest expense, plus 100% of new
cash and appraised non-cash equity proceeds received by CCO Holdings and not allocated to
the debt incurrence covenant, all cumulatively from the fiscal quarter commenced October 1,
2003, plus $100 million.

In addition, CCO Holdings may make distributions or restricted payments, so long as no default
exists or would be caused by the transaction:

•

to repurchase management equity interests in amounts not to exceed $10 million per
fiscal year;

•

to pay, regardless of the existence of any default, pass-through tax liabilities in
respect of ownership of equity interests in Charter Holdings or its restricted
subsidiaries;

•

to pay, regardless of the existence of any default, interest when due on Charter
Holdings notes and our notes;



•

to pay, so long as there is no default, interest on the Charter convertible notes;

•

to purchase, redeem or refinance Charter Holdings notes, CCH II notes, Charter notes,
and other direct or indirect parent company notes, so long as CCO Holdings could incur
$1.00 of indebtedness under the 4.5 to 1.0 leverage ratio test referred to above and there
is no default; or

•

to make other specified restricted payments including merger fees up to 1.25% of the
transaction value, repurchases using concurrent new issuances, and certain dividends on
existing subsidiary preferred equity interests.

The indenture governing the CCO Holdings senior notes restricts CCO Holdings and its restricted
subsidiaries from making investments, except specified permitted investments, or creating new
unrestricted subsidiaries, if there is a default under the indenture or if CCO Holdings could not
incur $1.00 of new debt under the 4.5 to 1.0 leverage ratio test described above after giving
effect to the transaction.

Permitted investments include:

•

investments by CCO Holdings and its restricted subsidiaries in CCO Holdings and in other
restricted subsidiaries, or entities that become restricted subsidiaries as a result of the
investment,

•

investments aggregating up to 100% of new cash equity proceeds received by CCO Holdings
since November 10, 2003 to the extent the proceeds have not been allocated to the
restricted payments covenant described above,

•

other investments up to $750 million outstanding at any time, and

•

certain specified additional investments, such as investments in customers and suppliers
in the ordinary course of business and investments received in connection with permitted
asset sales.

CCO Holdings is not permitted to grant liens on its assets other than specified permitted liens.
Permitted liens include liens securing debt and other obligations incurred under our subsidiaries’
credit facilities, liens securing the purchase price of new assets, other liens securing
indebtedness up to $50 million and specified liens incurred in the ordinary course of business.
The lien covenant does not restrict liens on assets of subsidiaries of CCO Holdings.

CCO Holdings and CCO Holdings Capital, its co-issuer, are generally not permitted to sell all or
substantially all of their assets or merge with or into other companies unless their leverage ratio
after any such transaction would be no greater than their leverage ratio immediately prior to the
transaction, or unless CCO Holdings and its subsidiaries could incur $1.00 of new debt under the
4.50 to 1.0 leverage ratio test described above after giving effect to the transaction, no default
exists, and the surviving entity is a U.S. entity that assumes the CCO Holdings senior notes.

CCO Holdings and its restricted subsidiaries may generally not otherwise sell assets or, in the
case of restricted subsidiaries, issue equity interests, unless they receive consideration at least
equal to the fair market value of the assets or equity interests, consisting of at least 75% in
cash, assumption of liabilities, securities converted into cash within 60 days or productive
assets. CCO Holdings and its restricted subsidiaries are then required within 365 days after any
asset sale either to commit to use the net cash proceeds over a specified threshold to acquire
assets, including current assets, used or useful in their businesses or use the net cash proceeds
to repay debt, or to offer to repurchase the CCO Holdings senior notes with any remaining proceeds.

CCO Holdings and its restricted subsidiaries may generally not engage in sale and leaseback
transactions unless, at the time of the transaction, CCO Holdings could have incurred secured
indebtedness in an amount equal to the present value of the net rental payments to be made under
the lease, and the sale of the assets and application of proceeds is permitted by the covenant
restricting asset sales.

CCO Holdings’ restricted subsidiaries may generally not enter into restrictions on their ability to
make dividends or distributions or transfer assets to CCO Holdings on terms that are materially
more restrictive than those governing their debt, lien, asset sale, lease and similar agreements
existing when they entered into the indentures, unless those restrictions are on customary terms
that will not materially impair CCO Holdings’ ability to repay its notes.



The restricted subsidiaries of CCO Holdings are generally not permitted to guarantee or pledge
assets to secure debt of CCO Holdings, unless the guarantying subsidiary issues a guarantee of the
notes of comparable priority and tenor, and waives any rights of reimbursement, indemnity or
subrogation arising from the guarantee transaction for at least one year.

The indenture also restricts the ability of CCO Holdings and its restricted subsidiaries to enter
into certain transactions with affiliates involving consideration in excess of $15 million without
a determination by the board of directors that the transaction is on terms no less favorable than
arms length, or transactions with affiliates involving over $50 million without receiving an
independent opinion as to the fairness of the transaction to the holders of the CCO Holdings notes.

Charter Communications Operating, LLC Notes

On April 27, 2004, Charter Operating and Charter Communications Operating Capital Corp. jointly
issued $1.1 billion of 8% senior second-lien notes due 2012 and $400 million of 8 3/8% senior
second-lien notes due 2014, for total gross proceeds of $1.5 billion.

The Charter Operating notes were sold in a private transaction that was not subject to the
registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. The Charter Operating notes are not
expected to have the benefit of any exchange or other registration rights, except in specified
limited circumstances.

On the issue date of the Charter Operating notes, because of restrictions contained in the Charter
Holdings indentures, there were no Charter Operating note guarantees, even though Charter
Operating’s immediate parent, CCO Holdings, and certain of our subsidiaries were obligors and/or
guarantors under the Charter Operating credit facilities. Upon the occurrence of the guarantee and
pledge date (generally, the fifth business day after the Charter Holdings leverage ratio is
certified to be below 8.75 to 1.0), CCO Holdings and those subsidiaries of Charter Operating that
are then guarantors of, or otherwise obligors with respect to, indebtedness under the Charter
Operating credit facilities and related obligations will be required to guarantee the Charter
Operating notes. The note guarantee of each such guarantor will be:

•

a senior obligation of such guarantor;

•

structurally senior to the outstanding senior notes of CCO Holdings and CCO
Holdings Capital Corp. (except in the case of CCO Holdings’ note
guarantee, which is structurally

pari passu

with such senior notes), the outstanding senior notes of CCH II and CCH II Capital
Corp., the outstanding senior notes and senior discount notes of Charter Holdings and the
outstanding convertible senior notes of Charter (but subject to provisions in the Charter
Operating indenture that permit interest and, subject to meeting the 4.25 to 1.0 leverage
ratio test, principal payments to be made thereon); and

•

senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness of such guarantor.

As a result of the above leverage ratio test being met, CCO Holdings and certain of its
subsidiaries provided the additional guarantees described above during the first quarter of 2005.

All the subsidiaries of Charter Operating (except CCO NR Sub, LLC, and certain other subsidiaries
that are not deemed material and are designated as nonrecourse subsidiaries under the Charter
Operating credit facilities) are restricted subsidiaries of Charter Operating under the Charter
Operating notes. Unrestricted subsidiaries generally will not be subject to the restrictive
covenants in the Charter Operating indenture.

In the event of specified change of control events, Charter Operating must offer to purchase the
Charter Operating notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the total principal amount of the
Charter Operating notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon.

The limitations on incurrence of debt contained in the indenture governing the Charter Operating
notes permit Charter Operating and its restricted subsidiaries that are guarantors of the Charter
Operating notes to incur additional debt or issue shares of preferred stock if, after giving pro
forma effect to the incurrence, Charter Operating could meet a leverage ratio test (ratio of
consolidated debt to four times EBITDA, as defined, from the most recent fiscal quarter for which
internal financial reports are available) of 4.25 to 1.0.

In addition, regardless of whether the leverage ratio test could be met, so long as no default
exists or would result from the incurrence or issuance, Charter Operating and its restricted
subsidiaries are permitted to incur or issue:



•

up to $6.5 billion of debt under credit facilities (but such incurrence is permitted
only by Charter Operating and its restricted subsidiaries that are guarantors of the
Charter Operating notes, so long as there are such guarantors), including debt under credit
facilities outstanding on the issue date of the Charter Operating notes;

•

up to $75 million of debt incurred to finance the purchase or capital lease of assets;

•

up to $300 million of additional debt for any purpose; and

•

other items of indebtedness for specific purposes such as refinancing of existing debt
and interest rate swaps to provide protection against fluctuation in interest rates and,
subject to meeting the leverage ratio test, debt existing at the time of acquisition of a
restricted subsidiary.

The Charter Operating indenture provides that Charter Operating will not pay, or permit its
subsidiaries to pay, any interest or principal on $361 million of intercompany loans received by it
and its subsidiaries in November 2003 from CCO Holdings, all of which shall become a common equity
capital contribution to Charter Operating on the guarantee and pledge date.

The indenture governing the Charter Operating notes permits Charter Operating to incur debt under
one of the categories above, and later reclassify the debt into a different category. The Charter
Operating credit facilities generally impose more restrictive limitations on incurring new debt
than the Charter Operating indenture, so our subsidiaries that are subject to the Charter Operating
credit facilities are not permitted to utilize the full debt incurrence that would otherwise be
available under the Charter Operating indenture covenants.

Generally, under Charter Operating’s indenture Charter Operating and its restricted subsidiaries
are permitted to pay dividends on equity interests, repurchase interests, or make other specified
restricted payments only if Charter Operating could incur $1.00 of new debt under the leverage
ratio test, which requires that Charter Operating meet a 4.25 to 1.0 leverage ratio after giving
effect to the transaction, and if no default exists or would exist as a consequence of such
incurrence. If those conditions are met, restricted payments are permitted in a total amount of up
to 100% of Charter Operating’s consolidated EBITDA, as defined, minus 1.3 times its consolidated
interest expense, plus 100% of new cash and appraised non-cash equity proceeds received by Charter
Operating and not allocated to the debt incurrence covenant, all cumulatively from the fiscal
quarter commenced April 1, 2004, plus $100 million.

In addition, Charter Operating may make distributions or restricted payments, so long as no default
exists or would be caused by the transaction:

The indenture governing the Charter Operating notes restricts Charter Operating and its restricted
subsidiaries from making investments, except specified permitted investments, or creating new
unrestricted subsidiaries, if there is a default under the indenture or if Charter Operating could
not incur $1.00 of new debt under the 4.25 to 1.0 leverage ratio test described above after giving
effect to the transaction.



Permitted investments include:

•

investments by Charter Operating and its restricted subsidiaries in Charter Operating
and in other restricted subsidiaries, or entities that become restricted subsidiaries as a
result of the investment,

•

investments aggregating up to 100% of new cash equity proceeds received by Charter
Operating since April 27, 2004 to the extent the proceeds have not been allocated to the
restricted payments covenant described above,

•

other investments up to $750 million outstanding at any time, and

•

certain specified additional investments, such as investments in customers and suppliers
in the ordinary course of business and investments received in connection with permitted
asset sales.

Charter Operating and its restricted subsidiaries are not permitted to grant liens senior to the
liens securing the Charter Operating notes, other than permitted liens, on their assets to secure
indebtedness or other obligations, if, after giving effect to such incurrence, the senior secured
leverage ratio (generally, the ratio of obligations secured by first priority liens to four times
EBITDA, as defined, from the most recent fiscal quarter for which internal financial reports are
available) would exceed 3.75 to 1.0. Permitted liens include liens securing indebtedness and other
obligations under permitted credit facilities, liens securing the purchase price of new assets,
liens securing amounts up to $50 million, and liens incurred in the ordinary course of business.

Charter Operating and Charter Communications Operating Capital Corp., its co-issuer, are generally
not permitted to sell all or substantially all of their assets or merge with or into other
companies unless their leverage ratio after any such transaction would be no greater than their
leverage ratio immediately prior to the transaction, or unless Charter Operating and its
subsidiaries could incur $1.00 of new debt under the 4.25 to 1.0 leverage ratio test described
above after giving effect to the transaction, no default exists, and the surviving entity is a U.S.
entity that assumes the Charter Operating notes.

Charter Operating and its restricted subsidiaries generally may not otherwise sell assets or, in
the case of restricted subsidiaries, issue equity interests, unless they receive consideration at
least equal to the fair market value of the assets or equity interests, consisting of at least 75%
in cash, assumption of liabilities, securities converted into cash within 60 days or productive
assets. Charter Operating and its restricted subsidiaries are then required within 365 days after
any asset sale either to commit to use the net cash proceeds over a specified threshold to acquire
assets, including current assets, used or useful in their businesses or use the net cash proceeds
to repay debt, or to offer to repurchase the Charter Operating notes with any remaining proceeds.

Charter Operating and its restricted subsidiaries may generally not engage in sale and leaseback
transactions unless, at the time of the transaction, Charter Operating could have incurred secured
indebtedness in an amount equal to the present value of the net rental payments to be made under
the lease, and the sale of the assets and application of proceeds is permitted by the covenant
restricting asset sales.

Charter Operating’s restricted subsidiaries may generally not enter into restrictions on their
ability to make dividends or distributions or transfer assets to Charter Operating on terms that
are materially more restrictive than those governing their debt, lien, asset sale, lease and
similar agreements existing when Charter Operating entered into the indenture governing the Charter
Operating senior second-lien notes unless those restrictions are on customary terms that will not
materially impair Charter Operating’s ability to repay the Charter Operating notes.

The restricted subsidiaries of Charter Operating are generally not permitted to guarantee or pledge
assets to secure debt of Charter Operating, unless the guarantying subsidiary issues a guarantee of
the notes of comparable priority and tenor, and waives any rights of reimbursement, indemnity or
subrogation arising from the guarantee transaction for at least one year.

The indenture also restricts the ability of Charter Operating and its restricted subsidiaries to
enter into certain transactions with affiliates involving consideration in excess of $15 million
without a determination by the board of directors that the transaction is on terms no less
favorable than arms-length, or transactions with affiliates involving over $50 million without
receiving an independent opinion as to the fairness of the transaction to the holders of the
Charter Operating notes.

Charter Operating and its restricted subsidiaries are generally not permitted to transfer equity
interests in restricted subsidiaries unless the transfer is of all of the equity interests in the
restricted subsidiary or the restricted subsidiary



remains a restricted subsidiary and net proceeds of the equity sale are applied in accordance with
the asset sales covenant.

Until the guarantee and pledge date, the Charter Operating notes are secured by a second-priority
lien on all of Charter Operating’s assets that secure the obligations of Charter Operating under
the Charter Operating credit facility and specified related obligations. The collateral secures
the obligations of Charter Operating with respect to the 8% senior second-lien notes due 2012 and
the 8 3/8% senior second-lien notes due 2014 on a ratable basis. The collateral consists of
substantially all of Charter Operating’s assets in which security interests may be perfected under
the Uniform Commercial Code by filing a financing statement (including capital stock and
intercompany obligations), including, but not limited to:

•

all of the capital stock of all of Charter Operating’s direct subsidiaries, including,
but not limited to, CCO NR Holdings, LLC; and

•

all intercompany obligations owing to Charter Operating including, but not limited to,
intercompany notes from CC VI Operating, CC VIII Operating and Falcon, which notes are
supported by the same guarantees and collateral that supported these subsidiaries’ credit
facilities prior to the amendment and restatement of the Charter Operating credit
facilities.

On and after the guarantee and pledge date, the collateral for the Charter Operating notes will
consist of all of Charter Operating’s and its subsidiaries’ assets that secure the obligations of
Charter Operating or any subsidiary of Charter Operating with respect to the Charter Operating
credit facility and the related obligations or certain other indebtedness on such date. It is
currently contemplated that, as of the guarantee and pledge date, such collateral will consist of
the capital stock of Charter Operating held by CCO Holdings, all of the intercompany obligations
owing to CCO Holdings by Charter Operating or any subsidiary of Charter Operating, and
substantially all of Charter Operating’s and the guarantors’ assets (other than the assets of CCO
Holdings) in which security interests may be perfected under the Uniform Commercial Code by filing
a financing statement (including capital stock and intercompany obligations), including, but not
limited to:

•

with certain exceptions, all capital stock (limited in the case of capital stock of
foreign subsidiaries, if any, to 66% of the capital stock of first tier foreign
Subsidiaries) held by Charter Operating or any guarantor; and

•

with certain exceptions, all intercompany obligations owing to Charter Operating or any
guarantor.

In addition, within a time frame specified under the Charter Operating credit facility (45 days
after Charter Holdings satisfies the Leverage Condition, as defined), Charter Operating will be
required to redeem, or cause to be redeemed, in full the notes outstanding under the CC V
indenture. CC V Holdings, LLC has called for redemption all of its outstanding notes, which would
satisfy this requirement. See “ — CC V Holdings, LLC Notes.” Within five business days after the
redemption, and provided that such Leverage Condition remains satisfied, CC V Holdings, LLC and its
subsidiaries will be required to guarantee the Charter Operating credit facility and the related
obligations and to secure those guarantees with first-priority liens, and to guarantee the notes
and to secure the Charter Operating senior second-lien notes with second-priority liens, on
substantially all of their assets in which security interests may be perfected under the Uniform
Commercial Code by filing a financing statement (including capital stock and intercompany
obligations). In addition, if Charter Operating or its subsidiaries exercise any option to redeem
in full the notes outstanding under the Renaissance indenture, then, provided that the Leverage
Condition remains satisfied, the Renaissance entities will be required to provide corresponding
guarantees of the Charter Operating credit facilities and related obligations and note guarantees
and to secure the Charter Operating notes and the Charter Operating credit facilities and related
obligations with corresponding liens.

In the event that additional liens are granted by Charter Operating or its subsidiaries to secure
obligations under the Charter Operating credit facilities or the related obligations,
second-priority liens on the same assets will be granted to secure the Charter Operating notes,
which liens will be subject to the provisions of an intercreditor agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing sentence, no such second-priority liens need be provided if the time such liens would
otherwise be granted is not during a guarantee and pledge availability period (when the Leverage
Condition is satisfied), but such second-priority liens will be required to be provided in
accordance with the foregoing sentence on or prior to the fifth business day of the commencement of
the next succeeding guarantee and pledge availability period.



CC V Holdings, LLC Notes

On December 10, 1998, CC V Holdings, LLC, formerly known as Avalon Cable LLC, and CC V Holdings
Finance, Inc. (formerly Avalon Cable Holdings Finance, Inc.) (collectively the “CC V Issuers”)
jointly issued $196.0 million total principal amount at maturity of 11.875% senior discount notes
due 2008. On July 22, 1999, the issuers exchanged $196.0 million of the original issued and
outstanding CC V Holdings notes for substantially identical to the original CC V Holdings notes
except that they are registered under the Securities Act.

The CC V Holdings notes are guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of CC V Holdings. The Charter
Operating credit facilities require us to redeem the CC V Holdings notes within 45 days after the
first date that the Charter Holdings leverage ratio is less than 8.75 to 1.0. In satisfaction of
this requirement, CC V Holdings, LLC has called for redemption all of its outstanding notes, at
103.958% of principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption, which is
expected to be March 14, 2005.

In the event of specified change of control events, holders of the CC V Holdings notes have the
right to sell their CC V Holdings notes to the issuers of the CC V Holdings notes at 101% of the
total principal amount of the CC V Holdings notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the
date of purchase. Our acquisition of Avalon triggered this right. In January 2000, we completed
change of control offers in which we repurchased $16.3 million total accreted value of the 11.875%
notes at a purchase price of 101% of accreted value as of January 28, 2000.

On December 1, 2003, the issuers redeemed at par value an amount equal to $369.79 per $1,000 in
principal amount at maturity of each senior discount note then outstanding. Based on the amount
outstanding on December 1, 2003, the redemption amount was $67 million.

There were no current payments of cash interest on the CC V Holdings notes before December 1, 2003.
The CC V Holdings notes accreted in value at a rate of 11.875% per year, compounded semi-annually,
to a total principal amount of $180 million on December 1, 2003. At December 31, 2003, after
principal repayments in the fourth quarter of 2004, the total principal amount outstanding was $113
million. Since December 1, 2003, cash interest on the Avalon notes:

•

accrues at the rate of 11.875% per year on the principal amount at maturity; and

•

is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing June 1, 2004.

The limitations on incurrence of debt contained in the indenture governing the CC V Holdings notes
permit the CC V Issuers and their restricted subsidiaries to incur additional debt or issue shares
of preferred stock, so long as we are not in default under the CC V Holdings indenture:

The indenture governing the CC V Holdings notes permits the CC V Issuers to incur debt under one of
the categories above, and reclassify the debt into a different category.

Under the indenture governing the CC V Holdings notes, the CC V Issuers and their restricted
subsidiaries are permitted to pay dividends on equity interests, repurchase interests, make
restricted investments, or make other specified restricted payments only if CC V Holdings could,
after giving effect thereto, incur $1.00 of additional debt under the leverage ratio test, which
would require that the CC V Issuers meet the 6.5 to 1.0 leverage ratio of the indebtedness covenant
and no default would exist or result as a consequence thereof. If those conditions are met, the



CC V Issuers and their restricted subsidiaries are permitted to make restricted payments in a total
amount not to exceed the result of 100% of the CC V Issuers’ consolidated cash flow, minus 1.4
times their consolidated interest expense, plus 100% of new equity proceeds received by the CC V
Issuers, plus returns on certain investments, all cumulatively from January 1, 1999. The CC V
Issuers and their restricted subsidiaries may make permitted investments up to $10 million and
other specified permitted investments, restricted payments up to $5 million, and other specified
restricted payments without meeting the foregoing test.

The CC V Issuers and their restricted subsidiaries are not permitted to grant liens on their assets
other than specified permitted liens. Permitted liens include liens securing debt permitted by the
covenant limiting incurrence of debt, liens securing amounts up to the greater of $15 million or 5%
of total assets, certain existing liens and specified liens incurred in the ordinary course of
business.

The CC V Issuers are generally not permitted to sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially
all of their assets or merge with or into other companies unless the CC V Issuers and their
subsidiaries could incur $1.00 of additional debt under the leverage ratio test described above,
after giving effect to the transaction.

The CC V Issuers and their subsidiaries may generally not otherwise sell assets or, in the case of
restricted subsidiaries, equity interests, unless they receive consideration at least equal to the
fair market value of the assets or equity interests, with at least 75% of the consideration for
such sale consisting of a controlling interest in a permitted business or assets useful in a
permitted business or cash, assumption of liabilities or securities promptly converted into cash.
The CC V Issuers and their restricted subsidiaries are then required within 360 days after any
asset sale either to commit to use the net cash proceeds over a specified threshold either to
acquire assets, including controlling assets in permitted businesses, make capital expenditures or
use the net cash proceeds to repay debt, or to offer to repurchase the CC V Holdings notes with any
remaining proceeds.

The CC V Issuers and their restricted subsidiaries may not engage in sale and leaseback
transactions unless, at the time of the transaction, the applicable CC V Issuer or restricted
subsidiary could have incurred indebtedness under the leverage ratio test described above in an
amount equal to the present value of the net rental payments to be made under the lease, the gross
proceeds of the sale are at least equal to the fair market value of the subject property, and the
sale of the assets and application of proceeds is permitted by the covenant restricting asset
sales.

The CC V Issuers’ restricted subsidiaries may not enter into restrictions on their abilities to
make dividends or distributions or transfer assets to the CC V Issuers except under documents
governing debt, asset sales, leases and like transactions permitted by the indenture.

The restricted subsidiaries of the CC V Issuers are generally not permitted to guarantee or pledge
assets to secure debt of the CC V Issuers, unless the guarantying subsidiary issues a guarantee of
the CC V Holdings notes, and waives any rights of reimbursement, indemnity or subrogation arising
from the guarantee transaction.

The CC V Issuers and their restricted subsidiaries are generally not permitted to transfer equity
interests in restricted subsidiaries unless the transfer is of all of the equity interests in the
restricted subsidiary or the restricted subsidiary remains a restricted subsidiary and net proceeds
of the equity sale are applied in accordance with the asset sales covenant. Restricted
subsidiaries of the CC V Issuers are not permitted to issue equity interests if as a result, the
issuing subsidiary would no longer be a restricted subsidiary.

The indenture governing the CC V Holdings notes also restricts the ability of the CC V Issuers and
their restricted subsidiaries to enter into certain transactions with affiliates involving over
$2.5 million without a determination by the board of directors that the transaction is on terms no
less favorable than arms length, or transactions with affiliates involving consideration in excess
of $10 million with affiliates without receiving an independent opinion as to the fairness of the
transaction to the holders of the CC V Holdings notes.

Renaissance Media Notes

The 10% senior discount notes due 2008 were issued by Renaissance Media (Louisiana) LLC,
Renaissance Media (Tennessee) LLC and Renaissance Media Holdings Capital Corporation, with
Renaissance Media Group LLC as guarantor and the United States Trust Company of New York as
trustee. Renaissance Media Group LLC, which is the direct or indirect parent company of these
issuers, is now a subsidiary of Charter Operating. The Renaissance 10% notes and the Renaissance
guarantee are unsecured, unsubordinated debt of the issuers and the guarantor, respectively. In
October 1998, the issuers of the Renaissance notes exchanged $163 million of the original issued
and outstanding Renaissance notes for an equivalent value of new Renaissance notes. The form and
terms of the



new Renaissance notes are the same in all material respects as the form and terms of the original
Renaissance notes except that the issuance of the new Renaissance notes was registered under the
Securities Act.

There was no payment of any interest in respect of the Renaissance notes prior to October 15, 2003.
Since October 15, 2003, interest on the Renaissance notes is payable semi-annually in arrears in
cash at a rate of 10% per year. On April 15, 2003, the Renaissance notes became redeemable at the
option of the issuers thereof, in whole or in part, initially at 105% of their principal amount at
maturity, plus accrued interest, declining to 100% of the principal amount at maturity, plus
accrued interest, on or after April 15, 2006.

Our acquisition of Renaissance triggered change of control provisions of the Renaissance notes that
required us to offer to purchase the Renaissance notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of their
accreted value on the date of the purchase, plus accrued interest, if any. In May 1999, we made an
offer to repurchase the Renaissance notes, and holders of Renaissance notes representing 30% of the
total principal amount outstanding at maturity tendered their Renaissance notes for repurchase.

The limitations on incurrence of debt contained in the indenture governing the Renaissance notes
permit Renaissance Media Group and its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional debt, so long as
they are not in default under the indenture:

The indenture governing the Renaissance notes permits us to incur debt under one of the categories
above, and reclassify the debt into a different category.

Under the indenture governing the Renaissance notes, Renaissance Media Group and its restricted
subsidiaries are permitted to pay dividends on equity interests, repurchase interests, make
restricted investments, or make other specified restricted payments only if Renaissance Media Group
could incur $1.00 of additional debt under the debt incurrence test, which requires that
Renaissance Media Group meet the 6.75 to 1.0 leverage ratio after giving effect to the transaction
of the indebtedness covenant and that no default exists or would occur as a consequence thereof.
If those conditions are met, Renaissance Media Group and its restricted subsidiaries are permitted
to make restricted payments in a total amount not to exceed the result of 100% of Renaissance Media
Group’s consolidated EBITDA, as defined, minus 130% of its consolidated interest expense, plus 100%
of new cash equity proceeds received by Renaissance Media Group and not allocated to the
indebtedness covenant, plus returns on certain investments, all cumulatively from June 1998.
Renaissance Media Group and its restricted subsidiaries may make permitted investments up to $2
million in related businesses and other specified permitted investments, restricted payments up to
$10 million, dividends up to 6% each year of the net cash proceeds of public equity offerings, and
other specified restricted payments without meeting the foregoing test.

Renaissance Media Group and its restricted subsidiaries are not permitted to grant liens on their
assets other than specified permitted liens, unless corresponding liens are granted to secure the
Renaissance notes. Permitted liens include liens securing debt permitted to be incurred under
credit facilities, liens securing debt incurred under the incurrence of indebtedness test, in
amounts up to the greater of $200 million or 4.5 times Renaissance Media Group’s consolidated
EBITDA, as defined, liens as deposits for acquisitions up to 10% of the estimated purchase



price, liens securing permitted financings of new assets, liens securing debt permitted to be
incurred by restricted subsidiaries, and specified liens incurred in the ordinary course of
business.

Renaissance Media Group and the issuers of the Renaissance notes are generally not permitted to
sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets or merge with or into other
companies unless their consolidated net worth after any such transaction would be no greater than
their consolidated net worth immediately prior to the transaction, or unless Renaissance Media
Group could incur $1.00 of additional debt under the debt incurrence test, which would require them
to meet a leverage ratio of 6.75 to 1.00 after giving effect to the transaction.

Renaissance Media Group and its subsidiaries may generally not otherwise sell assets or, in the
case of subsidiaries, equity interests, unless they receive consideration at least equal to the
fair market value of the assets, consisting of at least 75% cash, temporary cash investments or
assumption of debt. Charter Holdings and its restricted subsidiaries are then required within 12
months after any asset sale either to commit to use the net cash proceeds over a specified
threshold either to acquire assets used in their own or related businesses or use the net cash
proceeds to repay debt, or to offer to repurchase the Renaissance notes with any remaining
proceeds.

Renaissance Media Group and its restricted subsidiaries may generally not engage in sale and
leaseback transactions unless the lease term does not exceed three years or the proceeds are
applied in accordance with the covenant limiting asset sales.

Renaissance Media Group’s restricted subsidiaries may generally not enter into restrictions on
their abilities to make dividends or distributions or transfer assets to Renaissance Media Group
except those not more restrictive than is customary in comparable financings.

The restricted subsidiaries of Renaissance Media Group are not permitted to guarantee or pledge
assets to secure debt of the Renaissance Media Group or its restricted subsidiaries, unless the
guarantying subsidiary issues a guarantee of the Renaissance notes of comparable priority and
tenor, and waives any rights of reimbursement, indemnity or subrogation arising from the guarantee
transaction.

Renaissance Media Group and its restricted subsidiaries are generally not permitted to issue or
sell equity interests in restricted subsidiaries, except sales of common stock of restricted
subsidiaries so long as the proceeds of the sale are applied in accordance with the asset sale
covenant, and issuances as a result of which the restricted subsidiary is no longer a restricted
subsidiary and any remaining investment in that subsidiary is permitted by the covenant limiting
restricted payments.

The indenture governing the Renaissance notes also restricts the ability of Renaissance Media Group
and its restricted subsidiaries to enter into certain transactions with affiliates involving
consideration in excess of $2 million without a determination by the disinterested members of the
board of directors that the transaction is on terms no less favorable than arms length, or
transactions with affiliates involving over $4 million with affiliates without receiving an
independent opinion as to the fairness of the transaction to Renaissance Media Group.

All of these covenants are subject to additional specified exceptions. In general, the covenants
of our subsidiaries’ credit agreements are more restrictive than those of our indentures.

Cross-Defaults

Our indentures and those of certain of our subsidiaries include various events of default,
including cross-default provisions. Under these provisions, a failure by any of the issuers or any
of their restricted subsidiaries to pay at the final maturity thereof the principal amount of other
indebtedness having a principal amount of $100 million or more (or any other default under any such
indebtedness resulting in its acceleration) would result in an event of default under the indenture
governing the applicable notes. The Renaissance indenture contains a similar cross-default
provision with a $10 million threshold that applies to the issuers of the Renaissance notes and
their restricted subsidiaries. As a result, an event of default related to the failure to repay
principal at maturity or the acceleration of the indebtedness under the Charter Holdings notes, CCH
II notes, CCO Holding notes, Charter Operating notes, the Charter Operating credit facilities or
the Renaissance notes could cause cross-defaults under our subsidiaries’ indentures.



Related Party Transactions

See “Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions — Business Relationships” for
information regarding related party transactions and transactions with other parties with whom we
or our related parties may have a relationship that enables the parties to negotiate terms of
material transactions that may not be available from other, more clearly independent parties, on an
arms length basis.

Certain Trends and Uncertainties

The following discussion highlights a number of trends and uncertainties, in addition to those
discussed elsewhere in this annual report and in other documents that we file with the SEC, that
could materially impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Substantial Leverage.

We have a significant amount of debt. As of December 31, 2004, our total
debt was approximately $19.5 billion. In 2005, $30 million of our debt matures and in 2006, an
additional $186 million matures. In 2007 and beyond, significant additional amounts will become
due under our remaining obligations. We believe that as a result of our significant levels of debt
and operating performance, our access to the debt markets could be limited when substantial amounts
of our indebtedness become due. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from
operating activities, and sufficient funds are not available to us from borrowings under our credit
facilities or from other sources, we may not be able to repay our debt, fund our other liquidity
and capital needs, grow our business or respond to competitive challenges. Further, if we are
unable to repay or refinance our debt, as it becomes due, we could be forced to restructure our
obligations or seek protection under the bankruptcy laws. If we were to raise capital through the
issuance of additional equity or if we were to engage in a recapitalization or other similar
transaction, our shareholders could suffer significant dilution and our noteholders might not
receive principal and interest payments to which they are contractually entitled on a timely basis
or at all. For more information, see the section above entitled “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Restrictive Covenants.

The credit facilities of our subsidiaries and the indentures governing our
and our subsidiaries’ other debt contain a number of significant covenants that could adversely
affect our ability to operate our business, and therefore could adversely affect our results of
operations and the price of our Class A common stock. These covenants restrict our and our
subsidiaries’ ability to:

Furthermore, our credit facilities require us to, among other things, maintain specified financial
ratios, meet specified financial tests and provide audited financial statements with an unqualified
opinion from our independent auditors. See “Description of Our Outstanding Debt” for details on
our debt covenants. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond
our control.

The breach of any covenants or obligations in the foregoing indentures or credit facilities, not
otherwise waived or amended, could result in a default under the applicable debt agreement or
instrument and could trigger acceleration of the related debt, which in turn could trigger defaults
under other agreements governing our long-term indebtedness. In addition, the secured lenders
under the Charter Operating credit facilities and the Charter Operating senior second-lien notes
could foreclose on their collateral, which includes equity interests in our subsidiaries, and
exercise other rights of secured creditors. Any default under those credit facilities, the
indentures governing our convertible notes or our subsidiaries’ debt could adversely affect our
growth, our financial condition and our results of operations and our ability to make payments on
our notes and the credit facilities and other debt of our subsidiaries. For more information, see
the section above entitled “— Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Liquidity

.

Our business requires significant cash to fund capital expenditures, debt service costs
and ongoing operations. Our ongoing operations will depend on our ability to generate cash and to
secure financing in the future.



We have historically funded liquidity and capital requirements through cash flows from operating
activities, borrowings under our credit facilities, issuances of debt and equity securities and
cash on hand.

Our ability to operate depends upon, among other things, our continued access to capital, including
credit under the Charter Operating credit facilities. These credit facilities are subject to
certain restrictive covenants, some of which require us to maintain specified financial ratios and
meet financial tests and to provide audited financial statements with an unqualified opinion from
our independent auditors. As of December 31, 2004, we were in compliance with the covenants under
our indentures and under the credit facilities and indentures of our subsidiaries, and we expect to
remain in compliance with those covenants for the next twelve months. If our operating performance
results in non-compliance with these covenants, or if any of certain other events of non-compliance
under these credit facilities or indentures governing our debt occurs, funding under the credit
facilities may not be available and defaults on some or potentially all of our debt obligations
could occur. An event of default under the credit facilities or indentures, if not waived, could
result in the acceleration of those debt obligations and, consequently, other debt obligations.
Such acceleration could result in exercise of remedies by our creditors and could force us to seek
the protection of the bankruptcy laws, which could materially adversely impact our ability to
operate our business and to make payments under our debt instruments. As of December 31, 2004, we
had borrowing availability under our credit facilities of $804 million, none of which was
restricted due to covenants.

If, at any time, additional capital or capacity is required beyond amounts internally generated or
available under our credit facilities or through additional debt or equity financings, we would
consider:

If the above strategies were not successful, could be forced to restructure our obligations or seek
protection under the bankruptcy laws. If we need to raise additional capital through the issuance
of equity or find it necessary to engage in a recapitalization or other similar transaction, our
shareholders could suffer significant dilution and our noteholders might not receive principal and
interest payments to which they are contractually entitled. For more information, see the section
above entitled “— Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Acceleration of Indebtedness of Charter’s Subsidiaries.

In the event of a default under our credit
facilities or notes, our creditors could elect to declare all amounts borrowed, together with
accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, to be due and payable. In such event, our credit
facilities and indentures would not permit Charter’s subsidiaries to distribute funds to Charter
Holdco or Charter to pay interest or principal on our notes. If the amounts outstanding under such
credit facilities or notes are accelerated, all of the debt and liabilities of Charter’s
subsidiaries would be payable from the subsidiaries’ assets, prior to any distribution of the
subsidiaries’ assets to pay the interest and principal amounts on Charter’s notes. In addition,
the lenders under our credit facilities could foreclose on their collateral, which includes equity
interests in Charter’s subsidiaries, and they could exercise other rights of secured creditors. In
any such case, we might not be able to repay or make any payments on our notes. Additionally, an
acceleration or payment default under our credit facilities would cause a cross-default in the
indentures governing the Charter Holdings notes, CCH II notes, CCO Holdings notes, Charter
Operating notes and Charter’s convertible senior notes and would trigger the cross-default
provision of the Charter Operating credit agreement. Any default under any of our credit
facilities or notes might adversely affect the holders of our notes and our growth, financial
condition and results of operations and could force us to examine all options, including seeking
the protection of the bankruptcy laws.

Charter Communications, Inc.’s Convertible Senior Notes are Structurally Subordinated to all
Liabilities of its Subsidiaries.

The borrowers and guarantors under the Charter Operating credit
facilities and senior second-lien notes are Charter’s indirect subsidiaries. A number of Charter’s
subsidiaries are also obligors under other debt instruments, including Charter Holdings, CCH II,
CCO Holdings and Charter Operating, which are each a co-issuer of senior notes and/or senior
discount notes. As of December 31, 2004, our total debt was approximately $19.5 billion, of which
$18.5 billion was structurally senior to the Charter convertible senior notes. In a
liquidation, the lenders under our credit facilities and the holders of the other debt instruments
and all other creditors



of Charter’s subsidiaries would have the right to be paid before holders of Charter’s convertible
senior notes from any of Charter’s subsidiaries’ assets.

The Charter Operating credit facilities and the indentures governing the senior notes, senior
discount notes and senior second-lien notes issued by subsidiaries of Charter contain restrictive
covenants that limit the ability of such subsidiaries to make distributions or other payments to
Charter Holdco or Charter to enable Charter to make payments on its convertible senior notes. In
addition, if Charter caused a subsidiary to make a distribution to enable it to make payments on
its convertible senior notes, and such transfer were deemed a fraudulent transfer or an unlawful
distribution, the holders of Charter’s convertible senior notes could be required to return the
payment to (or for the benefit of) the creditors of its subsidiaries. In the event of the
bankruptcy, liquidation or dissolution of a subsidiary, following payment by such subsidiary of its
liabilities, such subsidiary may not have sufficient assets remaining to make any payments to
Charter as an equity holder or otherwise and may be restricted by bankruptcy and insolvency laws
from making any such payments. The foregoing contractual and legal restrictions could limit
Charter’s ability to make payments of principal and/or interest to the holders of its convertible
senior notes.

Securities Litigation and Government Investigations.

A number of putative federal class action
lawsuits have been filed against us and certain of our former and present officers and directors
alleging violations of securities laws, which have been consolidated for pretrial purposes. In
addition, a number of other lawsuits have been filed against us in other jurisdictions. A
shareholders derivative suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
Missouri, and several class action lawsuits were filed in Delaware state court against us and
certain of our directors and officers. Finally, three shareholders derivative suits were filed in
Missouri state court against us, our then current directors and our former independent auditor.
These actions have been consolidated. The federal shareholders derivative suit, the Delaware class
actions and the consolidated derivative suit each alleged that the defendants breached their
fiduciary duties. In addition, Charter recently entered into Stipulations of Settlement setting
forth proposed terms of settlement for the above described class actions and derivative suits.
Settlement of those actions under the terms of the memoranda is subject to a number of conditions,
and there can therefore be no assurance that the actions will be settled on those terms or at all.
Additionally, a portion of the settlement is to be paid in shares of Charter’s Class A common stock
with a value of $45 million (includes shares issuable to
insurance carriers) and warrants to purchase Charter’s Class A common stock valued at $40
million, with such values in each case determined by formulas set forth in the Stipulations of
Settlement. If the price of Charter’s common stock declines, additional shares will be required in
order to fulfill this commitment. Charter has the right but not the obligation to terminate the
settlements if the value of its common stock (under the above-described formula) is less than
$2.25. See “Part II, Item 1. Legal Proceedings.”

In August 2002, we became aware of a grand jury investigation being conducted by the U.S.
Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Missouri into certain of our accounting and reporting
practices focusing on how we reported customer numbers, and our reporting of amounts received from
digital set-top terminal suppliers for advertising. The U.S. Attorney’s Office has publicly stated
that we are not a target of the investigation. We have also been advised by the U.S. Attorney’s
Office that no member of our board of directors is a target of the investigation. On July 24,
2003, a federal grand jury charged four former officers of Charter with conspiracy and mail and
wire fraud, alleging improper accounting and reporting practices focusing on revenue from digital
set-top terminal suppliers and inflated customer account numbers. Trial was set for February 7,
2005. Subsequently, each of the indicted former officers pled guilty to single conspiracy counts
related to the original mail and wire fraud charges and are awaiting sentencing. We are fully
cooperating with the investigation.

On November 4, 2002, we received an informal, non-public inquiry from the staff of the SEC. The
SEC issued a formal order of investigation dated January 23, 2003, and subsequently served document
and testimony subpoenas on Charter and a number of its former employees. The investigation and
subpoenas generally concerned our prior reports with respect to our determination of the number of
customers and various of our accounting policies and practices including our capitalization of
certain expenses and dealings with certain vendors, including programmers and digital set-top
terminal suppliers. On July 27, 2004, the SEC and Charter reached a final agreement to settle the
investigation. In the Settlement Agreement and Cease and Desist Order, Charter agreed to entry of
an administrative order prohibiting any future violations of United States securities laws and
requiring certain other remedial internal practices and public disclosures. Charter neither
admitted nor denied any wrongdoing, and the SEC assessed no fine against Charter.

Moreover, due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and investigations, and due to the
remaining conditions to the finalization of our anticipated settlements, we cannot predict with
certainty the ultimate outcome of these proceedings. An unfavorable outcome in the lawsuits or the
government investigation described above could result in substantial potential liabilities and have
a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and



results of operations or our liquidity. Further, these proceedings, and our actions in response to
these proceedings, could result in substantial additional defense costs and the diversion of
management’s attention, and could adversely affect our ability to execute our business and
financial strategies.

Competition.

The industry in which we operate is highly competitive, and has been more so in recent
years. In some instances, we compete against companies with fewer regulatory burdens, easier
access to financing, greater personnel resources, greater brand name recognition and
long-established relationships with regulatory authorities and customers. Increasing consolidation
in the cable industry and the repeal of certain ownership rules may provide additional benefits to
certain of our competitors, either through access to financing, resources or efficiencies of scale.

Our principal competitor for video services throughout our territory is direct broadcast satellite
television services, also known as DBS. Competition from DBS, including intensive marketing
efforts, aggressive pricing, and the ability of DBS to provide certain services that we are in the
process of developing, has had an adverse impact on our ability to retain customers.

DBS has grown rapidly over the last several years and continues to do so. The cable industry,
including Charter, has lost a significant number of subscribers to DBS competition, and we face
serious challenges in this area on a going forward basis. Local telephone companies and electric
utilities can compete in this area, and they increasingly may do so in the future. Certain
telephone companies have begun more extensive deployment of fiber in their networks that will
enable them to begin providing video services, as well as telephony and Internet access services,
to residential and business customers. The subscription television industry also faces competition
from free broadcast television and from other communications and entertainment media. With respect
to our Internet access services, we face competition, including intensive marketing efforts and
aggressive pricing, from telephone companies and other providers of “dial-up” and digital
subscriber line technology, also known as DSL. Further loss of customers to DBS or other
alternative video and data services and marketing efforts to retain customers and combat that loss
could have a material negative impact on the value of our business and its performance.

Mergers, joint ventures and alliances among franchised, wireless or private cable operators,
satellite television providers, local exchange carriers and others, and the repeal of certain
ownership rules may provide additional benefits to some of our competitors, either through access
to financing, resources or efficiencies of scale, or the ability to provide multiple services in
direct competition with us.

Long-Term Indebtedness — Change of Control Payments.

We may not have the ability to raise the
funds necessary to fulfill our obligations under Charter’s convertible senior notes, our senior and
senior discount notes and our credit facilities following a change of control. Under the
indentures governing the Charter convertible senior notes, upon the occurrence of specified change
of control events, including certain specified dispositions of stock by Mr. Allen, Charter is
required to offer to repurchase all of the outstanding Charter convertible senior notes. However,
we may not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control event to make the required
repurchase of the Charter convertible senior notes and Charter’s subsidiaries are limited in their
ability to make distributions or other payments to Charter to fund any required repurchase. In
addition, a change of control under our credit facilities and indentures governing our notes would
require the repayment of borrowings under those credit facilities and indentures. Because such
credit facilities and notes are obligations of Charter’s subsidiaries, the credit facilities and
the notes would have to be repaid by Charter’s subsidiaries before their assets could be available
to Charter to repurchase the Charter convertible senior notes. Charter’s failure to make or
complete a change of control offer would place it in default under the Charter convertible senior
notes. The failure of Charter’s subsidiaries to make a change of control offer or repay the
amounts outstanding under their credit facilities would place them in default under these
agreements and could result in a default under the indentures governing the Charter convertible
senior notes. See “— Certain Trends and Uncertainties — Liquidity.”

Variable Interest Rates.

At December 31, 2004, excluding the effects of hedging, approximately 31%
of our debt bears interest at variable rates that are linked to short-term interest rates. In
addition, a significant portion of our existing debt, assumed debt or debt we might arrange in the
future will bear interest at variable rates. If interest rates rise, our costs relative to those
obligations will also rise. As of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, the weighted average
interest rate on the credit facility debt was approximately 6.8% and 5.4%, the weighted average
interest rate on the high-yield debt was approximately 9.2% and 10.3%, and the weighted average
interest rate on the convertible debt was approximately 5.7% and 5.5%, respectively, resulting in a
blended weighted average interest rate of 8.8% and 8.2%, respectively. Approximately 83% of our
debt was effectively fixed including the effects of our interest rate hedge agreements as of
December 31, 2004 compared to approximately 80% at December 31, 2003.



Services.

We expect that a substantial portion of our near-term growth will be achieved through
revenues from high-speed data services, digital video, bundled service packages, and to a lesser
extent various commercial services that take advantage of cable’s broadband capacity. We may not
be able to offer these advanced services successfully to our customers or provide adequate customer
service and these advanced services may not generate adequate revenues. Also, if the vendors we
use for these services are not financially viable over time, we may experience disruption of
service and incur costs to find alternative vendors. In addition, the technology involved in our
product and service offerings generally requires that we have permission to use intellectual
property and that such property not infringe on rights claimed by others. If it is determined that
the product or service being utilized infringes on the rights of others, we may be sued or be
precluded from using the technology.

Increasing Programming Costs.

Programming has been, and is expected to continue to be, our largest
operating expense item. In recent years, the cable industry has experienced a rapid escalation in
the cost of programming, particularly sports programming. We expect programming costs to continue
to increase because of a variety of factors, including inflationary
or negotiated annual increases, additional programming being provided to
customers and increased costs to purchase or produce programming. The inability to fully pass
these programming cost increases on to our customers would have an adverse impact on our cash flow
and operating margins. As measured by programming costs, and excluding premium services
(substantially all of which were renegotiated and renewed in 2003), as of December 31, 2004
approximately 10% of our current programming contracts were expired, and approximately another 34%
are scheduled to expire by the end of 2005. There can be no assurance that these agreements will
be renewed on favorable or comparable terms. To the extent that we are unable to reach agreement
with certain programmers on terms that we believe are reasonable we may be forced to remove such
programming channels from our line-up, which could result in a further loss of customers. In
addition, our inability to fully pass these programming cost increases on to our customers would
have an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating margins.

Utilization of Net Operating Loss Carryforwards

.

As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately
$5.2 billion of tax net operating losses (resulting in a gross deferred tax asset of approximately
$2.1 billion), expiring in the years 2005 through 2024. Due to uncertainties in projected future
taxable income, valuation allowances have been established against the gross deferred tax assets
for book accounting purposes except for deferred benefits available to offset certain deferred tax
liabilities. Currently, such tax net operating losses can accumulate and be used to offset any of
our future taxable income. An “ownership change” as defined in the applicable federal income tax
rules, would place significant limitations, on an annual basis, on the use of such net operating
losses to offset any future taxable income we may generate. Such limitations, in conjunction with
the net operating loss expiration provisions, could effectively eliminate our ability to use a
substantial portion of our net operating losses to offset future taxable income.

The anticipated issuance of 150 million shares of our Class A common stock offered pursuant to a
share lending agreement executed by Charter in connection with the issuance of the 5.875%
convertible senior notes in November 2004, as well as possible future conversions of our
convertible notes, significantly increases the risk that we will experience an ownership change in
the future for tax purposes, resulting in a material limitation on the use of a substantial amount
of our existing net operating loss carryforwards. We do not believe that the issuance of shares
associated with the share lending agreement would result in our experiencing an ownership change.
However, future transactions and the timing of such transactions could cause an ownership change.
Such transactions include additional issuances of common stock by us (including but not limited to
issuances upon future conversion of our 5.875% convertible senior notes or as contemplated in the
proposed settlement of derivative class action litigation), reacquisitions of the borrowed shares
by us, or acquisitions or sales of shares by certain holders of our shares, including persons who
have held, currently hold, or accumulate in the future five percent or more of our outstanding
stock (including upon an exchange by Paul Allen or his affiliates, directly or indirectly, of
membership units of Charter Holdco into our Class A common stock). Many of the foregoing
transactions are beyond our control.

Class A Common Stock and Notes Price Volatility.

The market price of our Class A common stock and
our publicly traded notes has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile. We expect that
the price of our securities may fluctuate in response to various factors, including the factors
described in this section and various other factors, which may be beyond our control. These
factors beyond our control could include: financial forecasts by securities analysts; new
conditions or trends in the cable or telecommunications industry; general economic and market
conditions and specifically, conditions related to the cable or telecommunications industry; any
change in our debt ratings; the development of improved or competitive technologies; the use of new
products or promotions by us or our competitors; changes in accounting rules or interpretations;
new regulatory legislation adopted in the United States; and any action taken or requirements
imposed by NASDAQ if our Class A common stock trades



below $1.00 per share for over 30 consecutive trading days. On December 31, 2004, our Class A
common stock closed on NASDAQ at $2.24 per share.

In addition, the securities market in general, and the NASDAQ National Market and the market for
cable industry securities in particular, have experienced significant price fluctuations.
Volatility in the market price for companies may often be unrelated or disproportionate to the
operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may seriously
harm the market price of our Class A common stock and our notes, regardless of our operating
performance. In the past, securities litigation has often commenced following periods of
volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, and several purported class action
lawsuits were filed against us in 2001 and 2002, following a decline in our stock price.

Economic Slowdown; Global Conflict

.

It is difficult to assess the impact that the general economic
slowdown and global conflict will have on future operations. However, the economic slowdown has
resulted and could continue to result in reduced spending by customers and advertisers, which could
reduce our revenues, and also could affect our ability to collect accounts receivable and maintain
customers. Reductions in operating revenues would likely negatively affect our ability to make
expected capital expenditures and could also result in our inability to meet our obligations under
our financing agreements. These developments could also have a negative impact on our financing
and variable interest rate agreements through disruptions in the market or negative market
conditions.

Regulation and Legislation

.

Cable system operations are extensively regulated at the federal,
state, and local level, including rate regulation of basic service and equipment and municipal
approval of franchise agreements and their terms, such as franchise requirements to upgrade cable
plant and meet specified customer service standards. Additional legislation and regulation is
always possible.

Cable operators also face significant regulation of their channel carriage. They currently can be
required to devote substantial capacity to the carriage of programming that they would not carry
voluntarily, including certain local broadcast signals, local public, educational and government
access programming, and unaffiliated commercial leased access programming. This carriage burden
could increase in the future, particularly if cable systems were required to carry both the analog
and digital versions of local broadcast signals (dual carriage) or to carry multiple program
streams included with a single digital broadcast transmission (multicast carriage). Additional
government mandated broadcast carriage obligations could disrupt existing programming commitments,
interfere with our preferred use of limited channel capacity and limit our ability to offer
services that would maximize customer appeal and revenue potential. Although the FCC issued a
decision on February 10, 2005, confirming an earlier ruling against mandating either dual carriage
or multicast carriage, that decision could be appealed or Congress
could legislate additional
carriage obligations.

There is also uncertainty whether local franchising authorities, state regulators, the FCC, or the
U.S. Congress will impose obligations on cable operators to provide unaffiliated Internet service
providers with regulated access to cable plant. If they were to do so, and the obligations were
found to be lawful, it could complicate our operations in general, and our Internet operations in
particular, from a technical and marketing standpoint. These open access obligations could
adversely impact our profitability and discourage system upgrades and the introduction of new
products and services. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit recently vacated
in part an FCC ruling defining cable modem service as an “information service” and remanded for
further proceedings. The Ninth Circuit held that cable modem service is not “cable service” but is
part “telecommunications service” and part “information service.” The decision has been appealed
to the United States Supreme Court. However, if it is not reversed, the decision may lead to our
having to contribute to the federal government’s universal service fund, to comply with open access
requirements, and to subject our high-speed data operations generally to other common carrier
regulations. As we offer other advanced services over our cable system, we are likely to face
additional calls for regulation of our capacity and operation. These regulations, if adopted,
could adversely affect our operations.

Interest Rate Risk

We use interest rate risk management derivative instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements
and interest rate collar agreements (collectively referred to herein as interest rate agreements)
as required under the terms of the credit facilities of our subsidiaries. Our policy is to manage
interest costs using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt. Using interest rate swap agreements,
we agree to exchange, at specified intervals through 2007, the difference between fixed and
variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount.
Interest rate collar agreements are used to limit our exposure to, and to derive benefits from,
interest rate fluctuations



on variable rate debt to within a certain range of rates. Interest rate risk management agreements
are not held or issued for speculative or trading purposes.

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, we had outstanding $2.7 billion and $3.0 billion and $20 million and
$520 million, respectively, in notional amounts of interest rate swaps and collars, respectively.
The notional amounts of interest rate instruments do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties
and, thus, are not a measure of our exposure to credit loss. See “Item 7A. Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” for further information regarding the fair values and
contract terms of our interest rate agreements.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued the revised SFAS No. 123,

Share-Based Payment

, which addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions in which a
company receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of that company or (b)
liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company’s equity instruments or that may be
settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. This statement will be effective for us
beginning July 1, 2005. Because we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123
on January 1, 2003, we do not expect this revised standard to have a material impact on our
financial statements.

We do not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements,
if adopted, would have a material effect on our accompanying financial statements.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to various market risks, including fluctuations in interest rates. We use interest
rate risk management derivative instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements and interest
rate collar agreements (collectively referred to herein as interest rate agreements) as required
under the terms of the credit facilities of our subsidiaries. Our policy is to manage interest
costs using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt. Using interest rate swap agreements, we agree
to exchange, at specified intervals through 2007, the difference between fixed and variable
interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. Interest
rate collar agreements are used to limit our exposure to, and to derive benefits from, interest
rate fluctuations on variable rate debt to within a certain range of rates. Interest rate risk
management agreements are not held or issued for speculative or trading purposes.

As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, our long-term debt totaled approximately $19.5 billion and $18.6
billion, respectively. This debt was comprised of approximately $5.5 billion and $7.2 billion of
credit facilities debt, $13.3 billion and $11.2 billion principal amount of high-yield notes and
$1.0 billion and $774 million principal amount of convertible senior notes, respectively.

As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the weighted average interest rate on the credit facility debt
was approximately 6.8% and 5.4%, the weighted average interest rate on the high-yield notes was
approximately 9.2% and 10.3%, and the weighted average interest rate on the convertible senior
notes was approximately 5.7% and 5.5%, respectively, resulting in a blended weighted average
interest rate of 8.8% and 8.2%, respectively. The interest rate on approximately 83% and 80% of
the total principal amount of our debt was effectively fixed, including the effects of our interest
rate hedge agreements as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The fair value of our
high-yield notes was $12.2 billion and $9.9 billion at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
The fair value of our convertible senior notes was $1.1 billion and $732 million at December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively. The fair value of our credit facilities is $5.5 billion and $6.9
billion at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The fair value of high-yield and convertible
notes is based on quoted market prices, and the fair value of the credit facilities is based on
dealer quotations.

We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. We do, however, have certain
interest rate derivative instruments that have been designated as cash flow hedging instruments.
Such instruments effectively convert variable interest payments on certain debt instruments into
fixed payments. For qualifying hedges, SFAS No. 133 allows derivative gains and losses to offset
related results on hedged items in the consolidated statement of operations. We have formally
documented, designated and assessed the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge
accounting. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, net gain (loss) on derivative
instruments



and hedging activities includes gains of $4 million and $8 million and losses of $14 million,
respectively, which represent cash flow hedge ineffectiveness on interest rate hedge agreements
arising from differences between the critical terms of the agreements and the related hedged
obligations. Changes in the fair value of interest rate agreements designated as hedging
instruments of the variability of cash flows associated with floating-rate debt obligations that
meet the effectiveness criteria of SFAS No. 133 are reported in accumulated other comprehensive
loss. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, a gain of $42 million and $48 million
and losses of $65 million, respectively, related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow
hedges, was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and minority interest. The amounts
are subsequently reclassified into interest expense as a yield adjustment in the same period in
which the related interest on the floating-rate debt obligations affects earnings (losses).

Certain interest rate derivative instruments are not designated as hedges as they do not meet the
effectiveness criteria specified by SFAS No. 133. However, management believes such instruments
are closely correlated with the respective debt, thus managing associated risk. Interest rate
derivative instruments not designated as hedges are marked to fair value, with the impact recorded
as gain (loss) on derivative instruments and hedging activities in our statements of operations.
For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, net gain (loss) on derivative instruments and
hedging activities includes gains of $65 million and $57 million and losses of $101 million,
respectively, for interest rate derivative instruments not designated as hedges.

The table set forth below summarizes the fair values and contract terms of financial instruments
subject to interest rate risk maintained by us as of December 31, 2004 (dollars in millions):

The notional amounts of interest rate instruments do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties
and, thus, are not a measure of our exposure to credit loss. The amounts exchanged are determined
by reference to the notional amount and the other terms of the contracts. The estimated fair value
approximates the costs (proceeds) to settle the outstanding contracts. Interest rates on variable
debt are estimated using the average implied forward London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) rates
for the year of maturity based on the yield curve in effect at December 31, 2004.

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, we had outstanding $2.7 billion and $3.0 billion and $20 million and
$520 million, respectively, in notional amounts of interest rate swaps and collars, respectively.
The notional amounts of interest rate instruments do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties
and, thus, are not a measure of exposure to credit loss. The amounts exchanged are determined by
reference to the notional amount and the other terms of the contracts.

Controls and Procedures.

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this report, management, including our Interim Chief
Executive Officer and Interim Co-Chief Financial Officers, evaluated the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures with respect to the information
generated for use in this annual report. The evaluation was based in part upon reports and
affidavits provided by a number of executives. Based upon, and as of the date of that evaluation,
our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Interim Co-Chief Financial Officers concluded that the
disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurances that information
required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
Commission’s rules and forms.

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during 2004 that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.

In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that
any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable,
not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and management necessarily was
required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and
procedures. Based upon the above evaluation, Charter’s management believes that its controls do
provide such reasonable assurance.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Charter’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended). Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to Charter’s
management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published
financial statements.

Charter’s management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework.

Based on management’s assessment utilizing these criteria we believe that,
as of December 31, 2004, our internal control over financial reporting was effective

.

Our independent auditors, KPMG, LLP have audited management’s assessment of our internal control
over financial reporting as stated in their report on page F-3.

members of the Compensation Committee are more fully described in “ —  Director Compensation” and
in “Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions — Other Miscellaneous Relationships.”

During 2004, (1) none of our executive officers served on the compensation committee of any other
company that has an executive officer currently serving on the board of directors, Compensation
Committee or Option Plan Committee of Charter and (2) except for Carl Vogel who served as a
director of Digeo, Inc., an entity of which Paul Allen is a director and by virtue of his position
as Chairman of the board of directors of Digeo, Inc. is also a non-employee executive officer, none
of our executive officers served as a director of another entity, one of whose executive officers
served on the Compensation Committee or Option Plan Committee of Charter.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance

Section 16 of the Exchange Act requires our directors and certain of our officers, and persons who
own more than 10% of our common stock, to file initial reports of ownership and reports of changes
in ownership with the SEC. Such persons are required by SEC regulation to furnish us with copies
of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely on our review of the copies of such forms
furnished to us and written representations from these officers and directors, we believe that all
Section 16(a) filing requirements were met in 2004.



Code of Ethics

In January 2003, we adopted a Code of Conduct that constitutes a Code of Ethics within the meaning
of federal securities regulations for our employees, including all executive officers, and
established a hotline and website for reporting alleged violations of the code of conduct,
established procedures for processing complaints and implemented educational programs to inform our
employees regarding the Code of Conduct. A copy of our Code of Conduct is filed as Exhibit 14.1 to
this annual report.

Option/Stock Incentive Plans

The Plans.

We have granted stock options, restricted stock and other incentive compensation under
two plans — the 1999 Charter Communications Option Plan and the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan. The
1999 Charter Communications Option Plan provided for the grant of options to purchase membership
units in Charter Holdco to current and prospective employees and consultants of Charter Holdco and
its affiliates and to our current and prospective non-employee directors. Membership units
received upon exercise of any options are immediately exchanged for shares of Charter Class A
common stock on a one-for-one basis.

The 2001 Stock Incentive Plan provides for the grant of non-qualified stock options, stock
appreciation rights, dividend equivalent rights, performance units and performance shares, share
awards, phantom stock and/or shares of restricted stock (not to exceed 3,000,000 shares) as each
term is defined in the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan. Employees, officers, consultants and directors
of Charter and its subsidiaries and affiliates are eligible to receive grants under the 2001 Stock
Incentive Plan. Generally, options expire 10 years from the grant date. Unless sooner terminated
by our board of directors, the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan will terminate on February 12, 2011, and
no option or award can be granted thereafter.

Together, the plans allow for the issuance of up to a total of 90,000,000 shares of our Class A
common stock (or units exchangeable for our Class A common stock). Any shares covered by options
that are terminated under the 1999 Charter Communications Option Plan will be transferred to the
2001 Stock Incentive Plan, and no new options will be granted under the 1999 Charter Communications
Option Plan. At December 31, 2004, 1,004,848 shares had been issued under the plans upon exercise
of options, 187,699 had been issued upon vesting of restricted stock granted under the plans, and
2,076,860 shares were subject to future vesting under restricted stock agreements. Of the
remaining 86,730,593 shares covered by the plans, as of December 31, 2004, 24,834,513 were subject
to outstanding options (31% of which were vested), and there were 6,899,600 performance shares
granted under Charter’s Long-Term Incentive Program as of December 31, 2004, to vest on the third
anniversary of the date of grant conditional upon Charter’s performance against certain financial
targets approved by Charter’s board of directors at the time of the award. As of December 31,
2004, 54,996,480 shares remained available for future grants under the plans.

The plans authorize the repricing of options, which could include reducing the exercise price per
share of any outstanding option, permitting the cancellation, forfeiture or tender of outstanding
options in exchange for other awards or for new options with a lower exercise price per share, or
repricing or replacing any outstanding options by any other method.

In January 2004, the Compensation Committee of our board of directors approved our Long-Term
Incentive Program, or LTIP, which is a program administered under the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan.
Under the LTIP, employees of Charter and its subsidiaries whose pay classifications exceed a
certain level are eligible to receive stock options, and more senior level employees were eligible
to receive stock options and performance shares. The stock options vest 25% on each of the first
four anniversaries of the date of grant. The performance shares vest at the end of a three-year performance cycle



and shares of Class A common stock are issued, conditional
upon our performance against financial performance measures established by our management and
approved by the board of directors as of the time of the award. We granted 6,899,600 million
performance shares in January 2004 under this program and recognized expense of $8 million in the
first three quarters of 2004. However, in the fourth quarter of 2004, we reversed the entire $8
million of expense based on our assessment of the probability of achieving the financial
performance measures established by management and required to be met for the performance shares to
vest.

The 2001 Stock Incentive Plan must be administered by, and grants and awards to eligible
individuals must be approved by our board of directors or a committee thereof consisting solely of nonemployee directors as defined in
Section 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended. The board of directors or such committee
determines the terms of each stock option grant, restricted stock grant or other award at the time of grant, including the exercise price to be paid for the shares, the vesting schedule for each
option, the price, if any, to be paid by the grantee for the
restricted stock, the restrictions placed on the shares, and the time
or times when the restrictions will lapse. The board of directors or
such committee also has the power to accelerate the vesting of any grant or extend the term thereof.

Upon a change of control of
Charter, the board of directors or the administering committee can shorten the exercise period of
any option, have the survivor or successor entity assume the options with appropriate adjustments,
or cancel options and pay out in cash. If an optionee’s or grantee’s employment is terminated
without “cause” or for “good reason” following a “change in control” (as those terms are defined in
the plans), unless otherwise provided in an agreement, with respect to such optionee’s or grantee’s
awards under the plans, all outstanding options will become immediately and fully exercisable, all
outstanding stock appreciation rights will become immediately and fully exercisable, the
restrictions on the outstanding restricted stock will lapse, and all of the outstanding performance
shares will vest and the restrictions on all of the outstanding performance shares will lapse as if
all performance objectives had been satisfied at the maximum level.

February 2004 Option Exchange.

In January 2004, we offered employees of Charter and its
subsidiaries the right to exchange all stock options (vested and unvested) under the 1999 Charter
Communications Option Plan and 2001 Stock Incentive Plan that had an exercise price over $10 per
share for shares of restricted Charter Class A common stock or, in some instances, cash. Based on
a sliding exchange ratio, which varied depending on the exercise price of an employee’s outstanding
options, if an employee would have received more than 400 shares of restricted stock in exchange
for tendered options, we issued to that employee shares of restricted stock in the exchange. If,
based on the exchange ratios, an employee would have received 400 or fewer shares of restricted
stock in exchange for tendered options, we instead paid to the employee cash in an amount equal to
the number of shares the employee would have received multiplied by $5.00. The offer applied to
options to purchase a total of 22,929,573 shares of Class A common stock, or approximately 48% of
our 47,882,365 total options (vested and unvested) issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2003.
Participation by employees was voluntary. Non-employee members of the board of directors of
Charter or any of its subsidiaries were not eligible to participate in the exchange offer.

In the closing of the exchange offer on February 20, 2004, we accepted for cancellation eligible
options to purchase approximately 18,137,664 shares of our Class A common stock. In exchange, we
granted approximately 1,966,686 shares of restricted stock, including 460,777 performance shares to
eligible employees of the rank of senior vice president and above, and paid a total cash amount of
approximately $4 million (which amount includes applicable withholding taxes) to those employees
who received cash rather than shares of restricted stock. The restricted stock was granted on
February 25, 2004. Employees tendered approximately 79% of the options eligible to be exchanged
under the program.

The cost of the stock option exchange program was approximately $10 million, with a 2004 cash
compensation expense of approximately $4 million and a non-cash compensation expense of
approximately $6 million to be expensed ratably over the three-year vesting period of the
restricted stock issued in the exchange.

Employment Arrangements

Messrs. May and Chang serve pursuant to letter agreements described below. Mr. Vogel and Ms.
Bellville are no longer employees, but served during 2004 pursuant to employment agreements as
described below.

Charter entered into an agreement with Robert P. May, effective January 17, 2005, whereby Mr. May
serves as Charter’s Interim President and Chief Executive Officer (the “May Executive Services
Agreement’’). Under the May Executive Services Agreement, Mr. May receives a $1,250,000 base fee
per year. If Mr. May becomes Charter’s permanent President and Chief Executive Officer or is
terminated without cause, Mr. May will be eligible to receive a one-time discretionary bonus up to
100% of the actual base fee paid to him for his interim service under the



agreement, based on individual and company performance. Mr. May will continue to receive the
compensation and reimbursement of expenses to which he is entitled in his capacity as a member of
the board of directors. Mr. May may terminate the May Executive Services Agreement on thirty (30)
days notice. Charter may terminate such agreement upon three (3) months notice, and Charter may
elect at its discretion to pay Mr. May the base rate for such period in lieu of all or part of the
notice. Subject to the approval of the board of directors or a
suitable committee thereof, Mr. May will be granted
options to purchase shares of Charter Class A common stock and/or receive a grant of restricted
stock pursuant to the Charter Communications, Inc. 2001 Stock Incentive Plan, the number and terms
of which will be determined as soon as practicable. Mr. May serves as an independent contractor
and is not entitled to any vacation or eligible to participate in any employee benefit programs of
Charter. Charter will reimburse Mr. May for reasonable transportation costs from Mr. May’s
residence in Florida or other locations to Charter’s offices and will provide temporary living
quarters or reimburse expenses related thereto.

Mr. Chang is employed under the terms contained in an offer letter effective December 2, 2003
providing for an annual base salary of $400,000 (which has since been increased to $450,000 per
year) and eligibility for an annual incentive target of 100% of the base salary (based on a
combination of personal performance goals and overall company performance). Mr. Chang is also
eligible to participate in our 2001 Stock Incentive Plan. Under this plan, Mr. Chang was granted
350,000 options to purchase Class A common stock and 50,000 restricted shares on December 9, 2003.
Mr. Chang is also entitled to participate in our LTIP. Mr. Chang’s agreement provides that one
half of each of his unvested restricted shares would immediately vest, and one half of his unvested
options of the initial option grant would vest if he is terminated without cause or if he elects to
terminate his employment due to (1) a change in our Chief Executive Officer, (2) a change in
reporting relationship to anyone other than the Chief Executive Officer, (3) a requirement that the
employee relocate, or (4) a change of control of Charter, if terminated without cause. In
addition, Mr. Chang would be entitled to eighteen months of full severance benefits at his current
compensation rate, plus the pro rata portion of his bonus amounts within thirty days after
termination because of any of these events. In light of Mr. Vogel’s resignation, Charter and Mr.
Chang have agreed that he will have until April 15, 2005 to exercise his right to terminate his
employment and receive the foregoing vesting, severance and other benefits. In addition, Charter
has agreed that it will pay Mr. Chang a special $150,000 bonus, in addition to any other bonuses to
which he may be otherwise entitled, conditioned on Mr. Chang’s continued service as Interim
co-Chief Financial Officer through March 31, 2005, or any earlier date on which Charter may appoint
a new permanent Chief Financial Officer, and on his continued employment with Charter when the
bonus is payable in March 2005. Mr. Chang has informed Charter of his intention to resign effective April 15, 2005.

Until his resignation in January 2005, Mr. Vogel was employed as President and Chief Executive
Officer, earning a base annual salary of $1,000,000 and was eligible to receive an annual bonus of
up to $500,000, a portion of which was based on personal performance goals and a portion of which
was based on company performance measured against criteria established by the board with Mr. Vogel.
Pursuant to his employment agreement, Mr. Vogel was granted 3,400,000 options to purchase Class A
common stock and 50,000 shares of restricted stock under our 2001 Stock Incentive Plan. In the
February 2004 option exchange, Mr. Vogel exchanged his 3,400,000 options for 340,000 shares of
restricted stock and 340,000 performance shares. Mr. Vogel’s initial 50,000 restricted shares
vested 25% on the grant date, with the remainder vesting in 36 equal monthly installments beginning
December 2002. The 340,000 shares of restricted stock were to vest over a three-year period, with
one-third of the shares vesting on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date. The
340,000 performance shares were to vest at the end of a three-year period if certain financial
criteria were met. Mr. Vogel’s agreement provided that, if Mr. Vogel is terminated without cause
or if Mr. Vogel terminated the agreement for good reason, he is entitled to his aggregate base
salary due during the remainder of the term and full prorated benefits and bonus for the year in
which termination occurs. Mr. Vogel’s agreement included a covenant not to compete for the balance
of the initial term or any renewal term, but no more than one year in the event of termination
without cause or by Mr. Vogel with good reason. Mr. Vogel’s agreement entitled him to participate
in any disability insurance, pensions or other benefit plans afforded to employees generally or to
our executives, including our LTIP. We agreed to reimburse Mr. Vogel annually for the cost of term
life insurance in the amount of $5 million, although he declined this reimbursement in 2002, 2003
and 2004. Mr. Vogel was entitled to reimbursement of fees and dues for his membership in a country
club of his choice, which he declined in 2002, 2003 and 2004, and reimbursement for up to $10,000
per year for tax, legal and financial planning services. His agreement also provided for a car and
associated expenses for Mr. Vogel’s use. Mr. Vogel’s agreement provided for automatic one-year
renewals and also provided that we would cause him to be elected to our board of directors without
any additional compensation.

In February 2005, Charter entered into an agreement with Mr. Vogel setting forth the terms of his
resignation. Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Vogel received in February 2005 all accrued and
unpaid base salary and vacation pay through the date of resignation and a lump sum payment equal to
the remainder of his base salary during 2005 (totaling $953,425). In addition, he will receive a
lump sum cash payment of $500,000 at December 31, 2005, which is subject to reduction to the extent
of compensation attributable to certain competitive activities.



Mr. Vogel will continue to receive certain health benefits during 2005 and COBRA premiums for such
health insurance coverage for 18 months thereafter. All of his outstanding stock options, as well
as his restricted stock granted in 2004 (excluding 340,000 shares of restricted stock granted as
“performance units”, which will automatically be forfeited), will continue to vest through December
31, 2005. In addition, one-half of the remaining unvested portion of his 2001 restricted stock
grant will vest immediately, and the other half was forfeited. Mr. Vogel will have 60 days after
December 31, 2005 to exercise any outstanding vested stock options. Under the agreement, Mr. Vogel
waived any further right to any bonus or incentive plan participation and provided certain releases
of claims against Charter and its subsidiaries from any claims arising out of or based upon any
facts occurring prior to the date of the agreement, but Charter will continue to provide Mr. Vogel
certain indemnification rights and to include Mr. Vogel in its director and officer liability
insurance for a period of six years. Charter and its subsidiaries also agreed to provide releases
of certain claims against Mr. Vogel with certain exceptions reserved. Mr. Vogel has also agreed,
with limited exceptions that he will continue to be bound by the covenant not to compete,
confidentiality and non-disparagement provisions contained in his 2001 employment agreement.

Ms. Bellville was employed as Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer. Until her
resignation in September 2004, she was employed under an employment agreement entered into as of
April 27, 2003, that would have terminated on September 1, 2007. Her annual base salary was
$625,000 and she was eligible to receive an annual bonus in an amount to be determined by our board
of directors, with a contractual minimum for 2003 of $203,125. Commencing in 2004, Ms. Bellville
would have been eligible to receive a target annual bonus equal to 100% of her base salary for the
applicable year at the discretion of the board of directors, 50% to be based on personal
performance goals and 50% to be based on overall company performance. Under a prior offer letter
dated December 3, 2002, Ms. Bellville was granted 500,000 options to purchase shares of our Class A
common stock, which vested 25% on the date of the grant (December 9, 2002), with the balance to
vest in 36 equal installments commencing January 2003. Ms. Bellville’s employment agreement
provided that if she was terminated without cause or if she terminated the agreement for good
reason (including due to a change in control or if Ms. Bellville was required to report, directly
or indirectly, to persons other than the Chief Executive Officer), we would pay Ms. Bellville an
amount equal to the aggregate base salary due to Ms. Bellville during the remainder of the term, or
renewal term and a full prorated bonus for the year in which the termination occurs, within thirty
days of termination. Ms. Bellville’s agreement included a covenant not to compete for the balance
of the initial term or any renewal term, but no more than one year, in the event of termination
without cause or by her with good reason. Her agreement further provided that she was entitled to
participate in any disability insurance, pension or other benefit plan afforded to employees
generally or to executives, including our LTIP. Ms. Bellville was entitled to a monthly car
allowance and reimbursement for all business expenses associated with the use of such car. Ms.
Bellville’s agreement provided that she was entitled to the reimbursement of dues for her
membership in a country club of her choice, and reimbursement for up to $5,000 per year for tax,
legal and financial planning services. Her base salary may have been increased at the discretion
of our board of directors. Ms. Bellville’s agreement provided for automatic one-year renewals.

On September 16, 2004, Charter entered into an agreement with Ms. Bellville governing the terms and
conditions of her resignation as an officer and employee of Charter. Under the terms of this
agreement, Ms. Bellville has the right to receive 65 weeks of base pay based on an annual base of
$625,000, plus usual compensation for all accrued vacation and other leave time. Her options to
purchase 700,000 shares of Class A common stock will continue to vest during the salary
continuation period. Ms. Bellville will have 60 days after the expiration of the salary
continuation period to exercise any outstanding vested options at the applicable exercise prices
established at each grant date. To date, Ms. Bellville has exercised her options to purchase
350,000 shares. Ms. Bellville is entitled to receive relocation benefits under Charter’s current
relocation policy with respect to a move to a specified geographic area and will be provided
outplacement assistance for 6 months following the date of her separation from Charter. Her
resignation was effective September 30, 2004. The agreement provides that the previously existing
employment agreement would terminate, except for certain ongoing obligations on Ms. Bellville’s
part concerning confidentiality, non-solicitation and non-disparagement. The contractual
restriction on her ability to solicit current Charter employees does not apply to persons who, at
the time of solicitation, have not worked for Charter in the prior 6 months and are not receiving
severance from Charter. In addition, the non-competition provisions of her employment agreement
were waived. Under the agreement, Ms. Bellville waived a right to any bonus or incentive plan and
released Charter from any claims arising out of or based upon any facts occurring prior to the date
of the agreement, but Charter will continue to provide Ms. Bellville certain indemnification rights
for that period.

In addition to the indemnification provisions which apply to all employees under our bylaws, Mr.
Vogel’s and Ms. Bellville’s agreements provide that we will indemnify and hold harmless each
employee to the maximum extent permitted by law from and against any claims, damages, liabilities,
losses, costs or expenses in connection with or



arising out of the performance by the applicable employee of his or her duties. Each of the above
agreements also contains confidentiality and non-solicitation provisions.

Effective January 28, 2005, we eliminated the position of Chief Administrative Officer, resulting
in the termination of employment of Steven A. Schumm, Executive Vice President and Chief
Administrative Officer from Charter and each of our subsidiaries for which Mr. Schumm served as an
officer. Pursuant to a Separation Agreement executed on February 8, 2005, we will continue to pay
Mr. Schumm’s base salary for 65 weeks at an annual rate of $450,000, and Mr. Schumm will be paid a
bonus of $15,815 at such time as other executives receive their bonuses. Mr. Schumm’s stock
options will continue to vest during the 65-week severance period, and he will have 60 days
thereafter to exercise any vested options.

We have established separation guidelines which generally apply to all employees in situations
where management determines that an employee is entitled to severance benefits. Severance benefits
are granted solely in management’s discretion and are not an employee entitlement or guaranteed
benefit. The guidelines provide that persons employed at the level of Senior Vice President may be
eligible to receive between six and fifteen months of severance benefits and persons employed at
the level of Executive Vice President may be eligible to receive between nine and eighteen months
of severance benefits in the event of separation under certain circumstances generally including
elimination of a position, work unit or general staff reduction. Separation benefits are
contingent upon the signing of a separation agreement containing certain provisions including a
release of all claims against us. Severance amounts paid under these guidelines are distinct and
separate from any one-time, special or enhanced severance programs that may be approved by us from
time to time.

Our senior executives are
eligible to receive bonuses according to our 2005 Executive Bonus
Plan. Under this plan, our executive officers and certain other
management and professional employees are eligible to receive an
annual bonus. Each participating employee would receive his or
her target bonus if Charter (or such employee’s division) meets
specified performance measures for revenues, operating cash flow,
free cash flow and customer satisfaction.

Limitation of Directors’ Liability and Indemnification Matters

Our certificate of incorporation limits the liability of directors to the maximum extent permitted
by Delaware law. The Delaware General Corporation Law provides that a corporation may eliminate or
limit the personal liability of a director for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a
director, except for liability for:

(1) any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to the corporation and its shareholders;

(2) acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing
violation of law;

(3) unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock purchases or redemptions; or

(4) any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.

Our bylaws provide that we will indemnify all persons whom we may indemnify pursuant thereto to the
fullest extent permitted by law.

Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to
directors, officers or persons controlling us pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we have been
informed that in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed
in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.

We have reimbursed certain of our current and former directors, officers and employees in
connection with their defense in certain legal actions. See “Item 13. Certain Relationships and
Related Transactions — Other Miscellaneous Relationships — Indemnification Advances.’’

stock because such holdings are either convertible into Class A shares (in the case of Class B
shares and convertible senior notes) or exchangeable (directly or indirectly) for Class A shares
(in the case of the membership units) on a one-for-one basis. Unless otherwise noted, the named
holders have sole investment and voting power with respect to the shares listed as beneficially
owned. An issue has arisen as to whether the documentation for the Bresnan transaction was
correct and complete with regard to the ultimate ownership of the CC VIII, LLC membership
interests following the consummation of the Bresnan put transaction on June 6, 2003. See “Item
13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions — Transactions Arising out of Our
Organizational Structure and Mr. Allen’s Investment in Charter Communications, Inc. and Its
Subsidiaries — Equity Put Rights — CC VIII.”

(5)

The calculation of this percentage assumes for each person that:

A person is deemed to have the right to acquire shares of Class A common stock with respect
to options vested under the 1999 Charter Communications Option Plan. When vested, these
options are exercisable for membership units of Charter Holdco, which are immediately
exchanged on a one-for-one basis for shares of Charter Class A common stock. A person is
also deemed to have the right to acquire shares of Class A common stock issuable upon the
exercise of vested options under the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan.

(6)

The calculation of this percentage assumes that Mr. Allen’s equity interests are retained in
the form that maximizes voting power (i.e., the 50,000 shares of Class B common stock held by
Mr. Allen have not been converted into shares of Class A common stock; that the membership
units of Charter Holdco owned by each of Vulcan Cable III Inc. and Charter Investment, Inc.
have not been exchanged for shares of Class A common stock).

(7)

The total listed includes:

•

222,818,858 membership units in Charter Holdco held by Charter Investment, Inc.; and

•

116,313,173 membership units in Charter Holdco held by Vulcan Cable III Inc.

The listed total excludes 24,273,943 shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exchange of
units of Charter Holdco, which may be issuable to Charter Investment, Inc. (which is owned by
Mr. Allen) as a consequence of the closing of his purchase of the membership interests in CC
VIII, LLC that were put to Mr. Allen and were purchased by him on June 6, 2003. An issue has
arisen regarding the ultimate ownership of such CC VIII, LLC membership interests following the
consummation of such put transaction. See “Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related
Transactions — Transactions Arising out of Our Organizational Structure and Mr. Allen’s

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.

The following sets forth certain transactions in which we are involved and in which the directors,
executive officers and affiliates of Charter have or may have a material interest. The
transactions fall generally into three broad categories:

•

Transactions in which Mr. Allen has an interest that arise directly out of Mr. Allen’s
investment in Charter and Charter Holdco

.

A large number of the transactions described
below arise out of Mr. Allen’s direct and indirect (through Charter Investment, Inc., or
the Vulcan entities, each of which Mr. Allen controls) investment in Charter and its
subsidiaries, as well as commitments made as consideration for the investments themselves.

•

Transactions with third party providers of products, services and content in which Mr.
Allen has or had a material interest

.

Mr. Allen has had numerous investments in the areas
of technology and media. We have a number of commercial relationships with third parties
in which Mr. Allen has or had an interest.

•

Other Miscellaneous Transactions

.

We have a limited number of transactions in which
certain of the officers, directors and principal shareholders of Charter and its
subsidiaries, other than Mr. Allen, have an interest.

A number of our debt instruments and those of our subsidiaries require delivery of fairness
opinions for transactions with Mr. Allen or his affiliates involving more than $50 million. Such
fairness opinions have been obtained whenever required. All of our transactions with Mr. Allen or
his affiliates have been considered for approval either by the board of directors of Charter or a
committee of the board of directors and, in compliance with corporate governance requirements, all
related party transactions are considered by Charter’s Audit Committee comprised entirely of
independent directors. All of our transactions with Mr. Allen or his affiliates have been deemed
by the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors to be in our best interest.
Except where noted below, we do not believe that these transactions present any unusual risks for
us that would not be present in any similar commercial transaction.

The chart below summarizes certain information with respect to these transactions. Additional
information regarding these transactions is provided following the chart.

The following sets forth additional information regarding the transactions summarized above.

Transactions Arising Out
of Our Organizational Structure and Mr. Allen’s Investment
in Charter Communications, Inc. and
Its Subsidiaries

As noted above, a number of our related party transactions arise out of Mr. Allen’s investment in
Charter and its subsidiaries. Some of these transactions are with Charter Investment, Inc. and
Vulcan Ventures (both owned 100% by Mr. Allen), Charter (controlled by Mr. Allen) and Charter
Holdco (approximately 47% owned by us and 53% owned by other affiliates of Mr. Allen). See “Item
1. Business — Organizational Chart” for more information regarding the ownership by Mr. Allen and
certain of his affiliates.

Intercompany Management Arrangements.

Charter is a party to management arrangements with Charter Holdco and certain of its subsidiaries.
Under these agreements, Charter provides management services for the cable systems owned or
operated by its subsidiaries. These management agreements provide for reimbursement to Charter for
all costs and expenses incurred by it attributable to the ownership and operation of the managed
cable systems (referred to as “company expenses”), plus an additional fee to reimburse additional
costs incurred by Charter that are not in the nature of company expenses (such as corporate
overhead, administration and salary expense). The management agreements covering the CC VI, CC
VII, and CC VIII companies limit the additional fee that is not in respect of company expenses to
5%, 5%, and 3.5%, respectively, of their respective gross revenues. Under the arrangement covering
all of our other operating subsidiaries, there is no limit on the dollar amount or percentage of
revenues payable as this additional fee.

However, the total amount paid by Charter Holdco and all of its subsidiaries is limited to the
amount necessary to reimburse Charter for all of its expenses, costs, losses, liabilities and
damages paid or incurred by it in connection with the performance of its services under the various
management agreements and in connection with its corporate overhead, administration, salary expense
and similar items. The expenses subject to reimbursement include fees Charter is obligated to pay
under the mutual services agreement with Charter Investment, Inc. Payment of management fees by
Charter’s operating subsidiaries is subject to certain restrictions under the credit facilities and
indentures of such subsidiaries and the indentures governing the Charter Holdings public debt. If
any portion of the management fee due and payable is not paid, it is deferred by Charter and
accrued as a liability of such subsidiaries. Any deferred amount of the management fee will bear
interest at the rate of 10% per year, compounded annually, from the date it was due and payable
until the date it is paid. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the subsidiaries of Charter
Holdings paid a total of $90 million in management fees to Charter.

Mutual Services Agreement

Charter, Charter Holdco and Charter Investment, Inc. are parties to a mutual services agreement
whereby each party shall provide rights and services to the other parties as may be reasonably
requested for the management of the entities involved and their subsidiaries, including the cable
systems owned by their subsidiaries all on a cost-reimbursement basis. The officers and employees
of each party are available to the other parties to provide these



rights and services, and all expenses and costs incurred in providing these rights and services are
paid by Charter. Each of the parties will indemnify and hold harmless the other parties and their
directors, officers and employees from and against any and all claims that may be made against any
of them in connection with the mutual services agreement except due to its or their gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The mutual services agreement expires on November 12, 2009, and
may be terminated at any time by any party upon thirty days’ written notice to the other. For the
year ended December 31, 2004, Charter paid approximately $74 million to Charter Holdco for services
rendered pursuant to the mutual services agreement. All such amounts are reimbursable to Charter
pursuant to a management arrangement with our subsidiaries. See “ —  Intercompany Management
Arrangements.” The accounts and balances related to these services eliminate in consolidation.
Charter Investment, Inc. no longer provides services pursuant to this agreement.

Previous Management Agreement with Charter Investment, Inc.

Prior to November 12, 1999, Charter Investment, Inc. provided management and consulting services to
our operating subsidiaries for a fee equal to 3.5% of the gross revenues of the systems then owned,
plus reimbursement of expenses. The balance of management fees payable under the previous
management agreement was accrued with payment at the discretion of Charter Investment, Inc., with
interest payable on unpaid amounts. For the year ended December 31, 2004, Charter’s subsidiaries
did not pay any fees to Charter Investment, Inc. to reduce management fees payable. As of December
31, 2004, total management fees payable by our subsidiaries to Charter Investment, Inc. were
approximately $14 million, exclusive of any interest that may be charged.

Charter Communications Holding Company, LLC Limited Liability Agreement — Taxes

The limited liability company agreement of Charter Holdco contains special provisions regarding the

allocation of tax losses and profits among its members — Vulcan Cable III Inc., Charter
Investment, Inc. and us. In some situations, these provisions may cause us to pay more tax than
would otherwise be due if Charter Holdco had allocated profits and losses among its members based
generally on the number of common membership units. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates — Income Taxes.”

Vulcan Ventures Channel Access Agreement

Vulcan Ventures, an entity controlled by Mr. Allen, Charter, Charter Investment and Charter Holdco
are parties to an agreement dated September 21, 1999 granting to Vulcan Ventures the right to use
up to eight of our digital cable channels as partial consideration for a prior capital contribution
of $1.325 billion. Specifically, at Vulcan Ventures’ request, we will provide Vulcan Ventures with
exclusive rights for carriage of up to eight digital cable television programming services or
channels on each of the digital cable systems with local and to the extent available, national
control of the digital product owned, operated, controlled or managed by Charter or its
subsidiaries now or in the future of 550 megahertz or more. If the system offers digital services
but has less than 550 megahertz of capacity, then the programming services will be equitably
reduced. Upon request of Vulcan Ventures, we will attempt to reach a comprehensive programming
agreement pursuant to which it will pay the programmer, if possible, a fee per digital video
customer. If such fee arrangement is not achieved, then we and the programmer shall enter into a
standard programming agreement. The initial term of the channel access agreement was 10 years, and
the term extends by one additional year (such that the remaining term continues to be 10 years) on
each anniversary date of the agreement unless either party provides the other with notice to the
contrary at least 60 days prior to such anniversary date. To date, Vulcan Ventures has not
requested to use any of these channels. However, in the future it is possible that Vulcan Ventures
could require us to carry programming that is less profitable to us than the programming that we
would otherwise carry and our results would suffer accordingly.

Equity Put Rights

CC VIII.

As part of the acquisition of the cable systems owned by Bresnan Communications Company
Limited Partnership in February 2000, CC VIII, Charter’s indirect limited liability company
subsidiary, issued, after adjustments, 24,273,943 Class A preferred membership units (collectively,
the “CC VIII interest”) with a value and an initial capital account of approximately $630 million
to certain sellers affiliated with AT&T Broadband, subsequently owned by Comcast Corporation (the
“Comcast sellers”). While held by the Comcast sellers, the CC VIII interest was entitled to a 2%
priority return on its initial capital account and such priority return was entitled to
preferential distributions from available cash and upon liquidation of CC VIII. While held by the
Comcast sellers, the CC VIII interest generally did not share in the profits and losses of CC VIII.
Mr. Allen granted the Comcast sellers the right to sell to him the CC VIII interest for
approximately $630 million plus 4.5% interest



annually from February 2000 (the “Comcast put right”). In April 2002, the Comcast sellers exercised the Comcast
put right in full, and this transaction was consummated on June 6, 2003. Accordingly, Mr. Allen
has become the holder of the CC VIII interest, indirectly through an affiliate. Consequently,
subject to the matters referenced in the next paragraph, Mr. Allen generally thereafter will be
allocated his pro rata share (based on number of membership interests outstanding) of profits or
losses of CC VIII. In the event of a liquidation of CC VIII, Mr. Allen would be entitled to a
priority distribution with respect to the 2% priority return (which will continue to accrete). Any
remaining distributions in liquidation would be distributed to CC V Holdings, LLC and Mr. Allen in
proportion to CC V Holdings, LLC’s capital account and Mr. Allen’s capital account (which will
equal the initial capital account of the Comcast sellers of approximately $630 million, increased
or decreased by Mr. Allen’s pro rata share of CC VIII’s profits or losses (as computed for capital
account purposes) after June 6, 2003). The limited liability company agreement of CC VIII does not
provide for a mandatory redemption of the CC VIII interest.

An issue has arisen as to whether the documentation for the Bresnan transaction was correct and
complete with regard to the ultimate ownership of the CC VIII interest following consummation of
the Comcast put right. Specifically, under the terms of the Bresnan transaction documents that
were entered into in June 1999, the Comcast sellers originally would have received, after
adjustments, 24,273,943 Charter Holdco membership units, but due to an FCC regulatory issue raised
by the Comcast sellers shortly before closing, the Bresnan transaction was modified to provide that
the Comcast sellers instead would receive the preferred equity interests in CC VIII represented by
the CC VIII interest. As part of the last-minute changes to the Bresnan transaction documents, a
draft amended version of the Charter Holdco limited liability company agreement was prepared, and
contract provisions were drafted for that agreement that would have required an automatic exchange
of the CC VIII interest for 24,273,943 Charter Holdco membership units if the Comcast sellers
exercised the Comcast put right and sold the CC VIII interest to Mr. Allen or his affiliates.
However, the provisions that would have required this automatic exchange did not appear in the
final version of the Charter Holdco limited liability company agreement that was delivered and
executed at the closing of the Bresnan transaction. The law firm that prepared the documents for
the Bresnan transaction brought this matter to the attention of Charter and representatives of Mr.
Allen in 2002.

Thereafter, the board of directors of Charter formed a Special Committee (currently comprised of
Messrs. Merritt, Tory and Wangberg) to investigate the matter and take any other appropriate action
on behalf of Charter with respect to this matter. After conducting an investigation of the
relevant facts and circumstances, the Special Committee determined that a “scrivener’s error” had
occurred in February 2000 in connection with the preparation of the last-minute revisions to the
Bresnan transaction documents and that, as a result, Charter should seek the reformation of the
Charter Holdco limited liability company agreement, or alternative relief, in order to restore and
ensure the obligation that the CC VIII interest be automatically exchanged for Charter Holdco
units. The Special Committee further determined that, as part of such contract reformation or
alternative relief, Mr. Allen should be required to contribute the CC VIII interest to Charter
Holdco in exchange for 24,273,943 Charter Holdco membership units. The Special Committee also
recommended to the board of directors of Charter that, to the extent the contract reformation is
achieved, the board of directors should consider whether the CC VIII interest should ultimately be
held by Charter Holdco or Charter Holdings or another entity owned directly or indirectly by them.

Mr. Allen disagrees with the Special Committee’s determinations described above and has so notified
the Special Committee. Mr. Allen contends that the transaction is accurately reflected in the
transaction documentation and contemporaneous and subsequent company public disclosures.

The parties engaged in a process of non-binding mediation to seek to resolve this matter, without
success. The Special Committee is evaluating what further actions or processes it may undertake to
resolve this dispute. To accommodate further deliberation, each party has agreed to refrain from
initiating legal proceedings over this matter until it has given at least ten days’ prior notice to
the other. In addition, the Special Committee and Mr. Allen have determined to utilize the
Delaware Court of Chancery’s program for mediation of complex business disputes in an effort to
resolve the CC VIII interest dispute. If the Special Committee and Mr. Allen are unable to reach a
resolution through that mediation process or to agree on an alternative dispute resolution process,
the Special Committee intends to seek resolution of this dispute through judicial proceedings in an
action that would be commenced, after appropriate notice, in the Delaware Court of Chancery against
Mr. Allen and his affiliates seeking contract reformation, declaratory relief as to the respective
rights of the parties regarding this dispute and alternative forms of legal and equitable relief.
The ultimate resolution and financial impact of the dispute are not determinable at this time.

Mirror Securities



Charter is a holding company and its principal assets are its equity interest in Charter Holdco and
certain mirror notes payable by Charter Holdco to Charter and mirror preferred units held by
Charter, which have the same principal amount and terms as those of Charter’s convertible senior
notes and Charter’s outstanding preferred stock. In 2004, Charter Holdco paid to Charter $49
million related to interest on the mirror notes, and Charter Holdco paid an additional $4 million
related to dividends on the mirror preferred membership units. Further, during 2004 Charter Holdco
issued 7,252,818 common membership units to Charter in cancellation of $30 million principal amount
of mirror notes so as to mirror the issuance by Charter of Class A common stock in exchange for a
like principal amount of its outstanding convertible notes. In addition, in connection with our
November 2004 sale of the $862.5 million principal amount of 5.875% convertible senior notes due
2009, Charter Holdco issued to us mirror notes in identical principal amount in exchange for the
proceeds from our offering. Charter Holdco then purchased and pledged certain U.S. government
securities to us as security for the mirror notes (which were in turn repledged by us to the
trustee for the benefit of holders of our 5.875% convertible senior notes and which we expect to
use to fund the first six interest payments on the notes), and agreed to lend common units to us,
the terms of which will, to the extent practicable, mirror the terms of the shares. Charter Holdco
also redeemed the remaining $588 million principal amount of the mirror notes in respect of our
5.75% convertible senior notes due 2005 concurrently with our December 23, 2004 redemption of our
5.75% convertible senior notes. In addition, in December 2004, Charter Holdco entered into a unit lending agreement with
Charter in which it agreed to lend common units to Charter that would mirror the anticipated loan
of Class A common shares by Charter to Citigroup Global Markets pursuant to a share lending
agreement. The members of Charter Holdco (including the entities controlled by Mr. Allen) also at
that time entered into a letter agreement providing, among other things, that for purposes of the
allocation provisions of the Limited Liability Company Agreement of Charter Holdco, the mirror
units be treated as disregarded and not outstanding until such time (and except to the extent)
that, under Charter’s share lending agreement, Charter treats the loaned shares in a manner that
assumes they will neither be returned by Charter by the borrower nor
otherwise be acquired by
Charter in lieu of such a return.

Allocation of Business Opportunities with Mr. Allen

As described under “ —  Third Party Business Relationships in which Mr. Allen has or had an
Interest” in this section, Mr. Allen and a number of his affiliates have interests in various
entities that provide services or programming to our subsidiaries. Given the diverse nature of Mr.
Allen’s investment activities and interests, and to avoid the possibility of future disputes as to
potential business, Charter and Charter Holdco, under the terms of their respective organizational
documents, may not, and may not allow their subsidiaries, to engage in any business transaction
outside the cable transmission business except for the Digeo, Inc. joint venture; a joint venture
to develop a digital video recorder set-top terminal; an existing investment in Cable Sports
Southeast, LLC, a provider of regional sports programming; as an owner of the business of
Interactive Broadcaster Services Corporation or, Chat TV, an investment in @Security Broadband
Corp., a company developing broadband security applications; and incidental businesses engaged in
as of the closing of Charter’s initial public offering in November 1999. This restriction will
remain in effect until all of the shares of Charter’s high-vote Class B common stock have been
converted into shares of Charter Class A common stock due to Mr. Allen’s equity ownership falling
below specified thresholds.

Should Charter or Charter Holdco or any of their subsidiaries wish to pursue, or allow their
subsidiaries to pursue, a business transaction outside of this scope, it must first offer Mr. Allen
the opportunity to pursue the particular business transaction. If he decides not to pursue the
business transaction and consents to Charter or its subsidiaries engaging in the business
transaction, they will be able to do so. In any such case, the restated certificate of
incorporation of Charter and the limited liability company agreement of Charter Holdco would need
to be amended accordingly to modify the current restrictions on the ability of such entities to
engage in any business other than the cable transmission business. The cable transmission business
means the business of transmitting video, audio, including telephony, and data over cable systems
owned, operated or managed by Charter, Charter Holdco or any of their subsidiaries from time to
time.

Under Delaware corporate law, each director of Charter, including Mr. Allen, is generally required
to present to Charter, any opportunity he or she may have to acquire any cable transmission
business or any company whose principal business is the ownership, operation or management of cable
transmission businesses, so that we may determine whether we wish to pursue such opportunities.
However, Mr. Allen and the other directors generally will not have an obligation to present other
types of business opportunities to Charter and they may exploit such opportunities for their own
account.

Also, conflicts could arise with respect to the allocation of corporate opportunities between us
and Mr. Allen and his affiliates in connection with his investments in businesses in which we are
permitted to engage under Charter’s restated certificate of incorporation. Certain of the
indentures of Charter and its subsidiaries require the applicable issuer of notes to obtain, under
certain circumstances, approval of the board of directors of Charter and, where a transaction or
series of related transactions is valued at or in excess of $50 million, a fairness opinion with
respect to transactions in which Mr. Allen has an interest.
Related party transactions are approved by our Audit Committee in compliance with the listing
requirements applicable to NASDAQ national market listed companies. We have not instituted any other formal plan or arrangement
to address potential conflicts of interest.



The restrictive provisions of the organizational documents described above may limit our ability to
take advantage of attractive business opportunities. Consequently, our ability to offer new
products and services outside of the cable transmission business and enter into new businesses
could be adversely affected, resulting in an adverse effect on our growth, financial condition and
results of operations.

Third Party Business Relationships in which Mr. Allen has or had an Interest

As previously noted, Mr. Allen has and has had extensive investments in the areas of media and
technology. We have a number of commercial relationships with third parties in which Mr. Allen has
an interest. Mr. Allen or his affiliates own equity interests or warrants to purchase equity
interests in various entities with which we do business or which provide us with products, services
or programming. Mr. Allen owns 100% of the equity of Vulcan Ventures Incorporated and Vulcan Inc.
and is the president of Vulcan Ventures. Ms. Jo Allen Patton is a director and the President and
Chief Executive Officer of Vulcan Inc. and is a director and Vice President of Vulcan Ventures.
Mr. Lance Conn is Executive Vice President of Vulcan Inc. and Vulcan Ventures. The various cable,
media, Internet and telephony companies in which Mr. Allen has invested may mutually benefit one
another. We can give no assurance, nor should you expect, that any of these business relationships
will be successful, that we will realize any benefits from these relationships or that we will
enter into any business relationships in the future with Mr. Allen’s affiliated companies.

Mr. Allen and his affiliates have made, and in the future likely will make, numerous investments
outside of us and our business. We cannot assure you that, in the event that we or any of our
subsidiaries enter into transactions in the future with any affiliate of Mr. Allen, such
transactions will be on terms as favorable to us as terms we might have obtained from an unrelated
third party.

TechTV, Inc.

TechTV, Inc. (“TechTV”) operated a cable television network that offered programming mostly related
to technology. Pursuant to an affiliation agreement that originated in 1998 and that terminates in
2008, TechTV has provided us with programming for distribution via our cable systems. The
affiliation agreement provides, among other things, that TechTV must offer Charter certain terms
and conditions that are no less favorable in the affiliation agreement than are given to any other
distributor that serves the same number of or fewer TechTV viewing customers. Additionally,
pursuant to the affiliation agreement, we were entitled to incentive payments for channel launches
through December 31, 2003.

In March 2004, Charter Holdco entered into agreements with Vulcan Programming and TechTV, which
provide for (i) Charter Holdco and TechTV to amend the affiliation agreement which, among other
things, revises the description of the TechTV network content, provides for Charter Holdco to waive
certain claims against TechTV relating to alleged breaches of the affiliation agreement and
provides for TechTV to make payment of outstanding launch receivables due to Charter Holdco under
the affiliation agreement, (ii) Vulcan Programming to pay approximately $10 million and purchase
over a 24-month period, at fair market rates, $2 million of advertising time across various cable
networks on Charter cable systems in consideration of the agreements, obligations, releases and
waivers under the agreements and in settlement of the aforementioned claims and (iii) TechTV to be
a provider of content relating to technology and video gaming for Charter’s interactive television
platforms through December 31, 2006 (exclusive for the first year). For the year ended December
31, 2004, we recognized approximately $5 million of the Vulcan Programming payment as an offset to
programming expense and paid approximately $2 million to Tech TV under the affiliation agreement.

We believe that Vulcan Programming, which is 100% owned by Mr. Allen, owned an approximate 98%
equity interest in TechTV at the time Vulcan Programming sold TechTV to an unrelated third party in
May 2004. Until September 2003, Mr. Savoy, a former Charter director, was the president and
director of Vulcan Programming and was a director of TechTV. Mr. Wangberg, one of Charter’s
directors, was the chairman, chief executive officer and a director of TechTV. Mr. Wangberg
resigned as the chief executive officer of TechTV in July 2002. He remained a director of TechTV
along with Mr. Allen until Vulcan Programming sold TechTV.



Oxygen Media Corporation

Oxygen Media LLC (“Oxygen”) provides programming content aimed at the female audience for
distribution over cable systems and satellite. On July 22, 2002, Charter Holdco entered into a
carriage agreement with Oxygen, whereby we agreed to carry programming content from Oxygen. Under
the carriage agreement, we currently make Oxygen programming available to approximately 5 million
of our video customers. The term of the carriage agreement was retroactive to February 1, 2000,
the date of launch of Oxygen programming by us, and was to run for a period of five years from that
date. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we paid Oxygen approximately $13 million for
programming content. In addition, Oxygen pays us marketing support fees for customers launched
after the first year of the term of the carriage agreement up to a total of $4 million. We
recorded approximately $1 million related to these launch incentives as a reduction of programming
expense for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Concurrently with the execution of the carriage agreement, Charter Holdco entered into an equity
issuance agreement pursuant to which Oxygen’s parent company, Oxygen Media Corporation (“Oxygen
Media”), granted a subsidiary of Charter Holdco a warrant to purchase 2.4 million shares of Oxygen
Media common stock for an exercise price of $22.00 per share. In February 2005, this warrant
expired unexercised. Charter Holdco was also to receive unregistered shares of Oxygen Media common
stock with a guaranteed fair market value on the date of issuance of $34 million, on or prior to
February 2, 2005, with the exact date to be determined by Oxygen Media, but this commitment was
later revised as discussed below.

We recognize the guaranteed value of the investment over the life of the carriage agreement as a
reduction of programming expense. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded approximately
$13 million as a reduction of programming expense. The carrying value of our investment in Oxygen
was approximately $32 million as of December 31, 2004.

In August 2004, Charter Holdco and Oxygen entered into agreements that amended and renewed the
carriage agreement. The amendment to the carriage agreement (a) revises the number of our
customers to which Oxygen programming must be carried and for which we must pay, (b) releases
Charter Holdco from any claims related to the failure to achieve distribution benchmarks under the
carriage agreement, (c) requires Oxygen to make payment on outstanding receivables for marketing
support fees due to us under the carriage agreement; and (d) requires that Oxygen provide its
programming content to us on economic terms no less favorable than Oxygen provides to any other
cable or satellite operator having fewer subscribers than us. The renewal of the carriage
agreement (a) extends the period that we will carry Oxygen programming to our customers through
January 31, 2008, and (b) requires license fees to be paid based on customers receiving Oxygen
programming, rather than for specific customer benchmarks.

In August 2004, Charter Holdco and Oxygen also amended the equity issuance agreement to provide for
the issuance of 1 million shares of Oxygen Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $33.10
per share plus accrued dividends to Charter Holdco on February 1, 2005 in place of the $34 million
of unregistered shares of Oxygen Media common stock. Oxygen Media
will deliver these shares in March 2005. The preferred stock is convertible into common stock after December 31, 2007 at a conversion
ratio, the numerator of which is the liquidation preference and the denominator which is the fair
market value per share of Oxygen Media common stock on the conversion date.

As of December 31, 2004,
through Vulcan Programming, Mr. Allen owned an approximate 31% interest in
Oxygen assuming no exercises of outstanding warrants or conversion or exchange of convertible or
exchangeable securities. Ms. Jo Allen Patton is a director and the President of Vulcan
Programming. Mr. Lance Conn is a Vice President of Vulcan Programming. Marc Nathanson has an
indirect beneficial interest of less than 1% in Oxygen.

Portland Trail Blazers

On October 7, 1996, the former owner of our Falcon cable systems entered into a letter agreement
and a cable television agreement with Trail Blazers Inc. for the cable broadcast in the
metropolitan area surrounding Portland, Oregon of pre-season, regular season and playoff basketball
games of the Portland Trail Blazers, a National Basketball Association basketball team. Mr. Allen
is the 100% owner of the Portland Trail Blazers and Trail Blazers Inc. After the acquisition of
the Falcon cable systems in November 1999, we continued to operate under the terms of these
agreements until their termination on September 30, 2001. Under the letter agreement, Trail
Blazers Inc. was paid a fixed fee for each customer in areas directly served by the Falcon cable
systems. Under the cable television agreement, we shared subscription revenues with Trail Blazers
Inc. We paid approximately $96,100 for



the year ended December 31, 2004 in connection with the cable broadcast of Portland Trail Blazers
basketball games under the October 1996 cable television agreement and subsequent local cable
distribution agreements.

Digeo, Inc.

In March 2001, Charter Ventures and Vulcan Ventures Incorporated formed DBroadband Holdings, LLC
for the sole purpose of purchasing equity interests in Digeo. In connection with the execution of
the broadband carriage agreement, DBroadband Holdings, LLC purchased an equity interest in Digeo
funded by contributions from Vulcan Ventures Incorporated. The equity interest is subject to a
priority return of capital to Vulcan Ventures up to the amount contributed by Vulcan Ventures on
Charter Ventures’ behalf. After Vulcan Ventures recovers its amount contributed and any cumulative
loss allocations, Charter Ventures has a 100% profit interest in DBroadband Holdings, LLC. Charter
Ventures is not required to make any capital contributions, including capital calls, and may
require Vulcan Ventures, through January 24, 2004, to make certain additional contributions through
DBroadband Holdings, LLC to acquire additional equity in Digeo as necessary to maintain Charter
Ventures’ pro rata interest in Digeo in the event of certain future Digeo equity financings by the
founders of Digeo. These additional equity interests are also subject to a priority return of
capital to Vulcan Ventures up to amounts contributed by Vulcan Ventures on Charter Ventures’
behalf. DBroadband Holdings, LLC is therefore not included in our consolidated financial
statements. Pursuant to an amended version of this arrangement, in 2003, Vulcan Ventures
contributed a total of $29 million to Digeo, $7 million of which was contributed on Charter
Ventures’ behalf, subject to Vulcan Ventures’ aforementioned priority return. Since the formation
of DBroadband Holdings, LLC, Vulcan Ventures has contributed approximately $56 million on Charter
Ventures’ behalf.

On March 2, 2001, a subsidiary of Charter, Charter Communications Ventures, LLC (“Charter
Ventures”) entered into a broadband carriage agreement with Digeo Interactive, LLC (“Digeo
Interactive”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Digeo, Inc. (“Digeo”), an entity controlled by Paul
Allen. The carriage agreement provided that Digeo Interactive would provide to Charter a “portal”
product, which would function as the television-based Internet portal (the initial point of entry
to the Internet) for Charter’s customers who received Internet access from Charter. The agreement
term was for 25 years and Charter agreed to use the Digeo portal exclusively for six years. Before
the portal product was delivered to Charter, Digeo terminated development of the portal product.

On September 27, 2001, Charter and Digeo Interactive amended the broadband carriage agreement.
According to the amendment, Digeo Interactive would provide to Charter the content for enhanced
“Wink” interactive television services, known as Charter Interactive Channels (“i-channels”). In
order to provide the i-channels, Digeo Interactive sublicensed certain Wink technologies to
Charter. Charter is entitled to share in the revenues generated by the i-channels. Currently, our
digital video customers who receive i-channels receive the service at no additional charge.

On September 28, 2002, Charter entered into a second amendment to its broadband carriage agreement
with Digeo Interactive. This amendment supersedes the amendment of September 27, 2001. It
provides for the development by Digeo Interactive of future features to be included in the Basic
i-TV service provided by Digeo and for Digeo’s development of an interactive “toolkit” to enable
Charter to develop interactive local content. Furthermore, Charter may request that Digeo
Interactive manage local content for a fee. The amendment provides for Charter to pay for
development of the Basic i-TV service as well as license fees for customers who receive the
service, and for Charter and Digeo to split certain revenues earned from the service. In 2004, we
paid Digeo Interactive approximately $3 million for customized development of the i-channels and
the local content tool kit. We received no revenues under the broadband carriage agreement in
2003. This amendment expired pursuant to its terms on December 31, 2003. Digeo Interactive is
continuing to provide the Basic i-TV service on a month-to-month basis.

On June 30, 2003, Charter Holdco entered into an agreement with Motorola, Inc. for the purchase of
100,000 digital video recorder (“DVR”) units. The software for these DVR units is being supplied
by Digeo Interactive, LLC under a license agreement entered into in April 2004. Under the license
agreement Digeo Interactive granted to Charter Holdco the right to use Digeo’s proprietary software
for the number of DVR units that Charter deploys from a maximum of 10 headends through year-end
2004. This maximum number of headends was increased from 10 to 15 pursuant to a letter agreement
executed on June 11, 2004 and the date for entering into license agreements for units deployed was
extended to June 30, 2005. The number of headends was increased from 15 to 20 pursuant to a letter
agreement dated August 4, 2004, from 20 to 30 pursuant to a letter agreement dated September 28,
2004 and from 30 to 50 headends by a letter agreement in February 2005. The license granted for
each unit deployed under the agreement is valid for five years. In addition, Charter will pay
certain other fees including a per-headend license fee and maintenance fees. Maximum license and
maintenance fees during the term of the agreement are expected to be approximately $7 million.
The agreement provides that Charter is entitled to receive contract terms, considered



on the whole, and license fees, considered apart from other contract terms, no less favorable than
those accorded to any other Digeo customer. Charter paid approximately $474,400 in license and
maintenance fees in 2004.

In April 2004, we launched DVR service (using units containing the Digeo software) in our
Rochester, Minnesota market using a broadband media center that is an integrated set-top terminal
with a cable converter, DVR hard drive and connectivity to other consumer electronics devices (such
as stereos, MP3 players, and digital cameras).

In May 2004, Charter Holdco entered into a binding term sheet with Digeo Interactive for the
development, testing and purchase of 70,000 Digeo PowerKey DVR units. The term sheet provided that
the parties would proceed in good faith to negotiate, prior to year-end 2004, definitive agreements
for the development, testing and purchase of the DVR units and that the parties would enter into a
license agreement for Digeo’s proprietary software on terms substantially similar to the terms of
the license agreement described above. In November 2004, Charter Holdco and Digeo Interactive
executed the license agreement and in December 2004, the parties executed the purchase agreement,
each on terms substantially similar to the binding term sheet. Product development and testing are
continuing. Total purchase price and license and maintenance fees during the term of the
definitive agreements are expected to be approximately $41 million. The definitive agreements are
terminable at no penalty to Charter in certain circumstances.

We believe that Vulcan
Ventures, an entity controlled by Mr. Allen, owns an approximate
51% equity
interest in Digeo, Inc., on a fully-converted basis. Mr. Allen is a director of Digeo, and Mr.
Vogel was a director of Digeo in 2004. During 2004, Mr. Vogel held options to purchase 10,000
shares of Digeo common stock.

Other Miscellaneous Relationships

Viacom Networks

Pursuant to certain affiliation agreements with networks of Viacom, Inc. (“Viacom”), including MTV,
MTV2, Nickelodeon, VH1, TVLand, CMT, Spike TV, Comedy Central, Viacom Digital Suite, CBS-owned and
operated broadcast stations, Showtime, The Movie Channel, and Flix, Viacom provides Charter with
programming for distribution via our cable systems. The affiliation agreements provide for, among
other things, rates and terms of carriage, advertising on the Viacom networks, which Charter can
sell to local advertisers and marketing support. For the year ended December 31, 2004, Charter
paid Viacom approximately $194 million for programming. Charter recorded approximately $8 million
as receivables from Viacom networks related to launch incentives for certain channels and marketing
support, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2004. From April 1994 to July 2004, Mr.
Dolgen served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Viacom Entertainment Group.

ADC Telecommunications Inc.

Charter and Charter Holdco purchase certain equipment for use in our business from ADC
Telecommunications, which provides broadband access and network equipment. Mr. Wangberg serves as
a director for ADC Telecommunications. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we paid $344,800 to
ADC Telecommunications under this arrangement.

HDNet and HDNet Movies Network

On January 10, 2003, we signed an agreement to carry two around-the-clock, high-definition
networks, HDNet and HDNet Movies. HDNet Movies delivers a commercial-free schedule of full-length
feature films converted from 35mm to high-definition, including titles from an extensive library of
Warner Bros. films. HDNet Movies will feature a mix of theatrical releases, made-for-TV movies,
independent films and shorts. The HDNet channel features a variety of HDTV programming, including
live sports, sitcoms, dramas, action series, documentaries, travel programs, music concerts and
shows, special events, and news features including the popular HDNet World Report. HDNet also
offers a selection of classic and recent television series. We paid HDNet and HDNet Movies
approximately $609,100 in 2004. We believe that entities controlled by Mr. Cuban owned
approximately 81% of HDNet as of December 31, 2004. As of December 31, 2004, we believe that Mark
Cuban, co-founder and president of HDNet, owned approximately 19,000,000 shares, or 6.2% of the
total common equity in Charter based on a Schedule 13G filed with the SEC on May 21, 2003.



Affiliate Lease Agreement

David L. McCall, who served as Senior Vice President — Operations — Eastern Division during 2002
and January 2003, is a partner in a partnership that leases office space to us under a lease
agreement, which expires December 31, 2010. The partnership received approximately $43,400
pursuant to such lease and related agreements for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Carriage Fees

We have carried The Outdoor Channel on a month-to-month basis since the expiration of an
affiliation agreement in July 2002. We paid approximately $1 million to The Outdoor Channel during
2004. In December 2003, Mr. Merritt became director of Outdoor Channel Holdings, Inc., an
affiliate of The Outdoor Channel, Inc.

Payment for Relative’s Services

Since June 2003, Mr. Vogel’s brother-in-law has been an employee of Charter Holdco and has received
a salary commensurate with his position in the engineering department.

Indemnification Advances

Pursuant to Charter’s bylaws (and the employment agreements of certain of our current and former
officers), Charter is obligated (subject to certain limitations) to indemnify and hold harmless, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, any officer, director or employee against all expense,
liability and loss (including, among other things, attorneys’ fees) reasonably incurred or suffered
by such officer, director or employee as a result of the fact that he or she is a party or is
threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding by reason
of the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer or employee of Charter. In addition,
Charter is obligated to pay, as an advancement of its indemnification obligation, the expenses
(including attorneys’ fees) incurred by any officer, director or employee in defending any such
action, suit or proceeding in advance of its final disposition, subject to an obligation to repay
those amounts under certain circumstances. Pursuant to these indemnification arrangements and as
an advancement of costs, Charter has reimbursed certain of its current and former directors and
executive officers a total of approximately $3 million in respect of invoices received in 2004, in
connection with their defense of certain legal actions described herein. See “Item 3. Legal
Proceedings.” Those current and former directors and officers include: Paul G. Allen, David C.
Andersen, David G. Barford, Mary Pat Blake, J. Christian Fenger, Kent D. Kalkwarf, Ralph G. Kelly,
Jerald L. Kent, Paul E. Martin, David L. McCall, Ronald L. Nelson, Nancy B. Peretsman, John C.
Pietri, William D. Savoy, Steven A. Schumm, Curtis S. Shaw, William J. Shreffer, Stephen E. Silva,
James Trey Smith and Carl E. Vogel. These amounts were submitted to Charter’s director and officer
insurance carrier and have been reimbursed consistent with the terms of the Securities Class Action
and Derivative Action Settlements described in “Item 3. Legal Proceedings.” On or about February
22, 2005, Charter filed lawsuits against the four former officers who were indicted and pled guilty
as part of the government investigation conducted by the United States Attorney’s Office. These
suits seek to recover fees and related expenses that Charter advanced these former officers under
the indemnification provisions described above.



PART IV

Item 14.

Principal Accounting Fees and Services.

Audit Fees

During the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, we incurred fees and related expenses for
professional services rendered by KPMG LLP (“KPMG”) for the audits of our and our subsidiaries’
financial statements (including five subsidiaries that are also public registrants), for the review
of our and our subsidiaries’ interim financial statements and five offering memorandums and
registration statement filings in 2004 and two offering memorandums and registration statement
filings in 2003 totaling approximately $6.2 million and $3.2 million, respectively. Included in
2004 are fees and related expenses of $1.9 million for the audit of internal control over financial
reporting required under Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404.

Audit-Related Fees

We incurred fees to KPMG of approximately $0.1 million and $0.4 million during the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The services in 2004 primarily related to the audit of
our 401(k) plan and advisory services associated with our Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404
implementation. In 2003, these services primarily related to the audit of cable systems sold to
Atlantic Broadband Finance, LLC and advisory services associated with our Sarbanes-Oxley Section
404 implementation.

All Other Fees

None.

The Audit Committee appoints,
retains, compensates and oversees the registered public accountants
(subject, if applicable, to board of director and/or shareholder
ratification), and approves in advance all fees and terms for the
audit engagement and non-audit engagements where non-audit services
are not prohibited by Section 10A of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended with registered public accountants. Pre-approvals of
non-audit services are sometimes delegated to a single member of the
Audit Committee. However, any pre-approvals made by the Audit
Committee’s designee are presented at the Audit Committee’s
next regularly scheduled meeting. The Audit Committee has an
obligation to consult with management on these matters. The Audit
Committee approved 100% of the KPMG fees for the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003. Each year, including 2004, with
respect to the proposed audit engagement, the Audit Committee reviews
the proposed risk assessment process in establishing the scope of
examination and the reports to be rendered.

In its capacity as a
committee of the Board, the Audit Committee oversees the work of the
registered public accounting firm (including resolution of
disagreements between management and the public accounting firm
regarding financial reporting) for the purpose of preparing or
issuing an audit report or performing other audit, review or attest
services. The registered public accounting firm reports directly to the Audit Committee. In performing its functions, the

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors

Charter Communications, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Charter Communications, Inc. and
subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, changes in shareholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2004. These consolidated financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Charter Communications, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our
report dated March 1, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment of, and the
effective operation of, internal control over financial reporting.

As discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2002, the
Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets

.

As discussed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, effective September 30, 2004, the
Company adopted EITF Topic D-108,

Use of the Residual Method to Value Acquired Assets Other than
Goodwill

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors

Charter Communications, Inc.:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Charter Communications, Inc. and subsidiaries (the
Company) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004,
based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible
for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on
criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by COSO. Also, in our
opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by COSO.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2004 and
2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes
in shareholders’ equity (deficit), and
cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2004, and our report
dated March 1, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2004, 2003 AND 2002

(dollars in millions, except where indicated)

1. Organization and Basis of Presentation

Charter Communications, Inc. (“Charter”) is a holding company whose principal assets at December
31, 2004 are the 47% controlling common equity interest in Charter Communications Holding Company,
LLC (“Charter Holdco”) and “mirror” notes which are payable by Charter Holdco to Charter and have
the same principal amount and terms as those of Charter’s convertible senior notes. Charter Holdco
is the sole owner of Charter Communications Holdings, LLC (“Charter Holdings”). The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of Charter, Charter Holdco, Charter Holdings and all of
their wholly owned subsidiaries where the underlying operations reside, collectively referred to
herein as the “Company.” Charter consolidates Charter Holdco on the basis of voting control.
Charter Holdco’s limited liability company agreement provides that so long as Charter’s Class B
common stock retains its special voting rights, Charter will maintain a 100% voting interest in
Charter Holdco. Voting control gives Charter full authority and control over the operations of
Charter Holdco. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions among consolidated entities
have been eliminated. The Company is a broadband communications company operating in the United
States. The Company offers its customers traditional cable video programming (analog and digital
video) as well as high-speed data services and, in some areas, advanced broadband services such as
high definition television, video on demand and telephony. The Company sells its cable video
programming, high-speed data and advanced broadband services on a subscription basis. The Company
also sells local advertising on satellite-delivered networks.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Areas involving significant judgments and estimates include capitalization of labor and
overhead costs; depreciation and amortization costs; impairments of property, plant and equipment,
franchises and goodwill; income taxes; and contingencies. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Reclassifications.

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the 2004
presentation.

2. Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company incurred net loss applicable to common stock of $4.3 billion, $242 million and $2.5
billion in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company’s net cash flows from operating
activities were $472 million, $765 million and $748 million for the years ending December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively.

The Company has a significant level of debt. The Company’s long-term financing as of December 31,
2004 consists of $5.5 billion of credit facility debt, $13.3 billion principal amount of high-yield
notes and $1.0 billion principal amount of convertible senior notes. In 2005, $30 million of the
Company’s debt will mature and in 2006, an additional $186 million of the Company’s debt will
mature. In 2007 and beyond, significant additional amounts will become due under the Company’s
remaining long-term debt obligations.

The Company has historically required significant cash to fund capital expenditures and debt
service costs. Historically, the Company has funded these requirements through cash flows from
operating activities, borrowings under its credit facilities, sales of assets,
issuances of debt and equity securities and cash on hand. However, the mix of funding sources
changes from period to period. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company, generated $472
million of net cash flows from operating activities, after paying cash interest of $1.3 billion.
In addition, the Company generated approximately $744 million from the sale of assets,
substantially all of which was used to fund operations, including capital expenditures. Finally,
the Company had net cash flows from financing activities of $294 million, which included, among
other things, the proceeds from the issuance in December of $550 million of CCO Holdings, LLC (“CCO
Holdings”) Notes. This debt issuance was the primary reason cash on hand increased by $523 million
to $650 million at December 31, 2004. Approximately $622 million was used to repay outstanding
borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facility, through a series of transactions executed
in February 2005.

F-8


CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2004, 2003 AND 2002

(dollars in millions, except where indicated)

The Company expects that cash on hand, cash flows from operating activities and the amounts
available under its credit facilities will be adequate to meet its cash needs in 2005. Cash flows
from operating activities and amounts available under the Company’s credit facilities may not be
sufficient to fund the Company’s operations and satisfy its principal repayment obligations that
come due in 2006 and, the Company believes, will not be sufficient to fund its operations and
satisfy such repayment obligations thereafter.

It is likely that the Company
will require additional funding to repay debt maturing after 2006. The Company is working with its financial advisors to address such funding
requirements. However, there can be no assurance that such funding will be available to the
Company. Although Mr. Allen and his affiliates have purchased equity from the Company in the past,
Mr. Allen and his affiliates are not obligated to purchase equity from, contribute to or loan funds
to the Company in the future.

Credit Facilities and Covenants

The Company’s ability to operate depends upon, among other things, its continued access to capital,
including credit under the Charter Communications Operating, LLC (“Charter Operating”) credit
facilities. These credit facilities, along with the Company’s indentures, are subject to certain
restrictive covenants, some of which require the Company to maintain specified financial ratios and
meet financial tests and to provide audited financial statements with an unqualified opinion from
the Company’s independent auditors. As of December 31, 2004, the Company was in compliance with
the covenants under the Company’s indentures and under its credit facilities and the Company
expects to remain in compliance with those covenants for the next twelve months. As of December
31, 2004, the Company had borrowing availability under the credit facilities of $804 million, none
of which was restricted due to covenants. Continued access to the Company’s credit facilities is
subject to the Company remaining in compliance with the applicable covenants of these credit
facilities, including covenants tied to the Company’s operating performance. If the Company’s
operating performance results in non-compliance with these covenants, or if any of certain other
events of non-compliance under these credit facilities or indentures governing the Company’s debt
occurs, funding under the credit facilities may not be available and defaults on some or
potentially all of the Company’s debt obligations could occur. An event of default under the
covenants governing any of the Company’s debt instruments could result in the acceleration of its
payment obligations under that debt and, under certain circumstances, in cross-defaults under its
other debt obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated
financial condition or results of operations.

The Charter Operating credit facilities require the Company to redeem the CC V Holdings notes
within 45 days after the first date that the Charter Holdings leverage ratio is less than 8.75 to
1.0. In satisfaction of this requirement, CC V Holdings, LLC has called for redemption all of its
outstanding notes, at 103.958% of principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
redemption, which is expected to be March 14, 2005. The total cost of the redemption including
accrued and unpaid interest is expected to be $122 million. The Company intends to fund the
redemption with borrowings under its credit facilities.

Specific Limitations

Charter’s ability to make interest payments on its convertible senior notes, and, in 2006 and 2009,
to repay the outstanding principal of its convertible senior notes, will depend on its ability to
raise additional capital and/or on receipt of payments or distributions from Charter Holdco or its
subsidiaries, including CCH II, LLC (“CCH II”), CCO Holdings, LLC (“CCO Holdings”) and Charter
Operating. The indentures governing the CCH II notes, CCO Holdings notes, and Charter Operating
notes, however, restrict these entities and their subsidiaries from making distributions to their
parent companies (including Charter and Charter Holdco) for payment of interest and principal on
Charter’s convertible senior notes, in each case unless there is no default under the applicable
indenture and a specified leverage ratio test is met at the time of such event. CCH II, CCO Holdings and Charter Operating meet the applicable
leverage ratio test under each of their respective indentures, and as a result are not prohibited
from making any such distributions to their respective direct parent.

F-9


CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2004, 2003 AND 2002

(dollars in millions, except where indicated)

The indentures governing the Charter Holdings notes permit Charter Holdings to make distributions
to Charter Holdco for payment of interest or principal on the convertible senior notes, only if,
after giving effect to the distribution, Charter Holdings can incur additional debt under the
leverage ratio of 8.75 to 1.0, there is no default under Charter Holdings’ indentures and other
specified tests are met. For the quarter ended December 31, 2004, there was no default under
Charter Holdings’ indentures and other specified tests were met. In addition, Charter Holdings met
the leverage ratio of 8.75 to 1.0 based on December 31, 2004 financial results. As a result,
distributions from Charter Holdings to Charter or Charter Holdco are not currently restricted.
Such distributions will again be restricted, however, if Charter Holdings fails to meet its
leverage ratio test. In the past, Charter Holdings has from time to time failed to meet this
leverage ratio test and there can be no assurance that Charter Holdings will satisfy this test in
the future.

During periods when such distributions are restricted, the indentures governing the Charter
Holdings notes permit Charter Holdings and its subsidiaries to make specified investments in
Charter Holdco or Charter, up to an amount determined by a formula, as long as there is no default
under the indentures. As of December 31, 2004, Charter Holdco had $106 million in cash on hand and
was owed $29 million in intercompany loans from its subsidiaries, which were available to pay
interest on Charter’s 4.75% convertible senior notes, which is expected to be approximately $7
million in 2005. In addition, Charter has $144 million of governmental securities pledged as
security for the six interest payments on Charter’s 5.875% convertible senior notes.

Sale of Assets

In March 2004, the Company closed the sale of certain cable systems in Florida, Pennsylvania,
Maryland, Delaware and West Virginia to Atlantic Broadband Finance, LLC. The Company closed the
sale of an additional cable system in New York to Atlantic Broadband Finance, LLC in April 2004.
These transactions resulted in a $104 million pretax gain recorded as a gain on sale of assets in
the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Subject to post-closing contractual
adjustments, the total net proceeds from the sale of all of these systems were approximately $733
million. The proceeds received to date were used to repay
a portion of amounts outstanding under the Company’s credit facilities.

3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or
less to be cash equivalents. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates market
value.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including all material, labor and certain
indirect costs associated with the construction of cable transmission and distribution facilities.
Costs associated with initial customer installations and the additions of network equipment
necessary to enable advanced services are capitalized. Costs capitalized as part of initial
customer installations include materials, labor, and certain indirect costs. Indirect costs are
associated with the activities of the Company’s personnel who assist in connecting and activating
the new service and consist of compensation and indirect costs associated with these support
functions. Indirect costs primarily include employee benefits and payroll taxes, direct variable
costs associated with capitalizable activities, consisting primarily of installation and
construction vehicle costs, the cost of dispatch personnel and indirect costs directly attributable
to capitalizable activities. The costs of disconnecting service at a customer’s dwelling or
reconnecting service to a previously installed dwelling are charged to operating expense in the
period incurred. Costs for repairs and maintenance are charged to operating expense as incurred,
while plant and equipment replacement and betterments, including replacement of cable drops from
the pole to the dwelling, are capitalized.

Depreciation is recorded
using the straight-line composite method over management’s estimate of the useful
lives of the related assets as follows:

Franchises

Franchise rights represent the value attributed to agreements with local authorities that allow
access to homes in cable service areas acquired through the purchase of cable systems. Management
estimates the fair value of franchise rights at the date of acquisition and determines if the
franchise has a finite life or an indefinite-life as defined by Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

. All franchises that qualify for
indefinite-life treatment under SFAS No. 142 are no longer amortized against earnings but instead
are tested for impairment annually as of October 1, or more frequently as warranted by events or
changes in circumstances (see Note 7). The Company concluded that 99% of its franchises qualify
for indefinite-life treatment; however, certain franchises did not qualify for indefinite-life
treatment due to technological or operational factors that limit their lives. These franchise
costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over 10 years. Costs incurred in renewing cable
franchises are deferred and amortized over 10 years.

Other Noncurrent Assets

Other noncurrent assets primarily include goodwill, deferred financing costs, governmental
securities and investments in equity securities. Costs related to borrowings are deferred and
amortized to interest expense over the terms of the related borrowings.

Investments in equity securities are accounted for at cost, under the equity method of accounting
or in accordance with SFAS No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities

. Charter recognizes losses for any decline in value considered to be other than
temporary. Certain marketable equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported
at market value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income
or loss.

As required by the indentures to the Company’s 5.875% convertible senior notes issued in November
2004, the Company purchased U.S. government securities valued at approximately $144 million with
maturities corresponding to the interest payment dates for the convertible senior notes. These
securities were pledged and are held in escrow to provide payment in full for the first six
interest payments of the convertible senior notes (see Note 9). These securities are accounted for
as held-to-maturity securities. At December 31, 2004, the carrying value and fair value of the
securities was approximately $144 million with approximately $48 million recorded in prepaid and
other assets and approximately $96 million recorded in other assets in the Company’s consolidated
balance sheet.

F-11


CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2004, 2003 AND 2002

(dollars in millions, except where indicated)

Valuation of Property, Plant and Equipment

The Company evaluates the recoverability of property, plant and equipment for impairment when
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. Such events or changes in circumstances could include such factors as impairment of
the Company’s indefinite life franchise under SFAS No. 142, changes in technological advances,
fluctuations in the fair value of such assets, adverse changes in relationships with local
franchise authorities, adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results. If a review
indicates that the carrying value of such asset is not recoverable from estimated undiscounted cash
flows, the carrying value of such asset is reduced to its estimated fair value. While the Company
believes that its estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions regarding
such cash flows could materially affect its evaluations of asset recoverability. No impairment of
property, plant and equipment occurred in 2004, 2003 and 2002.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company accounts for derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

, as amended. For those instruments
which qualify as hedging activities, related gains or losses are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income. For all other derivative instruments, the related gains or losses are
recorded in the income statement. The Company uses interest rate risk management derivative
instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements, interest rate cap agreements and interest rate
collar agreements (collectively referred to herein as interest rate agreements) as required under
the terms of the credit facilities of the Company’s subsidiaries. The Company’s policy is to
manage interest costs using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt. Using interest rate swap
agreements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed
and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount.
Interest rate cap agreements are used to lock in a maximum interest rate should variable rates
rise, but enable the Company to otherwise pay lower market rates. Interest rate collar agreements
are used to limit exposure to and benefits from interest rate fluctuations on variable rate debt to
within a certain range of rates. The Company does not hold or issue any derivative financial
instruments for trading purposes.

Certain provisions of the Company’s 5.875% convertible senior notes issued in November 2004 were
considered embedded derivatives for accounting purposes and were required to be separately
accounted for from the convertible senior notes. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, these
derivatives are marked to market with gains or losses recorded in interest expense on the Company’s
consolidated statement of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company recognized
$1 million in losses related to these derivatives. At December 31, 2004, $10 million is recorded
in accounts payable and accrued expenses relating to the short-term portion of these derivatives
and $21 million is recorded in other long-term liabilities related to the long-term portion.

Revenue Recognition

Revenues from residential and commercial video and high-speed data services are recognized when the
related services are provided. Advertising sales are recognized at estimated realizable values in
the period that the advertisements are broadcast. Local governmental authorities impose franchise
fees on the Company ranging up to a federally mandated maximum of 5% of gross revenues as defined
in the franchise agreement. Such fees are collected on a monthly basis from the Company’s
customers and are periodically remitted to local franchise authorities. Franchise fees are
reported as revenues on a gross basis with a corresponding operating expense

.

Programming Costs

The Company has various contracts to obtain analog, digital and premium video programming from
program suppliers whose compensation is typically based on a flat fee per customer. The cost of
the right to exhibit network programming under such arrangements is recorded in operating expenses
in the month the programming is available for exhibition. Programming costs are paid each month
based on calculations performed by the Company and are subject to adjustment based on periodic
audits performed by the programmers. Certain programming contracts contain launch incentives to be
paid by the programmers. The Company receives these payments related to the activation of the
programmer’s cable television channel and recognizes the launch incentives on a straight-line basis

F-12


CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2004, 2003 AND 2002

(dollars in millions, except where indicated)

over the life of the programming agreement as a reduction of programming expense. This offset to
programming expense was $59 million, $62 million and $57 million for the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Programming costs included in the accompanying statement of
operations were $1.3 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the deferred amount of launch
incentives, included in other long-term liabilities, totaled $106 million and $170 million,
respectively.

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs associated with marketing the Company’s products and services are generally
expensed as costs are incurred. Such advertising expense was $72 million, $62 million and $60
million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company has historically accounted for stock-based compensation in accordance with Accounting
Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

, and related
interpretations, as permitted by SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

. On January
1, 2003, the Company adopted the fair value measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123 using the
prospective method under which the Company will recognize compensation expense of a stock-based
award to an employee over the vesting period based on the fair value of the award on the grant date
consistent with the method described in Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation (“FIN”)
No. 28,

Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans

.
Adoption of these provisions resulted in utilizing a preferable accounting method as the
consolidated financial statements will present the estimated fair value of stock-based compensation
in expense consistently with other forms of compensation and other expense associated with goods
and services received for equity instruments. In accordance with SFAS No. 148,

Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and Disclosure,

the fair value method was applied only to
awards granted or modified after January 1, 2003, whereas awards granted prior to such date were
accounted for under APB No. 25, unless they were modified or settled in cash.

years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively: risk-free interest rates of 3.3%, 3.0%,
and 3.6%; expected volatility of 92.4%, 93.6% and

(dollars in millions, except where indicated)

64.2%; and expected lives of 4.6 years, 4.5 years and 4.3 years, respectively. The valuations
assume no dividends are paid.

Unfavorable Contracts and Other Settlements

The Company recognized $5 million of benefit for the year ended December 31, 2004 related to
changes in estimated legal reserves established as part of previous business combinations, which,
based on an evaluation of current facts and circumstances, are no longer required.

The Company recognized $72 million of benefit for the year ended December 31, 2003 as a result of
the settlement of estimated liabilities recorded in connection with prior business combinations.
The majority of this benefit (approximately $52 million) is due to the renegotiation of a major
programming contract, for which a liability had been recorded for the above market portion of the
agreement in conjunction with the Falcon acquisition in 1999 and the Bresnan acquisition in 2000.
The remaining benefit relates to the reversal of previously recorded liabilities, which are no
longer required.

Income Taxes

The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the
financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company’s assets and liabilities and expected
benefits of utilizing net operating loss carryforwards. The impact on deferred taxes of changes in
tax rates and tax law, if any, applied to the years during which temporary differences are expected
to be settled, are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period of enactment
(see Note 21).

Minority Interest

Minority interest on the consolidated balance sheets represents the portion of members’ equity of
Charter Holdco not owned by Charter, plus preferred membership interests in an indirect subsidiary
of Charter held by Mr. Paul G. Allen. Minority interest totaled $648 million and $689 million as
of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Gains or losses arising from issuances by Charter Holdco of its membership units are recorded as
capital transactions thereby increasing or decreasing shareholders’ equity and decreasing or
increasing minority interest on the consolidated balance sheets. These losses totaled $0, $1
million and $1 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, on the
accompanying consolidated statements of changes in shareholders’ equity. Operating losses are
allocated to the minority owners based on their ownership percentage, thereby reducing the
Company’s net loss.

Reported losses allocated to minority interest on the statement of operations are limited to the
extent of any remaining minority interest on the balance sheet related to Charter Holdco. Because
minority interest in Charter Holdco was substantially eliminated at December 31, 2003, beginning in
2004, Charter began to absorb substantially all future losses before income taxes that otherwise
would have been allocated to minority interest.

Loss per Common Share

Basic loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss applicable to common stock by

300,291,877 shares, 294,597,519 shares and 294,440,261 shares for the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, representing the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the
respective periods. Diluted loss per common share equals basic loss per common share for the
periods presented, as the effect of stock options is antidilutive because the Company incurred net
losses. All membership units of Charter Holdco are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into common
stock of Charter at the option of the holders. As of December 31, 2004, Charter Holdco has
644,385,801 membership units outstanding. Should the holders exchange units for shares, the effect
would not be dilutive because the Company incurred net losses.

Segments

SFAS No. 131,

Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information

, established
standards for reporting information about operating segments in annual financial statements and in
interim financial reports issued to shareholders. Operating segments are defined as components of
an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated on a
regular basis by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to
allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing performance of the segment.

The Company’s operations are managed on the basis of geographic divisional operating segments. The
Company has evaluated the criteria for aggregation of the geographic operating segments under
paragraph 17 of SFAS No. 131 and believes it meets each of the respective criteria set forth. The
Company delivers similar products and services within each of its geographic divisional operations.
Each geographic and divisional service area utilizes similar means for delivering the programming
of the Company’s services; have similarity in the type or class of customer receiving the products
and services; distributes the Company’s services over a unified network; and operates within a
consistent regulatory environment. In addition, each of the geographic divisional operating
segments has similar economic characteristics. In light of the Company’s similar services, means
for delivery, similarity in type of customers, the use of a unified network and other
considerations across its geographic divisional operating structure, management has determined that
the Company has one reportable segment, broadband services.

4. Acquisitions

On February 28, 2002, CC Systems, LLC, a subsidiary of the Company, and High Speed Access Corp.
(“HSA”) closed the Company’s acquisition from HSA of the contracts and associated assets, and
assumed related liabilities, that served certain of the Company’s high-speed data customers. At
closing, the Company paid approximately $78 million in cash and delivered 37,000 shares of HSA’s
Series D convertible preferred stock and all the warrants to buy HSA common stock owned by the
Company. The purchase price has been allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on
fair values, including approximately $8 million assigned to intangible assets and amortized over an
average useful life of three years and approximately $52 million assigned to goodwill. During the
period from 1997 to 2000, certain subsidiaries of the Company entered into Internet-access related
service agreements with HSA, and both Vulcan Ventures and certain of the Company’s subsidiaries
made equity investments in HSA. (see Note 22 for additional information).

In April 2002, Interlink Communications Partners, LLC, Rifkin Acquisition Partners, LLC and Charter
Communications Entertainment I, LLC, each an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Charter Holdings,
completed the purchase of certain assets of Enstar Income Program II-2, L.P., Enstar Income Program
IV-3, L.P., Enstar Income/Growth Program Six-A, L.P., Enstar Cable of Macoupin County and Enstar
IV/PBD Systems Venture, serving approximately 21,600 (unaudited) customers, for a total cash
purchase price of $48 million. In September 2002, Charter Communications Entertainment I, LLC
purchased all of Enstar Income Program II-1, L.P.’s Illinois cable systems, serving approximately
6,400 (unaudited) customers, for a cash purchase price of $15 million. Enstar Communications
Corporation, a direct subsidiary of Charter Holdco, is a general partner of the Enstar limited
partnerships but does not exercise control over them. The purchase prices were allocated to assets
acquired based on fair values, including $41 million assigned to franchises and $4 million assigned
to other intangible assets amortized over a useful life of three years.

The 2002 acquisitions were funded primarily from borrowings under the credit facilities of the
Company’s subsidiaries.

The Company periodically evaluates the estimated useful lives used to depreciate its assets and the
estimated amount of assets that will be abandoned or have minimal use in the future. A significant
change in assumptions about the extent or timing of future asset retirements, or in the Company’s
use of new technology and upgrade programs, could materially affect future depreciation expense.

Depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $1.5 billion, $1.5
billion and $1.4 billion respectively.

7. Franchises and Goodwill

On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS’’) No.
142, which eliminates the amortization of indefinite-lived intangible assets. Accordingly,
beginning January 1, 2002, all franchises that qualify for indefinite-life treatment under SFAS No.
142 are no longer amortized against earnings but instead are tested for impairment annually based
on valuations, or more frequently as warranted by events or changes in circumstances. Based on the
guidance prescribed in Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF’’) Issue No. 02-7,

Unit of Accounting for
Testing of Impairment of Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

, franchises are aggregated into
essentially inseparable asset groups to conduct the valuations. The asset groups generally
represent geographic clustering of the Company’s cable systems into groups by which such systems
are managed. Management believes such grouping represents the highest and best use of those
assets.

The Company’s valuations, which are based on the present value of projected after tax cash flows,
result in a value of property, plant and equipment, franchises, customer relationships and its
total entity value. The value of goodwill is the difference between the total entity value and
amounts assigned to the other assets.

CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2004, 2003 AND 2002

(dollars in millions, except where indicated)

Franchises, for valuation purposes, are defined as the future economic benefits of the right to
solicit and service potential customers (customer marketing rights), and the right to deploy and
market new services such as interactivity and telephony to the potential customers (service
marketing rights). Fair value is determined based on estimated discounted future cash flows using
assumptions consistent with internal forecasts. The franchise after-tax cash flow is calculated as
the after-tax cash flow generated by the potential customers obtained and the new services added to
those customers in future periods. The sum of the present value of the franchises’ after-tax cash
flow in years 1 through 10 and the continuing value of the after-tax cash flow beyond year 10
yields the fair value of the franchise. Prior to the adoption of EITF Topic D-108,

Use of the
Residual Method to Value Acquired Assets Other than Goodwill

, discussed below, the Company followed
a residual method of valuing its franchise assets, which had the effect of including goodwill with
the franchise assets.

The Company follows the guidance of EITF Issue 02-17,

Recognition of Customer Relationship
Intangible Assets Acquired in a Business Combination,

in valuing customer relationships. Customer
relationships, for valuation purposes, represent the value of the business relationship with
existing customers and are calculated by projecting future after-tax cash flows from these
customers including the right to deploy and market additional services such as interactivity and
telephony to these customers. The present value of these after-tax cash flows yield the fair value
of the customer relationships. Substantially all acquisitions occurred prior to January 1, 2002.
The Company did not record any value associated with the customer relationship intangibles related
to those acquisitions. For acquisitions subsequent to January 1, 2002 the Company did assign a
value to the customer relationship intangible, which is amortized over its estimated useful life.

In September 2004, the SEC staff issued Topic D-108 which requires the direct method of separately
valuing all intangible assets and does not permit goodwill to be included in franchise assets. The
Company performed an impairment assessment as of September 30, 2004, and adopted Topic D-108 in
that assessment resulting in a total franchise impairment of approximately $3.3 billion. The
Company recorded a cumulative effect of accounting change of $765 million (approximately $875
million before tax effects of $91 million and minority interest effects of $19 million) for the
year ended December 31, 2004 representing the portion of the Company’s total franchise impairment
attributable to no longer including goodwill with franchise assets. The effect of the adoption was
to increase net loss and loss per share by $765 million and $2.55 for the year ended December 31,
2004. The remaining $2.4 billion of the total franchise impairment was attributable to the use of
lower projected growth rates and the resulting revised estimates of future cash flows in the
Company’s valuation, and was recorded as impairment of franchises in the Company’s accompanying
consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004. Sustained analog video
customer losses by the Company in the third quarter of 2004 primarily as a result of increased
competition from direct broadcast satellite providers and decreased growth rates in the Company’s
high-speed data customers in the third quarter of 2004, in part, as a result of increased
competition from digital subscriber line service providers led to the lower projected growth rates
and the revised estimates of future cash flows from those used at October 1, 2003.

The valuation completed at October 1, 2003 showed franchise values in excess of book value and thus
resulted in no impairment. The Company’s annual impairment assessment as of October 1, 2002, based
on revised estimates from January 1, 2002 of future cash flows and projected long-term growth rates
in the Company’s valuation, led to the recognition of a $4.6 billion impairment charge in the
fourth quarter of 2002.

As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangible assets are presented
in the following table:

For the year ended December 31, 2004, the net carrying amount of indefinite-lived intangible
assets was reduced by $490 million as a result of the sale of cable systems, primarily the sale to
Atlantic Broadband Finance, LLC, discussed in Note 2. Additionally, in the first and fourth
quarters of 2004, approximately $29 million and $8 million, respectively, of franchises that were
previously classified as finite-lived were reclassified to indefinite-lived, based on the Company’s
renewal of these franchise assets in 2003 and 2004. Franchise amortization expense for the years
ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $4 million, $9 million and $9 million, respectively,
which represents the amortization relating to franchises that did not qualify for indefinite-life
treatment under SFAS No. 142, including costs associated with franchise renewals. The Company
expects that amortization expense on franchise assets will be approximately $3 million annually for
each of the next five years. Actual amortization expense in future periods could differ from these
estimates as a result of new intangible asset acquisitions or divestitures, changes in useful lives
and other relevant factors.

The accreted values presented above represents the face value of the notes less the original issue
discount at the time of sale plus the accretion to the balance sheet date.

On November 22, 2004, the Company issued $862.5 million original principal amount of 5.875%
convertible senior notes due 2009, which are convertible into shares of Charter’s Class A common
stock, par value $.001 per share, at a rate of 413.2231 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes
(or approximately $2.42 per share), subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. On December
23, 2004, the Company used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the notes to redeem all of
its outstanding 5.75% convertible senior notes due 2005 (total principal amount of $588 million).
The redemption resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $10 million.

In April 2004, Charter’s indirect subsidiaries, Charter Operating and Charter Communications
Operating Capital Corp., sold $1.5 billion of senior second-lien notes in a private transaction.
Additionally, Charter Operating amended and restated its $5.1 billion credit facilities, among
other things, to defer maturities and increase availability under those facilities to approximately
$6.5 billion, consisting of a $1.5 billion six-year revolving credit facility, a $2.0 billion
six-year term loan facility and a $3.0 billion seven-year term loan facility. Charter Operating
used the additional borrowings under the amended and restated credit facilities, together with
proceeds from the sale of the Charter Operating senior second-lien notes to refinance the credit
facilities of its subsidiaries, CC VI Operating Company, LLC (“CC VI Operating”), Falcon Cable
Communications, LLC (“Falcon Cable”), and CC VIII Operating, LLC (“CC VIII Operating”), all in
concurrent transactions. In addition, Charter Operating was substituted as the lender in place of
the banks under those subsidiaries’ credit facilities. These transactions resulted in losses on
extinguishment of debt of $21 million.

The Company recognized a loss of approximately $23 million recorded as loss on debt to equity
conversion on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31,
2004 from privately negotiated

exchanges of a total of $30 million principal amount of Charter’s 5.75% convertible senior notes
for shares of Charter Class A common stock. The exchanges resulted in the issuance of more shares
in the exchange transaction than would have been issuable under the original terms of the
convertible senior notes.

In September 2003, Charter, Charter Holdings and their indirect subsidiary, CCH II purchased, in a
non-monetary transaction, a total of approximately $609 million principal amount of Charter’s
outstanding convertible senior notes and approximately $1.3 billion principal amount of the senior
notes and senior discount notes issued by Charter Holdings from institutional investors in a small
number of privately negotiated transactions. As consideration for these securities, CCH II issued
approximately $1.6 billion principal amount of 10.25% notes due 2010, and realized approximately
$294 million of debt discount. CCH II also issued an additional $30 million principal amount of
10.25% notes for an equivalent amount of cash and used the proceeds for transaction costs and for
general corporate purposes. This transaction resulted in a gain on extinguishment of debt of $267
million for the year ended December 31, 2003. See discussion of the CCH II notes below for more
details.

5.75% Charter Convertible Notes

In October and November 2000, Charter issued 5.75% convertible
senior notes with a total principal amount at maturity of $750 million. The 5.75% Charter
convertible notes were convertible at the option of the holder into shares of Class A common stock
at a conversion rate of 46.3822 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which was equivalent
to a price of $21.56 per share, subject to certain adjustments. The remaining $588 million of
these notes was redeemed on December 23, 2004 at a price of 101.15% of the outstanding principal
amount plus accrued and unpaid interest through the redemption date.

4.75% Charter Convertible Notes.

In May 2001, Charter issued 4.75% convertible senior notes with a
total principal amount at maturity of $633 million. As of December 31, 2004, there was $156
million in total principal amount of these notes outstanding. The 4.75% Charter convertible notes
rank equally with any of Charter’s future unsubordinated and unsecured indebtedness, but are
structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of Charter’s
subsidiaries.

The 4.75% Charter convertible notes are convertible at the option of the holder into shares of
Class A common stock at a conversion rate of 38.0952 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes,
which is equivalent to a price of $26.25 per share, subject to certain adjustments. Specifically,
the adjustments include anti-dilutive provisions, which automatically occur based on the occurrence
of specified events to provide protection rights to holders of the notes. Additionally, Charter
may adjust the conversion ratio under certain circumstances when deemed appropriate. These notes
are redeemable at Charter’s option at amounts decreasing from 101.9% to 100% of the principal
amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest beginning on June 4, 2004, to the date of redemption.
Interest is payable semiannually on December 1 and June 1, beginning December 1, 2001, until
maturity on June 1, 2006.

Upon a change of control, subject to certain conditions and restrictions, Charter may be required
to repurchase the notes, in whole or in part, at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued
interest at the repurchase date.

5.875% Charter Convertible Notes

.

In November 2004, Charter issued 5.875% convertible senior notes
due 2009 with a total original principal amount of $862.5 million. The 5.875% Charter convertible
notes are convertible at any time at the option of the holder into shares of Class A common stock
at an initial conversion rate of 413.2231 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which is
equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $2.42 per share, subject to certain adjustments.
Specifically, the adjustments include anti-dilutive provisions, which cause adjustments to occur
automatically based on the occurrence of specified events to provide protection rights to holders
of the notes. The conversion rate may also be increased (but not to exceed 462 shares per $1,000
principal amount of notes) upon a specified change of control transaction. Additionally, Charter
may elect to increase the conversion rate under certain circumstances when deemed appropriate and
subject to applicable limitations of the NASDAQ stock market. Holders who convert their notes
prior to November 16, 2007 will receive an early conversion make whole amount in respect of their
notes based on a proportional share of the portfolio of pledged securities described below, with
specified adjustments.

The 5.875% Charter convertible notes are unsecured (except with respect to the collateral as
described below) and rank equally with existing and future unsubordinated and unsecured
indebtedness (except with respect to the

collateral described below), but are structurally subordinated to all existing and future
indebtedness and other liabilities of Charter’s subsidiaries. Upon a change of control and certain
other fundamental changes, subject to certain conditions and restrictions, Charter may be required
to repurchase the notes, in whole or in part, at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued
interest at the repurchase date.

Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears. Charter Holdco used a portion of the proceeds from
the sale of the notes to purchase a portfolio of U.S. government securities in an amount which the
Company believes will be sufficient to make the first six interest payments on the notes. These
government securities were pledged to the Company as security for a mirror note issued by Charter
Holdco to Charter (as discussed below) and pledged to the trustee under the indenture governing the notes as security
for the Company’s obligations thereunder. The Company expects to use such securities to fund the
first six interest payments under the notes. The pledged securities totaled $144 million at
December 31, 2004. Any holder that converts its notes prior to the third anniversary of the issue
date will be entitled to receive, in addition to the requisite number of shares upon conversion, an
interest make whole payment equal to the cash proceeds from the sale by the trustee of that portion
of the remaining pledged U.S. government securities which secure interest payments on the notes so
converted, subject to certain limitations with respect to notes that have not been sold prior to
being registered under the Securities Act of 1933.

Following the earlier of the sale of the notes pursuant to an effective registration statement or
the date two years following the issue date, the notes in whole or in part may be redeemed for cash
at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount plus accrued and
unpaid interest, deferred interest and liquidated damages, if any, but only if for any 20 trading
days in any 30 consecutive trading day period the closing price has exceeded 180% of the conversion
price, if such 30 trading day period begins prior to November 16, 2007 or 150% of the conversion
price, if such 30 trading period begins thereafter. Holders who convert notes that the Company has
called for redemption shall receive, in addition to the early conversion make whole amount, if
applicable, the present value of the interest on the notes converted that would have been payable
for the period from the later of November 17, 2007 and the redemption date through the scheduled
maturity date for the notes, plus any accrued deferred interest.

The Company is required to
register the 5.875% Charter convertible notes by April 21, 2005. If the
5.875% Charter convertible notes are not registered by such date, the Company will incur liquidating
damages as defined in the related indenture. In conjunction with issuing the 5.875% Charter convertible notes, the Company filed a
registration statement to sell up to 150 million shares of the Company’s Class A common
stock pursuant to a share lending agreement. The share lending agreement is required to
be registered by April 1, 2005. If the share lending agreement is not registered by such
date, the Company will incur liquidating damages as defined in the related indenture.

In connection with our
November 2004 sale of the $862.5 million principal amount of 5.875% convertible senior notes due
2009, Charter Holdco issued to Charter mirror notes in identical principal amount in exchange for the
proceeds from its offering. Charter Holdco then purchased and pledged certain U.S. government
securities to Charter as security for the mirror notes (which were in turn
repledged by Charter to the
trustee for the benefit of holders of Charter’s 5.875%
convertible senior notes and which Charter expects to
use to fund the first six interest payments on the notes), and agreed
to lend common units to Charter,
the terms of which will, to the extent practicable, mirror the terms of the shares. Charter Holdco
also redeemed the remaining $588 million principal amount of the mirror notes in respect of our
5.75% convertible senior notes due 2005 concurrently with its
December 23, 2004 redemption of its 5.75% convertible senior notes.

In addition, in December 2004, Charter Holdco entered into a unit lending agreement with
Charter in which it agreed to lend common units to Charter that would mirror the anticipated loan
of Class A common shares by Charter to Citigroup Global Markets pursuant to a share lending
agreement. The members of Charter Holdco (including the entities controlled by Mr. Allen) also at
that time entered into a letter agreement providing, among other things, that for purposes of the
allocation provisions of the Limited Liability Company Agreement of Charter Holdco, the mirror
units be treated as disregarded and not outstanding until such time (and except to the extent)
that, under Charter’s share lending agreement, Charter treats the loaned shares in a manner that
assumes they will neither be returned by Charter by the borrower nor
otherwise be acquired by
Charter in lieu of such a return.

of restrictions contained in the Charter Holdings indentures, there were no Charter Operating note
guarantees, even though Charter Operating’s immediate parent, CCO Holdings, and certain of the
Company’s subsidiaries were obligors and/or guarantors under the Charter Operating credit
facilities. Upon the occurrence of the guarantee and pledge date (generally, the fifth business
day after the Charter Holdings leverage ratio is certified to be below 8.75 to 1.0), CCO Holdings
and those subsidiaries of Charter Operating that are then guarantors of, or otherwise obligors with
respect to, indebtedness under the Charter Operating credit facilities and related obligations will
be required to guarantee the Charter Operating notes. The note guarantee of each such guarantor
will be:

•

a senior obligation of such guarantor;

•

structurally senior to the outstanding senior notes of CCO Holdings and CCO
Holdings Capital Corp. (except in the case of CCO Holdings’ note guarantee, which ranks
equally with such senior notes), the outstanding senior notes of CCH II and CCH II
Capital Corp., the outstanding senior notes and senior discount notes of Charter
Holdings and the outstanding convertible senior notes of Charter (but subject to
provisions in the Charter Operating indenture that permit interest and, subject to
meeting the 4.25 to 1.0 leverage ratio test, principal payments to be made thereon);
and

•

senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness of such
guarantor.

As a result of the above leverage ratio test being met, CCO Holdings and certain of its
subsidiaries provided the additional guarantees described above during the first quarter of 2005.

All the subsidiaries of Charter Operating (except CCO NR Sub, LLC, and certain other subsidiaries
that are not deemed material and are designated as nonrecourse subsidiaries under the Charter
Operating credit facilities) are restricted subsidiaries of Charter Operating under the Charter
Operating notes. Unrestricted subsidiaries generally will not be subject to the restrictive
covenants in the Charter Operating indenture.

In the event of specified change of control events, Charter Operating must offer to purchase the
Charter Operating notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the total principal amount of the
Charter Operating notes repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon.

The indenture governing the Charter Operating senior notes contains restrictive covenants that
limit certain transactions or activities by Charter Operating and its restricted subsidiaries.
Substantially all of Charter Operating’s direct and indirect subsidiaries are currently restricted
subsidiaries.

Renaissance Notes.

In connection with the acquisition of Renaissance in April 1999, the Company
assumed $163 million principal amount at maturity of 10.000% senior discount notes due 2008 of
which $49 million was repurchased in May 1999. The Renaissance notes did not require the payment
of interest until April 15, 2003. From and after April 15, 2003, the Renaissance notes bear
interest, payable semi-annually, on April 15 and October 15, commencing on October 15, 2003. The

Holdings’ outstanding 11.875% senior discount notes due 2008 with an accreted value of $113 million
as of December 31, 2003. Commencing December 1, 2003, cash interest on the CC V Holdings 11.875%
notes will be payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year. In February 2005, these
notes were called with an anticipated redemption date of March 14, 2005.

the Company’s subsidiaries contain certain covenants that restrict the ability of Charter Holdings,
Charter Capital, CCH II, CCH II Capital Corp., CCO Holdings, CCO Holdings Capital Corp., Charter
Operating, Charter Communications Operating Capital Corp., the CC V Holdings notes issuers,
Renaissance Media Group, and all of their restricted subsidiaries to:

Charter Operating Credit Facilities.

In April 2004, Charter Operating amended and restated its
$5.1 billion credit facilities, among other things, to defer maturities and increase availability
under those facilities to approximately $6.5 billion, consisting of a $1.5 billion revolving credit
facility with a maturity date in 2010; a $2.0 billion Term A loan facility of which 12.5% matures
in 2007, 30% matures in 2008, 37.5% matures in 2009 and 20% matures in 2010; and a $3.0 billion
Term B loan facility which is repayable in 27 equal quarterly installments aggregating in each loan
year to 1% of the original amount of the Term B facility, with the remaining balance due at final
maturity in 2011. Charter Operating used the additional borrowings under the amended and restated
credit facilities, together with proceeds from the sale of the Charter Operating senior second-lien
notes to refinance the credit facilities of its subsidiaries, CC VI Operating, Falcon Cable, and CC
VIII Operating,, all in concurrent transactions. In addition, Charter Operating was substituted as
the lender in place of the banks under those subsidiaries’ credit facilities.

Amounts outstanding under the Charter Operating credit facilities bear interest, at Charter
Operating’s election, at a base rate or the Eurodollar rate (2.07% to 2.28% as of December 31,
2004), as defined, plus a margin for Eurodollar loans of up to 3.00% for the Term A facility and
revolving credit facility, and up to 3.25% for the Term B facility, and for base rate loans of up
to 2.00% for the Term A facility and revolving credit facility, and up to 2.25% for the Term B
facility. A quarterly commitment fee of up to .75% is payable on the average daily unborrowed
balance of the revolving credit facilities.

The obligations of Charter’s subsidiaries under the Charter Operating credit facilities
(the “Obligations”) are guaranteed by Charter Operatings’ immediate parent company, CCO Holdings,
and the subsidiaries of Charter Operating, except for immaterial subsidiaries and subsidiaries
precluded from guaranteeing by reason of the provisions of other indebtedness to which they are
subject (the “non-guarantor subsidiaries”, primarily Renaissance and CC V Holdings and their subsidiaries). The
Obligations are also secured by (i) a lien on all of the assets of Charter Operating and its
subsidiaries (other than assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries), to the extent such lien can be
perfected under the Uniform Commercial Code by the filing of a financing statement, and (ii) by a
pledge by CCO Holdings of the equity interests owned by it in Charter Operating or any of Charter
Operating’s subsidiaries, as well as intercompany obligations owing to it by any of such entities.
Upon the Charter Holdings Leverage Ratio (as defined in the indenture governing the Charter
Holdings senior notes and senior discount notes) being under 8.75 to 1.0, the Charter Operating
credit facilities require that the 11.875% notes due 2008 issued by CC V Holdings, LLC be redeemed.
Because such Leverage Ratio was determined to be under 8.75 to 1.0 in February 2005, CC V Holdings
has called for redemption of such notes with an anticipated redemption date of March 14, 2005.
Following such redemption and provided the Leverage Ratio of Charter Holdings remains under 8.75 to
1.0, CC V Holdings and its subsidiaries (other than non-guarantor subsidiaries) will guarantee the
Obligations and grant a lien on all of their assets as to which a lien can be perfected under the
Uniform Commercial Code by the filing of a financing statement.

The Charter Operating credit facilities were amended and restated previously as of June 19, 2003 to
allow for the insertion of intermediate holding companies between Charter Holdings and Charter
Operating. In exchange for the lenders’ consent to the organizational restructuring, Charter
Operating’s pricing increased by 50 basis points across all levels in the pricing grid then in
effect under the Charter Operating credit facilities.

Amounts under the Charter Operating credit facilities, as amended in 2003, bore interest at the
Eurodollar rate or the base rate, each as defined, plus a margin of up to 3.0% for Eurodollar loans
(3.15% to 3.92% as of December 31, 2003) and 2.0% for base rate loans. A quarterly commitment fee
of between 0.25% and 0.375% per annum was payable on the unborrowed balance of the revolving credit
facilities.

approximately $5.5 billion and the unused total potential availability was $804 million.

CC VI Operating Credit Facilities.

As discussed above, in April 2004, Charter Operating was
substituted as the lender in place of the banks for the CC VI Operating Credit Facilities

Charter Operating Credit Facilities Restrictive Covenants.

The Charter Operating credit facilities
contain representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants similar to those
described above with respect to the indentures governing the Company’s notes, information
requirements, events of default and financial covenants. The financial covenants, as defined,
measure performance against standards set for leverage, debt service coverage, and operating cash
flow coverage of cash interest expense on a quarterly basis or as applicable. Additionally, the
credit facilities contain provisions requiring mandatory loan prepayments under specific
circumstances, including when significant amounts of assets are sold and the proceeds are not
promptly reinvested in assets useful in the business of the borrower within a specified period.
The Charter Operating credit facilities also provide that in the event that any indebtedness of CCO
Holdings remains outstanding on the date, which is six months prior to the scheduled final
maturity, the term loans under the Charter Operating credit facilities will mature and the
revolving credit facilities will terminate on such date. The events of default under the Charter
Operating credit facilities include, among other things:

Operating, unless the Paul Allen Group holds a greater share of ordinary voting power of
Charter Operating,

•

certain of Charter Operating’s indirect or direct parent companies having indebtedness
in excess of $500 million aggregate principal amount which remains undefeased three months
prior to the final maturity of such indebtedness, and

•

Charter Operating ceasing to be a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of CCO Holdings, except
in certain very limited circumstances.

In the event of a default under the Company’s subsidiaries’ credit facilities or notes, the
subsidiaries’ creditors could elect to declare all amounts borrowed, together with accrued and
unpaid interest and other fees, to be due and payable. In such event, the subsidiaries’ credit
facilities and indentures would not permit the Company’s subsidiaries to distribute funds to
Charter Holdco or Charter to pay interest or principal on Charter’s notes. In addition, the
lenders under the Company’s credit facilities could foreclose on their collateral, which includes
equity interests in the Company’s subsidiaries, and exercise other rights of secured creditors. In
any such case, the Company might not be able to repay or make any payments on its notes.
Additionally, an acceleration or payment default under Charter Operating’s credit facilities would
cause a cross-default in the indentures governing the Charter Holdings notes, CCH II notes, CCO
Holdings notes, Charter Operating notes and Charter’s convertible senior notes and would trigger
the cross-default provision of the Charter Operating Credit Agreement. Any default under any of
the subsidiaries’ credit facilities or notes might adversely affect the holders of Charter’s notes
and the Company’s growth, financial condition and results of operations and could force the Company
to examine all options, including seeking the protection of the bankruptcy laws.

Based upon outstanding indebtedness as of December 31, 2004, the amortization of term loans,
scheduled reductions in available borrowings of the revolving credit facilities, and the maturity
dates for all senior and subordinated notes and debentures, total future principal payments on the
total borrowings under all debt agreements as of December 31, 2004, are as follows:

For the amounts of debt scheduled to mature during 2005, it is management’s intent to fund the
repayments from borrowings on the Company’s revolving credit facility. The accompanying
consolidated balance sheet reflects this intent by presenting all debt balances as long-term while
the table above reflects actual debt maturities as of the stated date.

10. Minority Interest and Equity Interest of Charter Holdco

Charter is a holding company whose primary asset is a controlling equity interest in Charter
Holdco, the indirect owner of the Company’s cable systems, and $990 million and $774 million at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, of mirror notes which are payable by Charter Holdco to
Charter and have the same principal amount and terms as those of Charter’s convertible senior
notes. Minority interest on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets represents the ownership
percentage of Charter Holdco not owned by Charter, or 52.8% of total members’ equity of Charter
Holdco, plus $656 million and $694 million of preferred membership interests in CC VIII, LLC (“CC
VIII”), an indirect subsidiary of Charter Holdco, as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 respectively.
As more fully described in Note 22, this preferred interest arises from the approximately $630
million of preferred membership units issued by CC VIII in connection with an acquisition in
February 2000. As of December 31, 2003,

F-29


CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

(dollars in millions, except where indicated)

minority interest also includes $25 million of preferred interest in Charter Helicon, LLC, another
indirect subsidiary of Charter Holdco, issued in connection with the 1999 Helicon acquisition. As
of December 31, 2004, the preferred interest in Charter Helicon, LLC was reclassified to other
long-term liabilities.

Members’ equity of Charter Holdco was ($4.4) billion, ($57) million and $662 million as of December
31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Gains and losses arising from the issuance by Charter
Holdco of its membership units are recorded as capital transactions, thereby increasing or
decreasing shareholders’ equity and decreasing or increasing minority interest on the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets. Minority interest was 52.8% as of December 31, 2004 and 53.5% as of
December 31, 2003 and 2002. Minority interest includes the proportionate share of changes in fair
value of interest rate risk derivative agreements. Such amounts are temporary as they are
contractually scheduled to reverse over the life of the underlying instrument. Additionally,
reported losses allocated to minority interest on the consolidated statement of operations are
limited to the extent of any remaining minority interest on the balance sheet related to Charter
Holdco. Because minority interest in Charter Holdco was substantially eliminated at December 31,
2003, beginning in 2004, the Company began to absorb substantially all losses before income taxes
that otherwise would have been allocated to minority interest. This resulted in an additional $2.4
billion of net loss for the year ended December 31, 2004. Subject to any changes in Charter
Holdco’s capital structure, future losses will be substantially absorbed by Charter. Changes to
minority interest consist of the following for the periods presented:

11. Preferred Stock — Redeemable

On August 31, 2001, in connection with its acquisition of Cable USA, Inc. and certain cable system
assets from affiliates of Cable USA, Inc., the Company issued 505,664 shares of Series A
Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock (the Preferred Stock) valued at and with a liquidation
preference of $51 million. Holders of the Preferred Stock have no voting rights but are entitled
to receive cumulative cash dividends at an annual rate of 5.75%, payable quarterly. If for any
reason Charter fails to pay the dividends on the Preferred Stock on a timely basis, the dividend
rate on each share increases to an annual rate of 7.75% until the payment is made. The Preferred
Stock is redeemable by Charter at its option on or after August 31, 2004 and must be redeemed by
Charter at any time upon a change of control, or if not previously redeemed or converted, on August
31, 2008. The Preferred Stock is convertible, in whole or in part, at the option of the holders
from April 1, 2002 through August 31, 2008, into shares

of common stock at an initial conversion rate equal to a conversion price of $24.71 per share of
common stock, subject to certain customary adjustments. The redemption price per share of
Preferred Stock is the Liquidation Preference of $100, subject to certain customary adjustments.
In the first quarter of 2003, the Company issued 39,595 additional shares of preferred stock valued
at and with a liquidation preference of $4 million.

12. Common Stock

The Company’s Class A common stock and Class B common stock are identical except with respect to
certain voting, transfer and conversion rights. Holders of Class A common stock are entitled to
one vote per share and holder of Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes for each share of
Class B common stock held and for each Charter Holdco membership unit held. The Class B common
stock is subject to significant transfer restrictions and is convertible on a share for share basis
into Class A common stock at the option of the holder. Charter Holdco membership units are
exchangeable on a one-for-one basis for shares of Class A common stock.

13. Comprehensive Loss

Certain marketable equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at market
value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as accumulated other comprehensive loss on the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, the Company reports changes in the fair
value of interest rate agreements designated as hedging the variability of cash flows associated
with floating-rate debt obligations, that meet the effectiveness criteria of SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

, in accumulated other comprehensive
loss, after giving effect to the minority interest share of such gains and losses. Comprehensive
loss for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $4.3 billion, $219 million and $2.5
billion, respectively.

14. Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

The Company uses interest rate risk management derivative instruments, such as interest rate swap
agreements and interest rate collar agreements (collectively referred to herein as interest rate
agreements) to manage its interest costs. The Company’s policy is to manage interest costs using a
mix of fixed and variable rate debt. Using interest rate swap agreements, the Company has agreed
to exchange, at specified intervals through 2007, the difference between fixed and variable
interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. Interest
rate collar agreements are used to limit the Company’s exposure to and benefits from interest rate
fluctuations on variable rate debt to within a certain range of rates.

The Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. The Company does,
however, have certain interest rate derivative instruments that have been designated as cash flow
hedging instruments. Such instruments effectively convert variable interest payments on certain
debt instruments into fixed payments. For qualifying hedges, SFAS No. 133 allows derivative gains
and losses to offset related results on hedged items in the consolidated statement of operations.
The Company has formally documented, designated and assessed the effectiveness of transactions that
receive hedge accounting. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, net gain (loss) on
derivative instruments and hedging activities includes gains of $4 million and $8 million and
losses of $14 million, respectively, which represent cash flow hedge ineffectiveness on interest
rate hedge agreements arising from differences between the critical terms of the agreements and the
related hedged obligations. Changes in the fair value of interest rate agreements designated as
hedging instruments of the variability of cash flows associated with floating-rate debt obligations
that meet the effectiveness criteria SFAS No. 133 are reported in accumulated other comprehensive
loss. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, a gain of $42 million and $48 million
and losses of $65 million, respectively, related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow
hedges, was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and minority interest. The amounts
are subsequently reclassified into interest expense as a yield adjustment in the same period in
which the related interest on the floating-rate debt obligations affects earnings (losses).

Certain interest rate derivative instruments are not designated as hedges as they do not meet the
effectiveness criteria specified by SFAS No. 133. However, management believes such instruments
are closely correlated with the respective debt, thus managing associated risk. Interest rate
derivative instruments not designated as hedges are

F-31

(dollars in millions, except where indicated)

marked to fair value, with the impact recorded as gain (loss) on derivative instruments and hedging
activities in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. For the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, net gain (loss) on derivative instruments and hedging activities includes
gains of $65 million, $57 million and losses of $101 million, respectively, for interest rate
derivative instruments not designated as hedges.

As of December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company had outstanding $2.7 billion, $3.0 billion and
$3.4 billion and $20 million, $520 million and $520 million, respectively, in notional amounts of
interest rate swaps and collars, respectively. The notional amounts of interest rate instruments
do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, thus, are not a measure of exposure to
credit loss. The amounts exchanged are determined by reference to the notional amount and the
other terms of the contracts.

15. Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Company has estimated the fair value of its financial instruments as of December 31, 2004 and
2003 using available market information or other appropriate valuation methodologies. Considerable
judgment, however, is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value.
Accordingly, the estimates presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are not
necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company would realize in a current market exchange.

The carrying amounts of cash, receivables, payables and other current assets and liabilities
approximate fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments. The Company is exposed
to market price risk volatility with respect to investments in publicly traded and privately held
entities.

The fair value of interest rate agreements represents the estimated amount the Company would
receive or pay upon termination of the agreements. Management believes that the sellers of the
interest rate agreements will be able to meet their obligations under the agreements. In addition,
some of the interest rate agreements are with certain of the participating banks under the
Company’s credit facilities, thereby reducing the exposure to credit loss. The Company has
policies regarding the financial stability and credit standing of major counterparties.
Nonperformance by the counterparties is not anticipated nor would it have a material adverse effect
on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

The estimated fair value of the Company’s notes and interest rate agreements at December 31, 2004
and 2003 are based on quoted market prices, and the fair value of the credit facilities is based on
dealer quotations.

A summary of the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s debt and related interest rate
agreements at December 31, 2004 and 2003 is as follows:

2001 Stock Incentive Plan of Charter (the “2001 Plan”). Prior to 2001, options were granted under
the 1999 Option Plan of Charter Holdco (the “1999 Plan”).

The 1999 Plan provided for the grant of options to purchase membership units in Charter Holdco to
current and prospective employees and consultants of Charter Holdco and its affiliates and current
and prospective non-

employee directors of Charter. Options granted generally vest over five years from the grant date,
with 25% vesting 15 months after the anniversary of the grant date and ratably thereafter. Options
not exercised accumulate and are exercisable, in whole or in part, in any subsequent period, but
not later than 10 years from the date of grant. Membership units received upon exercise of the
options are automatically exchanged into Class A common stock of Charter on a one-for-one basis.

The 2001 Plan provides for the grant of non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights,
dividend equivalent rights, performance units and performance shares, share awards, phantom stock
and/or shares of restricted stock (not to exceed 3,000,000), as each term is defined in the 2001
Plan. Employees, officers, consultants and directors of the Company and its subsidiaries and
affiliates are eligible to receive grants under the 2001 Plan. Options granted generally vest over
four years from the grant date, with 25% vesting on the anniversary of the grant date and ratably
thereafter. Generally, options expire 10 years from the grant date.

The 2001 Plan allows for the issuance of up to a total of 90,000,000 shares of Charter Class A
common stock (or units convertible into Charter Class A common stock). The total shares available
reflect a July 2003 amendment to the 2001 Plan approved by the board of directors and the
shareholders of Charter to increase available shares by 30,000,000 shares. In 2001, any shares
covered by options that terminated under the 1999 Plan were transferred to the 2001 Plan, and no
new options can be granted under the 1999 Plan.

In the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, certain directors were awarded a total of 182,932
and 80,603 shares, respectively, of restricted Class A common stock of which 25,705 shares had been
cancelled as of December 31, 2004. The shares vest one year from the date of grant. In December
2003 and January 2004, in connection with new employment agreements, certain officers were awarded
50,000 and 50,000 shares, respectively, of restricted Class A common stock of which 50,000 shares
had been cancelled as of December 31, 2004. The shares vest annually over a four-year period
beginning from the date of grant. As of December 31, 2004, deferred compensation remaining to be
recognized in future period totaled $0.4 million.

A summary of the activity for the Company’s stock options, excluding granted shares of restricted
Class A common stock, for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, is as follows (amounts

On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the fair value measurement provisions of SFAS No. 123,
under which the Company recognizes compensation expense of a stock-based award to an employee over
the vesting period based on the fair value of the award on the grant date. Adoption of these
provisions resulted in utilizing a preferable accounting method as the consolidated financial
statements present the estimated fair value of stock-based compensation in expense consistently
with other forms of compensation and other expense associated with goods and services received for
equity instruments. In accordance with SFAS No. 123, the fair value method will be applied only to
awards granted or modified after January 1, 2003, whereas awards granted prior to such date will
continue to be accounted for under APB No. 25, unless they are modified or settled in cash. The
ongoing effect on consolidated results of operations or financial condition will be dependent upon
future stock based compensation awards granted. The Company recorded $31 million of option
compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123, the Company used the intrinsic value method prescribed by
APB No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

, to account for the option plans. Option
compensation expense of $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, was recorded in the
consolidated statements of operations since the exercise prices of certain options were less than
the estimated fair values of the underlying membership interests on the date of grant.

In January 2004, the Company began an option exchange program in which the Company offered its
employees the right to exchange all stock options (vested and unvested) under the 1999 Charter
Communications Option Plan and 2001 Stock Incentive Plan that had an exercise price over $10 per
share for shares of restricted Charter Class A common stock or, in some instances, cash. Based on
a sliding exchange ratio, which varied depending on the exercise price of an employees outstanding
options, if an employee would have received more than 400 shares of restricted stock in exchange
for tendered options, Charter issued that employee shares of restricted stock in the exchange. If,
based on the exchange ratios, an employee would have received 400 or fewer shares of restricted
stock in exchange for tendered options, Charter instead paid the employee cash in an amount equal
to the number of shares the employee would have received multiplied by $5.00. The offer applied to
options (vested and unvested) to purchase a total of 22,929,573 shares of Class A common stock, or
approximately 48% of the Company’s 47,882,365 total options issued and outstanding as of December
31, 2003. Participation by employees was voluntary. Those members of the Company’s board of
directors who were not also employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries were not eligible
to participate in the exchange offer.

In the closing of the exchange offer on February 20, 2004, the Company accepted for cancellation
eligible options to purchase approximately 18,137,664 shares of its Class A common stock. In
exchange, the Company granted 1,966,686 shares of restricted stock, including 460,777 performance
shares to eligible employees of the rank of senior vice president and above, and paid a total cash
amount of approximately $4 million (which amount includes applicable withholding taxes) to those
employees who received cash rather than shares of restricted stock. The restricted stock was
granted on February 25, 2004. Employees tendered approximately 79% of the options eligible to be
exchanged under the program.

The cost to the Company of the stock option exchange program was approximately $10 million, with a
2004 cash compensation expense of approximately $4 million and a non-cash compensation expense of
approximately $6 million to be expensed ratably over the three-year vesting period of the
restricted stock in the exchange.

In January 2004, the Compensation Committee of the board of directors of Charter approved Charter’s
Long-Term Incentive Program (“LTIP”), which is a program administered under the 2001 Stock
Incentive Plan. Under the LTIP, employees of Charter and its subsidiaries whose pay
classifications exceed a certain level are eligible to receive stock options, and more senior level
employees are eligible to receive stock options and performance shares. The stock options vest 25%
on each of the first four anniversaries of the date of grant. The performance shares vest on the
third anniversary of the grant date and shares of Charter Class A common stock are issued,
conditional upon Charter’s performance against financial performance measures established by
Charter’s management and approved by its board of directors as of the time of the award. Charter
granted 6.9 million shares in January 2004 under this program and recognized expense of $8 million
in the first three quarters of 2004. However, in the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company reversed
the entire $8 million of expense based on the Company’s assessment of the probability of achieving
the financial performance measures established by Charter and required to be met for the
performance shares to vest.

20. Special Charges

In the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company began a workforce reduction program and consolidation of
its operations from three divisions and ten regions into five operating divisions, eliminating
redundant practices and streamlining its management structure. The Company has recorded special
charges as a result of reducing its workforce and consolidating administrative offices in 2003 and
2004. The activity associated with this initiative is summarized in the table below.

For the year ended December 31, 2003, the severance and lease costs were offset by a $5 million
settlement from the Internet service provider Excite@Home related to the conversion of high-speed
data customers to Charter Pipeline service in 2001. For the year ended December 31, 2004, special
charges include approximately $85 million, representing the aggregate value of the Charter Class A
common stock and warrants to purchase Charter Class A common stock contemplated to be issued as
part of a settlement of consolidated federal and state class actions and federal derivative action
lawsuits and approximately $10 million of litigation costs related to the tentative settlement of a
national class action suit, all of which are subject to final documentation and court approval (see
Note 23). For the year ended December 31, 2004, special charges were offset by $3 million received
from a third party in settlement of a dispute.

21. Income Taxes

All operations are held through Charter Holdco and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Charter
Holdco and the majority of its subsidiaries are not subject to income tax. However, certain of
these subsidiaries are corporations and are subject to income tax. All of the taxable income,
gains, losses, deductions and credits of Charter Holdco are passed through to its members: Charter,
Charter Investment, Inc. (“Charter Investment”) and Vulcan Cable III Inc. (“Vulcan Cable”).
Charter is responsible for its share of taxable income or loss of Charter Holdco allocated to
Charter in accordance with the Charter Holdco limited liability company agreement (“LLC Agreement”)
and partnership tax rules and regulations.

The LLC Agreement provides for certain special allocations of net tax profits and net tax losses
(such net tax profits and net tax losses being determined under the applicable federal income tax
rules for determining capital accounts). Pursuant to the LLC Agreement, through the end of 2003,
net tax losses of Charter Holdco that would otherwise have been allocated to Charter based
generally on its percentage ownership of outstanding common units were allocated instead to
membership units held by Vulcan Cable and Charter Investment (the “Special Loss Allocations”) to
the extent of their respective capital account balances. After 2003, pursuant to the LLC
Agreement, net tax losses of Charter Holdco are to be allocated to Charter, Vulcan Cable and
Charter Investment based generally on their respective percentage ownership of outstanding common
units to the extent of their respective capital account balances. The LLC Agreement further
provides that, beginning at the time Charter Holdco generates net tax profits, the net tax profits
that would otherwise have been allocated to Charter based generally on its percentage ownership of
outstanding common membership units will instead generally be allocated to Vulcan Cable and Charter
Investment (the “Special Profit Allocations”). The Special Profit Allocations to Vulcan Cable and
Charter Investment will generally continue until the cumulative amount of the Special Profit
Allocations offsets the cumulative amount of the Special Loss Allocations. The amount and timing
of the Special Profit Allocations are subject to the potential application of, and interaction
with, the Curative Allocation Provisions described in the following paragraph. The LLC Agreement
generally provides that any additional net tax profits are to be allocated among the members of
Charter Holdco based generally on their respective percentage ownership of Charter Holdco common
membership units.

Because the respective capital account balance of each of Vulcan Cable and Charter Investment was
reduced to zero by December 31, 2002, certain net tax losses of Charter Holdco that were to be
allocated for 2002, 2003, 2004 and possibly later years (subject to
resolution of the issue described in Note 22) to Vulcan
Cable and Charter Investment instead have been and will be allocated to Charter (the “Regulatory Allocations”). The LLC
Agreement further provides that, to the extent possible, the effect of the Regulatory Allocations
is to be offset over time pursuant to certain curative allocation provisions (the “Curative
Allocation Provisions”) so that, after certain offsetting adjustments are made, each member’s
capital account balance is equal to the capital account balance such member would have had if the
Regulatory Allocations had not been part of the LLC Agreement. The cumulative amount of the actual
tax losses allocated to Charter as a result of the Regulatory Allocations through the year ended
December 31, 2004 is approximately $4.0 billion.

As a result of the Special Loss Allocations and the Regulatory Allocations referred to above, the
cumulative amount of losses of Charter Holdco allocated to Vulcan Cable and Charter Investment is
in excess of the amount that would have been allocated to such entities if the losses of Charter
Holdco had been allocated among its members in proportion to their respective percentage ownership
of Charter Holdco common membership units. The cumulative amount of such excess losses was
approximately $2.1 billion through December 31, 2003 and $1.0 billion through December 31, 2004.

CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2004, 2003 AND 2002

(dollars in millions, except where indicated)

In certain situations, the Special Loss Allocations, Special Profit Allocations, Regulatory
Allocations and Curative Allocation Provisions described above could result in Charter paying taxes
in an amount that is more or less than if Charter Holdco had allocated net tax profits and net tax
losses among its members based generally on the number of common membership units owned by such
members. This could occur due to differences in (i) the character of the allocated income (e.g.,
ordinary versus capital), (ii) the allocated amount and timing of tax depreciation and tax
amortization expense due to the application of section 704(c) under the Internal Revenue Code,
(iii) the potential interaction between the Special Profit Allocations and the Curative Allocation
Provisions, (iv) the amount and timing of alternative minimum taxes paid by Charter, if any, (v)
the apportionment of the allocated income or loss
among the states in which Charter Holdco does business, and (vi) future federal and state tax laws.
Further, in the event of new capital contributions to Charter Holdco, it is possible that the tax
effects of the Special Profit Allocations, Special Loss Allocations,
Regulatory Allocations and
Curative Allocation Provisions will change significantly pursuant to the provisions of the income
tax regulations
or the terms of a contribution agreement with respect to such
contribution. Such change could defer the actual tax benefits to be derived by Charter with
respect to the net tax losses allocated to it or accelerate the actual taxable income to Charter
with respect to the net tax profits allocated to it. As a result, it is possible under certain
circumstances, that Charter could receive future allocations of taxable income in excess of its
currently allocated tax deductions and available tax loss carryforwards. The ability to utilize
net operating loss carryforwards is potentially subject to certain limitations as discussed below.

In addition, under their exchange agreement with Charter, Vulcan Cable and Charter Investment may
exchange some or all of their membership units in Charter Holdco for Charter’s Class B common
stock, be merged with Charter, or be acquired by Charter in a non-taxable reorganization. If such
an exchange were to take place prior to the date that the Special Profit Allocation provisions had
fully offset the Special Loss Allocations, Vulcan Cable and Charter Investment could elect to cause
Charter Holdco to make the remaining Special Profit Allocations to Vulcan Cable and Charter
Investment immediately prior to the consummation of the exchange. In the event Vulcan Cable and
Charter Investment choose not to make such election or to the extent such allocations are not
possible, Charter would then be allocated tax profits attributable to the membership units received
in such exchange pursuant to the Special Profit Allocation provisions. Mr. Allen has generally
agreed to reimburse Charter for any incremental income taxes that Charter would owe as a result of
such an exchange and any resulting future Special Profit Allocations
to Charter. The ability of Charter to utilize net operating loss
carryforwards is potentially subject to certain limitations as
discussed below. If Charter were to become subject to certain
limitations (whether as a result of an exchange described above or
otherwise), and as a result were to owe taxes resulting from the
Special Profit Allocations, then Mr. Allen may not be obligated to
reimburse Charter for such income taxes.

For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company recorded deferred income tax
benefits as shown below. The income tax benefits were realized through reductions in the deferred
tax liabilities related to Charter’s investment in Charter Holdco, as well as the deferred tax
liabilities of certain of Charter’s indirect corporate subsidiaries. In 2003, Charter received tax
loss allocations from Charter Holdco. Previously, the tax losses had been allocated to Vulcan
Cable and Charter Investment in accordance with the Special Loss Allocations provided under the
Charter Holdco amended and restated limited liability company agreement. The Company does not
expect to recognize a similar benefit related to its investment in Charter Holdco after 2003 due to
limitations on its ability to offset future tax benefits against the remaining deferred tax
liabilities. However, the actual tax provision calculation in future periods will be the result of
current and future temporary differences, as well as future operating results.

As of December 31, 2004, the Company
    has deferred tax assets of $3.5 billion, which primarily relate to financial
    and tax losses allocated to Charter from Charter Holdco. The deferred tax
    assets include $2.1 billion of tax net operating loss carryforwards (generally
    expiring in years 2005 through 2024) of Charter and its indirect corporate
    subsidiaries. Valuation allowances of $3.2 billion exist with respect
    to these deferred tax assets.

The change of approximately
$1.9 billion in valuation allowance between the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, presented above, includes the
provision for valuation allowance, the impact of the decrease in deferred tax liabilities
and the impact of additional losses resulting from the cumulative effect of accounting change.

Full realization of the Company’s tax net operating losses is dependent on: (1) Charter and its
indirect corporate subsidiaries’ ability to generate future taxable income and (2) the absence of
certain future “ownership changes” of Charter’s common stock. An “ownership change” as defined in
the applicable federal income tax rules, would place significant limitations, on an annual basis,
on the use of such net operating losses to offset any future taxable income the Company may
generate. Such limitations, in conjunction with the net operating loss expiration provisions,
could effectively eliminate the Company’s ability to use a substantial portion of its net operating
losses to offset future taxable income. Future transactions and the timing of such transactions
could cause an ownership change. Such transactions include additional issuances of common stock by
the Company (including but not limited the

anticipated issuances of 150 million shares of common stock under the share lending agreement in
conjunction with the issuance of 5.875% convertible senior notes in November 2004 or upon future
conversion of Charter’s convertible senior notes), reacquisitions of the borrowed shares by
Charter, or acquisitions or sales of shares by certain holders of Charter’s shares, including
persons who have held, currently hold, or accumulate in the future five percent or more of
Charter’s outstanding stock (including upon an exchange by Paul Allen or his affiliates, directly
or indirectly, of membership units of Charter Holdco into CCI common stock). Many of the foregoing
transactions are beyond management’s control.

The total valuation allowance
for deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 was $3.2
billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets,
management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred
tax assets will be realized. Because of the uncertainties in projecting future taxable income of
Charter Holdco, valuation allowances have been established except for deferred benefits available
to offset certain deferred tax liabilities.

The Company is currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for the tax years ending
December 31, 1999 and 2000. Management does not expect the results of this examination to have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operation.

22. Related Party Transactions

The following sets forth certain transactions in which the Company and the directors, executive
officers and affiliates of the Company are involved. Unless otherwise disclosed, management
believes that each of the transactions described below was on terms no less favorable to the
Company than could have been obtained from independent third parties.

Charter is a holding company and its principal assets are its equity interest in Charter Holdco and
certain mirror notes payable by Charter Holdco to Charter and mirror preferred units held by
Charter, which have the same principal amount and terms as those of Charter’s convertible senior
notes and Charter’s outstanding preferred stock. In 2004, Charter Holdco paid to Charter $49
million related to interest on the mirror notes, and Charter Holdco paid an additional $4 million
related to dividends on the mirror preferred membership units. Further, during 2004 Charter Holdco
issued 7,252,818 common membership units to Charter in cancellation of $30 million principal amount
of mirror notes so as to mirror the issuance by Charter of Class A common stock in exchange for a
like principal amount of its outstanding convertible notes.

Charter is a party to management arrangements with Charter Holdco and certain of its subsidiaries.
Under these agreements, Charter provides management services for the cable systems owned or
operated by its subsidiaries. The management services include such services as centralized
customer billing services, data processing and related support, benefits administration and
coordination of insurance coverage and self-insurance programs for medical, dental and workers’
compensation claims. Costs associated with providing these services are billed and charged
directly to the Company’s operating subsidiaries and are included within operating costs in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Such costs totaled $202 million, $210 million
and $176 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. All other
costs incurred on the behalf of Charter’s operating subsidiaries are considered a part of the
management fee and are recorded as a component of selling, general and administrative expense, in
the accompanying consolidated financial statements. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003
and 2002, the management fee charged to the Company’s operating subsidiaries approximated the
expenses incurred by Charter Holdco and Charter on behalf of the Company’s operating subsidiaries.
The credit facilities of the Company’s operating subsidiaries prohibit payments of management fees
in excess of 3.5% of revenues until repayment of the outstanding indebtedness. In the event any
portion of the management fee due and payable is not paid, it is deferred by Charter and accrued as
a liability of such subsidiaries. Any deferred amount of the management fee will bear interest at
the rate of 10% per year, compounded annually, from the date it was due and payable until the date
it is paid.

Mr. Allen, the controlling shareholder of Charter, and a number of his affiliates have interests in
various entities that provide services or programming to Charter’s subsidiaries. Given the diverse
nature of Mr. Allen’s investment activities and interests, and to avoid the possibility of future
disputes as to potential business, Charter and Charter Holdco, under the terms of their respective
organizational documents, may not, and may not allow their subsidiaries to engage in any business
transaction outside the cable transmission business except for certain existing approved
investments. Should Charter or Charter Holdco or any of their subsidiaries wish to pursue, or
allow their subsidiaries to pursue, a business transaction outside of this scope, it must first
offer Mr. Allen the opportunity to pursue the particular business transaction. If he decides not
to pursue the business transaction and consents to Charter or its subsidiaries engaging in the
business transaction, they will be able to do so. The cable transmission business means the
business of transmitting video, audio, including telephony, and data over cable systems owned,
operated or managed by Charter, Charter Holdco or any of their subsidiaries from time to time.

Mr. Allen or his affiliates own or have owned equity interests or warrants to purchase equity
interests in various entities with which the Company does business or which provides it with
products, services or programming. Among these entities are TechTV L.L.C. (“TechTV”), Oxygen Media
Corporation (“Oxygen Media”), Digeo, Inc., Click2learn, Inc., Trail Blazer Inc., Action Sports
Cable Network (“Action Sports”) and Microsoft Corporation. In addition, Mr. Allen and William
Savoy, a former Charter director, were directors of USA Networks, Inc. (“USA Networks”), who
operates the USA Network, The Sci-Fi Channel, Trio, World News International and Home Shopping
Network, owning approximately 5% and less than 1%, respectively, of the common stock of USA
Networks. In 2002, Mr. Allen and Mr. Savoy sold their common stock and are no longer directors of
the USA Network. In May 2004, TechTV was sold to an unrelated third party. Mr. Allen owns 100% of
the equity of Vulcan Ventures Incorporated (“Vulcan Ventures”) and Vulcan Inc. and is the president
of Vulcan Ventures. Ms. Jo Allen Patton is a director and the President and Chief Executive
Officer of Vulcan Inc. and is a director and Vice President of Vulcan Ventures. Mr. Lance Conn is
Executive Vice President of Vulcan Inc. and Vulcan Ventures. Mr. Savoy was a vice president and a
director of Vulcan Ventures until his resignation in September 2003 and he resigned as a director
of Charter in April 2004. The various cable, media, Internet and telephony companies in which Mr.
Allen has invested may mutually benefit one another. The Company can give no assurance, nor should
you expect, that any of these business relationships will be successful, that the Company will
realize any benefits from these relationships or that the Company will enter into any business
relationships in the future with Mr. Allen’s affiliated companies.

Mr. Allen and his affiliates have made, and in the future likely will make, numerous investments
outside of the Company and its business. The Company cannot assure that, in the event that the
Company or any of its subsidiaries enter into transactions in the future with any affiliate of Mr.
Allen, such transactions will be on terms as favorable to the Company as terms it might have
obtained from an unrelated third party. Also, conflicts could arise with respect to the allocation
of corporate opportunities between the Company and Mr. Allen and his affiliates. The Company has
not instituted any formal plan or arrangement to address potential conflicts of interest.

High Speed Access Corp.

(“High Speed Access”) was a provider of high-speed Internet access services
over cable modems. During the period from 1997 to 2000, certain Charter entities entered into
Internet-access related service agreements, and both Vulcan Ventures, an entity owned by Mr. Allen,
and Charter Holdco made equity investments in High Speed Access.

On February 28, 2002, Charter’s subsidiary, CC Systems, purchased from High Speed Access the
contracts and associated assets, and assumed related liabilities, that served the Company’s
customers, including a customer contact center, network operations center and provisioning
software. Immediately prior to the asset purchase, Vulcan Ventures beneficially owned
approximately 37%, and the Company beneficially owned approximately 13%, of the common stock of
High Speed Access (including the shares of common stock which could be acquired upon conversion of
the Series D preferred stock, and upon exercise of the warrants owned by Charter Holdco).
Following the consummation of the asset purchase, neither the Company nor Vulcan Ventures
beneficially owned any securities of, or were otherwise affiliated with, High Speed Access.

The Company receives or will receive programming for broadcast via its cable systems from TechTV
(now G4), USA Networks, Oxygen Media, Trail Blazers Inc. and Action Sports. The Company pays a fee
for the programming service generally based on the number of customers receiving the service. Such
fees for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were each less than 1% of total operating
expenses with the exception of USA Networks which was 2%, 2% and 2% of total operating expenses for
the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In addition, the Company receives
commissions from USA Networks for home shopping sales generated by its customers. Such revenues
for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were less than 1% of total revenues. On
November 5, 2002, Action Sports announced that it was discontinuing its business. The Company
believes that the failure of Action Sports will not materially affect the Company’s business or
results of operations.

Tech TV.

The Company receives from TechTV programming for distribution via its cable system
pursuant to an affiliation agreement. The affiliation agreement provides, among other things, that
TechTV must offer Charter

F-41


CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2004, 2003 AND 2002

(dollars in millions, except where indicated)

certain terms and conditions that are no less favorable in the affiliation agreement than are given
to any other distributor that serves the same number of or fewer TechTV viewing customers.
Additionally, pursuant to the affiliation agreement, the Company was entitled to incentive payments
for channel launches through December 31, 2003.

In March 2004, Charter Holdco entered into agreements with Vulcan Programming and TechTV, which
provide for (i) Charter Holdco and TechTV to amend the affiliation agreement which, among other
things, revises the description of the TechTV network content, provides for Charter Holdco to waive
certain claims against TechTV relating to alleged breaches of the affiliation agreement and
provides for TechTV to make payment of outstanding launch receivables due to Charter Holdco under
the affiliation agreement, (ii) Vulcan Programming to pay approximately $10 million and purchase
over a 24-month period, at fair market rates, $2 million of advertising time across various cable
networks on Charter cable systems in consideration of the agreements, obligations, releases and
waivers under the agreements and in settlement of the aforementioned claims and (iii) TechTV to be
a provider of content relating to technology and video gaming for Charter’s interactive television
platforms through December 31, 2006 (exclusive for the first year). For the year ended December
31, 2004, the Company recognized approximately $5 million of the Vulcan Programming payment as an
offset to programming expense and paid approximately $2 million to Tech TV under the affiliation
agreement.

Oxygen.

Concurrently with the execution of a carriage agreement, Charter Holdco entered into an
equity issuance agreement pursuant to which Oxygen Media LLC’s (“Oxygen”) parent company, Oxygen
Media Corporation (“Oxygen Media”), granted a subsidiary of Charter Holdco a warrant to purchase
2.4 million shares of common stock of Oxygen Media for an exercise price of $22.00 per share. In
February 2005, the warrant expired unexercised. Charter Holdco was also to receive unregistered
shares of Oxygen Media common stock with a guaranteed fair market value on the date of issuance of
$34 million, on or prior to February 2, 2005 with the exact date to be determined by Oxygen Media,
but this commitment was later revised as discussed below.

The Company recognizes the guaranteed value of the investment over the life of the carriage
agreement as a reduction of programming expense. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002, the Company recorded approximately $13 million, $9 million, and $6 million, respectively, as
a reduction of programming expense. The carrying value of the Company’s investment in Oxygen was
approximately $32 million and $19 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

In August 2004, Charter Holdco and Oxygen entered into agreements that amended and renewed the
carriage agreement. The amendment to the carriage agreement (a) revises the number of the
Company’s customers to which Oxygen programming must be carried and for which the Company must pay,
(b) releases Charter Holdco from any claims related to the failure to achieve distribution
benchmarks under the carriage agreement, (c) requires Oxygen to make payment on outstanding
receivables for marketing support fees due to the Company under the affiliation agreement; and (d)
requires that Oxygen provide its programming content to the Company on economic terms no less
favorable than Oxygen provides to any other cable or satellite operator having fewer subscribers
than the Company. The renewal of the carriage agreement (a) extends the period that the Company
will carry Oxygen programming to its customers through January 31, 2008, and (b) requires license
fees to be paid based on customers receiving Oxygen programming, rather than for specific customer
benchmarks.

In August 2004, Charter Holdco and Oxygen also amended the equity issuance agreement to provide for
the issuance of 1 million shares of Oxygen Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $33.10
per share plus accrued dividends to Charter Holdco on February 1, 2005 in place of the $34 million
of unregistered shares of Oxygen Media common stock. Oxygen Media
will deliver these shares in March 2005. The preferred stock is convertible into common stock after December 31, 2007 at a conversion
ratio, the numerator of which is the liquidation preference and the denominator which is the fair
market value per share of Oxygen Media common stock on the conversion date.

Digeo, Inc

. In March 2001, Charter Ventures and Vulcan Ventures Incorporated formed DBroadband
Holdings, LLC for the sole purpose of purchasing equity interests in Digeo. In connection with the
execution of the broadband carriage agreement, DBroadband Holdings, LLC purchased an equity
interest in Digeo funded by contributions from

Vulcan Ventures Incorporated. The equity interest is subject to a priority return of capital to
Vulcan Ventures up to the amount contributed by Vulcan Ventures on Charter Ventures’ behalf. After
Vulcan Ventures recovers its amount contributed and any cumulative loss allocations, Charter
Ventures has a 100% profit interest in DBroadband Holdings, LLC. Charter Ventures is not required
to make any capital contributions, including capital calls, and may require Vulcan Ventures,
through January 24, 2004, to make certain additional contributions through DBroadband Holdings, LLC
to acquire additional equity in Digeo as necessary to maintain Charter Ventures’ pro rata interest
in Digeo in the event of certain future Digeo equity financings by the founders of Digeo. These
additional equity interests are also subject to a priority return of capital to Vulcan Ventures up
to amounts contributed by Vulcan Ventures on Charter Ventures’ behalf. DBroadband Holdings, LLC is
therefore not included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Pursuant to an amended
version of this arrangement, in 2003, Vulcan Ventures contributed a total of $29 million to Digeo,
$7 million of which was contributed on Charter Ventures’ behalf, subject to Vulcan Ventures’
aforementioned priority return. Since the formation of DBroadband Holdings, LLC, Vulcan Ventures
has contributed approximately $56 million on Charter Ventures’ behalf.

On June 30, 2003, Charter Holdco entered into an agreement with Motorola, Inc. for the purchase of
100,000 digital video recorder (“DVR’’) units. The software for these DVR units is being supplied
by Digeo Interactive, LLC under a license agreement entered into in April 2004. Under the license
agreement Digeo Interactive granted to Charter Holdco the right to use Digeo’s proprietary software
for the number of DVR units that Charter deploys from a maximum of 10 headends through year-end
2004. This maximum number of headends was increased from 10 to 15 pursuant to a letter agreement
executed on June 11, 2004 and the date for entering into license agreements for units deployed was
extended to June 30, 2005. The number of headends was increased again from 15 to 20 pursuant to a
letter agreement dated August 4, 2004, from 20 to 30 pursuant to a letter agreement dated September
28, 2004 and from 30 to 50 headends by a letter agreement in February 2005. The license granted
for each unit deployed under the agreement is valid for five years. In addition, Charter will pay
certain other fees including a per-headend license fee and maintenance fees. Maximum license and
maintenance fees during the term of the agreement are expected to be approximately $7 million.
The agreement provides that Charter is entitled to receive contract terms, considered on the whole,
and license fees, considered apart from other contract terms, no less favorable than those accorded
to any other Digeo customer. Charter paid $474,400 in license and maintenance fees in
2004.

In April 2004, the Company launched DVR service (using units containing the Digeo software) in its
Rochester, Minnesota market using a broadband media center that is an integrated set-top terminal
with a cable converter, DVR hard drive and connectivity to other consumer electronics devices (such
as stereos, MP3 players, and digital cameras).

In May 2004, Charter Holdco entered into a binding term sheet with Digeo Interactive for the
development, testing and purchase of 70,000 Digeo PowerKey DVR units. The term sheet provided that
the parties would proceed in good faith to negotiate, prior to year-end 2004, definitive agreements
for the development, testing and purchase of the DVR units and that the parties would enter into a
license agreement for Digeo’s proprietary software on terms substantially similar to the terms of
the license agreement described above. In November 2004, Charter Holdco and Digeo Interactive
executed the license agreement and in December 2004, the parties executed the purchase agreement,
each on terms substantially similar to the binding term sheet. Product development and testing is
continuing. Total purchase price and license and maintenance fees during the term of the
definitive agreements are expected to be approximately $41 million. The definitive agreements are
terminable at no penalty to Charter in certain circumstances.

A wholly owned subsidiary of Digeo, Digeo Interactive, provides interactive channel (i-channel)
service to Charter on a month-to-month basis. In the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
Charter paid Digeo Interactive $3 million, $4 million and $3 million, respectively, for customized
development of i-channels and an interactive “toolkit” to enable Charter to develop interactive
local content.

On January 10, 2003, the Company signed an agreement to carry two around-the-clock, high-definition
networks, HDNet and HDNet Movies. HDNet Movies delivers a commercial-free schedule of full-length
feature films converted from 35mm to high-definition, including titles from an extensive library of
Warner Bros. films. HDNet Movies will feature a mix of theatrical releases, made-for-TV movies,
independent films and shorts. The HDNet

channel features a variety of HDTV programming, including live sports, sitcoms, dramas, action
series, documentaries, travel programs, music concerts and shows, special events, and news features
including HDNet World Report. HDNet also offers a selection of classic and recent television
series. The Company paid HDNet and HDNet Movies approximately $0.6 million in 2004. The Company
believes that entities controlled by Mr. Cuban owned
approximately 81% of HDNet as of December 31,
2004. As of December 31, 2004, the Company believes that Mark Cuban, co-founder and president of
HDNet, owned approximately 6.2% of the total common equity in Charter based on a Schedule 13G filed
with the SEC on May 21, 2003.

Certain related parties, including members of the board of directors and officers, hold interests
in the Company’s senior convertible debt and senior notes and discount notes of the Company’s
subsidiary of approximately $59.6 million of face value at December 31, 2004.

As part of the acquisition of the cable systems owned by Bresnan Communications Company Limited
Partnership in February 2000, CC VIII, LLC, Charter’s indirect limited liability company
subsidiary, issued, after adjustments, 24,273,943 Class A preferred membership units (collectively,
the “CC VIII interest”) with a value and an initial capital account of approximately $630 million
to certain sellers affiliated with AT&T Broadband, subsequently owned by Comcast Corporation (the
“Comcast sellers”). While held by the Comcast sellers, the CC VIII interest was entitled to a 2%
priority return on its initial capital account and such priority return was entitled to
preferential distributions from available cash and upon liquidation of CC VIII. While held by the
Comcast sellers, the CC VIII interest generally did not share in the profits and losses of CC VIII.
Mr. Allen granted the Comcast sellers the right to sell to him the CC VIII interest for
approximately $630 million plus 4.5% interest annually from February 2000 (the “Comcast put
right”). In April 2002, the Comcast sellers exercised the Comcast put right in full, and this
transaction was consummated on June 6, 2003. Accordingly, Mr. Allen has become the holder of the
CC VIII interest, indirectly through an affiliate. Consequently, subject to the matters referenced
in the next paragraph, Mr. Allen generally thereafter will be allocated his pro rata share (based
on number of membership interests outstanding) of profits or losses of CC VIII. In the event of a
liquidation of CC VIII, Mr. Allen would be entitled to a priority distribution with respect to the
2% priority return (which will continue to accrete). Any remaining distributions in liquidation
would be distributed to CC V Holdings, LLC and Mr. Allen in proportion to CC V Holdings, LLC’s
capital account and Mr. Allen’s capital account (which will equal the initial capital account of
the Comcast sellers of approximately $630 million, increased or decreased by Mr. Allen’s pro rata
share of CC VIII’s profits or losses (as computed for capital account purposes) after June 6,
2003). The limited liability company agreement of CC VIII does not provide for a mandatory
redemption of the CC VIII interest.

An issue has arisen as to whether the documentation for the Bresnan transaction was correct and
complete with regard to the ultimate ownership of the CC VIII interest following consummation of
the Comcast put right. Specifically, under the terms of the Bresnan transaction documents that
were entered into in June 1999, the Comcast sellers originally would have received, after
adjustments, 24,273,943 Charter Holdco membership units, but due to an FCC regulatory issue raised
by the Comcast sellers shortly before closing, the Bresnan transaction was modified to provide that
the Comcast sellers instead would receive the preferred equity interests in CC VIII represented by
the CC VIII interest. As part of the last-minute changes to the Bresnan transaction documents, a
draft amended version of the Charter Holdco limited liability company agreement was prepared, and
contract provisions were drafted for that agreement that would have required an automatic exchange
of the CC VIII interest for 24,273,943 Charter Holdco membership units if the Comcast sellers
exercised the Comcast put right and sold the CC VIII interest to Mr. Allen or his affiliates.
However, the provisions that would have required this automatic exchange did not appear in the
final version of the Charter Holdco limited liability company agreement that was delivered and
executed at the closing of the Bresnan transaction. The law firm that prepared the documents for
the Bresnan transaction brought this matter to the attention of Charter and representatives of Mr.
Allen in 2002.

Thereafter, the board of directors of Charter formed a Special Committee (currently comprised of
Messrs. Merritt, Tory and Wangberg) to investigate the matter and take any other appropriate action
on behalf of Charter with respect to this matter. After conducting an investigation of the
relevant facts and circumstances, the Special Committee determined that a “scrivener’s error” had
occurred in February 2000 in connection with the preparation of the last-minute revisions to the
Bresnan transaction documents and that, as a result, Charter should seek the reformation of the
Charter Holdco limited liability company agreement, or alternative relief, in order to restore and

F-44

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2004, 2003 AND 2002

(dollars in millions, except where indicated)

ensure the obligation that the CC VIII interest be automatically exchanged for Charter Holdco
units. The Special Committee further determined that, as part of such contract reformation or
alternative relief, Mr. Allen should be required to contribute the CC VIII interest to Charter
Holdco in exchange for 24,273,943 Charter Holdco membership units. The Special Committee also
recommended to the board of directors of Charter that, to the extent the contract reformation is
achieved, the board of directors should consider whether the CC VIII interest should ultimately be
held by Charter Holdco or Charter Holdings or another entity owned directly or indirectly by them.

Mr. Allen disagrees with the Special Committee’s determinations described above and has so notified
the Special Committee. Mr. Allen contends that the transaction is accurately reflected in the
transaction documentation and contemporaneous and subsequent company public disclosures.

The parties engaged in a process of non-binding mediation to seek to resolve this matter, without
success. The Special Committee is evaluating what further actions or processes it may undertake to
resolve this dispute. To accommodate further deliberation, each party has agreed to refrain from
initiating legal proceedings over this matter until it has given at least ten days’ prior notice to
the other. In addition, the Special Committee and Mr. Allen have determined to utilize the
Delaware Court of Chancery’s program for mediation of complex business disputes in an effort to
resolve the CC VIII interest dispute. If the Special Committee and Mr. Allen are unable to reach a
resolution through that mediation process or to agree on an alternative dispute resolution process,
the Special Committee intends to seek resolution of this dispute through judicial proceedings in an
action that would be commenced, after appropriate notice, in the Delaware Court of Chancery against
Mr. Allen and his affiliates seeking contract reformation, declaratory relief as to the respective
rights of the parties regarding this dispute and alternative forms of legal and equitable relief.
The ultimate resolution and financial impact of the dispute are not determinable at this time.

(dollars in millions, except where indicated)

The following items are not included in the contractual obligation table due to various factors
discussed below. However, the Company incurs these costs as part of its operations:

•

The Company also rents utility poles used in its operations. Generally, pole rentals
are cancelable on short notice, but the Company anticipates that such rentals will recur.
Rent expense incurred for pole rental attachments for the years ended December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, was $43 million, $40 million and $41 million, respectively.

•

The Company pays franchise fees under multi-year franchise agreements based on a
percentage of revenues earned from video service per year. The Company also pays other
franchise related costs, such as public education grants under multi-year agreements.
Franchise fees and other franchise-related costs included in the accompanying statement of
operations were $164 million, $162 million and $160 million for the years ended December
31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

•

The Company also has $166 million in letters of credit, primarily to its various
worker’s compensation, property casualty and general liability carriers as collateral for
reimbursement of claims. These letters of credit reduce the amount the Company may borrow
under its credit facilities.

Litigation

Fourteen putative federal class action lawsuits (the “Federal Class Actions”) were filed against
Charter and certain of its former and present officers and directors in various jurisdictions
allegedly on behalf of all purchasers of Charter’s securities during the period from either
November 8 or November 9, 1999 through July 17 or July 18, 2002. Unspecified damages were sought
by the plaintiffs. In general, the lawsuits alleged that Charter utilized misleading accounting
practices and failed to disclose these accounting practices and/or issued false and misleading
financial statements and press releases concerning Charter’s operations and prospects. The Federal
Class Actions were specifically and individually identified in public filings made by Charter prior
to the date of this annual report.

In October 2002, Charter filed a motion with the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (the
“Panel”) to transfer the Federal Class Actions to the Eastern District of Missouri. On March 12,
2003, the Panel transferred the six Federal Class Actions not filed in the Eastern District of
Missouri to that district for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings with the eight
Federal Class Actions already pending there. The Panel’s transfer order assigned the Federal Class
Actions to Judge Charles A. Shaw. By virtue of a prior court order, StoneRidge Investment Partners
LLC became lead plaintiff upon entry of the Panel’s transfer order. StoneRidge subsequently filed
a Consolidated Amended Complaint. The Court subsequently consolidated the Federal Class Actions
into a single action (the “Consolidated Federal Class Action”) for pretrial purposes. On June 19,
2003, following a status and scheduling conference with the parties, the Court issued a Case
Management Order setting forth a schedule for the pretrial phase of the Consolidated Class Action.
Motions to dismiss the Consolidated Amended Complaint were filed. On February 10, 2004, in
response to a joint motion made by StoneRidge and defendants, Charter, Vogel and Allen, the court
entered an order providing, among other things, that: (1) the parties who filed such motion engage
in a mediation within ninety (90) days; and (2) all proceedings in the Consolidated Federal Class
Actions were stayed until May 10, 2004. On May 11, 2004, the Court extended the stay in the
Consolidated Federal Class Action for an additional sixty (60) days. On July 12, 2004, the parties
submitted a joint motion to again extend the stay, this time until September 10, 2004. The Court
granted that extension on July 20, 2004. On August 5, 2004, Stoneridge, Charter and the individual
defendants who were the subject of the suit entered into a Memorandum of Understanding setting
forth agreements in principle to settle the Consolidated Federal Class Action. These parties
subsequently entered into Stipulations of Settlement dated as of January 24, 2005 (described more
fully below) which incorporate the terms of the August 5, 2004 Memorandum of Understanding.

On September 12, 2002, a shareholders derivative suit (the “State Derivative Action”) was filed in
the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis, State of Missouri (the “Missouri State Court”) against
Charter and its then current directors, as well as its former auditors. A substantively identical
derivative action was later filed and consolidated into the State Derivative Action. The
plaintiffs allege that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties by

F-46


CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2004, 2003 AND 2002

(dollars in millions, except where indicated)

failing to establish and maintain adequate internal controls and procedures. Unspecified damages,
allegedly on Charter’s behalf, were sought by the plaintiffs.

On March 12, 2004, an action substantively identical to the State Derivative Action was filed in
the Missouri State Court, against Charter and certain of its current and former directors, as well
as its former auditors. The plaintiffs in that case alleged that the individual defendants
breached their fiduciary duties by failing to establish and maintain adequate internal controls and
procedures. Unspecified damages, allegedly on Charter’s behalf, were sought by plaintiffs. On
July 14, 2004, the Court consolidated this case with the State Derivative Action.

Separately, on February 12, 2003, a shareholders derivative suit (the “Federal Derivative Action”)
was filed against Charter and its then current directors in the United States District Court for
the Eastern District of Missouri. The plaintiff in that suit alleged that the individual
defendants breached their fiduciary duties and grossly mismanaged Charter by failing to establish
and maintain adequate internal controls and procedures.

As noted above, Charter entered into Memoranda of Understanding on August 5, 2004 setting forth
agreements in principle regarding settlement of the Consolidated Federal Class Action, the State
Derivative Action(s) and the Federal Derivative Action (the “Actions”). Charter and various other
defendants in those actions subsequently entered into Stipulations of Settlement dated as of
January 24, 2005, setting forth a settlement of the Actions in a manner consistent with the terms
of the Memorandum of Understanding. The Stipulations of Settlement, along with the various
supporting documentation, were filed with the Court on February 2, 2005. The Settlements provide
that, in exchange for a release of all claims by plaintiffs against Charter and its former and
present officers and directors named in the Actions, Charter will pay to the plaintiffs a
combination of cash and equity collectively valued at $144 million, which will include the fees and
expenses of plaintiffs’ counsel. Of this amount, $64 million will be paid in cash (by Charter’s
insurance carriers) and the balance will be paid in shares of Charter Class A common stock having
an aggregate value of $40 million and ten-year warrants to purchase shares of Charter Class A
common stock having an aggregate warrant value of $40 million. The warrants would have an exercise
price equal to 150% of the fair market value (as defined) of Charter Class A common stock as of the
date of the entry of the order of final judgment approving the settlement. In addition, Charter
expects to issue additional shares of its Class A common stock to its insurance carrier having an
aggregate value of $5 million. As a result, in the second quarter of 2004, the Company recorded a
$149 million litigation liability within other long-term liabilities and a $64 million insurance
receivable as part of other non-current assets on its consolidated balance sheet and an $85 million
special charge on its consolidated statement of operations. Additionally, as part of the
settlements, Charter will also commit to a variety of corporate governance changes, internal
practices and public disclosures, some of which have already been undertaken and none of which are
inconsistent with measures Charter is taking in connection with the recent conclusion of the SEC
investigation described below. Documents related to the settlement of the Actions have now been
executed and filed. On February 15, 2005, the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Missouri gave preliminary approval to the settlement of the Actions. The settlement of
each of the lawsuits remains conditioned upon, among other things, final judicial approval of the
settlements following notice to the class, and dismissal, with prejudice, of the consolidated
derivative actions now pending in Missouri State Court, which are related to the Federal Derivative
Action.

In addition to the Federal Class Actions, the State Derivative Action (s), the new Missouri State
Court derivative action and the Federal Derivative Action, six putative class action lawsuits have
been filed against Charter and certain of its then current directors and officers in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware (the “Delaware Class Actions”). The lawsuits were filed after
the filing of a 13D amendment by Mr. Allen indicating that he was exploring a number of possible
alternatives with respect to restructuring or expanding his ownership interest in Charter. Charter
believes the plaintiffs speculated that Mr. Allen might have been contemplating an unfair bid for
shares of Charter or some other sort of going private transaction on unfair terms and generally
alleged that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by participating in or acquiescing to
such a transaction. The lawsuits, which are substantively identical, were brought on behalf of
Charter’s securities holders as of July 29, 2002, and sought unspecified damages and possible
injunctive relief. However, no such transaction by Mr. Allen has been presented. On April 30,
2004, orders of dismissal without prejudice were entered in each of the Delaware Class Actions.

In August 2002, Charter became aware of a grand jury investigation being conducted by the U.S.
Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Missouri into certain of its accounting and reporting
practices, focusing on how Charter reported customer numbers and its reporting of amounts received
from digital set-top terminal suppliers for advertising. The U.S. Attorney’s Office has publicly
stated that Charter is not a target of the investigation. Charter was also advised by the U.S.
Attorney’s Office that no current officer or member of its board of directors is a target of the
investigation. On July 24, 2003, a federal grand jury charged four former officers of Charter with
conspiracy and mail and wire fraud, alleging improper accounting and reporting practices focusing
on revenue from digital set-top terminal suppliers and inflated customer account numbers. Trial
was set for February 7, 2005. Subsequently, each of the indicted former officers pled guilty to
single conspiracy counts related to the original mail and wire fraud charges and are awaiting
sentencing. The Company is fully cooperating with the investigation.

On November 4, 2002, Charter received an informal, non-public inquiry from the staff of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The SEC issued a formal order of investigation dated
January 23, 2003, and subsequently served document and testimony subpoenas on Charter and a number
of its former employees. The investigation and subpoenas generally concerned Charter’s prior
reports with respect to its determination of the number of customers, and various of its accounting
policies and practices including its capitalization of certain expenses and dealings with certain
vendors, including programmers and digital set-top terminal suppliers. On July 27, 2004, the SEC
and Charter reached a final agreement to settle the investigation. In the Settlement Agreement and
Cease and Desist Order, Charter agreed to entry of an administrative order prohibiting any future
violation of United States securities laws and requiring certain other remedial internal practices
and public disclosures. Charter neither admitted nor denied any wrongdoing, and the SEC assessed
no fine against Charter.

Charter is generally required to indemnify each of the named individual defendants in connection
with the matters described above pursuant to the terms of its bylaws and (where applicable) such
individual defendants’ employment agreements. In accordance with these documents, in connection
with the pending grand jury investigation, the now settled SEC investigation and the above
described lawsuits, some of Charter’s current and former directors and current and former officers
have been advanced certain costs and expenses incurred in connection with their defense. On
February 22, 2005, Charter filed suit against four of its former officers who were indicted in the
course of the grand jury investigation. These suits seek to recover the legal fees and other
related expenses advanced to these individuals by Charter for the grand jury investigation, SEC
investigation and class action and related lawsuits.

In October 2001, two customers, Nikki Nicholls and Geraldine M. Barber, filed a class action suit
against Charter Holdco in South Carolina Court of Common Pleas (the “South Carolina Class Action”),
purportedly on behalf of a class of Charter Holdco’s customers, alleging that Charter Holdco
improperly charged them a wire maintenance fee without request or permission. They also claimed
that Charter Holdco improperly required them to rent analog and/or digital set-top terminals even
though their television sets were “cable ready.” A substantively identical case was filed in the
Superior Court of Athens — Clarke County, Georgia by Emma S. Tobar on March 26, 2002 (the “Georgia
Class Action”), alleging a nationwide class for these claims. Charter Holdco removed the South
Carolina Class Action to the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina in
November 2001, and moved to dismiss the suit in December 2001. The federal judge remanded the case
to the South Carolina Court of Common Pleas in August 2002 without ruling on the motion to dismiss.
The plaintiffs subsequently moved for a default judgment, arguing that upon return to state court,
Charter Holdco should have, but did not file a new motion to dismiss. The state court judge
granted the plaintiff’s motion over Charter Holdco’s objection in September 2002. Charter Holdco
immediately appealed that decision to the South Carolina Court of Appeals and the South Carolina
Supreme Court, but those courts ruled that until a final judgment was entered against Charter
Holdco, they lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal.

In January 2003, the Court of Common Pleas granted the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification.
In October and November 2003, Charter Holdco filed motions (a) asking that court to set aside the
default judgment, and (b) seeking dismissal of plaintiffs’ suit for failure to state a claim. In
January 2004, the Court of Common Pleas granted in part and denied in part Charter Holdco’s motion
to dismiss for failure to state a claim. It also took under advisement Charter Holdco’s motion to
set aside the default judgment. In April 2004, the parties to both the Georgia and South Carolina
Class Actions participated in a mediation. The mediator made a proposal to the parties to settle
the lawsuits. In May 2004, the parties accepted the mediator’s proposal and reached a tentative
settlement,

F-48


CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2004, 2003 AND 2002

(dollars in millions, except where indicated)

subject to final documentation and court approval. As a result of the tentative settlement, we
recorded a special charge of $9 million in our consolidated statement of operations in the first
quarter of 2004. On July 8, 2004, the Superior Court of Athens — Clarke County, Georgia granted a
motion to amend the Tobar complaint to add Nicholls, Barber and April Jones as plaintiffs in the
Georgia Class Action and to add any potential class members in South Carolina. The court also
granted preliminary approval of the proposed settlement on that date. On August 2, 2004, the
parties submitted a joint request to the South Carolina Court of Common Pleas to stay the South
Carolina Class Action pending final approval of the settlement and on August 17, 2004, that court
granted the parties’ request. On November 10, 2004, the court granted final approval of the
settlement, rejecting positions advanced by two objectors to the settlement. On December 13, 2004
the court entered a written order formally approving that settlement. On January 11, 2005, certain
class members appealed the order entered by the Georgia court. That appeal was dismissed on or
about February 3, 2005. Additionally, one of the objectors to this settlement recently filed a
similar, but not identical, lawsuit.

Furthermore, Charter is also party to, other lawsuits and claims that arose in the ordinary course
of conducting its business. In the opinion of management, after taking into account recorded
liabilities, the outcome of these other lawsuits and claims are not expected to have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations or its
liquidity.

Regulation in the Cable Industry

The operation of a cable system is extensively regulated by the Federal Communications Commission
(“FCC”), some state governments and most local governments. The FCC has the authority to enforce
its regulations through the imposition of substantial fines, the issuance of cease and desist
orders and/or the imposition of other administrative sanctions, such as the revocation of FCC
licenses needed to operate certain transmission facilities used in connection with cable
operations. The 1996 Telecom Act altered the regulatory structure governing the nation’s
communications providers. It removed barriers to competition in both the cable television market
and the local telephone market. Among other things, it reduced the scope of cable rate regulation
and encouraged additional competition in the video programming industry by allowing local telephone
companies to provide video programming in their own telephone service areas.

The 1996 Telecom Act required the FCC to undertake a number of implementing rulemakings. Moreover,
Congress and the FCC have frequently revisited the subject of cable regulation. Future legislative
and regulatory changes could adversely affect the Company’s operations.

24. Employee Benefit Plan

The Company’s employees may participate in the Charter Communications, Inc. 401(k) Plan. Employees
that qualify for participation can contribute up to 50% of their salary, on a pre-tax basis,
subject to a maximum contribution limit as determined by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company
matches 50% of the first 5% of participant contributions. The Company made contributions to the
401(k) plan totaling $7 million, $7 million and $8 million for the years ended December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively.

25. Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued the revised SFAS No. 123,

Share —
Based Payment

, which addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions in which a
company receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of that company or (b)
liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company’s equity instruments or that may be
settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. This statement will be effective for the
Company beginning July 1, 2005. Because Charter adopted the fair value recognition provisions of
SFAS No. 123 on January 1, 2003, the Company does not expect this revised standard to have a
material impact on its financial statements.

Charter does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting
pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s accompanying financial
statements.
