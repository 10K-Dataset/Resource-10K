Other Information

On September 14, 2005 (the “Petition Date”), we
and substantially all of our subsidiaries filed voluntary
petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United
States Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the
United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New
York (the “Bankruptcy Court”). No assurance can be
given as to what values, if any, will be ascribed in our
bankruptcy proceedings to our various pre-petition liabilities,
common stock and other securities. We believe that our currently
outstanding common stock will have no value and will be canceled
under any plan of reorganization we propose and that the value
of our various pre-petition liabilities and other securities is
highly speculative. Accordingly, we urge that caution be
exercised with respect to existing and future investments in any
of these liabilities or securities. In addition, trading of our
common stock on the New York Stock Exchange was suspended on
October 13, 2005, and our common stock was delisted from
the New York Stock Exchange on November 30, 2005.

PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

General Description

We are a major air carrier that provides scheduled air
transportation for passengers and cargo throughout the United
States and around the world. As of December 31, 2005, we
(including our wholly-owned subsidiary, Comair, Inc.
(“Comair”)), served 144 domestic cities in
47 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the
U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as 59 cities in 41
foreign countries. With our domestic and international codeshare
partners, our route network covers 228 domestic cities in
49 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the
U.S. Virgin Islands, and 197 cities in 87 foreign
countries. We are managed as a single business unit.

For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
passenger revenues accounted for 90%, 91% and 91% of our
consolidated operating revenues, respectively, and cargo
revenues and other sources accounted for 10%, 9% and 9% of our
consolidated operating revenues, respectively. In 2005, our
operations in North America, the Atlantic, Latin America and the
Pacific accounted for 80%, 14%, 5% and 1%, respectively, of our
consolidated operating revenues. In 2004, our operations in
North America, the Atlantic, Latin America and the Pacific
accounted for 81%, 14%, 4% and 1%, respectively, of our
consolidated operating revenues. In 2003, our operations in
North America, the Atlantic, Latin America and the Pacific
accounted for 83%, 12%, 4% and 1%, respectively, of our
consolidated operating revenues.



We are incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. Our
principal executive offices are located at Hartsfield-Jackson
Atlanta International Airport in Atlanta, Georgia (the
“Atlanta Airport”). Our telephone number is
(404)

715-2600,

and our Internet address is

www.delta.com

.

See “— Risk Factors Relating to Delta” and
“— Risk Factors Relating to the Airline
Industry” in Item 1A and “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” in Item 7 for additional discussion of
trends and factors affecting us and our industry.

Airline Operations

An important characteristic of our route network is the hub
system we operate at airports in Atlanta, Cincinnati, New
York — John F. Kennedy International Airport
(“JFK”) and Salt Lake City. Each of these hub
operations includes Delta flights that gather and distribute
traffic from markets in the geographic region surrounding the
hub to other major cities and to other Delta hubs. Our hub
system also provides passengers with access to our principal
international gateways in Atlanta and JFK.

We are strengthening our domestic hubs and growing our
international schedules. As of December 1, 2005 we reduced
capacity by approximately 25% at Cincinnati, with the intention
of increasing the percentage of local Cincinnati traffic from
approximately 35% to nearly 50%. To respond to increased demand
for service to emerging business and leisure destinations, we
are increasing international capacity by approximately 25% by
the summer of 2006 in comparison to our schedule in the summer
of 2005, with a focus on routes to Europe, Latin America and the
Caribbean. For example, we, along with our contract carriers on
certain routes, have added or announced plans to add more than
50 new international routes in the last year, including over 20
since November 2005. In 2006, service will be added to new
destinations in countries such as Denmark, Ecuador, Germany,
Honduras, Hungary, Israel, Jamaica, Mexico, Ukraine, and United
Kingdom, some of which service is subject to government approval.

In addition, we announced in October 2005 that Song’s
service will merge into Delta’s in May 2006.
Song

®

was started in April 2003 as a low-fare operation primarily
offering flights between cities in the Northeastern United
States, Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Florida leisure destinations.
We plan to add 26 First Class seats to each of the 48 B757-200
aircraft now operating in Song’s service; convert an
additional 50 or more Mainline aircraft to two-class service;
and expand personal digital in-flight entertainment system to
the converted aircraft. Our plan is to grow this service,
referred to as Song service, to all transcontinental Mainline
routes beginning in the fall of 2006 and all routes over
1,750 miles by the end of 2007.

As briefly discussed below, other key characteristics of our
route network include our alliances with foreign airlines; the
Delta Connection Program; the Delta Shuttle; and our domestic
marketing alliances, including with Continental Airlines, Inc.
(“Continental”) and Northwest Airlines, Inc.
(“Northwest”).

International Alliances

We have formed bilateral and multilateral marketing alliances
with foreign airlines to improve our access to international
markets. These arrangements can include codesharing, frequent
flyer benefits, shared or reciprocal access to passenger
lounges, joint promotions and other marketing agreements.

Our international codesharing agreements enable us to market and
sell seats to an expanded number of international destinations.
Under international codesharing arrangements, we and the foreign
carriers publish our respective airline designator codes on a
single flight operation, thereby allowing us and the foreign
carrier to offer joint service with one aircraft rather than
operating separate services with two aircraft. These
arrangements typically allow us to sell seats on the foreign
carrier’s aircraft that are marketed under our
“DL” designator code and permit the foreign airline to
sell seats on our aircraft that are marketed under the foreign
carrier’s two-letter designator code. We have international
codeshare arrangements in effect with Aerolitoral, Aeromexico,
Air France (and certain of Air France’s affiliated carriers
operating flights beyond Paris), Air Jamaica, Alitalia, Avianca,
China Airlines, China Southern, CSA Czech Airlines, El Al Israel
Airlines, Korean Air, Royal Air Maroc and South African Airways.

Delta, Aeromexico, Air France, Alitalia, Continental, CSA Czech
Airlines, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines (“KLM”), Korean Air
and Northwest are members of the SkyTeam international airline
alliance. One goal of SkyTeam is to link the route networks of
the member airlines, providing opportunities for increased



connecting traffic while offering enhanced customer service
through mutual codesharing arrangements, reciprocal frequent
flyer and lounge programs and coordinated cargo operations. In
2002, we, Air France, Alitalia, CSA Czech Airlines and Korean
Air received limited antitrust immunity from the
U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”). The
grant of antitrust immunity enables us and our immunized
partners to offer a more integrated route network, and develop
common sales, marketing and discount programs for customers. In
December 2005, the DOT denied our application for six-way
transatlantic antitrust immunity to add Northwest and KLM to the
antitrust immunity we have with Air France, Alitalia, and CSA
Czech Airlines.

Delta Connection Program

The Delta Connection program is our regional carrier service,
which feeds traffic to our route system through contracts with
regional air carriers that operate flights serving passengers
primarily in small and medium-sized cities. The program enables
us to increase the number of flights in certain locations, to
better match capacity with demand and to preserve our presence
in smaller markets. Our Delta Connection network operates the
largest number of regional jets in the United States.

We have contractual arrangements with seven regional carriers to
operate regional jet and, in certain cases, turbo-prop aircraft
using our “DL” designator code. Our wholly-owned
subsidiary, Comair, operates all of its flights under our code.
Atlantic Southeast Airlines, Inc. (“ASA”), which we
sold to SkyWest Holdings, Inc. (“SkyWest”) in
September 2005, continues to operate all of its flights under
our code. In addition, we have agreements with the following
regional carriers that operate some of their flights using our
code: SkyWest Airlines, Inc. (“SkyWest Airlines”), a
subsidiary of SkyWest; Chautauqua Airlines, Inc.
(“Chautauqua”), a subsidiary of Republic Airways
Holdings, Inc. (“Republic Holdings”); Shuttle America
Corporation (“Shuttle America”), a subsidiary of
Republic Holdings; Freedom Airlines, Inc. (“Freedom”),
a subsidiary of Mesa Air Group, Inc.; and American Eagle
Airlines, Inc. (“Eagle”).

We generally pay ASA, SkyWest Airlines, Chautauqua, Shuttle
America and Freedom amounts, as defined in their respective
contract carrier agreements, which are based on a determination
of their respective cost of operating those flights and other
factors intended to approximate market rates for those services.
Our arrangement with Eagle, which is limited to certain flights
operated to and from the Los Angeles International Airport, as
well as a portion of the flights operated using our code by
SkyWest Airlines, are structured as revenue proration
agreements. These prorate arrangements establish a fixed dollar
or percentage division of revenues for tickets sold to
passengers traveling on connecting flight itineraries. For
additional information regarding our contract carrier
agreements, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Delta Shuttle

The Delta Shuttle is our high frequency service targeted to
Northeast business travelers. It provides nonstop, hourly
service on business days between New York — LaGuardia
Airport (“LaGuardia”) and both Boston —
Logan International Airport (“Logan”) and
Washington, D.C. — Ronald Reagan National Airport
(“National”).

Domestic Alliances

We have entered into marketing alliances with
(1) Continental and Northwest (including regional carriers
affiliated with each) and (2) Alaska Airlines and Horizon
Air Industries, both of which include mutual codesharing and
reciprocal frequent flyer and airport lounge access
arrangements. These marketing relationships are designed to
permit the carriers to retain their separate identities and
route networks while increasing the number of domestic and
international connecting passengers using the carriers’
route networks. Currently, Delta, Continental and Northwest are
allowed to codeshare on a combined 5,200 flights.

Regulatory Matters

The DOT and the Federal Aviation Administration
(“FAA”) exercise regulatory authority over air
transportation in the United States. The DOT has authority to
issue certificates of public convenience and necessity required
for airlines to provide domestic air transportation. An air
carrier that the DOT finds “fit” to operate is given
unrestricted authority to operate domestic air transportation
(including the carriage of



passengers and cargo). Except for constraints imposed by
Essential Air Service regulations, which are applicable to
certain small communities, airlines may terminate service to a
city without restriction.

The DOT has jurisdiction over certain economic and consumer
protection matters such as unfair or deceptive practices or
methods of competition, advertising, denied boarding
compensation, baggage liability and disabled passenger
transportation. The DOT also has authority to review certain
joint venture agreements between major carriers. The FAA has
primary responsibility for matters relating to air carrier
flight operations, including airline operating certificates,
control of navigable air space, flight personnel, aircraft
certification and maintenance, and other matters affecting air
safety.

Authority to operate international routes and international
codesharing arrangements is regulated by the DOT and by the
governments of the foreign countries involved. International
route awards are also subject to the approval of the President
of the United States for conformance with national defense and
foreign policy objectives.

The Transportation Security Administration and U.S. Customs
and Border Protection, divisions of the Department of Homeland
Security, are responsible for certain civil aviation security
matters, including passenger and baggage screening at
U.S. airports and international passenger prescreening
prior to entry into or departure from the United States.

Airlines are also subject to various other federal, state, local
and foreign laws and regulations. The U.S. Department of
Justice (“DOJ”) has jurisdiction over airline
competition matters. The U.S. Postal Service has authority
over certain aspects of the transportation of mail. Labor
relations in the airline industry are generally governed by the
Railway Labor Act. Environmental matters are regulated by
various federal, state, local and foreign governmental entities.
Privacy of passenger and employee data is regulated by domestic
and foreign laws and regulations.

Fares and Rates

Airlines set ticket prices in most domestic and international
city pairs without governmental regulation, and the industry is
characterized by significant price competition. Certain
international fares and rates are subject to the jurisdiction of
the DOT and the governments of the foreign countries involved.
Most of our tickets are sold by travel agents, and fares are
subject to commissions, overrides and discounts paid to travel
agents, brokers and wholesalers.

In January 2005, we announced the expansion of our
SimpliFares

®

initiative throughout the 48 contiguous United States. An
important part of our transformation plan, SimpliFares is a
fundamental change in our domestic pricing structure which is
intended to better meet customer needs; to simplify our
business; and to help us achieve a lower cost structure. Under
SimpliFares, we lowered unrestricted fares on some routes by as
much as 50%; reduced the number of fare categories; implemented
a fare cap that we have adjusted because of high fuel prices;
and eliminated the Saturday-night stay requirement that existed
for certain fares. While SimpliFares has initially had a
negative impact on our operating results, which may continue for
some period, we believe it will provide net benefits to us over
the longer term by stimulating traffic; improving productivity
by simplifying our product; and increasing customer usage of
delta.com, our lowest cost distribution channel.

Route Authority

Our flight operations are authorized by certificates of public
convenience and necessity and, to a limited extent, by
exemptions issued by the DOT. The requisite approvals of other
governments for international operations are controlled by
bilateral agreements with, or permits or approvals issued by,
foreign countries. Because international air transportation is
governed by bilateral or other agreements between the United
States and the foreign country or countries involved, changes in
United States or foreign government aviation policies could
result in the alteration or termination of such agreements,
diminish the value of our international route authorities or
otherwise affect our international operations. Bilateral
agreements between the United States and various foreign
countries served by us are subject to renegotiation from time to
time.

Certain of our international route and codesharing authorities
are subject to periodic renewal requirements. We request
extension of these authorities when and as appropriate. While
the DOT usually



renews temporary authorities on routes where the authorized
carrier is providing a reasonable level of service, there is no
assurance of this result. Dormant route authority may not be
renewed in some cases, especially where another
U.S. carrier indicates a willingness to provide service.

Competition

We face significant competition with respect to routes, services
and fares. Our domestic routes are subject to competition from
both new and existing carriers, many of which have lower costs
than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations
served by us. We also compete with all-cargo carriers, charter
airlines, regional jet operators and, particularly on our
shorter routes, surface transportation. International marketing
alliances formed by domestic and foreign carriers, including the
Star Alliance (among United Airlines, Lufthansa German Airlines
and others) and the oneworld alliance (among American Airlines,
British Airways and others), have significantly increased
competition in international markets. Through marketing and
codesharing arrangements with U.S. carriers, foreign
carriers have obtained access to interior U.S. passenger
traffic. Similarly, U.S. carriers have increased their
ability to sell international transportation such as
transatlantic services to and beyond European cities through
alliances with international carriers.

The continuing growth of low-cost carriers, including Southwest,
AirTran and JetBlue, in the United States has placed significant
competitive pressure on us and other network carriers. In
addition, other hub-and-spoke carriers such as US Airways and
United Airlines have reduced their costs through Chapter 11
reorganization. Our ability to compete effectively with low-cost
carriers, restructured carriers and other airlines depends, in
significant part, on our ability to achieve a cost structure
that is competitive with those carriers.

We regularly monitor competitive developments in the airline
industry and evaluate our strategic alternatives. These
strategic alternatives include, among other things, internal
growth, codesharing arrangements, marketing alliances, joint
ventures, and mergers and acquisitions. Our evaluations involve
internal analysis and, where appropriate, discussions with third
parties.

In 2005, based on our ongoing strategic review of our business,
we announced improvements to our business plan designed to
strengthen our ability to compete with our most direct
competitors, which are primarily either newer carriers or
recently reorganized carriers that have low-cost structures. See
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operation — Our Business
Plan” in Item 7 for additional information about our
business plan.

Airport Access

Operations at three major U.S. airports and certain foreign
airports served by us are regulated by governmental entities
through “slot” allocations. Each slot represents the
authorization to land at, or take off from, the particular
airport during a specified time period.

In the United States, the FAA currently regulates slot
allocations at JFK and LaGuardia in New York and National in
Washington, D.C. Our operations at those three airports
generally require slot allocations. Under legislation enacted by
Congress, slot rules will be phased out at JFK and LaGuardia by
2007.

We currently have sufficient slot authorizations to operate our
existing flights, and have generally been able to obtain slots
to expand our operations and to change our schedules. There is
no assurance, however, that we will be able to obtain slots for
these purposes in the future because, among other reasons, slot
allocations are subject to changes in governmental policies.

Possible Legislation or DOT Regulation

A number of Congressional bills and proposed DOT regulations
have been considered in recent years to address airline
competition issues. Some of these proposals would require large
airlines with major operations at certain airports to divest or
make available to other airlines slots, gates, facilities and
other assets at those airports. Other measures would limit the
service or pricing responses of major carriers that appear to
target new entrant airlines. In addition, concerns about airport
congestion issues have caused the DOT and FAA to consider
various proposals for access to certain airports, including
“congestion-based” landing fees and programs that
would withdraw slots from existing carriers and reallocate those
slots (either by lottery or



auction) to the highest bidder or to carriers with little or no
current presence at such airports. These proposals, if enacted,
could negatively impact our existing services and our ability to
respond to competitive actions by other airlines.

Fuel

Our results of operations are significantly impacted by changes
in the price and availability of aircraft fuel. The following
table shows our aircraft fuel consumption and costs for
2003-2005.

(1)

Net of fuel hedge gains under our fuel hedging program of
    $105 million and $152 million for 2004 and 2003,
    respectively.

Our aircraft fuel purchase contracts do not provide material
protection against price increases or assure the availability of
our fuel supplies. We purchase most of our aircraft fuel from
petroleum refiners under contracts that establish the price
based on various market indices. We also purchase aircraft fuel
on the spot market, from off-shore sources and under contracts
that permit the refiners to set the price.

While we had no fuel hedge contracts in place during 2005, we
periodically enter into heating and crude oil derivative
contracts to attempt to reduce our exposure to changes in fuel
prices. Information regarding our fuel hedging program, and
Bankruptcy Court and Creditors Committee approvals for fuel
hedging, is set forth under “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Market Risks Associated with Financial
Instruments — Aircraft Fuel Price Risk” in
Item 7 and in Notes 5 and 6 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. There can be no assurance
that fuel hedging transactions can be completed at levels
authorized by the Bankruptcy Court or Creditors Committee.

Although we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of
aircraft fuel, it is impossible to predict the future
availability or price of aircraft fuel. Political disruptions or
wars involving oil-producing countries, changes in government
policy concerning aircraft fuel production, transportation or
marketing, changes in aircraft fuel production capacity,
environmental concerns, natural disasters and other
unpredictable events may result in fuel supply shortages and
fuel price increases in the future.

Employee Matters

Railway Labor Act

Our relations with labor unions in the United States are
governed by the Railway Labor Act. Under the Railway Labor Act,
a labor union seeking to represent an unrepresented craft or
class of employees is required to file with the National
Mediation Board (“NMB”) an application alleging a
representation dispute, along with authorization cards signed by
at least 35% of the employees in that craft or class. The NMB
then investigates the dispute and, if it finds the labor union
has obtained a sufficient number of authorization cards,
conducts an election to determine whether to certify the labor
union as the collective bargaining representative of that craft
or class. Under the NMB’s usual rules, a labor union will
be certified as the representative of the employees in a craft
or class only if more than 50% of those employees vote for union
representation. A certified labor union then enters into a
collective bargaining agreement with the employer.

Under the Railway Labor Act, a collective bargaining agreement
between an airline and a labor union does not expire, but
instead becomes amendable as of a stated date. Either party may
request the NMB to appoint a federal mediator to participate in
the negotiations for a new or amended agreement. If no agreement
is reached in mediation, the NMB may determine, at any time,
that an impasse exists and offer binding arbitration. If either
party rejects binding arbitration, a

30-day

“cooling
off” period begins. At the end



of this

30-day

period,
the parties may engage in “self help,” unless the
President of the United States appoints a Presidential Emergency
Board (“PEB”) to investigate and report on the
dispute. The appointment of a PEB maintains the “status
quo” for an additional 60 days. If the parties do not
reach agreement during this period, the parties may then engage
in “self help.” “Self help” includes, among
other things, a strike by the union or the imposition of
proposed changes to the collective bargaining agreement by the
airline. Congress and the President have the authority to
prevent “self help” by enacting legislation which,
among other things, imposes a settlement on the parties.

Collective Bargaining

At December 31, 2005, we had a total of approximately
55,700 full-time equivalent employees. Approximately 17% of
these employees are represented by unions. The following table
presents certain information concerning the union representation
of our domestic employees.

We have been and continue to be in negotiations with the Air
Line Pilots Association, International (“ALPA”), the
collective bargaining representative of Delta’s pilots, to
reduce our pilot labor costs as required under our business
plan. Because we were not able to reach a consensual agreement
with ALPA, on November 1, 2005, we filed a motion with the
Bankruptcy Court under Section 1113 of the Bankruptcy Code
to reject our collective bargaining agreement with ALPA. In
December 2005, we reached an interim agreement with ALPA, which
was approved by the Bankruptcy Court and ratified by
Delta’s pilots. The interim agreement provides, among other
things, for a reduction in (1) hourly pilot wage rates of
14% and (2) other pilot pay and cost items equivalent to
approximately an additional 1% hourly wage reduction. These
reductions became effective December 15, 2005, and remain
in effect until the earlier of (1) our entering into a
comprehensive agreement with ALPA on changes to the pilot
collective bargaining agreement; or (2) the time that the
neutral panel described below issues its final order as to
whether Delta is authorized to reject the pilot collective
bargaining agreement under the legal standards of
Section 1113 of the Bankruptcy Code.

The interim agreement provides that Delta and ALPA will seek to
negotiate a tentative comprehensive agreement, and establishes
the following time limits for reaching that agreement
(“March 2006 time limits”): (1) March 1,
2006, for the parties’ negotiating committees to reach a
tentative agreement; (2) March 8, 2006, for approval
by the ALPA Master Executive Council; and
(3) March 22, 2006, for pilot ratification. Because
the first of the March 2006 time limits was not met, pursuant to
our interim agreement with ALPA, the matter at issue in
Delta’s Section 1113 motion has been submitted to a
mutually agreed upon, neutral panel of three experts in airline
labor matters for a binding decision on that issue. The interim
agreement provides that the panel’s decision must be issued
no later than 45 days after the failure to meet the
applicable March 2006 time limit, which is April 15, 2006.
We cannot predict the outcome of the neutral panel’s
decision as to whether or not we would be authorized to reject
the collective bargaining agreement.



Comair has reached agreements with ALPA, which represents
Comair’s pilots, and with the International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers (“IAM”), which
represents Comair’s maintenance employees, to reduce the
labor costs of both of these employee groups. These agreements
are, however, conditioned on Comair’s obtaining a specified
level of labor cost reductions under its collective bargaining
agreement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters
(“IBT”), representing Comair’s flight attendants.
Because Comair was not able to reach a consensual agreement with
the IBT, on February 22, 2006, Comair filed a motion with
the Bankruptcy Court under Section 1113 of the Bankruptcy
Code to reject Comair’s collective bargaining agreement
with the IBT. This motion is scheduled for hearing in the
Bankruptcy Court on March 27, 2006.

See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information about these subjects.

Labor unions periodically engage in organizing efforts to
represent various groups of employees of Delta and Comair who
are not represented for collective bargaining purposes. The
timing and outcome of these organizing efforts cannot presently
be determined.

Environmental Matters

The Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 recognizes the rights
of operators of airports with noise problems to implement local
noise abatement programs so long as such programs do not
interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or
the national air transportation system. It generally provides
that local noise restrictions on Stage 3 aircraft first
effective after October 1, 1990, require FAA approval.
While we have had sufficient scheduling flexibility to
accommodate local noise restrictions in the past, our operations
could be adversely impacted if locally-imposed regulations
become more restrictive or widespread.

On December 1, 2003, the FAA published a Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking (“NPRM”) to adopt the International Civil
Aviation Organization’s (“ICAO”) Chapter 4
noise standard, which is known as the Stage 4 standard in
the United States. This standard would require that all new
commercial jet aircraft designs certificated on or after
January 1, 2006 be at least ten decibels quieter than the
existing Stage 3 noise standard requires. This new standard
would not apply to existing aircraft or to the continued
production of aircraft types already certificated. Comments on
the NPRM were filed by various parties on March 1, 2004.
All new aircraft that we have on order will meet the proposed
Stage 4 standard. Accordingly, the proposed rule is not
expected to have any significant impact on us, and we and the
U.S. airline industry generally supported the adoption of
the NPRM. The FAA has not yet taken final action.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the
“EPA”) is authorized to regulate aircraft emissions.
Our aircraft comply with the applicable EPA standards. On
November 17, 2005, the EPA issued a final rule adopting
emissions control standards for aircraft engines previously
adopted by the ICAO. These standards apply to newly designed
engines certified after December 31, 2003, and align the
U.S. aircraft engine emission standards with existing
international standards. The rule, as adopted, is not expected
to have a material impact on us. However, a group of state and
local air regulators have filed a petition for review in the
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
challenging the rule on a number of grounds. We support the rule
as adopted and are monitoring these proceedings in the Circuit
Court.

In December 2004, Miami-Dade County filed a lawsuit in Florida
Circuit Court against us, seeking injunctive relief and alleging
responsibility for past and future environmental cleanup costs
and civil penalties for environmental conditions at Miami
International Airport. This lawsuit is related to several other
actions filed by the County against other parties to recover
environmental remediation costs incurred at the airport. This
lawsuit is currently stayed as a result of our Chapter 11
proceedings. If the stay is lifted, we plan to vigorously defend
this lawsuit. An adverse decision in this case could result in
substantial damages against us. Although the ultimate outcome of
this matter cannot be predicted with certainty, management
believes that the resolution of this matter will not have a
material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

We have been identified by the EPA as a potentially responsible
party (a “PRP”) with respect to certain Superfund
Sites, and have entered into consent decrees regarding some of
these sites. Our alleged disposal volume at each of these sites
is small when compared to the total contributions of all PRPs at
each



site. We are aware of soil and/or ground water contamination
present on our current or former leaseholds at several domestic
airports. To address this contamination, we have a program in
place to investigate and, if appropriate, remediate these sites.
Although the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be
predicted with certainty, management believes that the
resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse
effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Frequent Flyer Program

We have a frequent flyer program, the
SkyMiles

®

program, offering incentives to increase travel on Delta. This
program allows participants to earn mileage for travel awards by
flying on Delta, Delta Connection carriers and participating
airlines. Mileage credit may also be earned by using certain
services offered by program partners such as credit card
companies, hotels, car rental agencies, telecommunication
services and internet services. In addition, individuals and
companies may purchase mileage credits. We reserve the right to
terminate the program with six months advance notice, and to
change the program’s terms and conditions at any time
without notice.

Mileage credits can be redeemed for free or upgraded air travel
on Delta and participating airline partners, for membership in
our Crown Room Club and for other program partner awards. Travel
awards are subject to certain transfer restrictions and
capacity-controlled seating. In some cases, blackout dates may
apply. Miles will not expire as long as, at least once every
three years, the participant (1) takes a qualifying flight
on Delta or a Delta Connection carrier; (2) earns miles
through one of our program partners; or (3) redeems miles
for any program award.

We record a liability for the estimated incremental cost of
flight awards which are earned under our SkyMiles frequent flyer
program and expected to be redeemed for travel on Delta or other
airline partners. Our incremental costs include (1) our
system average cost per passenger for fuel, food and other
direct passenger costs for awards to be redeemed on Delta and
(2) contractual costs for awards to be redeemed on partner
airlines. The liability is recorded in accounts payable,
deferred credits and other accrued liabilities on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets. We periodically record adjustments
to this liability in other operating expenses on our
Consolidated Statements of Operations based on awards earned,
awards redeemed, changes in our estimated incremental costs and
changes to the SkyMiles program.

At December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we had recorded a
liability of $291 million, $211 million and
$229 million, respectively, for expected redemptions of
7 million, 6 million and 10 million travel
awards, respectively.

Frequent flyer program participants redeemed 3.3 million,
2.9 million, and 2.8 million round-trip award tickets
on Delta or any of our partner airlines in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Approximately 9%, 8% and 9% of our total revenue
passenger miles were flown by participants using award tickets
in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We believe that the
relatively low percentage of passenger miles flown by SkyMile
members traveling on program awards and the restrictions applied
to travel awards minimize the displacement of revenue passengers.

Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program

We participate in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (“CRAF”)
program, which permits the U.S. military to use the
aircraft and crew resources of participating U.S. airlines
during airlift emergencies, national emergencies or times of
war. We have agreed to make available under the CRAF program,
during the period



October 1, 2005 through September 30, 2006, a portion
of our international range aircraft. As of December 31,
2005, the following numbers of our aircraft are available for
CRAF activation:

The CRAF program has only been activated twice, both times at
the Stage I level, since it was created in 1951.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

Risk Factors Relating to Delta

We filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the
    Bankruptcy Code on September 14, 2005 and are subject to
    the risks and uncertainties associated with Chapter 11
    proceedings.

For the duration of our Chapter 11 proceedings, our
operations, including our ability to execute our business plan,
are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with
bankruptcy. Risks and uncertainties associated with our
Chapter 11 proceedings include the following:

These risks and uncertainties could affect our business and
operations in various ways. For example, negative events or
publicity associated with our Chapter 11 proceedings could
adversely affect our sales of tickets and the relationship with
our customers, as well as with vendors and employees, which in
turn could adversely affect our operations and financial
condition, particularly if the Chapter 11 proceedings are
protracted. Also, transactions outside the ordinary course of
business are subject to the prior approval of the Bankruptcy
Court, which may limit our ability to respond timely to certain
events or take advantage of certain opportunities.

Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with our
Chapter 11 proceedings, the ultimate impact that events
that occur during these proceedings will have on our business,
financial condition and results of



operations cannot be accurately predicted or quantified, and
there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a
going concern.

Employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions may
    adversely affect our operations.

Our business is labor intensive, utilizing large numbers of
pilots, flight attendants and other personnel. Approximately 17%
of our workforce is unionized. Strikes or labor disputes with
our and our affiliates’ unionized employees may adversely
affect our ability to conduct our business. Relations between
air carriers and labor unions in the United States are governed
by the Railway Labor Act, which provides that a collective
bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does
not expire, but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date.
The Railway Labor Act generally prohibits strikes or other types
of self-help actions both before and after a collective
bargaining agreement becomes amendable, unless and until the
collective bargaining processes required by the Railway Labor
Act have been exhausted.

We have been and continue to be in negotiations with ALPA to
reduce our pilot labor costs as required under our business
plan. Because we were not able to reach a consensual agreement
with ALPA, on November 1, 2005, we filed a motion with the
Bankruptcy Court under Section 1113 of the Bankruptcy Code
to reject our collective bargaining agreement with ALPA. In
December 2005, we reached an interim agreement with ALPA, which
was approved by the Bankruptcy Court and ratified by
Delta’s pilots. The interim agreement provides, among other
things, for a reduction in (1) hourly pilot wage rates of
14% and (2) other pilot pay and cost items equivalent to
approximately an additional 1% hourly wage reduction. These
reductions became effective December 15, 2005, and remain
in effect until the earlier of (1) our entering into a
comprehensive agreement with ALPA on changes to the pilot
collective bargaining agreement; or (2) the time that the
neutral panel described below issues its final order as to
whether Delta is authorized to reject the pilot collective
bargaining agreement under the legal standards of
Section 1113.

The interim agreement provides that Delta and ALPA will seek to
negotiate a tentative comprehensive agreement, and establishes
the March 2006 time limits: (1) March 1, 2006, for the
parties’ negotiating committees to reach a tentative
agreement; (2) March 8, 2006, for approval by the ALPA
Master Executive Council; and (3) March 22, 2006, for
pilot ratification. Because the first of the March 2006 time
limits was not met, pursuant to our interim agreement with ALPA,
the matter at issue in Delta’s Section 1113 motion has
been submitted to a mutually agreed upon, neutral panel of three
experts in airline labor matters for a binding decision on that
issue. The interim agreement provides that the panel’s
decision must be issued no later than 45 days after the
failure to meet the applicable March 2006 time limit, which is
April 15, 2006. We cannot predict the outcome of the
neutral panel’s decision as to whether or not we would be
authorized to reject the collective bargaining agreement.

If the neutral panel determines that we are authorized to reject
the collective bargaining agreement, ALPA has threatened to
initiate a strike, which we believe should not be permitted
under the Railway Labor Act. However, we cannot predict the
outcome of any effort we might undertake to obtain court relief
to prevent or stop a strike or other forms of work disruption. A
strike or other form of significant work disruption by ALPA
would likely have a material negative impact on our ability to
continue operating our business and would trigger an event of
default under our Post-Petition Financing Agreements if all or
substantially all of our flight and other operations are
suspended for longer than two days. As a result, we could be
required to cease operations permanently.

In addition, if we or our affiliates are unable to reach
agreement with any of our unionized work groups on future
negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining
agreements, or if additional segments of our workforce become
unionized, we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages,
subject to the requirements of the Railway Labor Act and the
Bankruptcy Code.

We have substantial liquidity needs and face significant
    liquidity pressure.

At December 31, 2005, our cash and cash equivalents and
short-term investments were $2.0 billion. This amount
reflects the net proceeds from our sale of ASA to SkyWest and
the net proceeds from our borrowings under our post-petition
financing agreements (“Post-Petition Financing
Agreements”), which consist of a Secured Super-Priority

Debtor-in

-Possession
Credit Facility from a syndicate of lenders (the “DIP
Credit Facility”) and a modification agreement with
American Express Travel Related Services



Company, Inc. (“Amex”) and American Express Bank,
F.S.B. that modified existing agreements with Amex under which
Amex purchases SkyMiles from us (the “Amex Post-Petition
Facility”).

We have substantial liquidity needs in the operation of our
business and face significant liquidity challenges due to
historically high aircraft fuel prices, low passenger mile
yields, credit card processor holdbacks and cash reserves and
other cost pressures. Accordingly, we believe that our cash and
cash equivalents and short-term investments will remain under
pressure during 2006 and thereafter. Because substantially all
of our assets are encumbered and our Post-Petition Financing
Agreements contain restrictions against additional borrowing, we
believe we will not be able to obtain any material amount of
additional debt financing during our Chapter 11 proceedings.

Our Post-Petition Financing Agreements include financial
    and other covenants that impose substantial restrictions on our
    financial and business operations.

The Post-Petition Financing Agreements include financial
covenants that, among other things, require us to
(1) maintain unrestricted funds in an amount not less than
$750 million through May 31, 2006; $1 billion at
all times from June 1, 2006 through November 30, 2006;
$750 million at all times from December 1, 2006
through February 28, 2007; and $1 billion at all times
thereafter and (2) achieve certain levels of EBITDAR
(earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and
aircraft rent, as defined). For additional information about our
financial covenants, see Note 8 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our ability to comply with the EBITDAR covenant depends on our
ability to achieve the targeted benefits of our business plan in
certain timeframes. If we are unable to achieve the targeted
benefits that are contemplated in our business plan, we may not
be able to comply with our EBITDAR covenant.

In addition, our Post-Petition Financing Agreements restrict our
ability to, among other things, incur or secure additional
indebtedness, make investments, sell assets, pay dividends or
repurchase stock. If we fail to comply with the covenants in the
Post-Petition Financing Agreements and are unable to obtain a
waiver or amendment, an event of default would result under the
Post-Petition Financing Agreements.

The Post-Petition Financing Agreements contain other events of
default customary for

debtor-in

-possession
financings of this type, including cross defaults to each other
and certain change of control events. Additionally, the
suspension of all or substantially all of our flight and other
operations for longer than two days would, in most
circumstances, including as the result of our inability to
operate because of a strike by our pilots, be an event of
default. If an event of default were to occur, the lenders could
declare outstanding borrowings under these agreements
immediately due and payable. As a result, we could be required
to cease operations permanently.

We have experienced significant losses in recent years,
    which have had a material adverse effect on our financial
    condition. The implementation of our business plan requires that
    we make significant changes to our business.

We recorded a consolidated net loss of $3.8 billion for the
year ended December 31, 2005. During the five years ended
December 31, 2005, we reported an aggregate consolidated
net loss of approximately $12.3 billion. As reflected by
our Chapter 11 filing, these losses are not sustainable.

During the last several years, we implemented profit improvement
initiatives, which became the basis for our transformation plan
announced in late 2004 to address the conditions that led to
these losses. Our transformation plan has a goal of providing us
with approximately $5 billion in annual benefits by the end
of 2006 (as compared to 2002), primarily through cost
reductions. We are on track to obtain the full $5 billion
in benefits by the end of 2006. As of December 31, 2005, we
had implemented initiatives intended to achieve approximately
90% of these benefits.

The benefits we are realizing under our transformation plan are,
however, being outpaced and masked by historically high aircraft
fuel prices. We continue to operate in a weak pricing
environment, which limits our ability to increase fares to
offset high fuel costs. Accordingly, we must make additional
substantial changes in our business to further reduce our cost
structure and increase our revenues in order to maintain
adequate liquidity and achieve long-term viability. In the
context of our Chapter 11 proceedings, we have adopted a
business plan to target the delivery of an additional
$3 billion in annual benefits by the end of 2007.



We cannot assure you that we will achieve the targeted benefits
under our business plan or that these benefits, even if
achieved, will be adequate for us to maintain financial
viability. In addition, our business plan involves significant
change to our business. We cannot assure you that we will be
successful in implementing the plan. In addition, the
implementation of key elements of the plan, such as employee job
reductions, may have an adverse impact on our business and
results of operations, particularly in the near term.
Furthermore, our existing international operations and plans for
expansion of our international operations under our business
plan could be adversely affected by factors such as reversals or
delays in the opening of foreign markets, currency and political
risks, taxation and changes in international government
regulation of our operations, including the ability to obtain or
retain needed route authorities and/or slots.

Our business is dependent on the price and availability of
    aircraft fuel. Continued periods of historically high fuel costs
    will continue to materially adversely affect our operating
    results. Likewise, significant disruptions in the supply of
    aircraft fuel would materially adversely affect our operations
    and operating results.

Our operating results are significantly impacted by changes in
the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Fuel prices
increased substantially in 2004 and 2005 and remained at
historically high levels at the end of 2005. In 2005, our
average fuel price per gallon rose 47% to $1.71 as compared to
an average price of $1.16 in 2004. In 2004, our average fuel
price per gallon rose 42% as compared to an average price of
81.78¢ in 2003. Our fuel costs represented 23%, 16%, and
13% of our operating expenses in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. These increasing costs have had a significant
negative effect on our results of operations and financial
condition.

During the months of September and October, 2005, our fuel costs
and supplies were negatively impacted by two hurricanes, Katrina
and Rita, that struck the Gulf Coast region of the United
States. These storms interfered with the operations of
production facilities and refineries in Louisiana and Texas. As
a result, our fuel costs significantly increased during the
latter part of 2005, primarily from drastically increased costs
of refining crude oil into jet fuel.

Our ability to pass along the increased costs of fuel to our
customers is limited by the competitive nature of the airline
industry. We generally have not been able to increase our fares
to fully offset the effect of increased fuel costs in the past
and we may not be able to do so in the future.

In addition, our aircraft fuel purchase contracts do not provide
material protection against price increases or assure the
availability of our fuel supplies. We purchase most of our
aircraft fuel from petroleum refiners under contracts that
establish the price based on various market indices. We also
purchase aircraft fuel on the spot market, from offshore sources
and under contracts that permit the refiners to set the price.
To attempt to reduce our exposure to changes in fuel prices, we
periodically enter into heating and crude oil derivatives
contracts, though we may not be able to successfully manage this
exposure. In December 2005, the Bankruptcy Court authorized us
to enter into fuel hedging contracts for up to 30% of our
monthly estimated fuel consumption, with hedging allowed in
excess of that level if we obtained approval of the official
committee of unsecured creditors appointed in our
Chapter 11 proceedings (the “Creditors
Committee”) or the Bankruptcy Court. In February 2006, we
received approval from the Creditors Committee to hedge up to
50% of our estimated 2006 aggregate fuel consumption, with no
single month exceeding 80% of our estimated fuel consumption. We
also agreed that we would not enter into any fuel hedging
contracts that extend beyond December 31, 2006 without
additional approval from the Creditors Committee or the
Bankruptcy Court. Depending on the type of hedging instrument
used, our ability to benefit from declines in fuel prices may be
limited.

We are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft
fuel, but it is impossible to predict the future availability or
price of aircraft fuel. Weather-related events, natural
disasters, political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing
countries, changes in governmental policy concerning aircraft
fuel production, transportation or marketing, changes in
aircraft fuel production capacity, environmental concerns, and
other unpredictable events may result in additional fuel supply
shortages and fuel price increases in the future. Additional
increases in fuel costs or disruptions in fuel supplies could
have additional negative effects on us.



The retirement of a significant number of our pilots prior
    to their normal retirement age of 60 could require significant
    contributions to our defined benefit pension plan for pilots,
    significantly disrupt our operations and negatively impact our
    revenue.

Under our defined benefit pension plan for pilots (“Pilot
Plan”), Delta pilots who retire can elect to receive 50% of
the present value of their accrued pension benefit in a lump sum
in connection with their retirement and the remaining 50% of
their accrued pension benefit as an annuity after retirement. In
recent years, our pilots have retired prior to their normal
retirement age of 60 at greater than historical levels due to
(1) a perceived risk of rising interest rates, which could
reduce the amount of their lump sum pension benefit; and/or
(2) concerns about their ability to receive a lump sum
pension benefit if a notice of intent to terminate the Pilot
Plan is issued during a restructuring under Chapter 11 of
the Bankruptcy Code. While the Pilot Plan is currently
prohibited from making the lump sum payments, it is currently
projected that the lump sum feature would become available in
October 2006 if the Pilot Plan is not subject to termination
proceedings prior to that date. If a significant number of pilot
early retirements occurs in the near future, the resulting lump
sum payments, combined with other factors, could trigger a
requirement to make contributions to the Pilot Plan in excess of
amounts currently estimated. The amount of any additional
contribution depends on factors that are not currently known
and, therefore, cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. An
additional contribution could have a material adverse impact on
our liquidity.

A significant number of pilot early retirements in the near
future could also disrupt our operations and have a material
adverse impact on our revenues because there may not be enough
pilots to operate certain aircraft types for a period of time,
the duration of which cannot be determined. We and ALPA had
agreed to certain provisions that helped mitigate the effect of
pilot early retirements on our operations over the past eighteen
months, but these provisions expired on December 31, 2005.
As of January 31, 2006, approximately 1,700 of our 5,900
pilots on the active roster are at or over age 50 and thus
were eligible to retire at the beginning of February 2006.

Our defined benefit pension plan funding requirements are
    significant, are affected by factors beyond our control and
    could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity.

Our funding obligations for certain of our defined benefit
pension plans (“DB Plans”) are governed by the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
(“ERISA”). During the year ended December 31,
2005, we contributed approximately $325 million to our
DB Plans. Estimates of future funding requirements under
the DB Plans are based on various assumptions, including
legislative changes regarding these obligations. These
assumptions include, among other things, the actual and
projected market performance of assets of the DB Plans;
future long-term corporate bond yields; statutory requirements;
the terms of the DB Plans; and demographic data for
participants in the DB Plans, including the number of
participants, their salaries and the rate of participant
attrition.

Assuming current funding rules and current plan design, we
estimate that the funding requirements under our DB Plans
for 2006, 2007 and 2008 will aggregate approximately
$3.4 billion, absent any liquidity shortfall contribution
requirements. Substantially this entire amount relates to
benefits earned prior to the Petition Date. We believe we are
not required to fund such pre-petition amounts while operating
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. As noted below in
“Legal Proceedings” in Item 3, DP3 and certain
other entities unsuccessfully challenged this position in the
Bankruptcy Court and the issue is currently on appeal to the
District Court. If we were required to make such pre-petition
contributions to the DB Plans, it would have an adverse effect
on our liquidity and could result in an earlier resumption of
the Pilot Plan making the lump sum payments to retiring pilots,
which, as described above, could cause disruption in our
operations and have a material effect on our revenues. If our
DB Plans continue after we emerge from Chapter 11, we
may be required to fully fund required contributions at that
date, including contributions related to benefits earned prior
to our Petition Date.

Based on our preliminary five-year forecast and additional
information regarding the assets and liabilities for the
DB Plans, we believe that, under current pension funding
rules, we would need to seek distress termination of both the
Nonpilot Plan and the Pilot Plan in order to successfully
reorganize and emerge from Chapter 11. Proposed legislation
that passed in the U.S. Senate and is now pending in a
House-Senate Conference Committee would extend our funding
obligations for our DB Plans over 20 years. If the
pending



legislation is enacted in the form in which it passed the
U.S. Senate, we hope to avoid a distress termination of the
Nonpilot Plan, though there is no assurance that we can do so.
We currently believe, however, that the existence of the lump
sum option in the Pilot Plan and the significant number of early
pilot retirements it may drive make it unlikely that we could
satisfy our funding obligations to that plan even if the pending
legislation is enacted in the form in which it passed the
U.S. Senate.

For additional information about our pension plans, see
Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Interruptions or disruptions in service at one of our hub
    airports could have a material adverse impact on our
    operations.

Our business is heavily dependent on our operations at the
Atlanta Airport and at our other hub airports in Cincinnati, JFK
and Salt Lake City. Each of these hub operations includes
flights that gather and distribute traffic from markets in the
geographic region surrounding the hub to other major cities and
to other Delta hubs. A significant interruption or disruption in
service at the Atlanta Airport or at one of our other hubs could
have a serious impact on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

We are increasingly dependent on technology in our
    operations, and if our technology fails or we are unable to
    continue to invest in new technology, our business may be
    adversely affected.

We have become increasingly dependent on technology initiatives
to reduce costs and to enhance customer service in order to
compete in the current business environment. For example, we
have made significant investments in check-in kiosks, Delta
Direct phone banks and related initiatives across the system.
The performance and reliability of our technology are critical
to our ability to attract and retain customers and our ability
to compete effectively. In this challenging business
environment, particularly during our Chapter 11
proceedings, we may not be able to continue to make sufficient
capital investments in our technology infrastructure to deliver
these expected benefits.

In addition, any internal technology error or failure, or large
scale external interruption in technology infrastructure we
depend on, such as power, telecommunications or the internet,
may disrupt our technology network. Any individual, sustained or
repeated failure of our technology could impact our customer
service and result in increased costs. Like all companies, our
technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of sources of
interruption due to events beyond our control, including natural
disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures,
computer viruses, hackers and other security issues. While we
have in place, and continue to invest in, technology security
initiatives and disaster recovery plans, these measures may not
be adequate or implemented properly to prevent a business
disruption and its adverse financial consequences to our
business.

If we experience further losses of our senior management
    and other key employees, our operating results could be
    adversely affected, and we may not be able to attract and retain
    additional qualified management personnel.

We are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our
officers and other key employees to execute our business plans.
Our deteriorating financial performance, along with our
Chapter 11 proceedings, creates uncertainty that has led to
a significant increase in unwanted attrition. We are at risk of
losing management talent critical to the successful
transformation and ongoing operation of our business. If we
continue to experience a substantial turnover in our leadership
and other key employees, including as a result of planned
overhead reductions required by our business plan, our
performance could be materially adversely impacted. Furthermore,
we may be unable to attract and retain additional qualified
executives as needed in the future.

We are facing significant litigation and if any such
    significant litigation is concluded in a manner adverse to us,
    our financial condition and operating results could be
    materially adversely affected.

We are involved in legal proceedings relating to antitrust
matters, employment practices, environmental issues and other
matters concerning our business. As a result of our
Chapter 11 filing, most attempts to collect, secure or
enforce remedies with respect to pre-petition claims against us
are subject to the automatic



stay provisions of Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code
and certain liabilities could be discharged in the
Chapter 11 proceedings. While we cannot reasonably estimate
the potential loss for certain of our legal proceedings because,
for example, the litigation is in its early stages or the
plaintiff does not specify damages being sought, if the outcome
of any significant litigation is adverse to us and such
proceedings are not discharged in our Chapter 11
proceedings, our financial condition and operating results could
be materially adversely impacted.

We are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming
    from any accident involving our aircraft.

If one of our aircraft were to crash or be involved in an
accident, we could be exposed to significant tort liability. The
insurance we carry to cover damages arising from any future
accidents may be inadequate. In the event that our insurance is
not adequate, we may be forced to bear substantial losses from
an accident. In addition, any accident involving an aircraft
that we operate or is operated by an airline that is one of our
codeshare partners could create a public perception that our
aircraft are not safe or reliable, which could harm our
reputation, result in air travelers being reluctant to fly on
our aircraft and harm our business.

Issuances of equity in connection with our restructuring
    increase the likelihood that in the future our ability to
    utilize our federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards
    may be limited.

Under federal income tax law, a corporation is generally
permitted to deduct from taxable income in any year net
operating losses carried forward from prior years. We have net
operating loss carryforwards of approximately $8.5 billion
as of December 31, 2005. Our ability to deduct net
operating loss carryforwards could be subject to a significant
limitation if we were to undergo an “ownership change”
for purposes of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended, during or as a result of our Chapter 11
proceedings.

Risk Factors Relating to the Airline Industry

The airline industry is highly competitive and, if we
    cannot successfully compete in the marketplace, our business,
    financial condition and operating results will be materially
    adversely affected.

We face significant competition with respect to routes, services
and fares. Our domestic routes are subject to competition from
both new and established carriers, some of which have
substantially lower costs than we do and provide service at low
fares to destinations served by us. Our revenues continue to be
materially adversely impacted by the growth of low-cost
carriers, with which we compete in most of our markets.
Significant expansion by low-cost carriers to our hub airports
could have an adverse impact on our business. We also face
increasing competition in smaller to medium-sized markets from
rapidly expanding regional jet operators. In addition, we
compete with foreign carriers, both on interior
U.S. routes, due to marketing and codesharing arrangements,
and in international markets.

The continuing growth of low-cost carriers, including Southwest,
AirTran and JetBlue, in the United States has placed significant
competitive pressure on us and other network carriers. In
addition, other hub-and-spoke carriers such as US Airways and
United Airlines have reduced their costs through Chapter 11
reorganization. Our ability to compete effectively with low-cost
carriers, restructured carriers and other airlines depends, in
part, on our ability to achieve a cost structure that is
competitive with those carriers. If we cannot lower our costs
and subsequently maintain our costs at a competitive level, then
our business, financial condition and operating results will
continue to be materially adversely affected.

The airline industry has changed fundamentally since the
    terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, and our business,
    financial condition and operating results have been materially
    adversely affected.

Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the
airline industry has experienced fundamental and permanent
changes, including substantial revenue declines and cost
increases, which have resulted in industry-wide liquidity
issues. The terrorist attacks significantly reduced the demand
for air travel, and additional terrorist activity involving the
airline industry could have an equal or greater impact.
Additional terrorist attacks or fear of such attacks, even if
not made directly on the airline industry, negatively affect us
and the airline industry. Although global economic conditions
have improved from their depressed levels after
September 11, 2001, the airline industry in the United
States has continued to experience a reduction in



high-yield business travel and increased price sensitivity in
customers’ purchasing behavior. In addition, aircraft fuel
prices have increased significantly during the last several
years, were at historically high levels for an extended period
during 2005 and remained at or near those levels during the
early part of 2006. The airline industry has continued to add or
restore capacity despite these conditions. We expect all of
these conditions will persist and will continue to adversely
impact our operations and our efforts to return to profitability.

The airline industry is subject to extensive government
    regulation, and new regulations may increase our
    operating costs.

Airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal
compliance requirements that result in significant costs. For
instance, the FAA from time to time issues directives and other
regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of
aircraft that necessitate significant expenditures. We expect to
continue incurring expenses to comply with the FAA’s
regulations.

Other laws, regulations, taxes and airport rates and charges
have also been imposed from time to time that significantly
increase the cost of airline operations or reduce revenues. For
example, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, which
became law in November 2001, mandates the federalization of
certain airport security procedures and imposes additional
security requirements on airports and airlines, most of which
are funded by a per ticket tax on passengers and a tax on
airlines. The federal government has recently proposed a
significant increase in the per ticket tax. Due to the weak
revenue environment, the existing tax has negatively impacted
our revenues because we generally have not been able to increase
our fares to pass these fees on to our customers. Similarly, the
proposed ticket tax increase, if implemented, could negatively
impact our revenues.

Furthermore, we and other U.S. carriers are subject to
domestic and foreign laws regarding privacy of passenger and
employee data that are not consistent in all countries in which
we operate. In addition to the heightened level of concern
regarding privacy of passenger data in the United States,
certain European government agencies are initiating inquiries
into airline privacy practices. Compliance with these regulatory
regimes is expected to result in additional operating costs and
could impact our operations and any future expansion.

Our insurance costs have increased substantially as a
    result of the September 11 terrorist attacks, and further
    increases in insurance costs or reductions in coverage could
    have a material adverse impact on our business and operating
    results.

As a result of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001,
aviation insurers significantly reduced the maximum amount of
insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for
liability to persons (other than employees or passengers) for
claims resulting from acts of terrorism, war or similar events.
At the same time, aviation insurers significantly increased the
premiums for such coverage and for aviation insurance in
general. Since September 24, 2001, the U.S. government
has been providing U.S. airlines with war-risk insurance to
cover losses, including those resulting from terrorism, to
passengers, third parties (ground damage) and the aircraft hull.
The coverage currently extends through August 31, 2006
(with a possible extension to December 31, 2006 at the
discretion of the Secretary of Transportation). The withdrawal
of government support of airline war-risk insurance would
require us to obtain war-risk insurance coverage commercially,
if available. Such commercial insurance could have substantially
less desirable coverage than currently provided by the
U.S. government, may not be adequate to protect our risk of
loss from future acts of terrorism, may result in a material
increase to our operating expenses or may not be obtainable at
all, resulting in an interruption to our operations.

PROPERTIES

Flight Equipment

The table set forth below shows our aircraft fleet at
December 31, 2005.

Our purchase commitments (firm orders) for aircraft as well as
options to purchase additional aircraft, as of December 31,
2005, are shown below. We have a long-term agreement with The
Boeing Company (“Boeing”) that covers firm orders,
options and rolling options for certain mainline aircraft
through calendar year 2017. Our long-term agreement with
Bombardier Inc. covers options for certain regional jet aircraft
through calendar year 2010. See Note 1 to the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information
about the treatment of executory contracts under the Bankruptcy
Code.

(1)

We have a definitive agreement, which was approved by the
    Bankruptcy Court, with a third party to sell 10 B737-800
    aircraft immediately after those aircraft are delivered to us by
    the manufacturer in 2007. These aircraft are included in the
    above table because we continue to have a contractual obligation
    to purchase these aircraft from the manufacturer.

(1)

Aircraft options have scheduled delivery slots, while rolling
    options replace options and are assigned delivery slots as
    options expire or are exercised.



Ground Facilities

We lease most of the land and buildings that we occupy. Our
largest aircraft maintenance base, various computer, cargo,
flight kitchen and training facilities and most of our principal
offices are located at or near the Atlanta Airport, on land
leased from the City of Atlanta generally under long-term
leases. We own a portion of our principal offices, our Atlanta
reservations center and other real property in Atlanta.

We lease ticket counter and other terminal space, operating
areas and air cargo facilities in most of the airports that we
serve. At most airports that we serve, we have entered into use
agreements which provide for the non-exclusive use of runways,
taxiways, and other improvements and facilities; landing fees
under these agreements normally are based on the number of
landings and weight of aircraft. These leases and use agreements
generally run for periods of less than one year to thirty years
or more, and often contain provisions for periodic adjustments
of lease rates, landing fees and other charges applicable under
that type of agreement. Examples of major leases and use
agreements at Delta hub or other significant airports that will
expire in the next several years include, among others:
(1) Atlanta central passenger terminal lease and the
airport use agreement; (2) Salt Lake City airport use and
lease agreement; and (3) New York LaGuardia terminal lease.
We also lease aircraft maintenance facilities at certain
airports, including, among others, our main Atlanta maintenance
base and hangar facilities at the Cincinnati/ Northern Kentucky
International Airport, Tampa International Airport and Salt Lake
City International Airport. Our aircraft maintenance facility
leases generally require us to pay the cost of providing,
operating and maintaining such facilities, including, in some
cases, amounts necessary to pay debt service on special facility
bonds issued to finance their construction. We also lease
marketing, ticket and reservations offices in certain locations
for varying terms. Additional information relating to our leases
of our ground facilities is set forth in Note 9 of the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In recent years, some airports have increased or sought to
increase the rates charged to airlines to levels that we believe
are unreasonable. The extent to which such charges are limited
by statute or regulation and the ability of airlines to contest
such charges has been subject to litigation and to
administrative proceedings before the DOT. If the limitations on
such charges are relaxed, or the ability of airlines to
challenge such charges is restricted, the rates charged by
airports to airlines may increase substantially.

The City of Atlanta, with our support and the support of other
airlines, is currently implementing portions of a ten year
capital improvement program (the “CIP”) at the Atlanta
Airport. Implementation of the CIP should increase the number of
flights that may operate at the airport and reduce flight
delays. The CIP includes, among other things, a new
approximately 9,000 foot full-service runway (targeted for
completion in May 2006), related airfield improvements,
additional terminal and gate capacity, new cargo and other
support facilities and roadway and other infrastructure
improvements. If fully implemented, the CIP is currently
estimated by the City of Atlanta to cost approximately
$6.8 billion, which exceeds the $5.4 billion CIP
approved by the airlines in 1999. The CIP runs through 2010,
with individual projects scheduled to be constructed at
different times. A combination of federal grants, passenger
facility charge revenues, increased user rentals and fees, and
other airport funds are expected to be used to pay CIP costs
directly and through the payment of debt service on bonds.
Certain elements of the CIP have been delayed, and there is no
assurance that the CIP will be fully implemented. Failure to
implement certain portions of the CIP in a timely manner could
adversely impact our operations at the Atlanta Airport.

During 2001, we entered into lease and financing agreements with
the Massachusetts Port Authority (“Massport”) for the
redevelopment and expansion of Terminal A at Logan. The new
terminal opened in March 2005 and has enabled us to consolidate
all of our domestic operations at that airport into one
location. Project costs were funded with $498 million in
proceeds from special facility bonds issued by Massport on
August 16, 2001. We agreed to pay the debt service on the
bonds under an agreement with Massport and issued a guarantee to
the bond trustee covering the payment of the debt service on the
bonds. Additional information about these bonds is set forth in
Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

For additional information about our efforts to restructure our
real estate related obligations in our Chapter 11
proceedings, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Facility Bond Restructurings and Recharacterization
Litigation” in Item 7.



ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Chapter 11 Proceedings

As discussed above, on September 14, 2005, we and certain
of our subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy
Court. The reorganization cases are being jointly administered
under the caption “In re Delta Air Lines, Inc.,
et al., Case
No.

05-17923-ASH.”

The Debtors continue to operate their business as

“debtors-in

-possession”
under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders
of the Bankruptcy Court. As of the date of the Chapter 11
filing, virtually all pending litigation (including actions
described below) is stayed, and absent further order of the
Bankruptcy Court, no party, subject to certain exceptions, may
take any action, also subject to certain exceptions, to recover
on pre-petition claims against the Debtors. At this time it is
not possible to predict the outcome of the Chapter 11
filings or their effect on our business.

Coincident with the Chapter 11 filing, we stopped making
contributions to our qualified pension plans and payments from
our non-qualified pension plans for benefits earned prior to the
filing. In September 2005, the Delta Pilots Pension Preservation
Organization (“DP3”), an organization consisting of
retired Delta pilots, filed a motion in the Bankruptcy Court to
compel the continued payment of collectively-bargained pension
benefits to retired pilots. Specifically, DP3 sought an order
requiring us to (1) continue making non-qualified pension
payments to retired pilots; and (2) make required
contributions to the qualified pension plan for benefits earned
prior to the Petition Date. DP3 argued that because Delta had
not rejected its collective bargaining agreement with ALPA, and
because such agreement required us to maintain both the
qualified and non-qualified plans, we had to continue such
payments regardless of the bankruptcy filing until the time
Delta rejected the collective bargaining agreement with ALPA.
DP3’s motion was supported by Fiduciary Counselors, the
independent fiduciary for the qualified pension plan, and ALPA.
We and the Creditors Committee opposed the motion on the basis
that the requested contributions and payments were for benefits
that were earned prior to the Petition Date, and under
controlling law, we were not required to make such payments at
that time (and still are not required to make such payments).

In October, the Bankruptcy Court denied DP3’s motion on
procedural grounds and DP3, joined by Fiduciary Counselors and
ALPA, filed an appeal of that decision to the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York. The
appellants have filed opening briefs with the District Court in
which they also urge the District Court to decide the case on
the merits, and not necessarily restrict itself to the
procedural issue relied on by the Bankruptcy Court in its
decision. Delta has filed its opposition brief.

In December 2005, subsequent to the Bankruptcy Court’s
decision on the DP3 motion, several individuals, all of them
retired Delta pilots, commenced an adversary proceeding in the
Bankruptcy Court on behalf of themselves and a class consisting
of approximately 5,800 retired Delta pilots and their
survivors, raising issues substantially overlapping with those
raised by DP3’s motion. In January 2006, on
Delta’s motion, the Bankruptcy Court extended Delta’s
time to answer or otherwise move with respect to this class
action until thirty days after the District Court’s
resolution of the appeal concerning the Bankruptcy Court’s
ruling on DP3’s motion.

In Re Northwest Airlines, et al. Antitrust
    Litigation

In June 1999, two purported class action antitrust lawsuits were
filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Michigan against Delta, US Airways and Northwest.

In these cases, plaintiffs allege, among other things:
(1) that the defendants and certain other airlines
conspired in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act to
restrain competition in the sale of air passenger service by
enforcing rules prohibiting certain ticketing practices; and
(2) that the defendants violated Section 2 of the
Sherman Act by prohibiting these ticketing practices.

Plaintiffs have requested a jury trial. They seek injunctive
relief; costs and attorneys’ fees; and unspecified damages,
to be trebled under the antitrust laws. The District Court
granted the plaintiffs’ motion for class action
certification and denied the airlines’ motions for summary
judgment in May 2002. On May 4, 2004, the District Court
issued a supplemental order defining various plaintiff
subclasses. The subclasses



pertinent to Delta include: (1) for the purpose of the
Section 1 claim, a subclass of persons or entities who
purchased from a defendant or its agent a full fare,
unrestricted ticket for travel on any of certain designated city
pairs originating or terminating at Delta’s Atlanta or
Cincinnati hubs, Northwest’s hubs at Minneapolis, Detroit
or Memphis, or US Airways’ hubs at Pittsburgh or Charlotte,
during the period from June 11, 1995 to date; (2) for
the purpose of the Section 2 claim as it relates to its
Atlanta hub, a subclass of persons or entities who purchased
from Delta or its agent a full fare, unrestricted ticket for
travel on any of certain designated city pairs originating or
terminating at its Atlanta hub during the same period; and
(3) for the purpose of the Section 2 claim as it
relates to its Cincinnati hub, a subclass of persons or entities
who purchased from Delta or its agent a full fare, unrestricted
ticket for travel on any of certain designated city pairs
originating or terminating at its Cincinnati hub during the same
period. The District Court administratively closed this case on
September 20, 2005 due to the bankruptcy proceedings of
Delta, Northwest and US Airways. The case is subject to
reopening upon further action by the District Court.

Litigation Re September 11 Terrorist Attacks

Delta is a defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the
terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. It appears that
the plaintiffs in these actions are alleging that Delta and many
other air carriers are jointly liable for damages resulting from
the terrorist attacks based on a theory of shared responsibility
for passenger security screening at Logan, Washington Dulles
International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport.
These lawsuits, which are in preliminary stages, generally seek
unspecified damages, including punitive damages. Federal law
limits the financial liability of any air carrier for
compensatory and punitive damages arising out of the September
11 terrorist attacks to no more than the limits of liability
insurance coverage maintained by the air carrier. Because this
litigation was subject to the automatic stay imposed by our
Chapter 11 proceedings, the plaintiffs in these lawsuits
agreed to stipulations that limit their recovery of any judgment
solely to available insurance coverage in exchange for us
agreeing to lift the automatic stay. An order reflecting this
stipulation has been entered by the Bankruptcy Court and our
exposure in these lawsuits is now limited to the deductible in
our insurance policies.

Delta Family-Care Savings Plan Litigation

On September 3, 2004, a retired Delta employee filed a
class action complaint (amended on March 16, 2005) in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia
against Delta, certain current and former Delta officers and
certain current and former Delta directors on behalf of himself
and other participants in the Delta Family-Care Savings Plan
(“Savings Plan”). The amended complaint alleges that
the defendants were fiduciaries of the Savings Plan and, as
such, breached their fiduciary duties under ERISA to the
plaintiff class by (1) allowing class members to direct
their contributions under the Savings Plan to a fund invested in
Delta common stock; and (2) continuing to hold Delta’s
contributions to the Savings Plan in Delta’s common and
preferred stock. The amended complaint seeks damages unspecified
in amount, but equal to the total loss of value in the
participants’ accounts from September 2000 through
September 2004 from the investment in Delta stock. Defendants
deny that there was any breach of fiduciary duty, and have moved
to dismiss the complaint, which motion is pending before the
District Court. The District Court has stayed the action against
Delta due to the bankruptcy filing, and we have filed an
adversary proceeding with the Bankruptcy Court seeking to extend
the stay as to all defendants. The District Court is awaiting
the results of that action before it further considers the
motion to dismiss filed by the individual defendants.

* * *

The antitrust litigation described above has been
administratively closed by the court. Additionally, our exposure
in the September 11 litigation has been limited as the result of
a stipulation we entered into with the plaintiffs. In each of
the cases described above in which we are a defendant, we
believe the plaintiffs’ claims are without merit, and, to
the extent these cases are proceeding, we are vigorously
defending the lawsuits. However, an adverse decision in any of
these cases could result in substantial damages against us.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED
    STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Until October 13, 2005, our common stock was traded on the
New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol
“DAL”. As the result of our bankruptcy proceedings,
our common stock was suspended from trading by the NYSE on
October 13, 2005 and thereafter delisted by the NYSE. Our
common stock has been quoted since its suspension from the NYSE
on the Pink Sheets Electronic Quotation Service (“Pink
Sheets”) maintained by Pink Sheets LLC for the National
Quotation Bureau, Inc. The tickler symbol “DALRQ” has
been assigned to our common stock for

over-the

-counter
quotations.

The following table sets forth for the periods indicated, the
highest and lowest sales price for our common stock, as reported
on the NYSE for the period through October 13, 2005 and the
quarterly high and low bid quotations for our common stock as
reported on the Pink Sheets for the period beginning
October 13, 2005. The quotations from the Pink Sheets
reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail markup, markdown or
commissions, and may not represent actual transactions.

As of February 28, 2006, there were approximately 25,600
holders of record of our common stock.

We suspended the payment of dividends on our common stock in
2003. We expect to retain any future earnings to fund our
operations and meet our cash and liquidity needs. Therefore, we
do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in
the future.

We believe that our currently outstanding common stock will have
no value and will be canceled under any plan of reorganization
that we propose. Accordingly, we urge that caution be exercised
with respect to existing and future investments in our common
stock and other securities.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
    CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

On September 14, 2005 (the “Petition Date”), we
and substantially all of our subsidiaries (collectively, the
“Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions for
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States
Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”), in the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York
(the “Bankruptcy Court”). The reorganization cases are
being jointly administered under the caption, “In re Delta
Air Lines, Inc., et al., Case
No. 05

-17923-ASH.”

Our Chapter 11 filing followed an extended effort by us to
restructure our business to strengthen our competitive and
financial position. In 2004, we announced our transformation
plan, which is intended to provide us with approximately
$5 billion in annual financial benefits by the end of 2006,
as compared to 2002. While we were, and continue to be, on
schedule to achieve the targeted benefits, we experienced a
liquidity shortfall in 2005 due to historically high aircraft
fuel prices and other cost pressures, continued low passenger
mile yields and cash holdbacks instituted for the first time by
our credit card processors. As a result, we determined that we
could not continue to operate without the protections provided
by Chapter 11. In connection with our Chapter 11
proceedings, we obtained $2.2 billion in post-petition
financing, which provided net proceeds of $1.2 billion
after the required repayment of certain pre-petition facilities.
For further information about our Chapter 11 proceedings
and our post-petition financing, see Notes 1 and 8,
respectively, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded a
consolidated net loss of $3.8 billion. These results
include $1.8 billion in aggregate charges for
reorganization items and pension and restructuring charges, net.
See Notes 1 and 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for further information about these
charges. Our cash and cash equivalents and short-term
investments were $2.0 billion at December 31, 2005,
compared to $1.8 billion at December 31, 2004.

The benefits we realized under our transformation initiatives
during 2005 were outpaced and masked by historically high
aircraft fuel prices, which continue to have a material adverse
effect on our financial performance. During 2005, our aircraft
fuel expense increased 46%, or $1.3 billion, compared to
2004. In addition, we continue to operate in a highly
competitive pricing environment, which limits our ability to
increase fares to offset high fuel costs and has had a
significant negative impact on our financial results. Although
revenue passenger miles (“RPMs”), or traffic, and
passenger revenue rose 6% in 2005 compared to 2004, passenger
mile yield remained unchanged from the depressed level of the
prior year.

Chapter 11 Process

The Debtors are operating as

“debtors-in

-possession”
under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. In
general, as

debtors-in

-possession,
the Debtors are authorized under Chapter 11 to continue to
operate as an ongoing business, but may not engage in
transactions outside the ordinary course of business without the
prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court.

The Bankruptcy Court has approved various motions that
facilitate our continuation of normal operations. The Bankruptcy
Court’s orders authorize us, among other things, in our
discretion to: (1) provide employee wages, healthcare
coverage, vacation, sick leave and similar benefits without
interruption; (2) honor obligations arising prior to the
Petition Date (“pre-petition obligations”) to
customers and continue customer service programs, including
Delta’s SkyMiles frequent flyer program; (3) pay for
fuel under existing fuel supply contracts and honor existing
fuel supply, distribution and storage agreements; (4) honor
pre-petition obligations related to our interline,
clearinghouse, code sharing and other similar agreements;
(5) pay pre-petition obligations to foreign vendors,
foreign service providers and foreign governments; and
(6) continue maintenance of existing bank accounts and
existing cash management systems.

Shortly after the Petition Date, the Debtors began notifying all
known current or potential creditors of the Chapter 11
filing. Subject to certain exceptions under the Bankruptcy Code,
the Debtors’ Chapter 11 filing automatically enjoined,
or stayed, the continuation of any judicial or administrative
proceedings or other actions against the Debtors or their
property to recover on, collect or secure a claim arising prior
to the



Petition Date. Thus, for example, most creditor actions to
obtain possession of property from the Debtors, or to create,
perfect or enforce any lien against the property of the Debtors,
or to collect on monies owed or otherwise exercise rights or
remedies with respect to a pre-petition claim are enjoined
unless and until the Bankruptcy Court lifts the automatic stay.
Vendors are being paid for goods furnished and services provided
after the Petition Date in the ordinary course of business.

As required by the Bankruptcy Code, the United States Trustee
for the Southern District of New York appointed an official
committee of unsecured creditors (the “Creditors
Committee”). The Creditors Committee and its legal
representatives have a right to be heard on all matters that
come before the Bankruptcy Court with respect to the Debtors.
The Creditors Committee has been generally supportive of the
Debtors’ positions on various matters; however, there can
be no assurance that the Creditors Committee will support the
Debtors’ positions on matters to be presented to the
Bankruptcy Court in the future or on the Debtors’ plan of
reorganization, once proposed. Disagreements between the Debtors
and the Creditors Committee could protract the Chapter 11
proceedings, negatively impact the Debtors’ ability to
operate and delay the Debtors’ emergence from the
Chapter 11 proceedings. Under Section 365 and other
relevant sections of the Bankruptcy Code, we may assume, assume
and assign, or reject certain executory contracts and unexpired
leases, including, without limitation, leases of real property,
aircraft and aircraft engines, subject to the approval of the
Bankruptcy Court and certain other conditions. Any description
of an executory contract or unexpired lease in this
Form 10-K, including where applicable our express
termination rights or a quantification of our obligations, must
be read in conjunction with, and is qualified by, any overriding
rejection rights we have under Section 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code. See Note 1 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

In order to successfully exit Chapter 11, the Debtors will
need to propose, and obtain confirmation by the Bankruptcy Court
of, a plan of reorganization that satisfies the requirements of
the Bankruptcy Code. A plan of reorganization would, among other
things, resolve the Debtors’ pre-petition obligations, set
forth the revised capital structure of the newly reorganized
entity and provide for corporate governance subsequent to exit
from bankruptcy.

The Debtors have the exclusive right for 120 days after the
Petition Date to file a plan of reorganization and, if we do so,
60 additional days to obtain necessary acceptances of our
plan. The Bankruptcy Court has extended these periods until
July 11, 2006 and September 9, 2006, respectively, and
these periods may be extended further by the Bankruptcy Court
for cause. If the Debtors’ exclusivity period lapses, any
party in interest may file a plan of reorganization for any of
the Debtors. In addition to being voted on by holders of
impaired claims and equity interests, a plan of reorganization
must satisfy certain requirements of the Bankruptcy Code and
must be approved, or confirmed, by the Bankruptcy Court in order
to become effective. A plan of reorganization has been accepted
by holders of claims against and equity interests in the Debtors
if (1) at least one-half in number and two-thirds in dollar
amount of claims actually voting in each impaired class of
claims have voted to accept the plan and (2) at least
two-thirds in amount of equity interests actually voting in each
impaired class of equity interests has voted to accept the plan.

Under certain circumstances set forth in Section 1129(b) of
the Bankruptcy Code, the Bankruptcy Court may confirm a plan
even if such plan has not been accepted by all impaired classes
of claims and equity interests. A class of claims or equity
interests that does not receive or retain any property under the
plan on account of such claims or interests is deemed to have
voted to reject the plan. The precise requirements and
evidentiary showing for confirming a plan notwithstanding its
rejection by one or more impaired classes of claims or equity
interests depends upon a number of factors, including the status
and seniority of the claims or equity interests in the rejecting
class (i.e., secured claims or unsecured claims, subordinated or
senior claims, preferred or common stock). Generally, with
respect to common stock interests, a plan may be “crammed
down” even if the shareowners receive no recovery if the
proponent of the plan demonstrates that (1) no class junior
to the common stock is receiving or retaining property under the
plan and (2) no class of claims or interests senior to the
common stock is being paid more than in full.

The timing of filing a plan of reorganization by us will depend
on the timing and outcome of numerous other ongoing matters in
the Chapter 11 proceedings. Although we expect to file a
plan of reorganization that provides for our emergence from
bankruptcy as a going concern, there can be no assurance at this
time that a



plan of reorganization will be confirmed by the Bankruptcy
Court, or that any such plan will be implemented successfully.

The Debtors will file with the Bankruptcy Court schedules and
statements of financial affairs setting forth, among other
things, the assets and liabilities of the Debtors, subject to
the assumptions filed in connection therewith. All of the
schedules will be subject to further amendment or modification.
Differences between amounts scheduled by the Debtors and claims
by creditors will be investigated and resolved in connection
with the claims resolution process. In light of the expected
number of creditors of the Debtors, the claims resolution
process may take considerable time to complete. Accordingly, the
ultimate number and amount of allowed claims is not presently
known, nor can the ultimate recovery with respect to allowed
claims be presently ascertained.

Our Business Plan

Our business plan is intended to make Delta a simpler, more
efficient and customer focused airline with an improved
financial condition. As part of our Chapter 11
reorganization, we are seeking $3 billion in annual
financial benefits (revenue enhancements and cost reductions) by
the end of 2007 from revenue and network improvements; savings
to be achieved through the Chapter 11 restructuring
process; and reduced Mainline employee cost. This amount is in
addition to the $5 billion in annual financial benefits we
are on schedule to achieve by the end of 2006, as compared to
2002, under the transformation plan we announced in 2004.

Components of the $3 billion in annual financial benefits
we are seeking by the end of 2007 include:

Revenue and Network Productivity Improvements.

Our
business plan targets $1.1 billion in benefits to be
realized annually through revenue and network productivity
improvements. Key initiatives include:

We are strengthening our domestic hubs and growing our
international operations. As of December 1, 2005, we
reduced capacity by approximately 25% at Cincinnati, with the
intention of increasing the percentage of local Cincinnati
traffic from approximately 35% to nearly 50%. To respond to
increased demand for service to emerging business and leisure
destinations, we are increasing international capacity by
approximately 25% by the summer of 2006 in comparison to our
schedule in the summer of 2005, with a focus on routes to
Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean. For example, we and,
with respect to certain routes, our contract carriers have added
or announced plans to add more than 50 new international routes
in the last year, including over 20 since November 2005. In
2006, service will be added to new destinations in countries
such as Denmark, Ecuador, Germany, Honduras, Hungary, Israel,
Jamaica, Mexico, Ukraine, and United Kingdom, some of which
service is subject to government approval.

As part of our revenue and network productivity improvements, we
announced that Song’s service will merge into Delta’s
in May 2006. We plan to add 26 First Class seats to each of the

B757-200

aircraft
now operating in Song’s service; convert an additional 50
or more Mainline aircraft to two-class service; and expand
personal digital in-flight entertainment system to the converted
aircraft. Our plan is to grow this service, referred to as Song
service, to all transcontinental Mainline routes beginning in
the fall of 2006 and all routes over 1,750 miles by the end
of 2007.

In-Court Restructuring.

Our business plan includes a
target of $970 million of cost reductions to be realized
annually through in-court restructuring initiatives such as debt
relief, lease and facility savings,



aircraft lease rejections and negotiations, restructuring of
vendor contracts and changes to retiree medical benefits.

Competitive Employment Costs.

Our business plan targeted
$930 million of benefits to be realized annually through
reduced employment costs. These reductions are planned to result
from changes to pay and benefits for our employees, as well as
employee productivity improvements, outsourcing and overhead
reductions.

The total targeted benefit represents annual, ongoing labor cost
reductions of $605 million from our nonpilot
workforce — including management. Specific components
of nonpilot employment changes include:

As previously announced, our business plan contemplates that
approximately 7,000–9,000 jobs will be eliminated
system-wide by the end of 2007. A portion of these reductions
contributes to our targeted reduction in employment costs and
the remainder contributes to our targeted benefits from revenue
and network productivity improvements. We plan to achieve these
reductions through previously announced changes to strengthen
our route network and right-size our Cincinnati hub, increased
outsourcing and reduced overhead. The final number of job
reductions will depend in part upon changes to our fleet.

We originally targeted ongoing, annual labor cost reductions of
$325 million from our pilot workforce, but have reduced the
requested amount to $305 million in connection with our
effort to reach a consensual agreement with ALPA. See “Key
Chapter 11 Efforts” below regarding the status of our
pilot labor cost reduction initiatives.

Key Chapter 11 Efforts

The following generally describes our efforts in the
Chapter 11 proceedings in the areas of liquidity, pilot
labor cost reductions, restructurings of aircraft fleet, and
real estate and special facility bond restructurings. See
Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for further information on the Chapter 11
reorganization process.

Liquidity.

On September 16, 2005, we entered into a
Secured Super-Priority

Debtor-in

-Possession
Credit Agreement which, as amended (“DIP Credit
Facility”), permits us to borrow up to $1.9 billion
from a syndicate of lenders arranged by General Electric Capital
Corporation (“GECC”) and Morgan Stanley Senior
Funding, Inc. (“Morgan Stanley”), for which GECC acts
as administrative agent. On the same date, we entered into an
agreement (the “Modification Agreement”) with American
Express Travel Related Services Company (“Amex”) and
American Express Bank, F.S.B. pursuant to which we modified
certain existing agreements with Amex, including two agreements
under which we had previously borrowed $500 million from
Amex (collectively, the “Amex Pre-Petition Facility”).
We used a portion of the proceeds of our borrowings under the
DIP Credit Facility to (1) repay in full the
$480 million principal amount outstanding under our
pre-petition credit facility for which GECC was agent (“GE
Pre-Petition Facility”); (2) repay in full the
$500 million principal amount outstanding under our Amex
Pre-Petition Facility; and (3) prepay $50 million of
the $350 million principal amount that we borrowed from
Amex pursuant to the terms of the Amex Pre-Petition Facility as
modified by the Modification Agreement (collectively, the
“Amex Post-Petition Facility”). The Bankruptcy Court
approved our entering into the DIP Credit Facility and the
Modification Agreement.



On March 27, 2006 we executed an amended and restated
credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders led by GECC and
Morgan Stanley that replaced the DIP Credit facility in its
entirety.

In September 2005, we entered into an amendment to our
Visa/MasterCard credit card processing agreement to extend its
term to October 2007. On January 26, 2006, with the
authorization from the Bankruptcy Court, we entered into a
letter of credit facility with Merrill Lynch. Under the Letter
of Credit Reimbursement Agreement, Merrill Lynch issued a
$300 million irrevocable standby letter of credit
(“Merrill Lynch Letter of Credit”) for the benefit of
our Visa/MasterCard credit card processor
(“Processor”). As contemplated in our Visa/MasterCard
credit card processing agreement (“Processing
Agreement”), we are providing the Merrill Lynch Letter of
Credit as a substitution for a portion of the cash reserve that
the Processor maintains. Under the Processing Agreement, the
Processor is permitted to maintain a reserve from our
receivables that is equal to the Processor’s potential
liability for tickets purchased with Visa or MasterCard that
have not yet been used for travel (the “unflown ticket
liability”). We estimate that the reserve, which adjusts
daily, will range between $450 million and
$850 million during the term of the Processing Agreement.
The Processing Agreement allows us to substitute the Merrill
Lynch Letter of Credit for a portion of the cash reserve equal
to the lesser of $300 million and 45% of the unflown ticket
liability. The Merrill Lynch letter of credit will expire in
January 2008.

For further information about these liquidity initiatives, see
“Financial Condition and Liquidity” in this
Item 7 and Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

In December 2005, the Bankruptcy Court authorized us to enter
into fuel hedging contracts for up to 30% of our monthly
estimated fuel consumption, with hedging allowed in excess of
that level if we obtained approval of the Creditors Committee or
the Bankruptcy Court. In February 2006, we received approval
from the Creditors Committee to hedge up to 50% of our estimated
2006 aggregate fuel consumption, with no single month exceeding
80% of our estimated fuel consumption. We also agreed we would
not enter into any fuel hedging contracts that extend beyond
December 31, 2006 without additional approval from the
Creditors Committee or the Bankruptcy Court. See Notes 5
and 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
further information about fuel hedging.

Pilot Labor Cost Reductions.

We have been in and continue
to be in negotiations with ALPA to reduce our pilot labor costs
as required under our business plan. Because we were not able to
reach a consensual agreement with ALPA, on November 1,
2005, we filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court under
Section 1113 of the Bankruptcy Code to reject our
collective bargaining agreement with ALPA.

In December 2005, we reached an interim agreement with ALPA,
which was approved by the Bankruptcy Court and ratified by
Delta’s pilots. The interim agreement provides for, among
other things, a reduction in (1) hourly pilot wage rates of
14% and (2) other pilot pay and cost items equivalent to
approximately an additional 1% hourly wage reduction. These
reductions became effective December 15, 2005, and remain
in effect until the earlier of (1) our entering into a
comprehensive agreement with ALPA on changes to the pilot
collective bargaining agreement; or (2) the time that the
neutral panel described below issues its final order as to
whether Delta is authorized to reject the pilot collective
bargaining agreement under the legal standards of
Section 1113 of the Bankruptcy Code.

The interim agreement provides that Delta and ALPA will seek to
negotiate a tentative comprehensive agreement, and establishes
the following time limits (“March 2006 time limits”)
for reaching that agreement: (1) March 1, 2006, for
the parties’ negotiating committees to reach a tentative
agreement; (2) March 8, 2006, for approval by the ALPA
Master Executive Council; and (3) March 22, 2006, for
pilot ratification. Because the first of the March 2006 time
limits was not met, pursuant to our interim agreement with ALPA,
the matter at issue in Delta’s Section 1113 motion has
been submitted to a mutually agreed upon, neutral panel of three
experts in airline labor matters for a binding decision on that
issue. The interim agreement provides that the panel’s
decision must be issued no later than 45 days after the
failure to meet the applicable March 2006 time limit, which is
April 15, 2006. We cannot predict the outcome of the
neutral panel’s decision as to whether or not we would be
authorized to reject the collective bargaining agreement.

If the neutral panel determines that we are authorized to reject
the collective bargaining agreement, ALPA has threatened to
initiate a strike, which we believe should not be permitted
under the Railway Labor



Act. However, we cannot predict the outcome of any effort we
might undertake to obtain court relief to prevent or stop a
strike or other forms of work disruption. A strike or other form
of significant work disruption by ALPA would likely have a
material negative impact on our ability to continue operating
our business and would trigger an event of default under our
post-petition financing agreements if all or substantially all
of our flight and other operations are suspended for longer than
two days. As a result, we could be required to cease operations
permanently.

Restructuring of Aircraft Fleet.

A substantial portion of
the cost savings from our Chapter 11 proceedings targeted
in our business plan arises from reductions in aircraft costs
and fleet simplification. We are negotiating with many of our
aircraft lessors and lenders to restructure existing financings
to reduce aircraft lease and ownership costs to better reflect
current market rates. In February 2006, the Bankruptcy Court
approved a term sheet we negotiated with a group of creditors
with respect to financing transactions for 88 Mainline aircraft
that would result in approximately $200 million in annual
savings for us over the next several years compared with our
existing rent and debt service obligations for those aircraft;
these transactions are subject to completion of definitive
documentation and certain other conditions. We have also reached
agreements in principle to restructure a substantial number of
other Mainline aircraft and some regional jet aircraft. We are
in negotiations to restructure a substantial number of other
regional jet aircraft. These transactions will be subject to
Bankruptcy Court approval. In addition, we must enter into
definitive documentation for all agreements in principle that we
reach, and satisfy certain conditions. To the extent that we are
unable to restructure additional financings or enter into
definitive documentation, lessors or lenders may seek to
repossess aircraft. The loss of a significant number of aircraft
could result in a material adverse effect on our operating and
financial performance. See Note 9 to the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about
our aircraft leases.

We have also rejected leases, relinquished possession of,
returned, and sold certain aircraft to adjust our fleet size to
more closely match our needs and to reduce costs. In addition to
two aircraft types that we eliminated from our fleet in January
2006, we intend to eliminate two more aircraft types from our
fleet by the end of 2006.

Real Estate and Special Facility Bond Restructurings and
Recharacterization Litigation.

As part of our business plan,
we are evaluating our real estate needs. In appropriate cases,
when possible, we are taking actions to right-size our
facilities, reduce real estate related costs and restructure
lease and debt obligations. Among others, such actions may
involve the sale of certain properties, the renegotiation or
rejection of certain leases, litigating whether certain special
facility bond obligations are lease or debt financing
obligations and stopping payment on various unsecured debt
obligations.

Prior to the Petition Date, a number of our facilities,
improvements and, in certain cases, equipment were financed with
the proceeds of special facility bonds issued by various
governmental entities. At December 31, 2005, there was a
total of $1.8 billion in principal amount of such special
facility bonds outstanding. As discussed in Note 8 of the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
$397 million of such bonds are backed by GECC letters of
credit, with our reimbursement obligations to GECC being secured
by certain of our aircraft and other assets.

Our liability with respect to certain of the special facility
bonds outstanding at December 31, 2005 may constitute debt
obligations for bankruptcy purposes even if contained in an
agreement that is labeled a “lease.” Successful
recharacterization of such obligations as pre-petition debt
obligations could enable us to curtail debt service payments
with respect to such bonds while continuing to use the
facilities and making only true lease payments, such as ground
rent to the relevant airport operator.

To date, we have filed one lease recharacterization action in
Bankruptcy Court. The action relates to approximately
$47 million principal amount of special facility bonds
issued by the Regional Airports Improvement Corporation to
finance improvements to certain Los Angeles International
Airport terminal facilities occupied by us. The Bankruptcy Court
has suspended action in this matter pending a decision of the
Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals on a similar case involving
United Airlines.

Although we are committed to restructuring our real estate
related obligations in a manner that provides us with
appropriate facilities at reasonable costs while substantially
reducing our real estate related costs and



obligations, there is no assurance that such efforts will be
successful or that there will be no adverse effect on us or our
operations.

See Notes 8 and 9 to the Notes of the Consolidated
Financial Statements for further information.

Basis of Presentation of Consolidated Financial Statements

Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (“GAAP”), including the
provisions of American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants’ Statement of
Position

90-7,

“Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization Under
the Bankruptcy Code”
(“SOP

90-7”),

on a going concern basis. This contemplates the realization of
assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of
business. Accordingly, our Consolidated Financial Statements do
not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of
assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary
should we be unable to continue as a going concern.

As a result of sustained losses, labor issues and our
Chapter 11 proceedings, the realization of assets and
satisfaction of liabilities, without substantial adjustments
and/or changes in ownership, are subject to uncertainty. Given
this uncertainty, there is substantial doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern.

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements do not
purport to reflect or provide for the consequences of the
Chapter 11 proceedings. In particular, the financial
statements do not purport to show (1) as to assets, their
realizable value on a liquidation basis or their availability to
satisfy liabilities; (2) as to pre-petition liabilities,
the amounts that may be allowed for claims or contingencies, or
the status and priority thereof; (3) as to
shareowners’ equity accounts, the effect of any changes
that may be made in our capitalization; or (4) as to
operations, the effect of any changes that may be made in our
business.

Results of Operations — 2005 Compared to 2004

Net Loss

We recorded a consolidated net loss of $3.8 billion in
2005, compared to a consolidated net loss of $5.2 billion
in 2004.

Operating Revenues



Operating revenues totaled $16.2 billion in 2005, a
$956 million increase as compared to the prior year.
Passenger revenue increased 6% on a 3% increase in capacity. The
increase in passenger revenue reflects a 6% rise in RPMs, and a
flat passenger mile yield.

The relatively constant passenger mile yield reflects our lack
of pricing power due to the continuing growth of low-cost
carriers with which we compete in most of our domestic markets,
high industry capacity and price sensitivity by our customers,
enhanced by the availability of airline fare information on the
Internet. During the fourth quarter of 2005, passenger mile
yield increased 8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2004, which
reflects a general improvement in the overall business
environment and the structural changes we made to strengthen our
route network since our Chapter 11 filing. There can be no
assurance that the passenger mile yield will continue to improve.

Total Passenger Revenue per ASM (“Passenger RASM”)
increased 3% to 9.33¢. Load factor increased 1.8 points to
76.5%.

North American Passenger Revenue

— North
American passenger revenue increased 4% compared to the prior
year due to increased traffic in 2005. In the first half of 2005
yields averaged 5% below the first half of 2004, while in the
second half of 2005 yields averaged 5% higher than the second
half of 2004.

International Passenger Revenue

— Higher
international passenger revenue reflects a capacity increase of
13%. RPMs also increased 13%, while passenger mile yield
increased 4%. Passenger RASM increased 4% to 8.45¢ and load
factor remained consistent with the prior year. These increases
reflect increases in service to international destinations,
primarily in transatlantic markets.



Operating Expenses

Operating expenses for 2005 totaled $18.2 billion, which
includes a $888 million charge for restructuring, asset
writedowns, pension settlements and related items, net. For
additional information about this charge, see Note 16 of
the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating
expenses for 2004 totaled $18.5 billion and include a
$1.9 billion impairment of intangible assets related to the
write-off of goodwill associated with Atlantic Southeast
Airlines, Inc. (“ASA”) and Comair. For additional
information about this charge, see Note 7 of the Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result of these
items, operating expenses in the aggregate for 2005 and 2004 are
not comparable.

Operating capacity in 2005 compared to 2004 increased 3% to
157 billion Available Seat Miles (“ASMs”),
primarily due to operational efficiencies from the redesign of
our Atlanta hub from a banked to a continuous hub, which allowed
us to increase system-wide capacity with no additional Mainline
aircraft. Operating Cost per Available Seat Mile
(“CASM”) decreased 5% to 11.60¢ in 2005 compared
to 2004.

Salaries and related costs.

The decrease in salaries and
related costs includes a 17% decrease from salary rate
reductions for our pilot and nonpilot employees and a 7% decline
due to lower headcount.

Aircraft fuel.

Aircraft fuel expense increased
$1.3 billion, or 46% driven by higher fuel prices, which
were slightly offset by a reduction in total gallons consumed
due to our sale of ASA to SkyWest, Inc. (“SkyWest”) on
September 7, 2005. See “Financial Condition and
Liquidity — Sale of ASA” below for information
about our sale of ASA. Our average fuel price per gallon
increased 47% to $1.71 while total gallons consumed decreased
1%. Fare increases implemented during 2005 in response to rising
aircraft fuel prices offset only a small portion of those cost
increases. During 2005, we had no significant hedges or
contractual arrangements to reduce our fuel costs below market
levels. Our fuel expense is shown net of fuel hedge gains of
$105 million in 2004.

Contract carrier arrangements.

Contract carrier
arrangements expense increased primarily due to (1) a
change in how we account for ASA’s expenses as a result of
its sale to SkyWest and (2) new contract carrier agreements
with Shuttle America Corporation (“Shuttle America”)
and Freedom Airlines, Inc. (“Freedom”). These
increases were partially offset by the termination of our
contract carrier arrangement with Flyi, Inc. in 2004. After the
sale of ASA to SkyWest, expenses related to ASA are shown as
contract carrier arrangements expense; prior to the sale,
expenses related to ASA as our wholly owned subsidiary were
reported in the applicable expense line item.



Aircraft rent.

The decrease in aircraft rent expense
largely reflects a 21% decrease due to our lease restructuring
in the December 2004 quarter, which resulted in the
reclassification of certain aircraft leases from operating to
capital. As discussed below, this reclassification increased our
interest expense. The reduction in aircraft rent expense also
reflects our rejection of the leases for 50 aircraft, the
renegotiation of the leases for seven aircraft and the
repossession of 15 aircraft in connection with our
Chapter 11 proceedings during 2005.

Restructuring, asset writedowns, pension settlements and
related items, net.

Restructuring, asset writedowns, pension
settlements and related items, net for 2005 includes:

Restructuring, asset writedowns, pension settlements and related
items, net for 2004 includes (1) a $527 million gain
related to the elimination of the healthcare coverage subsidy
for nonpilot employees who retire after January 1, 2006;
(2) settlement charges totaling $251 million primarily
related to the Pilot Plan; (3) a $194 million charge
related to voluntary and involuntary workforce reduction
programs; and (4) a $41 million aircraft impairment
charge related to our agreement, entered into in the September
2004 quarter, to sell eight owned MD-11 aircraft.

Other.

The increase in other operating expenses primarily
reflects a 13% rise due to the increase of incremental costs
associated with our SkyMiles frequent flyer program (for further
information regarding our SkyMiles frequent flyer program, see
Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements) and a 5% increase from higher fuel taxes. These
increases were partially offset by the impact of our sale of ASA.

Other Income (Expense)

Other expenses, net for 2005 increased 42% to $974 million
compared to other expenses, net of $684 million for 2004.
This change is primarily attributable to the following:

•

Interest expense increased
    primarily due to a 31% increase from higher levels of debt
    outstanding and higher interest rates as well as a 10% rise due
    to additional interest related to the reclassification of
    certain aircraft leases from operating leases to capital leases
    as a result of renegotiations during the December 2004 quarter
    (see discussion of aircraft rent expense above). These increases
    were offset by a 15% decrease due to the accounting treatment of
    certain interest charges under our Chapter 11 proceedings
    (see discussion of interest expense in Note 2 of the Notes
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

•

Gain from sale of investments
    was $123 million in 2004 primarily due to the sale of our
    remaining equity interest in Orbitz, Inc. (“Orbitz”).
    For additional information about the sale of our investment in
    Orbitz, see Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.



Reorganization Items, Net

Reorganization items refer to revenues, expenses (including
professional fees), realized gains and losses and provisions for
losses that are realized or incurred in the bankruptcy
proceedings. The following table summarizes the components
included in reorganization items, net on our Consolidated
Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31,
2005:

(1)

Estimated allowed claims from our rejection of the leases for 50
    aircraft, the renegotiation of the leases for seven aircraft and
    the repossession of 15 aircraft.

(2)

We record an estimated claim associated with the rejection of an
    executory contract or unexpired lease when we file a motion with
    the Bankruptcy Court to reject such contract or lease and
    believe that it is probable the motion will be approved. We
    record an estimated claim associated with the renegotiation of
    an executory contract or unexpired lease when the renegotiated
    terms of such contract or lease are not opposed or otherwise
    approved by the Bankruptcy Court and there is sufficient
    information to estimate the claim.

(3)

Reflects the write-off of certain debt issuance costs and
    premiums in conjunction with valuing unsecured and undersecured
    debt.

(4)

Estimated allowed claims associated with facility leases and
    related bond obligations.

Claims related to reorganization items are reflected in
liabilities subject to compromise in our Consolidated Balance
Sheet as of December 31, 2005.

Income Tax Benefit (Provision)

In 2004, we recorded a valuation allowance on our net deferred
tax assets as we determined it was more likely than not that we
would not be able to realize the benefit of those tax assets. In
2005, we increased our valuation allowance by approximately
$1.6 billion. As a result, our effective tax rate was
(1.1)% and 30.2% for 2005 and 2004, respectively. For additional
information about the income tax valuation allowance, see
Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Results of Operations — 2004 Compared to 2003

Net Loss

We recorded a consolidated net loss of $5.2 billion in
2004, compared to a consolidated net loss of $773 million
in 2003.

Operating Revenues

Operating revenues totaled $15.2 billion in 2004, a 6%
increase from 2003. Passenger revenue increased 6% on a 9%
increase in capacity. The increase in passenger revenue reflects
an 11% rise in RPMs and a 4% decline in passenger mile yield.
The increase in capacity was primarily driven by the restoration
of flights that we reduced in 2003 due to the war in Iraq. The
decline in the passenger mile yield reflected our lack of
pricing power due to the continuing growth of low-cost carriers
with which we compete in most of our domestic markets, high
industry capacity and increased price sensitivity by our
customers, enhanced by the availability of airline fare
information on the Internet.

Passenger RASM decreased 3% to 9.09¢. Load factor increased
1.4 points to 74.7%.



North American Passenger Revenues.

North American
passenger revenues increased 4% to $11.1 billion for 2004
on a capacity increase of 7%. RPMs increased 9%, while passenger
mile yield fell 4%. Passenger RASM decreased 3% to 9.28¢.
Load factor increased by 1.1 points to 73.7%.

International Passenger Revenues.

International passenger
revenues increased 18% to $2.6 billion during 2004 on a
capacity increase of 15%. RPMs increased 19%, while passenger
mile yield remained unchanged. Passenger RASM increased 3% to
8.16¢, and load factor rose 2.2 points to 78.9%. All of
these increases are primarily due to the depressed levels in the
prior year from the war in Iraq.

Cargo and Other Revenues.

Cargo revenues increased 7% to
$500 million in 2004 primarily due to a 13% increase from
higher international freight volume and yield, which was
partially offset by a 5% decrease due to lower mail volume and
yield. Cargo ton miles increased 6%, while cargo ton mile yield
remained relatively flat. Other revenues increased 15% to
$945 million, primarily reflecting a 6% increase due to
revenue from new airport handling contracts and other
miscellaneous contracts, a 5% rise due to increased
administrative service charges, and a 3% increase due to higher
codeshare revenue from capacity increases.

Operating Expense

Operating expenses were $18.5 billion for 2004, a 23%, or
$3.5 billion, increase over 2003. As discussed below, the
increase in operating expenses was primarily due to (1) a
$1.9 billion goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2004;
(2) significantly higher fuel prices in 2004 than in 2003;
and (3) $398 million in reimbursements we received
under the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act
(“Appropriations Act”) in 2003 which were recorded as
an offset to operating expenses in that year. Operating capacity
increased 9% to 152 billion ASMs primarily due to the
restoration of capacity that we reduced in 2003 due to the war
in Iraq. CASM increased 13% to 12.23¢.

Salaries and related costs were relatively flat at
$6.3 billion. This reflects a 3% decline due to a decrease
in benefit expenses from our cost savings initiatives and a 2%
decline due to lower Mainline headcount. These decreases were
offset by (1) a 3% increase due to higher pension and
related expense; (2) a 1% increase due to a 4.5% salary
rate increase in May 2004 for our pilots under their collective
bargaining agreement which was partially offset by their rate
decrease effective December 1, 2004; and (3) a 1%
increase due to growth in operations.

Aircraft fuel expense increased 51%, or $986 million, to
$2.9 billion, with approximately $820 million of the
increase resulting from higher fuel prices. The average fuel
price per gallon increased 42% to $1.16, and total gallons
consumed increased 7%. Approximately 8% and 65% of our aircraft
fuel requirements were hedged during 2004 and 2003,
respectively. As discussed in Note 6 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2004, we settled
all of our fuel hedge contracts prior to their scheduled
settlement dates, resulting in a deferred gain of
$82 million that we recognized during 2004. In 2004, our
fuel expense is shown net of fuel hedge gains of
$105 million, which included the gain related to the early
settlement. Our fuel expense for 2003 is shown net of fuel hedge
gains of $152 million.

Contracted services expense increased 13%, primarily reflecting
a 4% increase from new contracts to provide airport handling and
other miscellaneous services, a 2% increase due to technology
projects, a 2% increase due to the suspension of the
Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”)
security fee from June 1, 2003 to September 30, 2003
and subsequent reimbursements and a 2% increase resulting from
higher capacity.

Expenses from our contract carrier arrangements increased 19% to
$932 million, largely reflecting an 8% increase from higher
fuel costs, a 7% increase due to growth under certain contract
carrier arrangements and a 3% increase from higher maintenance
expense.

Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs increased 8%,
primarily due to increased materials volume and higher costs
from scheduled maintenance events. Other selling expenses
increased 5%, primarily reflecting a 3% rise from increased
credit card charges due to higher traffic and a 1% increase from
advertising and promotions. Passenger service expense increased
7%, primarily due to increased traffic.

During December 2004, we recorded a $1.9 billion impairment
charge, primarily related to goodwill, in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
No. 142, “Goodwill and Other



Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”). For
additional information about the impairment charge, see
Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Restructuring, asset writedowns, pension settlements and related
items, net totaled a $41 million net gain for 2004 compared
to a $268 million net charge for 2003. The 2004 amount
includes (1) a $527 million gain related to the
elimination of the healthcare coverage subsidy for nonpilot
employees who retire after January 1, 2006;
(2) settlement charges totaling $257 million primarily
related to our Pilot Plan; (3) a $194 million charge
related to voluntary and involuntary workforce reduction
programs; and (4) a $41 million aircraft impairment
charge related to our agreement, entered into in the September
2004 quarter, to sell eight owned MD-11 aircraft. The charge for
2003 consists of (1) $212 million related to
settlements under the Pilot Plan; (2) $43 million
related to a net curtailment loss for the cost of pension and
postretirement obligations for participants under our 2002
workforce reduction programs; and (3) $41 million
associated with the planned sale of 11 B737-800 aircraft. This
charge was partially offset by a $28 million reduction to
operating expenses from revised estimates of remaining costs
associated with our restructuring activities. For additional
information about these restructuring, asset writedowns, pension
settlements and related items, net, see Note 16 of the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Reimbursements under the Appropriations Act totaled
$398 million in 2003, representing reimbursements from the
U.S. government to air carriers for certain passenger and
air carrier security fees paid to the TSA. We recorded these
amounts as a reduction to operating expenses in our Consolidated
Statement of Operations. For additional information about the
Appropriations Act, see Note 20 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other operating expenses increased 20%. This primarily reflects
a 7% increase from higher professional fees mainly from our
restructuring and contingency planning efforts, a 4% increase
due to a loss on certain aircraft transactions, a 4% increase
from a rise in the navigation charges due to increased
international capacity and a 4% increase due to higher fuel
taxes.

Operating Loss and Operating Margin

We incurred an operating loss of $3.3 billion for 2004,
compared to an operating loss of $785 million for 2003.
Operating margin, which is the ratio of operating income (loss)
to operating revenues, was (22%) and (6%) for 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

Other Income

Other expense, net for 2004 was $684 million, compared to
other expense, net of $404 million for 2003. This change is
primarily attributable to the following:



due 2005 for newly issued unsecured 8.0% Senior Notes due
    in December 2007. During 2003, we recorded a $15 million
    loss from our purchase of a portion of the Delta Family-Care
    Savings Plan’s Series C Guaranteed Serial ESOP Notes,
    offset by a $15 million gain related to a debt exchange.

Income Tax Provision (Benefit)

During 2004, we recorded an additional valuation allowance
against our net deferred income tax assets, which resulted in a
$1.2 billion non-cash charge to income tax expense on our
Consolidated Statement of Operations. For additional information
about the income tax valuation allowance, see Note 11 of
the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Financial Condition and Liquidity

The matters described herein, to the extent that they relate to
future events or expectations, may be significantly affected by
our Chapter 11 proceedings. Those proceedings will involve,
or may result in, various restrictions on our activities,
limitations on financing, the need to obtain Bankruptcy Court
and Creditors Committee approval for various matters and
uncertainty as to relationships with vendors, suppliers,
customers and others whom we may conduct or seek to conduct
business.

Significant Liquidity Events

Debtor-in

-Possession
    Financing

On September 16, 2005, we entered into the DIP Credit
Facility, which permits us to borrow up to $1.9 billion
from a syndicate of lenders arranged by GECC and Morgan Stanley
Senior Funding, Inc. (“Morgan Stanley”), for which
GECC acts as administrative agent. The Bankruptcy Court approved
our entering into the DIP Credit Facility.

The DIP Credit Facility consists of a $600 million Term
Loan A arranged by GECC (the “TLA”), a
$700 million Term Loan B arranged by GECC (the
“TLB”) and a $600 million Term Loan C
arranged jointly by GECC and Morgan Stanley (the
“TLC;” together with the TLA and TLB, collectively,
the “DIP Loans”). We applied a portion of these
proceeds to (1) repay in full the $480 million
principal amount outstanding under the GE Pre-Petition Facility;
(2) repay in full the $500 million principal amount
outstanding under our Amex Pre-Petition Facility; and
(3) prepay $50 million of the $350 million
principal amount outstanding under our Amex Post-Petition
Facility. The remainder of the proceeds of the DIP Loans is
available for our general corporate purposes.

Availability of funds under the TLA is subject to a borrowing
base calculation. If the outstanding amount of the TLA at any
time exceeds the borrowing base, we must immediately repay the
TLA or post cash collateral in an amount equal to the excess.

The TLA, TLB and TLC each mature on March 16, 2008. Prior
to the Amended and Restated DIP Credit Facility (defined below),
the TLA bore interest, at our option, at LIBOR plus 4.50% or an
index rate plus 3.75%; the TLB bore interest, at our option, at
LIBOR plus 6.50% or an index rate plus 5.75%; and the TLC bore
interest, at our option, at LIBOR plus 9.00% or an index rate
plus 8.25%.

We may also request the issuance of up to $200 million in
letters of credit under the DIP Credit Facility, which amount
must be fully cash collateralized at all times such letters of
credit are outstanding.

Our obligations under the DIP Credit Facility are guaranteed by
substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries (the
“Guarantors”). We will be required to make certain
mandatory repayments of the DIP Loans in the event we sell
certain assets, subject to certain exceptions. Any portion of
the DIP Loans that are repaid through either voluntary or
mandatory prepayment may not be reborrowed.

The DIP Loans and the related guarantees are secured by first
priority liens on substantially all of our and the
Guarantors’ present and future assets (including assets
that previously secured the GE Pre-Petition Facility) and by
junior liens on certain of our and the Guarantors’ other
assets (including certain accounts receivable and other assets
subject to a first priority lien securing the Amex Post-Petition
Facility described below), in each case subject to certain
exceptions, including an exception for assets which are subject
to



financing agreements that are entitled to the benefits of
Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy Code, to the extent such
financing agreements prohibit such liens.

The DIP Credit Facility includes affirmative, negative and
financial covenants that impose substantial restrictions on our
financial and business operations, including our ability to,
among other things, incur or secure other debt, make
investments, sell assets and pay dividends or repurchase stock.

The financial covenants require us to:

•

maintain unrestricted funds in
    an amount not less than $750 million through May 31,
    2006; $1 billion at all times from June 1, 2006
    through November 30, 2006; $750 million at all times
    from December 1, 2006 through February 28, 2007; and
    $1 billion at all times thereafter (“Liquidity
    Covenant”);

•

not exceed specified levels of
    capital expenditures during any fiscal quarter; and

•

achieve specified levels of
    EBITDAR, as defined, for successive trailing

12-month

periods
    through March 2008. During 2005, we were required to achieve
    increasing levels of EBITDAR, including EBITDAR of
    $644 million for the

12-month

period ending
    December 31, 2005. Thereafter, the minimum EBITDAR level
    for each successive trailing

12-month

period
    continues to increase, including $1.372 billion for the

12-month

period ended
    December 31, 2006; $1.988 billion for the

12-month

period ending
    December 31, 2007; and $2 billion for each

12-month

period ending
    thereafter. If our cash on hand exceeds the minimum cash on hand
    that we are required to maintain pursuant to the Liquidity
    Covenant, then the EBITDAR level that we are required to achieve
    is effectively reduced by the amount of such excess cash, up to
    a maximum reduction of $250 million from the required
    EBITDAR level.

The DIP Credit Facility contains events of default customary for

debtor-in

-possession
financings, including cross-defaults to the Amex Post-Petition
Facility and certain change of control events. The DIP Credit
Facility also includes events of default specific to our
business, including if all or substantially all of our flight
and other operations are suspended for longer than two days,
other than in connection with a general suspension of all
U.S. flights, or if certain routes and, subject to certain
materiality thresholds, other routes, and slots and gates are
revoked, terminated or cancelled. Upon the occurrence of an
event of default, the outstanding obligations under the DIP
Credit Facility may be accelerated and become due and payable
immediately.

On March 27, 2006, we executed an amended and restated
credit agreement (the “Amended and Restated DIP Credit
Facility”) with a syndicate of lenders led by GECC and
Morgan Stanley that replaced the DIP Credit Facility in its
entirety. The aggregate amounts available to be borrowed are not
changed from the DIP Credit Facility by the Amended and Restated
DIP Credit Facility. However, under the Amended and Restated DIP
Credit Facility, the interest rates on borrowings have been
reduced: the TLA bears interest, at our option, at LIBOR plus
2.75% or an index rate plus 2.00%; the TLB bears interest, at
our option, at LIBOR plus 4.75% or an index rate plus 4.00%; and
the TLC bears interest, at our option, at LIBOR plus 7.50% or an
index rate plus 6.75%. The Amended and Restated DIP Credit
Facility is otherwise substantially the same as the DIP Credit
Facility, including financial covenants, collateral, guarantees,
and events of default, and it allows the execution of amendments
to certain other credit facilities and the reimbursement
agreement with GECC discussed below under “GECC
Reimbursement Agreement Collateral Value Test” and in
Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Financing Agreement with Amex

On September 16, 2005, we entered into the Modification
Agreement with Amex and American Express Bank, F.S.B. pursuant
to which we modified certain existing agreements with Amex,
including the Amex Pre-Petition Facility under which we had
borrowed $500 million from Amex. The Amex Pre-Petition
Facility consisted of substantially identical supplements to the
two existing agreements under which Amex purchases SkyMiles from
us, the Membership Rewards Agreement and the Co-Branded Credit
Card Program Agreement (collectively, the “SkyMiles
Agreements”). The Bankruptcy Court approved our entering
into the Modification Agreement and our assuming the SkyMiles
Agreements. Amex has the right, in certain



circumstances, to impose a significant holdback of our
receivables, including for tickets purchased using an American
Express credit card but not yet used for travel.

As required by the Modification Agreement, on September 16,
2005, we used a portion of the proceeds of our initial borrowing
under the DIP Credit Facility to repay the outstanding principal
amount of $500 million, together with interest thereon,
that we had previously borrowed from Amex under the Amex
Pre-Petition Facility. Simultaneously, we borrowed
$350 million from Amex pursuant to the terms of the Amex
Post-Petition Facility. The amount borrowed under the Amex
Post-Petition Facility will be credited, in equal monthly
installments, towards Amex’s actual purchases of SkyMiles
during the

17-month

period commencing in July 2006. Any unused prepayment credit
will carryover to the next succeeding month with a final
repayment date for any then outstanding advances no later than
November 30, 2007. Prior to March 27, 2006, the
outstanding advances bore a fee, equivalent to interest, at a
rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 10.25%. As the date of
effectiveness of the Amended and Restated DIP Credit Facility,
to which Amex consented, the fee on outstanding advances
decreased to a rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 8.75%.

On October 7, 2005, Amex consented to an amendment to the
DIP Credit Facility in return for a prepayment of
$50 million under the Amex Post-Petition Facility. The
prepayment will be credited in inverse order of monthly
installments during the

17-month

period
commencing in July 2006.

Our obligations under the Amex Post-Petition Facility are
guaranteed by the Guarantors of the DIP Credit Facility. Our
obligations under certain of our agreements with Amex, including
our obligations under the Amex Post-Petition Facility, the
SkyMiles Agreements and the agreement pursuant to which Amex
processes travel and other purchases made from us using Amex
credit cards (“Card Services Agreement”), and the
corresponding obligations of the Guarantors, are secured by
(1) a first priority lien on our right to payment from Amex
for purchased SkyMiles, our interest in the SkyMiles Agreements
and related assets and our right to payment from Amex under, and
our interest in, the Card Services Agreement and (2) a
junior lien on the collateral securing the DIP Credit Facility.

With certain exceptions, the Amex Post-Petition Facility
contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants
substantially the same as in the DIP Credit Facility. The Amex
Post-Petition Facility contains customary events of default,
including cross-defaults to our obligations under the DIP Credit
Facility and to defaults under certain other of our agreements
with Amex. The Amex Post-Petition Facility also includes events
of default specific to our business, including upon cessation of
50% or more of our business operations (measured by net revenue)
and other events of default comparable to those in the DIP
Credit Facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default
under the Amex Post-Petition Facility, the loan under the Amex
Post-Petition Facility may be accelerated and become due and
payable immediately. An event of default under the Amex
Post-Petition facility results in an immediate cross-default
under the Amended and Restated DIP Credit Facility.

The Amended and Restated DIP Credit Facility and the Amex
Post-Petition Facility are subject to an intercreditor agreement
that generally regulates the respective rights and priorities of
the lenders under each Facility with respect to collateral and
certain other matters.

Sale of ASA

On September 7, 2005, we sold ASA to SkyWest for a purchase
price of $425 million. In conjunction with this
transaction, we amended our contract carrier agreements with ASA
and SkyWest Airlines, Inc. (“SkyWest Airlines”), a
wholly owned subsidiary of SkyWest, under which those regional
airlines serve as Delta Connection carriers. The sale of ASA
resulted in an immaterial gain that is being amortized over the
life of our contract carrier agreement with ASA. For additional
information on our contract carrier agreements with ASA and
SkyWest Airlines, see Note 10 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

At the closing of our sale of ASA, we received
$350 million, representing $330 million of purchase
price and $20 million related to aircraft deposits. As the
result of our assumption of our contract carrier agreements with
ASA and SkyWest Airlines in our Chapter 11 proceedings, on
November 2, 2005, we received an additional
$120 million, consisting of $90 million of deferred
purchase price and $30 million in aircraft deposits. We may
receive up to the remaining $5 million of deferred purchase
price depending on resolution



of a working capital adjustment. Upon the sale of ASA, we
repaid, as required, $100 million of outstanding borrowings
under a pre-petition credit facility. The remaining proceeds
from our sale of ASA are available for general corporate
purposes. See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for a list of the major classes of assets
sold and liabilities assumed by SkyWest.

Letter of Credit Facility Related to Visa/MasterCard Credit
    Card Processing Agreement

On January 26, 2006, with the authorization from the
Bankruptcy Court, we entered into a letter of credit facility
with Merrill Lynch. Under the Letter of Credit Reimbursement
Agreement, Merrill Lynch issued a $300 million irrevocable
standby letter of credit (“Merrill Lynch Letter of
Credit”) for the benefit of our Visa/MasterCard credit card
processor (“Processor”). As contemplated in our
Visa/MasterCard credit card processing agreement
(“Processing Agreement”), we are providing the Merrill
Lynch Letter of Credit as a substitution for a portion of the
cash reserve that the Processor maintains. Under the Processing
Agreement, the Processor is permitted to maintain a reserve from
our receivables that is equal to the Processor’s potential
liability for tickets purchased with Visa or MasterCard which
have not yet been used for travel (the “unflown ticket
liability”). We estimate that the reserve, which adjusts
daily, will range between $450 million and
$850 million during the term of the Processing Agreement.
The Processing Agreement allows us to substitute the Merrill
Lynch Letter of Credit for a portion of the cash reserve equal
to the lesser of $300 million and 45% of the unflown ticket
liability.

The Merrill Lynch Letter of Credit may only be drawn upon
following certain events as described in the Processing
Agreement. In addition, the Processor must first apply both the
portion of the cash reserve that the Processor will continue to
hold and any offsets from collections by the Processor before
drawing on the Merrill Lynch Letter of Credit to cover fare
refunds paid to passengers by the Processor.

Our obligation to reimburse Merrill Lynch under the Merrill
Lynch Letter of Credit for any draws made by the Processor is
not secured and will constitute a super-priority administrative
expense claim that is subject to certain other claims, including
our post-petition financing. The Merrill Lynch Letter of Credit
will expire on January 21, 2008, but will renew
automatically for one year periods thereafter unless Merrill
Lynch notifies the Processor 420 days prior to the
applicable expiration date that it will not renew the Merrill
Lynch Letter of Credit.

Covenants

As discussed above, the DIP Credit Facility and the Amex
Post-Petition Facility include certain affirmative, negative and
financial covenants. In addition, as is customary in the airline
industry, our aircraft lease and financing agreements require
that we maintain certain levels of insurance coverage, including
war-risk insurance. Failure to maintain these coverages may
result in an interruption to our operations. See Note 10 of
the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information about our war-risk insurance currently
provided by the U.S. government.

We were in compliance with these covenant requirements at
December 31, 2005 and 2004.

GECC Reimbursement Agreement Collateral Value Test.

We
have an agreement with GECC (the “Reimbursement
Agreement”) under which GECC has issued irrevocable,
direct-pay letters of credit totaling $403 million to pay
the principal and interest on $397 million aggregate
principal amount of tax-exempt special facility bonds
(“Bonds”) issued to refinance the construction cost of
certain airport facilities leased to us. We are required to
reimburse GECC for drawings under the letters of credit, and our
reimbursement obligation is secured by certain of our aircraft
and other assets. The Reimbursement Agreement contains a minimum
collateral value test (“Collateral Value Test”).

We will not satisfy the Collateral Value Test if (1) the
aggregate amount of the outstanding letters of credit plus any
other amounts payable by us under the Reimbursement Agreement
(“Aggregate Obligations”) on March 20, 2006 is
more than 60% of the appraised value of aircraft collateral
which secures our reimbursement obligation to GECC plus the fair
market value of permitted investments held as part of the
collateral and (2) within 60 days thereafter, we have
not either provided additional collateral to GECC in the form of
cash or aircraft or caused a reduction in the Aggregate
Obligations such that the Collateral Value Test is satisfied. If
we fail to satisfy the Collateral Value Test on May 19,
2006, an event of default will



occur. We currently estimate that, in order to satisfy the
Collateral Value Test on May 19, 2006, we will need to
provide GECC with additional collateral in the form of cash in
the amount of approximately $50 million.

We entered into a letter of intent with GECC in December 2005 to
amend the Reimbursement Agreement to eliminate the Collateral
Value Test, among other things. In February 2006, the Bankruptcy
Court approved the letter of intent, but because the completion
of the transactions contemplated in the letter of intent is
subject to definitive documentation and certain other
conditions, there can be no assurance that the Collateral Value
Test will be amended or eliminated. If the Collateral Value Test
is not amended or eliminated, we intend to satisfy it. See
Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for further information regarding the Reimbursement
Agreement and the Bonds.

Sources and Uses of Cash

Our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were
$2.0 billion at December 31, 2005, compared to
$1.8 billion at December 31, 2004. Restricted cash
totaled $928 million and $350 million at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Cash and cash
equivalents as of December 31, 2005 include approximately
$155 million, which is set aside for payment of certain
operational taxes and fees to various governmental authorities.

Cash flows from operating activities

For the year ended December 31, 2005, cash provided by
operating activities totaled $175 million. This is
comprised of our consolidated net loss for the year of
$3.8 billion offset by noncash adjustments totaling
approximately $3.0 billion and other changes in working
capital of approximately $959 million.

•

The $3.0 billion in noncash
    adjustments were primarily related to $1.3 billion of
    depreciation and amortization expense, $896 million of
    pension, postretirement and postemployment expense in excess of
    payments, net and $884 million of net noncash charges
    related to reorganization items.

•

The $959 million change in
    working capital items was primarily related to a
    $336 million sale of short-term investments, an increase of
    $145 million in our air traffic liability due to higher
    bookings and preservation of cash due to the protection afforded
    to us under the Chapter 11 proceedings.

Cash flows from investing activities

For the year ended December 31, 2005, cash used in
investing activities totaled $460 million, which includes
the following significant items:



Cash flows from financing activities

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, cash
provided by financing activities totaled $830 million and
includes the following significant amounts:

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of
December 31, 2005 and related to debt; operating leases;
aircraft order commitments; capital leases; contract carrier
obligations; interest and related payments; other material,
noncancelable purchase obligations; other liabilities; and
liabilities subject to compromise. We are in the process of
evaluating our executory contracts in order to determine which
contracts will be assumed in our Chapter 11 proceedings.
Therefore, obligations as currently quantified in the table
below and in the text immediately following the footnotes to the
table will continue to change. The table below does not include
contracts that we have successfully rejected through our
Chapter 11 proceedings. The table also does not include
commitments that are contingent on events or other factors that
are uncertain or unknown at this time, some of which are
discussed in footnotes to this table and in the text immediately
following the footnotes.

(1)

These amounts are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
    For additional information about our debt and related matters,
    see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

(2)

Although we are not generally permitted to make any payments on
    pre-petition obligations as a result of our Chapter 11
    proceedings, we have reached agreements with certain aircraft
    financing parties under Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy Code
    and received approval from the Bankruptcy Court to continue to
    make payments on certain aircraft



debt and lease obligations. The
    amounts included remain subject to change until a plan of
    reorganization is approved and we emerge from Chapter 11.

(3)

This amount includes our
    noncancelable operating leases and our lease payments related to
    aircraft under our contract carrier agreements with ASA, Skywest
    Airlines, Freedom Airlines, Inc. (“Freedom”) and
    Shuttle America. See Note 9 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

(4)

Our aircraft order commitments as
    of December 31, 2005 consist of firm orders to purchase
    five B777-200 aircraft and 50 B737-800 aircraft. This includes
    commitments to purchase 10 B737-800 aircraft, which we have
    entered into a definitive agreement to sell to a third party
    immediately following delivery of these aircraft to us by the
    manufacturer starting in 2007. The impact of these sales on the
    future commitments above would be a total reduction of
    approximately $395 million during the period
    2006 – 2008.

(5)

Interest payments related to
    capital lease obligations are included in the table. The present
    value of these obligations, excluding interest, is included on
    our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For additional information
    about our capital lease obligations, see Note 9 of the
    Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(6)

This amount represents our
    minimum fixed obligation under our contract carrier agreements
    with Chautauqua Airlines, Inc. (“Chautauqua”), Shuttle
    America, ASA, SkyWest Airlines, and Freedom (excluding contract
    carrier lease payments accounted for as operating leases, (see
    footnote (3) above)). For additional information regarding our
    contract carrier agreements, see Note 10 of the Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(7)

Includes purchase obligations
    pursuant to which we are required to make minimum payments for
    goods and services, including but not limited to insurance,
    outsourced human resource services, marketing, maintenance,
    obligations related to Comair, technology, and other third party
    services and products. For additional information about other
    commitments and contingencies, see Note 10 of the Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(8)

Represents other liabilities on
    our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we are obligated to
    make future payments related to medical benefit costs incurred
    but not yet paid and payments required under the pilot
    collective bargaining agreement for unused vacation time. These
    liabilities are not included in any other line item on this
    table.

(9)

In addition to the contractual
    obligations included in the table, we have significant cash
    obligations that are not included in the table. For example, we
    will pay wages required under collective bargaining agreements;
    fund pension plans (as discussed below); purchase capacity under
    contract carrier arrangements (as discussed below); and pay
    credit card processing fees and fees for other goods and
    services, including those related to fuel, maintenance and
    commissions. While we are parties to legally binding contracts
    regarding these goods and services, the actual commitment is
    contingent on certain factors such as volume and/or variable
    rates that are uncertain or unknown at this time. Therefore,
    these items are not included in the table. In addition, purchase
    orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from
    the table and any amounts which we are liable for under the
    purchase orders are included in current liabilities on our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The following items are not included in the table above:

Pension Plans.

We sponsor defined contribution and
defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and
retirees. Our funding obligations for certain of these plans are
governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
(“ERISA”). Estimates of pension plan funding
requirements can vary materially from actual funding
requirements because the estimates are based on various
assumptions, including those described below.

Defined Contribution Pension Plans (“DC
Plans”)

— During the year ended
December 31, 2005, we contributed approximately
$100 million to our DC Plans. Estimates of future funding
requirements under the DC Plans are based on various
assumptions. These assumptions include, among other things, the
number of participants in the DC Plans; the salary levels of
those participants; and the outcome of efforts to modify our
collective bargaining agreement with ALPA, either on a
consensual basis or under the Chapter 11 process. Assuming
current plan design, we expect to contribute approximately
$100 million to our DC Plans in 2006.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans (“DB
Plans”)

— Our principal DB Plans are the
Pilot Plan and the Nonpilot Plan. During the year ended
December 31, 2005, we contributed approximately
$325 million to our DB Plans. Estimates of future funding
requirements under the DB Plans are based on various
assumptions, including legislative changes regarding these
obligations. These assumptions also include, among other things,
the actual and projected market performance of assets of the DB
Plans; future long-term corporate bond yields; statutory
requirements; the terms of the DB Plans; and demographic data
for participants in the DB Plans, including the number of
participants, their salaries and the rate of participant
attrition.

Assuming current funding rules and current plan design, we
estimate that the funding requirements under our DB Plans for
2006, 2007 and 2008 will aggregate approximately
$3.4 billion, excluding any liquidity shortfall
contribution requirements under the Pilot Plan. Substantially
this entire amount relates to benefits



earned prior to the Petition Date. We believe we are not
required to fund such pre-petition amounts while operating under
Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Certain entities
unsuccessfully challenged this position in Bankruptcy Court, and
this issue is currently on appeal. If our DB Plans continue
after we emerge from Chapter 11, we may be required to
fully fund required contributions at that date, including
contributions related to benefits earned prior to our Petition
Date.

Based on our preliminary five-year forecast and additional
information regarding the assets and liabilities for the DB
Plans, we believe that, under current pension funding rules, we
would need to seek distress termination of both the Nonpilot
Plan and the Pilot Plan in order to successfully reorganize and
emerge from Chapter 11. Proposed legislation that passed in
the U.S. Senate and is now pending in a House —
Senate Conference Committee would extend our funding obligations
for our DB Plans over 20 years. If the pending legislation
is enacted in the form in which it passed the U.S. Senate,
we hope to avoid a distress termination of the Nonpilot Plan,
though there is no assurance that we can do so. We currently
believe, however, that the existence of the lump sum option in
the Pilot Plan and the significant number of early pilot
retirements it may drive make it unlikely that we could satisfy
our funding obligations to that plan even if the pending
legislation is enacted in the form in which it passed the
U.S. Senate. See Note 12 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for information about the lump
sum option under the Pilot Plan and our pension plans generally.

Contract Carriers.

We have long-term contract carrier
agreements with the following five regional air carriers (in
addition to Comair): Chautauqua, Shuttle America, ASA, SkyWest
Airlines, and Freedom. Under these agreements, the carriers
operate certain of their aircraft using our flight code, and we
schedule those aircraft, sell the seats on those flights and
retain the related revenues. We pay those airlines an amount, as
defined in the applicable agreement, which is based on a
determination of their cost of operating those flights and other
factors intended to approximate market rates for those services.

Under these long-term contract carrier agreements, we are
obligated to pay certain minimum fixed obligations, which are
included in the table above. The remaining estimated expenses
are not included in the table because these expenses are
contingent based on the costs associated with the operation of
contract carrier flights by those air carriers as well as rates
that are unknown at this time. We cannot reasonably estimate at
this time our expenses under the contract carrier agreements in
2006 and thereafter.

We may terminate the Chautauqua and Shuttle America agreements
without cause at any time after May 2010 and January 2013,
respectively, by providing certain advance notice. If we
terminate either the Chautauqua or Shuttle America agreements
without cause, Chautauqua or Shuttle America, respectively, has
the right to (1) assign to us leased aircraft that the
airline operates for us, provided we are able to continue the
leases on the same terms the airline had prior to the assignment
and (2) require us to purchase or lease any of the aircraft
that the airline owns and operates for us at the time of the
termination. If we are required to purchase aircraft owned by
Chautauqua or Shuttle America, the purchase price would be equal
to the amount necessary to (1) reimburse Chautauqua or
Shuttle America for the equity it provided to purchase the
aircraft and (2) repay in full any debt outstanding at such
time that is not being assumed in connection with such purchase.
If we are required to lease aircraft owned by Chautauqua or
Shuttle America, the lease would have (1) a rate equal to
the debt payments of Chautauqua or Shuttle America for the debt
financing of the aircraft calculated as if 90% of the aircraft
was debt financed by Chautauqua or Shuttle America and
(2) other specified terms and conditions.

We estimate that the total fair values, determined as of
December 31, 2005, of the aircraft that Chautauqua or
Shuttle America could assign to us or require that we purchase
if we terminate without cause our contract carrier agreements
with those airlines are $549 million and $386 million,
respectively. The actual amount that we may be required to pay
in these circumstances may be materially different from these
estimates.

For additional information on contract carrier agreements see
Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Interest and Related Payments.

Estimated amounts for
future interest and related payments in connection with our debt
obligations are based on the fixed and variable interest rates
specified in the associated debt agreements. We expect to pay
$1.05 billion related to interest on fixed and variable
rate debt



in 2006. Estimates on variable rate interest were calculated
using implied short term LIBOR rates based on LIBOR at
February 1, 2006. The related payments represent credit
enhancements required in conjunction with certain financing
agreements. As a result of our Chapter 11 filing, actual
interest expense in 2006 is expected to be less than the
contractual interest expense. See Note 2 of the Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our
policy relating to interest expense.

Legal Contingencies.

We are involved in various legal
proceedings relating to antitrust matters, employment practices,
environmental issues and other matters concerning our business.
We cannot reasonably estimate the potential loss for certain
legal proceedings because, for example, the litigation is in its
early stages or the plaintiff does not specify the damages being
sought.

As a result of our Chapter 11 proceedings, virtually all
pre-petition pending litigation against us is stayed and related
amounts accrued have been classified in liabilities subject to
compromise on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at
December 31, 2005.

Other Contingent Obligations under Contracts.

In addition
to the contractual obligations discussed above, we have certain
contracts for goods and services that require us to pay a
penalty, acquire inventory specific to us or purchase contract
specific equipment, as defined by each respective contract, if
we terminate the contract without cause prior to its expiration
date. These obligations are contingent upon whether we terminate
the contract without cause prior to its expiration date;
therefore, no obligation would exist unless such a termination
were to occur. We also cannot predict the impact, if any, that
our Chapter 11 proceedings might have on these obligations.

For additional information about other contingencies not
discussed above as well as discussions related to general
indemnifications, see Note 10 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Application of Critical Accounting Policies

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions.
We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions, which
are based on historical experience, changes in the business
environment and other factors that management believes to be
reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ
materially from these estimates.

Revenue Recognition — Passenger Revenue.

We
record sales of passenger tickets as air traffic liabilities on
our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Passenger revenues are
recognized when we provide transportation, reducing the related
air traffic liability. We periodically evaluate the estimated
air traffic liability and record any resulting adjustments in
our Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period in which
the evaluations are completed.

We sell mileage credits in our SkyMiles frequent flyer program
to participating partners such as credit card companies, hotels
and car rental agencies. The portion of the revenue from the
sale of mileage credits that approximates the fair value of
travel to be provided is deferred. We amortize the deferred
revenue on a straight-line basis over the period when
transportation is expected to be provided. The majority of the
revenue from the sale of mileage credits, including the
amortization of deferred revenue, is recorded in passenger
revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Operations; the
remaining portion is recognized in income currently and is
classified as other revenue.

Frequent Flyer Program Liability.

We have a frequent
flyer program, the SkyMiles Program, offering incentives to
increase travel on Delta. This program allows participants to
earn mileage for travel awards by flying on Delta, Delta
Connection carriers and participating airlines, as well as
through participating partners such as credit card companies,
hotels and car rental agencies. Mileage credits can be redeemed
for free or upgraded air travel on Delta and participating
airline partners, for membership in our Crown Room Club and
for other program partner awards.

We record a liability for the estimated incremental cost of
flight awards which are earned under our SkyMiles frequent flyer
program and expected to be redeemed for travel on Delta or other
airline partners. Our incremental costs include (1) our
system average cost per passenger for fuel, food and other
direct passenger costs for awards to be redeemed on Delta and
(2) contractual costs for awards to be redeemed on



partner airlines. The liability is recorded in accounts payable,
deferred credits and other accrued liabilities on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets. We periodically record adjustments
to this liability in other operating expenses on our
Consolidated Statements of Operations based on awards earned,
awards redeemed, changes in our estimated incremental costs and
changes to the SkyMiles program.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets.

In accordance with
SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets,” we apply a fair value-based impairment test to the
net book value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
assets on an annual basis and, if certain events or
circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been
incurred, on an interim basis. The annual impairment test date
for our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets is
December 31. Intangible assets with determinable useful
lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their
estimated useful lives. Our leasehold and operating rights have
definite useful lives and are amortized over their respective
lease terms, which range from nine to 19 years.

We had one reporting unit with assigned goodwill at
December 31, 2005 and 2004. In evaluating our goodwill for
impairment, we first compare the reporting unit’s fair
value to its carrying value. We estimate the fair value of our
reporting unit by considering (1) market multiple and
recent transaction values of peer companies and
(2) projected discounted future cash flows if reasonably
estimable. In applying the projected discounted future cash flow
methodology, we (1) estimate the reporting unit’s
future cash flows based on capacity, passenger yield, traffic,
operating costs and other relevant factors and (2) discount
those cash flows based on the reporting unit’s weighted
average cost of capital. If the reporting unit’s fair value
exceeds its carrying value, no further testing is required. If,
however, the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its
fair value, we then determine the amount of the impairment
charge, if any. We recognize an impairment charge if the
carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its
implied fair value.

We perform the impairment test for our indefinite-lived
intangible assets by comparing the asset’s fair value to
its carrying value. Fair value is estimated based on projected
discounted future cash flows. We recognize an impairment charge
if the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair
value.

See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information about the goodwill and
intangible assets impairment charges recorded during 2004.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.

We record impairment
losses on long-lived assets used in operations when events and
circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired and the
undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those
assets are less than their carrying amounts. The amount of
impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying
amounts of the assets exceed the estimated fair values.

In order to evaluate potential impairment as required by
SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“SFAS 144”),
we group assets at the fleet type level (the lowest level for
which there are identifiable cash flows) and then estimate
future cash flows based on assumptions involving projections of
passenger yield, fuel costs, labor costs and other relevant
factors. Aircraft fair values are estimated by management using
published sources, appraisals and bids received from third
parties, as available. Changes in these assumptions may have a
material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. For
additional information about our accounting policy for the
impairment of long-lived assets, see Notes 2 and 7 of the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Income Tax Valuation Allowance.

In accordance with
SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”
(“SFAS 109”), deferred tax assets should be
reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not
that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized. The future realization of our net deferred tax assets
depends on the availability of sufficient future taxable income.
In making this determination, we consider all available positive
and negative evidence and make certain assumptions. We consider,
among other things, our deferred tax liabilities; the overall
business environment; our historical earnings and losses; our
industry’s historically cyclical periods of earnings and
losses; and our outlook for future years. For additional
information about income taxes, see Notes 2 and 11 of the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Pension Plans.

We sponsor defined benefit pension plans
(“Plans”) for eligible employees and retirees. The
impact of the Plans on our Consolidated Financial Statements as
of December 31, 2005 and 2004 and for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 is presented in
Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. Assuming current plan design, we currently estimate
that our defined



benefit pension plan expense in 2006 will be approximately
$450 million. The effect of our Plans on our Consolidated
Financial Statements is subject to many assumptions. We believe
the most critical assumptions are (1) the weighted average
discount rate and (2) the expected long-term rate of return
on the assets of our Plans.

We determine our weighted average discount rate on our
measurement date primarily by reference to annualized rates
earned on high quality fixed income investments and

yield-to

-maturity
analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments. We
used a weighted average discount rate of 5.69% and 6.00% at
September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Additionally,
our weighted average discount rate for net periodic benefit cost
in each of the past three years has varied from the rate
selected on our measurement date, ranging from 6.83% in 2003 to
5.81% in 2005, due to remeasurements throughout the year. The
impact of a .50% change in our weighted average discount rate is
shown in the table below.

The expected long-term rate of return on the assets of our Plans
is based primarily on specific asset investment studies for our
Plans performed by outside consultants who used historical
returns on our Plans’ assets. The investment strategy for
pension plan assets is to utilize a diversified mix of global
public and private equity portfolios, public and private fixed
income portfolios, and private real estate and natural resource
investments to earn a long-term investment return that meets or
exceeds a 9% annualized return target. The impact of a .50%
change in our expected long-term rate of return is shown in the
table below.

Our rate of change in future compensation levels is based
primarily on labor contracts with our employees under collective
bargaining agreements and expected future pay rate changes for
other employees. Due to recent employee pay reductions and the
freeze of benefit accruals effective December 31, 2005 in
our Nonpilot Plan, adjusting the rate of change in future
compensation levels does not have a significant impact on 2006
pension expense or on the accrued pension liability at
December 31, 2005.

For additional information about our pension plans, see
Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 154,
“Accounting Changes and Error Corrections”
(“SFAS 154”). This standard replaces Accounting
Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 20,
“Accounting Changes” and SFAS No. 3,
“Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial
Statements.” SFAS 154 is effective for us as of
January 1, 2006, and will impact how we report changes in
accounting, if any, on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47
(“FIN 47”), “Accounting for Conditional
Asset Retirement Obligations.” FIN 47 clarifies the
term

conditional asset retirement obligation

as used in
FASB Statement No. 143, “Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations.” Our adoption of FIN 47 did
not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial
Statements.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123
(revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment”
(“SFAS 123R”) which requires an entity to
recognize compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair
value of share based payments, such as stock options granted to
employees. This standard replaces SFAS No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”
(“SFAS 123”), and supersedes APB Opinion
No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees” (“APB 25”). We adopted
SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006, as required. Based on
stock based awards outstanding as of that date, we estimate that
related



compensation expense will be approximately $50 million and
$20 million for the years ending December 31, 2006 and
2007, respectively.

Market Risks Associated with Financial Instruments

We have significant market risk exposure related to aircraft
fuel prices and interest rates. Market risk is the potential
negative impact of adverse changes in these prices or rates on
our Consolidated Financial Statements. To manage the volatility
relating to these exposures, we periodically enter into
derivative transactions pursuant to stated policies (see
Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements). We expect adjustments to the fair value of
financial instruments accounted for under SFAS 133 to
result in ongoing volatility in earnings and shareowners’
deficit.

The following sensitivity analyses do not consider the effects
of a change in demand for air travel, the economy as a whole, or
actions we may take to seek to mitigate our exposure to a
particular risk. For these and other reasons, the actual results
of changes in these prices or rates may differ materially from
the following hypothetical results.

Aircraft Fuel Price Risk

Our results of operations can be significantly impacted by
changes in the price of aircraft fuel. To manage this risk, we
periodically purchase options and other similar derivative
instruments and enter into forward contracts for the purchase of
fuel. We do not enter into fuel hedge contracts for speculative
purposes. We did not have any fuel hedge contracts at
December 31, 2005 or 2004.

Our business plan assumes that in 2006 our aircraft fuel
consumption will be approximately 2.1 billion gallons and
that our average annual jet fuel price per gallon will be
approximately $1.74. Based on these assumptions, a 10% rise in
that jet fuel price would increase our aircraft fuel expense by
approximately $370 million in 2006.

In December 2005, the Bankruptcy Court authorized us to enter
into fuel hedging contracts for up to 30% of our monthly
estimated fuel consumption, with hedging allowed in excess of
that level if we obtained approval of the Creditors Committee or
the Bankruptcy Court. In February 2006, we received approval of
the Creditors Committee to hedge up to 50% of our estimated 2006
aggregate fuel consumption, with no single month exceeding 80%
of our estimated fuel consumption. We also agreed that we would
not enter into any fuel hedging contracts that extend beyond
December 31, 2006 without additional approval from the
Creditors Committee or the Bankruptcy Court.

For additional information regarding fuel hedging and other
exposures to market risks, see Notes 5 and 6 of the Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates
primarily relates to our long-term debt obligations.

Market risk associated with our fixed-rate long-term debt is the
potential change in fair value resulting from a change in
interest rates. A 10% decrease in average annual interest rates
would have increased the estimated fair value of our long-term
debt by $504 million at December 31, 2005 (including
debt classified as liabilities subject to compromise) and by
$1.6 billion at December 31, 2004. A 10% increase in
average annual interest rates would not have a material impact
on our interest expense in 2006. At December 31, 2005, we
had no interest rate swaps or contractual arrangements that
would reduce our interest expense. For additional information on
our long-term debt agreements, see Note 8 of the Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In accordance with
SOP

90-7,

interest
expense is recorded only to the extent that (1) interest
will be paid during the bankruptcy proceedings or (2) it is
probable that interest will be an allowed priority, secured, or
unsecured claim. Interest expense recorded on our Consolidated
Statement of Operations totaled approximately $1 billion
for the year ended December 31, 2005. Contractual interest
expense (including



interest expense that is associated with obligations in
liabilities subject to compromise) during this period totaled
approximately $1.2 billion.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of our disclosure
controls and procedures, which have been designed to permit us
to effectively identify and timely disclose important
information. Our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the controls
and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2005 to
ensure that material information was accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Changes In Internal Control

During the three months ended December 31, 2005, we made
the following changes in our internal control over financial
reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting:

•

Our Chapter 11 proceedings
    continue to have a significant impact on our business processes
    and internal control over financial reporting related to
    (1) the proper separation and payment of pre-petition and
    post-petition obligations and (2) the preparation of
    consolidated financial statements reflecting the accounting
    required for the restructuring activities and reorganization
    expenses resulting from the Chapter 11 proceedings.
    Management continues to take actions necessary to address the
    resources, processes and controls related to these restructuring
    activities, while maintaining controls over routine daily
    operations.

•

Our approach to implementing new
    business processes, including those that are outsourced to a
    third party, encompasses the design and implementation of
    internal control over financial reporting as it relates to the
    new business process. In early 2005, we entered into an
    agreement with a third party to perform various business
    processes that were being performed internally by our personnel.
    These processes include processing payroll for all of our
    domestic employees and administering certain human resource and
    benefit related functions for these employees. Since announcing
    the agreement, we and the third party have been actively
    transitioning the business processes to the third party, and the
    transition was substantially completed in the fourth quarter of
    2005. Our personnel continue to perform or provide oversight of
    many of the controls in these processes.



Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
is defined in
Rules

13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over
financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies may deteriorate.

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005 using the criteria issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO) in

Internal Control — Integrated
Framework

. Based on that evaluation, management believes
that our internal control over financial reporting was effective
as of December 31, 2005.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005 has been audited by Deloitte &
Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm,
which also audited our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Deloitte & Touche LLP’s report on
management’s assessment of internal control over financial
reporting is set forth below.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareowners of Delta Air Lines,
    Inc.

Atlanta, Georgia

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting, that Delta Air Lines, Inc. (Debtor and

Debtor-in

-Possession)
and subsidiaries (the “Company”) maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
company’s principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.



Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
improper management override of controls, material misstatements
due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the criteria
established in

Internal Control — Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for
the year ended December 31, 2005, and our report dated
March 27, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
consolidated financial statements and included explanatory
paragraphs concerning matters related to (i) the
Company’s reorganization under Chapter 11 of the
United States Bankruptcy Code and (ii) the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern.

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareowners of Delta Air Lines,
Inc.

Atlanta, Georgia

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Delta Air Lines, Inc. (Debtor and

Debtor-in

-Possession)
and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, cash flows, and shareowners’
deficit for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2005. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Delta Air Lines, Inc. (Debtor and

Debtor-in

-Possession)
and subsidiaries at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2005, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.

As discussed in Notes 1 and 2, the Company has filed
for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States
Bankruptcy Code. The accompanying financial statements do not
purport to reflect or provide for the consequences of the
bankruptcy proceedings. In particular, such financial statements
do not purport to show (a) as to assets, their realizable
value on a liquidation basis or their availability to satisfy
liabilities; (b) as to prepetition liabilities, the amounts
that may be allowed for claims or contingencies, or the status
and priority thereof; (c) as to shareowner accounts, the
effect of any changes that may be made in the capitalization of
the Company; or (d) as to operations, the effect of any
changes that may be made in its business.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going
concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company’s recurring losses, labor
issues and its bankruptcy filing result in uncertainty regarding
the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities,
without substantial adjustments and/or changes in ownership, and
raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to
continue as a going concern. Management’s plans concerning
these matters are described in Note 1. The consolidated
financial statements do not include adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the
criteria established in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
March 27, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on
management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting and an
unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1.

Chapter 11 Proceedings

General Information

Delta Air Lines, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is a major air
carrier that provides air transportation for passengers and
cargo throughout the U.S. and around the world. Our Consolidated
Financial Statements include the accounts of Delta Air Lines,
Inc. and our wholly owned subsidiaries, including Comair, Inc.
(“Comair”), which are collectively referred to as
Delta.

On September 14, 2005 (the “Petition Date”), we
and substantially all of our subsidiaries (collectively, the
“Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions for
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States
Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”), in the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York
(the “Bankruptcy Court”). The reorganization cases are
being jointly administered under the caption “In re Delta
Air Lines, Inc., et al., Case
No.

05-17923-ASH.”

Since the Petition Date, the Bankruptcy Court has approved
various motions that facilitate our continuation of normal
operations. The Bankruptcy Court’s orders authorize us,
among other things, in our discretion to: (1) provide
employee wages, healthcare coverage, vacation, sick leave and
similar benefits without interruption; (2) honor
obligations arising prior to the Petition Date
(“pre-petition obligations”) to customers and continue
customer service programs, including Delta’s SkyMiles
frequent flyer program; (3) pay for fuel under existing
fuel supply contracts and honor existing fuel supply,
distribution and storage agreements; (4) honor pre-petition
obligations related to our interline, clearinghouse, code
sharing and other similar agreements; (5) pay pre-petition
obligations to foreign vendors, foreign service providers and
foreign governments; and (6) continue maintenance of
existing bank accounts and existing cash management systems.

The Debtors are operating as “debtors-in-possession”
under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. In
general, as debtors-in-possession, the Debtors are authorized
under Chapter 11 to continue to operate as an ongoing
business, but may not engage in transactions outside the
ordinary course of business without the prior approval of the
Bankruptcy Court.

Our business plan is intended to make Delta a simpler, more
efficient and customer focused airline with an improved
financial condition. As part of our Chapter 11
reorganization, we are seeking $3 billion in annual
financial benefits (revenue enhancements and cost reductions) by
the end of 2007 from revenue and network improvements; savings
to be achieved through the Chapter 11 restructuring
process; and reduced Mainline employee cost. This amount is in
addition to the $5 billion in annual financial benefits we
are on schedule to achieve by the end of 2006, as compared to
2002, under the transformation plan we announced in 2004.

Components of the $3 billion in annual financial benefits
we are seeking by the end of 2007 include:

Revenue and Network Productivity Improvements.

Our
business plan targets $1.1 billion in benefits to be
realized annually through revenue and network productivity
improvements. Key initiatives include:

In-Court Restructuring.

Our business plan includes a
target of $970 million of cost reductions to be realized
annually through in-court restructuring initiatives such as debt
relief, lease and facility savings,

F-8


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

aircraft lease rejections and negotiations, restructuring of
vendor contracts and changes to retiree medical benefits.

Competitive Employment Costs.

Our business plan targeted
$930 million of benefits to be realized annually through
reduced employment costs. These reductions are planned to result
from changes to pay and benefits for our employees, as well as
employee productivity improvements, outsourcing and overhead
reductions. We originally targeted ongoing, annual labor cost
reductions of $325 million from our pilot workforce, but
have reduced the requested amount to $305 million in our
effort to reach a consensual agreement with the Air Line Pilots
Association, International (“ALPA”), the collective
bargaining representative of Delta’s pilots. See
“Rejection of Collective Bargaining Agreements” below
for further information.

Notices to Creditors; Effect of Automatic Stay.

Shortly
after the Petition Date, the Debtors began notifying all known
current or potential creditors of the Chapter 11 filing.
Subject to certain exceptions under the Bankruptcy Code, the
Debtors’ Chapter 11 filing automatically enjoined, or
stayed, the continuation of any judicial or administrative
proceedings or other actions against the Debtors or their
property to recover on, collect or secure a claim arising prior
to the Petition Date. Thus, for example, most creditor actions
to obtain possession of property from the Debtors, or to create,
perfect or enforce any lien against the property of the Debtors,
or to collect on monies owed or otherwise exercise rights or
remedies with respect to a pre-petition claim, are enjoined
unless and until the Bankruptcy Court lifts the automatic stay.
Vendors are being paid for goods furnished and services provided
after the Petition Date in the ordinary course of business.

Appointment of Creditors Committee.

As required by the
Bankruptcy Code, the United States Trustee for the Southern
District of New York appointed an official committee of
unsecured creditors (the “Creditors Committee”). The
Creditors Committee and its legal representatives have a right
to be heard on all matters that come before the Bankruptcy Court
with respect to the Debtors. The Creditors Committee has been
generally supportive of the Debtors’ positions on various
matters; however, there can be no assurance that the Creditors
Committee will support the Debtors’ positions on matters to
be presented to the Bankruptcy Court in the future or on the
Debtors’ plan of reorganization, once proposed.
Disagreements between the Debtors and the Creditors Committee
could protract the Chapter 11 proceedings, negatively
impact the Debtors’ ability to operate and delay the
Debtors’ emergence from the Chapter 11 proceedings.

Rejection of Executory Contracts.

Under Section 365
and other relevant sections of the Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors
may assume, assume and assign, or reject certain executory
contracts and unexpired leases, including, without limitation,
leases of real property, aircraft and aircraft engines, subject
to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and certain other
conditions. By order of the Bankruptcy Court, our
Section 365 rights to assume, assume and assign, or reject
unexpired leases of non-residential real estate expire on the
earlier of the date of termination of our exclusive period to
file a plan of reorganization (currently July 11, 2006 and
subject to further extension by the Bankruptcy Court) or the
date of the conclusion of a disclosure statement hearing in
conjunction with a plan of reorganization. In general, rejection
of an executory contract or unexpired lease is treated as a
pre-petition breach of the executory contract or unexpired lease
in question and, subject to certain exceptions, relieves the
Debtors of performing their future obligations under such
executory contract or unexpired lease but entitles the contract
counterparty or lessor to a pre-petition general unsecured claim
for damages caused by such deemed breach. Counterparties to such
rejected contracts or leases can file claims against the
Debtors’ estate for such damages. Generally, the assumption
of an executory contract or unexpired lease requires the Debtors
to cure existing defaults under such executory contract or
unexpired lease.

Any description of an executory contract or unexpired lease
elsewhere in these Notes, including where applicable our express
termination rights or a quantification of our obligations, must
be read in conjunction with, and is qualified by, any overriding
rejection rights we have under Section 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code.

We expect that liabilities subject to compromise and resolution
in the Chapter 11 proceedings will arise in the future as a
result of damage claims created by the Debtors’ rejection
of various executory contracts and unexpired leases. Due to the
uncertain nature of many of the potential rejection claims, the
magnitude of

F-9


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

such claims is not reasonably estimable at this time. Such
claims may be material (see “Liabilities Subject to
Compromise” below).

Special Protection Applicable to Leases and Secured Financing
of Aircraft and Aircraft Equipment.

Notwithstanding the
general discussion above of the impact of the automatic stay,
under Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy Code
(“Section 1110”), certain secured parties,
lessors and conditional sales vendors may take possession of
certain qualifying aircraft, aircraft engines and other
aircraft-related equipment that are leased or subject to a
security interest or conditional sale contract pursuant to their
agreement with the Debtors. Section 1110 provides that,
unless the Debtors agree to perform under the agreement and cure
all defaults within 60 days after the Petition Date, such
financing party can take possession of such equipment.

Section 1110 effectively shortens the automatic stay period
to 60 days with respect to Section 1110 eligible
aircraft, engines and related equipment, subject to the
following two conditions. First, the debtor may extend the

60-day

period by
agreement of the relevant financing party, with court approval.
Alternatively, the debtor may elect, with court approval, to
perform all of the obligations under the applicable financing
and cure any defaults thereunder as required by the Bankruptcy
Code (which does not preclude later rejecting any related
lease). In the absence of either such arrangement, the financing
party may take possession of the property and enforce any of its
contractual rights or remedies to sell, lease or otherwise
retain or dispose of such equipment.

The

60-day

period under
Section 1110 expired on November 14, 2005. We have
entered into agreements to extend the automatic stay or elected
to perform under the applicable financing with respect to a
substantial number of the aircraft in our fleet. While we have
reached agreement with respect to certain of our aircraft
obligations and are negotiating with respect to many of our
other aircraft obligations, the ultimate outcome of these
negotiations cannot be predicted with certainty. To the extent
we are unable to reach definitive agreements with aircraft
financing parties, those parties may seek to repossess aircraft.
The loss of a significant number of aircraft could result in a
material adverse effect on our financial and operating
performance.

Request for Adequate Protection.

Certain aircraft
financing parties have filed motions with the Bankruptcy Court
seeking adequate protection against the risk that their aircraft
collateral could lose value while in the possession of or while
being used by the Debtors. The Bankruptcy Court could determine
that such parties are not adequately protected and that the
Debtors must pay certain amounts, which could be material, in
order to continue using the equipment.

Rejection of Collective Bargaining Agreements.

Section 1113 of the Bankruptcy Code permits a debtor to
reject its collective bargaining agreements (“CBAs”)
with its unions if the debtor first satisfies several
statutorily prescribed substantive and procedural prerequisites
and obtains the Bankruptcy Court’s approval of the
rejection. The debtor must make a proposal to modify its
existing CBAs based on the most complete and reliable
information available at the time, must bargain in good faith
and must share relevant information with its unions. The
proposed modifications must be necessary to permit the
reorganization of the debtor and must ensure that all affected
parties are treated fairly and equitably relative to the
creditors and the debtor. Rejection is appropriate if the unions
refuse to agree to the debtors’ necessary proposals
“without good cause” and the balance of the equities
favors rejection.

We have been and continue to be in negotiations with ALPA to
reduce our pilot labor costs as required under our business
plan. Because we were not able to reach a consensual agreement
with ALPA, on November 1, 2005, we filed a motion with the
Bankruptcy Court under Section 1113 of the Bankruptcy Code
to reject Delta’s collective bargaining agreement with ALPA.

In December 2005, we reached an interim agreement with ALPA,
which was approved by the Bankruptcy Court and ratified by
Delta’s pilots. The interim agreement provides for, among
other things, a reduction in (1) hourly pilot wage rates of
14% and (2) other pilot pay and cost items equivalent to
approximately an additional 1% hourly wage reduction. These
reductions became effective December 15, 2005, and remain
in effect until the earlier of (1) our entering into a
comprehensive agreement with ALPA on changes to the pilot
collective bargaining agreement; or (2) the time that the
neutral panel described

F-10


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

below issues its final order as to whether Delta is authorized
to reject the pilot collective bargaining agreement under the
legal standards of Section 1113 of the Bankruptcy Code.

The interim agreement provides that Delta and ALPA will seek to
negotiate a tentative comprehensive agreement, and establishes
the following time limits (“March 2006 time limits”)
for reaching that agreement: (1) March 1, 2006, for
the parties’ negotiating committees to reach a tentative
agreement; (2) March 8, 2006, for approval by the ALPA
Master Executive Council; and (3) March 22, 2006, for
pilot ratification. Because the first of the March 2006 time
limits was not met, pursuant to our interim agreement with ALPA,
the matter at issue in Delta’s Section 1113 motion has
been submitted to a mutually agreed upon, neutral panel of three
experts in airline labor matters for a binding decision on that
issue. The interim agreement provides that the panel’s
decision must be issued no later than 45 days after the
failure to meet the applicable March 2006 time limit, which is
April 15, 2006. We cannot predict the outcome of the
neutral panel’s decision as to whether or not we would be
authorized to reject the collective bargaining agreement.

Comair has been and continues to be in negotiations with the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters (“IBT”), the
collective bargaining representative of Comair’s flight
attendants, to reduce Comair’s flight attendant labor
costs. Because Comair was not able to reach a consensual
agreement with the IBT, on February 22, 2006, Comair filed
a motion with the Bankruptcy Court to reject Comair’s
collective bargaining agreement with the IBT.

See Note 10 for additional information about these and
related subjects.

Payment of Insurance Benefits to Retired Employees.

Section 1114 of the Bankruptcy Code addresses a
debtor’s ability to modify certain retiree disability,
medical and death benefits (“Covered Benefits”). To
modify Covered Benefits, the debtor must satisfy certain
statutorily prescribed procedural and substantive prerequisites
and obtain either (1) the Bankruptcy Court’s approval
or (2) the consent of an authorized representative of
retirees. The debtor must make a proposal to modify the Covered
Benefits based on the most complete and reliable information
available at the time, must bargain in good faith and must share
relevant information with the retiree representative. The
proposed modifications must be necessary to permit the
reorganization of the debtor and must ensure that all affected
parties are treated fairly and equitably relative to the
creditors and the debtor.

The Bankruptcy Court directed the appointment of two separate
retiree committees under Section 1114, one to serve as the
authorized representative of nonpilot retirees, and the other to
serve as the authorized representative of pilot retirees. We
have not yet made any proposal to modify retiree benefits for
either nonpilots or pilots that we believe are Covered Benefits.

Magnitude of Potential Claims.

The Debtors will file with
the Bankruptcy Court schedules and statements of financial
affairs setting forth, among other things, the assets and
liabilities of the Debtors, subject to the assumptions filed in
connection therewith. All of the schedules will be subject to
further amendment or modification. Differences between amounts
scheduled by the Debtors and claims by creditors will be
investigated and resolved in connection with the claims
resolution process. In light of the expected number of
creditors, the claims resolution process may take considerable
time to complete. Accordingly, the ultimate number and amount of
allowed claims is not presently known, nor can the ultimate
recovery with respect to allowed claims be presently ascertained.

Costs of Reorganization.

We have incurred and will
continue to incur significant costs associated with our
reorganization. The amount of these costs, which are being
expensed as incurred, are expected to significantly affect our
results of operations. For additional information, see
“Reorganization Items, net” in this Note.

Effect of Filing on Creditors and Shareowners.

Under the
priority scheme established by the Bankruptcy Code, unless
creditors agree otherwise, pre-petition liabilities and
post-petition liabilities must be satisfied in full before
shareowners are entitled to receive any distribution or retain
any property under a plan of reorganization. The ultimate
recovery to creditors and/or shareowners, if any, will not be
determined until confirmation of a plan or plans of
reorganization. No assurance can be given as to what values, if
any, will be

F-11


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

ascribed in the Chapter 11 proceedings to each of these
constituencies or what types or amounts of distributions, if
any, they would receive. A plan of reorganization could result
in holders of our liabilities and/or securities, including our
common stock, receiving no distribution on account of their
interests and cancellation of their holdings. As discussed
below, if the requirements of Section 1129(b) of the
Bankruptcy Code are met, a plan of reorganization can be
confirmed notwithstanding its rejection by the holders of our
common stock and notwithstanding the fact that such holders do
not receive or retain any property on account of their equity
interests under the plan. Because of such possibilities, the
value of our liabilities and securities, including our common
stock, is highly speculative. We urge that appropriate caution
be exercised with respect to existing and future investments in
any of the liabilities and/or securities of the Debtors.

Notice and Hearing Procedures for Trading in Claims and
Equity Securities.

The Bankruptcy Court issued a final order
to assist us in preserving our net operating losses (the
“NOL Order”). The NOL Order provides for certain
notice and hearing procedures regarding trading in our common
stock. It also provides a mechanism by which certain holders of
claims may be required to sell some of their holdings in
connection with implementation of a plan of reorganization.

Under the NOL Order, any person or entity that (1) is a
Substantial Equityholder (as defined below) and intends to
purchase or sell or otherwise acquire or dispose of Tax
Ownership (as defined in the NOL Order) of any shares of our
common stock, or (2) may become a Substantial Equityholder
as a result of the purchase or other acquisition of Tax
Ownership of shares of our common stock, must provide advance
notice of the proposed transaction to the Bankruptcy Court, to
us and to the Creditors Committee. A “Substantial
Equityholder” is any person or entity that has Tax
Ownership of at least nine million shares of our common stock.
The proposed transaction may not be consummated unless written
approval is received from us within the 15 day period
following our receipt of the notice. A transaction entered into
in violation of these procedures will be void as a violation of
the automatic stay under Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code
and may subject the participant to other sanctions. The NOL
Order also requires that each Substantial Equityholder file with
the Bankruptcy Court and serve on us a notice identifying
itself. Failure to comply with this requirement also may result
in the imposition of sanctions.

Under the NOL Order, any person or entity that (1) is a
Substantial Claimholder (as defined below) and intends to
purchase or otherwise acquire Tax Ownership of certain
additional claims against us, or (2) may become a
Substantial Claimholder as a result of the purchase or other
acquisition of Tax Ownership of claims against us, must serve on
the Creditors Committee a notice in which such claimholder
consents to the procedures set forth in the NOL Order. A
“Substantial Claimholder” is any person or entity that
has Tax Ownership of claims against us equal to or exceeding
$200 million (an amount that could be increased in the
future). Under the NOL Order, Substantial Claimholders may be
required to sell certain claims against us if the Bankruptcy
Court so orders in connection with our filing of a plan of
reorganization. Other restrictions on trading in claims may also
apply following our filing of a plan of reorganization.

Process for Plan of Reorganization.

In order to
successfully exit Chapter 11, the Debtors will need to
propose, and obtain confirmation by the Bankruptcy Court of, a
plan of reorganization that satisfies the requirements of the
Bankruptcy Code. A plan of reorganization would, among other
things, resolve the Debtors’ pre-petition obligations, set
forth the revised capital structure of the newly reorganized
entity and provide for corporate governance subsequent to exit
from bankruptcy.

The Debtors have the exclusive right for 120 days after the
Petition Date to file a plan of reorganization and, if we do so,
60 additional days to obtain necessary acceptances of our plan.
The Bankruptcy Court has extended these periods until
July 11, 2006 and September 9, 2006, respectively, and
these periods may be extended further by the Bankruptcy Court
for cause. If the Debtors’ exclusivity period lapses, any
party in interest may file a plan of reorganization for any of
the Debtors. In addition to being voted on by holders of
impaired claims and equity interests, a plan of reorganization
must satisfy certain requirements of the Bankruptcy Code and
must be approved, or confirmed, by the Bankruptcy Court in order
to become effective. A plan of reorganization has been accepted
by holders of claims against and equity interests in the Debtors
if (1) at least one-half in number and two-thirds in dollar
amount of claims actually voting in each impaired

class of claims have voted to accept the plan and (2) at
least two-thirds in amount of equity interests actually voting
in each impaired class of equity interests has voted to accept
the plan.

Under certain circumstances set forth in Section 1129(b) of
the Bankruptcy Code, the Bankruptcy Court may confirm a plan of
reorganization even if such plan has not been accepted by all
impaired classes of claims and equity interests. A class of
claims or equity interests that does not receive or retain any
property under the plan of reorganization on account of such
claims or interests is deemed to have voted to reject the plan.
The precise requirements and evidentiary showing for confirming
a plan of reorganization notwithstanding its rejection by one or
more impaired classes of claims or equity interests depends upon
a number of factors, including the status and seniority of the
claims or equity interests in the rejecting class (i.e., secured
claims or unsecured claims, subordinated or senior claims, or
common stock). Generally, with respect to common stock
interests, a plan of reorganization may be “crammed
down” even if the shareowners receive no recovery if the
proponent of the plan demonstrates that (1) no class junior
to the common stock is receiving or retaining property under the
plan and (2) no class of claims or interests senior to the
common stock is being paid more than in full.

The timing of filing a plan of reorganization by us will depend
on the timing and outcome of numerous other ongoing matters in
the Chapter 11 proceedings. Although we expect to file a
plan of reorganization that provides for our emergence from
bankruptcy as a going concern, there can be no assurance at this
time that a plan of reorganization will be confirmed by the
Bankruptcy Court, or that any such plan will be implemented
successfully.

Liabilities Subject to Compromise

The following table summarizes the components of liabilities
subject to compromise included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet
as of December 31, 2005:

Liabilities subject to compromise refers to pre-petition
obligations which may be impacted by the Chapter 11
reorganization process. These amounts represent our current
estimate of known or potential pre-petition obligations to be
resolved in connection with our Chapter 11 proceedings.

Differences between liabilities we have estimated and the claims
filed, or to be filed, will be investigated and resolved in
connection with the claims resolution process. We will continue
to evaluate these liabilities throughout the Chapter 11
process and adjust amounts as necessary. Such adjustments may be
material. In light of the expected large number of creditors,
the claims resolution process may take considerable time to
complete. Accordingly, the ultimate number and amount of allowed
claims is not presently known.

Reorganization Items, net

Reorganization items refers to revenues, expenses (including
professional fees), realized gains and losses and provisions for
losses that are realized or incurred in the bankruptcy
proceedings. The following table

F-13


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

summarizes the components included in reorganization items, net
on our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended
December 31, 2005:

(1)

Estimated allowed claims from our rejection of the leases for 50
    aircraft, the renegotiation of the leases for seven aircraft and
    the repossession of 15 aircraft.

(2)

We record an estimated claim associated with the rejection of an
    executory contract or unexpired lease when we file a motion with
    the Bankruptcy Court to reject such contract or lease and
    believe that it is probable the motion will be approved. We
    record an estimated claim associated with the renegotiation of
    an executory contract or unexpired lease when the renegotiated
    terms of such contract or lease are not opposed or are otherwise
    approved by the Bankruptcy Court and there is sufficient
    information to estimate the claim.

(3)

Reflects the write-off of certain debt issuance costs and
    premiums in conjunction with valuing unsecured and undersecured
    debt.

(4)

Estimated allowed claims associated with facility leases and
    related bond obligations.

Claims related to reorganization items are reflected in
liabilities subject to compromise in our Consolidated Balance
Sheet as of December 31, 2005.

From the Petition Date through December 31, 2005, we
received approximately $15 million in interest income from
the preservation of cash, which was partially offset by payments
of $6 million in professional fees related to our
Chapter 11 proceedings.

Note 2.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) on a
going concern basis. This contemplates the realization of assets
and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of
business. Accordingly, we do not include any adjustments
relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of
liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to
continue as a going concern.

As a result of sustained losses, labor issues and our
Chapter 11 proceedings, the realization of assets and
satisfaction of liabilities, without substantial adjustments
and/or changes in ownership, are subject to uncertainty. Given
this uncertainty, there is substantial doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern.

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements do not
purport to reflect or provide for the consequences of our
Chapter 11 proceedings. In particular, the financial
statements do not purport to show (1) as to assets, their
realizable value on a liquidation basis or their availability to
satisfy liabilities; (2) as to pre-petition liabilities,
the amounts that may be allowed for claims or contingencies, or
the status and priority thereof; (3) as to
shareowners’ equity accounts, the effect of any changes
that may be made in our capitalization; or (4) as to
operations, the effect of any changes that may be made to our
business.

We have eliminated all material intercompany transactions in our
Consolidated Financial Statements. We do not consolidate the
financial statements of any company in which we have an
ownership interest of 50% or less unless we control that
company. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, we did not control any
company in which we had an ownership interest of 50% or less.

F-14


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In accordance with GAAP, we have applied American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants’ (“AICPA”) Statement
of Position

90-7,

“Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization under
the Bankruptcy Code”
(“SOP

90-7”),

in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements.
SOP

90-7

requires
that the financial statements, for periods subsequent to the
Chapter 11 filing, distinguish transactions and events that
are directly associated with the reorganization from the ongoing
operations of the business. Accordingly, certain revenues,
expenses (including professional fees), realized gains and
losses and provisions for losses that are realized or incurred
in the bankruptcy proceedings are recorded in reorganization
items, net on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
Operations. In addition, pre-petition obligations that may be
impacted by the bankruptcy reorganization process have been
classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at
December 31, 2005 in liabilities subject to compromise.
These liabilities are reported at the amounts expected to be
allowed by the Bankruptcy Court, even if they may be settled for
lesser amounts (see Note 1).

While operating as

debtors-in

-possession
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors may
sell or otherwise dispose of or liquidate assets or settle
liabilities, subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court or
otherwise as permitted in the ordinary course of business, in
amounts other than those reflected in the Consolidated Financial
Statements. Moreover, a plan of reorganization could materially
change the amounts and classifications in the historical
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Reclassifications

We sell mileage credits in our SkyMiles frequent flyer program
to participating partners, such as credit card companies, hotels
and car rental agencies. The portion of the revenue from the
sale of mileage credits that approximates the fair value of
travel to be provided is deferred. We amortize the deferred
revenue on a straight-line basis over the period when
transportation is expected to be provided. For the year ended
December 31, 2005, the majority of the revenue from the
sale of mileage credits, including the amortization of deferred
revenue, is recorded in passenger revenue on our Consolidated
Statements of Operations; the remaining portion is recorded as
other revenue. Prior to 2005, the remaining portion was
classified as an offset to selling expenses. We have
reclassified prior period amounts to be consistent with the
current year presentation. These reclassifications resulted in
an increase to other, net revenues as well as passenger
commissions and other selling expenses of $233 million and
$221 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and
2003, respectively. Operating and net loss did not change for
any period presented. We believe this reclassification enhances
the comparability of other, net revenues, as well as passenger
commissions and other selling expenses, on our Consolidated
Statements of Operations.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, we classified changes
in restricted cash on our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
as an investing activity. Prior to 2005, we presented such
changes as an operating activity. We have reclassified prior
period amounts to be consistent with the current year
presentation. These reclassifications resulted in an increase to
cash flows from operating activities and a corresponding
decrease to cash flows from investing activities of
$115 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, and
$102 million for the year ended December 31, 2003.

We have reclassified certain other prior period amounts in our
Consolidated Financial Statements to be consistent with our
current period presentation. The effect of these
reclassifications is not material.

Use of Estimates

We are required to make estimates and assumptions when preparing
our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP.
These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in
our financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual
results could differ materially from those estimates.

New Accounting Standards

In May 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) No. 154, “Accounting
Changes and Error Corrections” (“SFAS 154”).

F-15


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

This standard replaces Accounting Principles Board
(“APB”) Opinion No. 20, “Accounting
Changes” and SFAS No. 3, “Reporting
Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements.”
SFAS 154 is effective for us as of January 1, 2006 and
will impact how we report future changes in accounting, if any,
on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No.
(“FIN”) 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset
Retirement Obligations” (“FIN 47”).
FIN 47 clarifies the term

conditional asset retirement
obligation

as used in FASB Statement No. 143,
“Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.” Our
adoption of FIN 47 did not have a material impact on our
Consolidated Financial Statements.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123
(revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment”
(“SFAS 123R”), which requires an entity to
recognize compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair
value of its share based payments, such as stock options granted
to employees. This standard replaces SFAS No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”
(“SFAS 123”), and supersedes APB Opinion
No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees” (“APB 25”). We adopted
SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006, as required. Based on
stock based awards outstanding as of that date, we estimate that
related compensation expense will be approximately
$50 million and $20 million for the years ending
December 31, 2006 and 2007, respectively.

In January 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
No. 106-1, “Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003” (“FSP 106-1”).
Beginning in 2006, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement
and Modernization Act of 2003 (“Medicare Act”)
introduces a federal subsidy to sponsors of healthcare benefit
plans in certain circumstances and a prescription drug benefit
to eligible participants under Medicare. We have determined that
the federal subsidy to be provided under the Medicare Act will
not have an impact on our postretirement benefit plans. We
believe, however, that the new prescription drug benefit that
will be provided under Medicare will reduce our future claims
costs under our postretirement benefit plans. See Note 12
for additional information about the impact of the Medicare Act.

In September 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force
(“EITF”) reached a consensus on EITF
Issue

04-08,

“The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted
earnings per Share”
(“EITF

04-08”).

This EITF requires shares of common stock issuable upon
conversion of contingently convertible debt instruments to be
included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share
whether or not the contingent conditions for conversion have
been met, unless the inclusion of these shares is anti-dilutive.
Previously, shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of
contingently convertible debt securities were excluded from the
calculation of diluted earnings per share. See Note 19 for
additional information about the impact of
EITF

04-08

on our
Consolidated Financial Statements.

During 2003, we adopted the following accounting standards,
which did not have a material impact on our Consolidated
Financial Statements:

•

SFAS No 132 (revised 2003),
    “Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions and Other
    Postretirement Benefits, and amendment of FASB Statements
    No. 87, 88, and 106” (“SFAS 132R”) (See
    Note 12 for disclosures required under SFAS 132R).

•

EITF

01-08,

“Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease”
    (see Note 9),

•

SFAS No 143,
    “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,”

    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities;”
    SFAS No 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial
    Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
    Equity;” and FIN 46, “Consolidation of Variable
    Interest Entities.”

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We classify short-term, highly liquid investments with
maturities of three months or less when purchased as cash and
cash equivalents. These investments are recorded at cost, which
approximates fair value. Cash

F-16


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2005 include
approximately $155 million, which is set aside for the
payment of certain operational taxes and fees to governmental
authorities.

Under our cash management system, we utilize controlled
disbursement accounts that are funded daily. Checks we issue,
which have not been presented for payment, are recorded in
accounts payable, deferred credits and other accrued liabilities
on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These amounts totaled
$66 million and $63 million at December 31, 2005
and 2004, respectively.

Short-Term Investments

At December 31, 2005, we did not have any short-term
investments. At December 31, 2004, our short-term
investments were comprised of auction rate securities. In
accordance with SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities”
(“SFAS 115”), we account for these investments as
trading securities. For additional information about trading
securities, see “Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities” in this Note.

Restricted Assets

We have restricted cash, which primarily relates to cash held as
collateral by credit card processors and interline
clearinghouses and to support certain projected insurance
obligations. Restricted cash included in current assets on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets totaled $870 million and
$348 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. Restricted cash recorded in other noncurrent
assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets totaled
$58 million and $2 million at December 31, 2005
and 2004, respectively.

We have restricted investments for the redevelopment and
expansion of Terminal A at Boston’s Logan International
Airport. Restricted investments included in other assets on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets totaled $46 and $127 million at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Derivative Financial Instruments

We account for derivative financial instruments in accordance
with SFAS 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS 133”). These
derivative instruments include fuel hedge contracts, interest
rate swap agreements and equity warrants and other similar
rights in certain companies (see Note 6).

Fuel Hedge Contracts

We periodically enter into fuel hedge contracts that qualify for
hedge accounting as cash flow hedges under SFAS 133. For
these types of hedges, we record the fair value of our fuel
hedge contracts on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and regularly
adjust the balances to reflect changes in the fair values of
those contracts.

Effective gains or losses related to the fair value adjustments
of fuel hedge contracts are recorded in shareowners’
deficit as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.
These gains or losses are recognized in aircraft fuel expense
when the related aircraft fuel purchases being hedged are
consumed. However, to the extent that the change in fair value
of a fuel hedge contract does not perfectly offset the change in
the value of the aircraft fuel being hedged, the ineffective
portion of the hedge is immediately recognized as a fair value
adjustment of SFAS 133 derivatives in other income
(expense) on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. In
calculating the ineffective portion of a fuel hedge contract, we
include all changes in the fair value attributable to the time
value component and recognize the amount in other income
(expense) during the life of the contract.

Interest Rate Swap Agreements

We record interest rate swap agreements that qualify as fair
value hedges under SFAS 133 at their fair value on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets and adjust these amounts and the
related debt to reflect changes in

F-17


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

their fair values. We record net periodic interest rate swap
settlements as adjustments to interest expense in other income
(expense) on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Equity Warrants and Other Similar Rights

We record our equity warrants and other similar rights in
certain companies at fair value at the date of acquisition in
other noncurrent assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In
accordance with SFAS 133, we regularly adjust our
Consolidated Balance Sheets to reflect the changes in the fair
values of the equity warrants and other similar rights, and
recognize the related gains or losses as fair value adjustments
of SFAS 133 derivatives in other income (expense) on our
Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Revenue Recognition

Passenger Revenues

We record sales of passenger tickets as air traffic liabilities
on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Passenger revenues are
recognized when we provide transportation, reducing the related
air traffic liability. We periodically evaluate the estimated
air traffic liability and record any resulting adjustments in
our Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period in which
the evaluations are completed.

We sell mileage credits in our SkyMiles frequent flyer program
to participating partners such as credit card companies, hotels
and car rental agencies. The portion of the revenue from the
sale of mileage credits that approximates the fair value of
travel to be provided is deferred. We amortize the deferred
revenue on a straight-line basis over the period when
transportation is expected to be provided. The majority of the
revenue from the sale of mileage credits, including the
amortization of deferred revenue, is recorded in passenger
revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Operations; the
remaining portion is recognized in income currently, and is
classified as other revenue.

Cargo Revenues

Cargo revenues are recognized in our Consolidated Statements of
Operations when we provide the transportation.

Other, net

Other, net revenue includes revenue from (1) a portion of
the sale of mileage credits, discussed above, (2) codeshare
agreements with certain airlines, and (3) other
miscellaneous service revenue. Under our codeshare agreements,
we sell seats on other airlines’ flights and they sell
seats on our flights, with each airline separately marketing its
respective seats. The revenue from our sale of codeshare seats
on other airlines, and the direct costs incurred in marketing
those seats, are recorded in other, net in operating revenues on
our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Our revenue from
other airlines’ sale of codeshare seats on our flights is
recorded in passenger revenue on our Consolidated Statements of
Operations.

Long-Lived Assets

We record our property and equipment at cost and depreciate or
amortize these assets on a straight-line basis to their
estimated residual values over their respective estimated useful
lives. Residual values for flight equipment range from

5%-40%

of cost. We also
capitalize certain internal and external costs incurred to
develop internal-use software; these assets are included in
ground property and equipment, net on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets. The estimated useful lives for major asset
classifications are as follows:

F-18


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for
the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” we record
impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations when
events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired and
the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those
assets are less than their carrying amounts. For long-lived
assets held for sale, we record impairment losses when the
carrying amount is greater than the fair value less the cost to
sell. We discontinue depreciation of long-lived assets once they
are classified as held for sale.

To determine impairments for aircraft used in operations, we
group assets at the fleet type level (the lowest level for which
there are identifiable cash flows) and then estimate future cash
flows based on projections of passenger yield, fuel costs, labor
costs and other relevant factors. If impairment occurs, the
amount of the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which
the carrying amount of the aircraft exceeds the estimated fair
value. Aircraft fair values are estimated by management using
published sources, appraisals and bids received from third
parties, as available. See Note 16 for additional
information about asset impairments.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets,” we apply a fair value-based
impairment test to the net book value of goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis and, if
certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss
may have been incurred, on an interim basis. The annual
impairment test date for our goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangible assets is December 31. Intangible assets with
determinable useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis
over their estimated useful lives. Our leasehold and operating
rights have definite useful lives and are amortized over their
respective lease terms, which range from nine to 19 years.

We had one reporting unit with assigned goodwill at
December 31, 2005 and 2004. In evaluating our goodwill for
impairment, we first compare the reporting unit’s fair
value to its carrying value. We estimate the fair value of our
reporting unit by considering (1) market multiple and
recent transaction values of peer companies and
(2) projected discounted future cash flows, if reasonably
estimable. In applying the projected discounted future cash flow
methodology, we (1) estimate the reporting unit’s
future cash flows based on capacity, passenger yield, traffic,
operating costs and other relevant factors and (2) discount
those cash flows based on the reporting unit’s weighted
average cost of capital. If the reporting unit’s fair value
exceeds its carrying value, no further testing is required. If,
however, the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its
fair value, we then determine the amount of the impairment
charge, if any. We recognize an impairment charge if the
carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its
implied fair value.

We perform the impairment test for our indefinite-lived
intangible assets by comparing the asset’s fair value to
its carrying value. Fair value is estimated based on projected
discounted future cash flows. We recognize an impairment charge
if the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair
value.

See Note 7 for additional information about the goodwill
and intangible assets impairment charges recorded during 2004.

Interest Capitalized

We capitalize interest on advance payments for the acquisition
of new aircraft and on construction of ground facilities as an
additional cost of the related assets. Interest is capitalized
at our weighted average interest rate on long-term debt or, if
applicable, the interest rate related to specific asset
financings. Interest capitalization ends when the equipment or
facility is ready for service or its intended use. Capitalized
interest totaled $9 million, $10 million and
$12 million for the years ended December 31, 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively.

Interest Expense

In accordance with
SOP

90-7,

we
record interest expense only to the extent (1) interest
will be paid during the Chapter 11 proceedings or
(2) it is probable interest will be an allowed priority,
secured, or

F-19


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

unsecured claim. Interest expense recorded on our Consolidated
Statements of Operations totaled approximately $1.0 billion
for the year ended December 31, 2005. Contractual interest
expense (including interest expense that is associated with
obligations in liabilities subject to compromise) during this
period totaled approximately $1.2 billion.

Equity Method Investments

We use the equity method to account for our investment in a
company when we have significant influence but not control over
the company’s operations. Under the equity method, we
initially record our investment at cost and then adjust the
carrying value of the investment to recognize our proportional
share of the company’s net income (loss). In addition,
dividends received from the company reduce the carrying value of
our investment.

In accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Staff
Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 51, “Accounting
for Sales of Stock by a Subsidiary”
(“SAB 51”), we record SAB 51 gains (losses)
as a component of shareowners’ deficit on our Consolidated
Balance Sheets (see Note 18).

Income Taxes

In accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for
Income Taxes” (“SFAS 109”), we account for
deferred income taxes under the liability method. Under this
method, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based
on the tax effects of temporary differences between the
financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as
measured by current enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance is
recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when necessary. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recorded net as current and
noncurrent deferred income taxes on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets (see Note 11).

Our income tax provisions are based on calculations and
assumptions that are subject to examination by the Internal
Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We do not record tax
benefits for any positions unless we believe it is probable
these benefits will be sustained under such examinations. We
regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations. We
believe the outcome of examinations will not have a material
effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event
the actual results differ from our estimates, we would adjust
the income tax provision in the period in which the facts that
give rise to the revision become known. Tax law and rate changes
are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which
such changes are enacted.

Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

In accordance with SFAS 115, we record our investments
classified as available-for-sale securities at fair value in
other noncurrent assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Any
change in the fair value of these securities is recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), unless such
change is a decline in value that is deemed to be other than
temporary (see Note 4). We record our investments
classified as trading securities at fair value in current assets
on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognize changes in the
fair value of these securities in other income (expense) on our
Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Frequent Flyer Program

We record a liability for the estimated incremental cost of
flight awards which are earned under our SkyMiles frequent flyer
program and expected to be redeemed for travel on Delta or other
airline partners. Our incremental costs include (1) our
system average cost per passenger for fuel, food and other
direct passenger costs for awards to be redeemed on Delta and
(2) contractual costs for awards to be redeemed on partner
airlines. The liability is recorded in accounts payable,
deferred credits and other accrued liabilities on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets. We periodically record adjustments
to this liability in other operating expenses on our
Consolidated Statements of Operations based on awards earned,
awards redeemed, changes in our estimated incremental costs and
changes to the SkyMiles program.

F-20


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Deferred Gains on Sale and Leaseback Transactions

We amortize deferred gains on the sale and leaseback of property
and equipment under operating leases over the lives of these
leases. The amortization of these gains is recorded as a
reduction to rent expense. Gains on the sale and leaseback of
property and equipment under capital leases reduce the carrying
value of the related assets.

Manufacturers’ Credits

We periodically receive credits in connection with the
acquisition of aircraft and engines. These credits are deferred
until the aircraft and engines are delivered, and then applied
on a pro rata basis as a reduction to the cost of the related
equipment.

Maintenance Costs

We record maintenance costs in operating expenses as they are
incurred.

Inventories

Inventories of expendable parts related to flight equipment are
carried at moving average cost and charged to operations as
consumed. An allowance for obsolescence for the cost of these
parts is provided over the remaining useful life of the related
fleet.

Advertising Costs

We expense advertising costs as other selling expenses in the
year incurred. Advertising expense was $164 million,
$148 million and $135 million for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Commissions

We record passenger commissions in prepaid expenses and other on
our Consolidated Balance Sheets when the related passenger
tickets are sold. Passenger commissions are recognized in
operating expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations
when the transportation is provided and the related revenue is
recognized.

Foreign Currency Remeasurement

We remeasure assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies using exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet
date. Fixed assets and the related depreciation or amortization
charges are recorded at the exchange rates in effect on the date
we acquired the assets. Revenues and expenses denominated in
foreign currencies are measured using average exchange rates for
each of the periods presented. We recognize the resulting
foreign exchange gains (losses) as a component of miscellaneous
income (expense) on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
These gains (losses) are immaterial for all periods presented.

Stock-Based Compensation

We account for our stock-based compensation plans under the
intrinsic value method in accordance with APB 25 and
related interpretations. No stock option compensation expense is
recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations because
all stock options granted had an exercise price equal to the
fair value of the underlying common stock on the grant date.

The estimated fair values of stock options granted during the
years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were derived
using a Black-Scholes model. The assumptions used in the
Black-Scholes model are based on the date when the stock options
are granted. The following table includes the assumptions used in

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

estimating fair values and the resulting weighted average fair
value of a stock option granted in the periods presented:

The following table shows what our net loss and loss per share
would have been for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004
and 2003 had we accounted for our stock-based compensation plans
under the fair value method of SFAS 123, using the
assumptions in the table above:

In 2004, we discontinued recording tax benefits for losses.
    Accordingly, there is no tax effect in 2005 and 2004.

For additional information about our stock option plans and the
motion we filed with the Bankruptcy Court seeking authority to
reject the outstanding stock options issued under these plans,
see Note 13. For additional information about new
accounting standards related to stock-based compensation, see
“New Accounting Standards” in this Note.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

We record our cash equivalents and short-term investments at
cost, which we believe approximates their fair values. The
estimated fair values of other financial instruments, including
debt and derivative instruments, have been determined using
available market information and valuation methodologies,
primarily discounted cash flow analyses and the Black-Scholes
model.

The fair value of our total secured and unsecured debt, based
primarily on quoted market values, was $10.5 billion at
December 31, 2005 (which includes debt classified as
liabilities subject to compromise), and $11.9 billion at
December 31, 2004. For additional information about our
debt, see Note 8.

Note 3.

Sale of ASA

On September 7, 2005, we sold Atlantic Southeast Airlines,
Inc. (“ASA”), our wholly owned subsidiary, to SkyWest,
Inc. (“SkyWest”) for a purchase price of
$425 million. In conjunction with this transaction, we
amended our contract carrier agreements with ASA and SkyWest
Airlines, Inc. (“SkyWest Airlines”), a wholly owned
subsidiary of SkyWest, under which those regional airlines serve
as Delta Connection carriers. The sale of ASA resulted in an
immaterial gain that is being amortized over the life of our
contract carrier agreement with ASA. For additional information
on our contract carrier agreements with ASA and SkyWest
Airlines, see Note 10.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

At the closing of our sale of ASA, we received
$350 million, representing $330 million of purchase
price and $20 million related to aircraft deposits. As the
result of our assumption of our contract carrier agreements with
ASA and SkyWest Airlines in our Chapter 11 proceedings, on
November 2, 2005, we received an additional
$120 million, consisting of $90 million of deferred
purchase price and $30 million in aircraft deposits. We may
receive up to the remaining $5 million of deferred purchase
price depending on resolution of a working capital adjustment.
Upon the sale of ASA, we repaid, as required, $100 million
of outstanding borrowings under a pre-petition credit facility.
The remaining proceeds from our sale of ASA are available for
general corporate purposes.

Our sale of ASA included the following major classes of assets
and liabilities:

After the sale of ASA to SkyWest, the revenues and expenses
related to our contract carrier agreement with ASA are reported
as regional affiliates passenger revenues and contract carrier
agreements, respectively, in our Consolidated Statements of
Operations. Prior to the sale, expenses related to ASA were
reported in the applicable expense line item in our Consolidated
Statements of Operations.

Marketable and Other Equity Securities

Republic Airways Holdings, Inc. and Affiliates
    (“Republic Holdings”)

We have contract carrier agreements with two subsidiaries of
Republic Holdings — Chautauqua Airlines, Inc.
(“Chautauqua”) and Shuttle America Corporation
(“Shuttle America”). As part of these agreements, we
received warrants to purchase Republic Holdings common stock.

F-23


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, our investment in Republic
Holdings consisted of the following:

(1)

Except per share data.

(2)

These warrants and the underlying shares of Republic Holdings
    common stock are not registered under the Securities Act of
    1933; we have certain demand and piggyback registration rights
    relating to the underlying shares of common stock.

These warrants were recorded at their fair values on the date
received in other noncurrent assets on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets. The fair values are primarily being recognized on a
straight-line basis over a five year period in our Consolidated
Statements of Operations. In accordance with SFAS 133, any
changes in fair value are recorded in other income
(expense) in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The
gains (losses) recorded from our investment in Republic
Holdings were not material for any period presented.

For additional information about our contract carrier agreements
with Chautauqua and Shuttle America, see Note 10.

priceline.com Incorporated (“priceline”)

We have an agreement with priceline under which we
(1) provide ticket inventory that may be sold through
priceline’s Internet-based e-commerce system and
(2) received certain equity interests in priceline. We are
required to provide priceline access to unpublished fares.

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, our investment in priceline
consisted of the following:

(1)

Except number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock.

(2)

We have certain registration rights relating to shares of
    priceline common stock we receive as dividends on the
    Series B Preferred Stock, or acquire from the exercise of
    the 2001 Warrant.

(3)

The Series B Preferred Stock is classified as an
    available-for-sale security under SFAS 115 and is recorded
    at face value, which approximates fair value, in other
    noncurrent assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The
    Series B Preferred Stock, among other things, (1) bears an
    annual dividend per share of approximately six shares of
    priceline common stock and (2) is subject to mandatory
    redemption in February 2007 at $1,000 per share plus any
    dividends accrued or accumulated but not yet paid.

(4)

The 2001 Warrant is recorded at fair value in other noncurrent
    assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In accordance with
    SFAS 133, any changes in fair value are recorded in other
    income (expense) on our Consolidated Statements of
    Operations. This warrant expires in February 2007 and has an
    exercise price of $17.81.

F-24


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The gains (losses) recorded from our investment in
priceline were not material to our Consolidated Statements of
Operations for any period presented.

For additional information about our accounting policy for
investments in equity securities and derivative financial
instruments, see Note 2.

Note 5.     Risk Management

Aircraft Fuel Price Risk

Our results of operations can be significantly impacted by
changes in the price of aircraft fuel. To manage this risk, we
periodically purchase options and other similar derivative
instruments and enter into forward contracts for the purchase of
fuel. We do not enter into fuel hedge contracts for speculative
purposes. We did not have any fuel hedge contracts at
December 31, 2005 or 2004.

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates
primarily relates to our long-term debt obligations, cash
portfolio, workers’ compensation obligations and pension,
postemployment and postretirement benefits.

Market risk associated with our long-term debt relates to the
potential change in fair value of our fixed rate debt from a
change in interest rates as well as the potential increase in
interest expense on variable rate debt. At December 31,
2005 and 2004, approximately 44% and 39%, respectively, of our
debt (including, at December 31, 2005, debt classified as
liabilities subject to compromise) had a variable interest rate.

Market risk associated with our cash portfolio relates to the
potential change in interest income from a decrease in interest
rates. Workers’ compensation obligation risk relates to the
potential changes in our future obligations and expenses from a
change in interest rates used to discount such obligations.
Pension, postemployment and postretirement benefits risk relates
to the potential changes in our benefit obligations, funding and
expenses from a change in interest rates (see Note 12).

From time to time, we may enter into interest rate swap
agreements. We do not enter into interest rate swap agreements
for speculative purposes. We did not have any interest rate swap
agreements at December 31, 2005 and 2004.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

We are subject to foreign currency exchange risk because we have
revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies,
primarily the euro, the British pound, and the Canadian dollar.
To manage exchange rate risk, we attempt to execute both our
international revenue and expense transactions in the same
foreign currency, to the extent practicable. From time to time,
we may also enter into foreign currency options and forward
contracts. We do not enter into foreign currency hedge contracts
for speculative purposes. We did not have any foreign currency
hedge contracts at December 31, 2005 and 2004.

Credit Risk

To manage credit risk associated with our aircraft fuel price,
interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk management
programs, we select counterparties based on their credit ratings
and limit our exposure to any one counterparty. We also monitor
the market position of these programs and our relative market
position with each counterparty. The credit exposure related to
these programs was not significant at December 31, 2005 and
2004.

Our accounts receivable are generated largely from the sale of
passenger airline tickets and cargo transportation services. The
majority of these sales are processed through major credit card
companies, resulting in accounts receivable which are subject to
certain holdbacks by the credit card processors. We also have
receivables from the sale of mileage credits to partners, such
as credit card companies, hotels and car

F-25


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

rental agencies that participate in our SkyMiles program. We
believe that the credit risk associated with these receivables
is minimal and that the allowance for uncollectible accounts
that we have provided is appropriate.

Self-Insurance Risk

We self-insure a portion of our losses from claims related to
workers’ compensation, environmental issues, property
damage, medical insurance for employees and general liability.
Losses are accrued based on an estimate of the ultimate
aggregate liability for claims incurred, using independent
actuarial reviews based on standard industry practices and our
actual experience. A portion of our projected workers’
compensation liability is secured with restricted cash
collateral (see Note 2).

Note 6.     Derivative
Instruments

We record all derivative instruments on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets at fair value and recognize certain changes in these fair
values in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The impact of SFAS 133 on our Consolidated Statements of
Operations is summarized as follows:

(1)

Fair value adjustments of SFAS 133 derivatives, net of tax,
    for 2003 were $(6) million. In 2004, we discontinued recording
    tax benefits for losses. Accordingly, there is no tax effect in
    2005 and 2004.

Fuel Hedging Program

On December 19, 2005 the Bankruptcy Court authorized us to
enter into fuel hedging contracts for up to 30% of our monthly
estimated fuel consumption. We may exceed the 30% limit with the
approval of the Creditors Committee or the Bankruptcy Court. In
February 2006, we received approval from the Creditors Committee
to hedge up to 50% of our estimated 2006 aggregate fuel
consumption, with no single month exceeding 80% of our estimated
fuel consumption. We also agreed that we would not enter into
any fuel hedging contracts that extend beyond December 31,
2006 without additional approval from the Creditors Committee or
the Bankruptcy Court.

Because there is not a readily available market for derivatives
in aircraft fuel, we periodically use heating and crude oil
derivative contracts to manage our exposure to changes in
aircraft fuel prices. Changes in the fair value of these
contracts (fuel hedge contracts) are highly correlated to
changes in aircraft fuel prices.

In February 2004, we settled all of our fuel hedge contracts
prior to their scheduled settlement dates. As a result of these
transactions, we received $83 million, which represented
the fair value of these contracts at the date of settlement. In
accordance with SFAS 133, we recorded effective gains of
$82 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss when
the related fuel purchases which were being hedged were consumed
during 2004. The time value component of these contracts and the
ineffective portion of the hedges at the date of settlement
resulted in an approximately $10 million charge, net of
tax. This charge was recorded in fair value adjustments of
SFAS 133 derivatives on our Consolidated Statements of
Operations.

We did not have any fuel hedge contracts at December 31,
2005 or 2004. For the month of February 2006, we hedged
approximately 26% of our fuel needs and recorded a gain of
$1.2 million upon settlement of these hedges. See
Note 2 for information about our accounting policy for fuel
hedge contracts.

F-26


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Equity Warrants and Other Similar Rights

We own equity warrants and other similar rights in certain
companies, primarily Republic Holdings and priceline. The fair
value of these rights was $37 million at December 31,
2005 and 2004. See Note 2 and 4 for information about our
accounting policy for and ownership of these rights,
respectively.

Note 7.     Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets

The following table includes the components of goodwill at
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, and the activity during
2004:

During 2004, we re-evaluated the estimated fair values of our
reporting units (Mainline, ASA and Comair) in light of the
implementation of initiatives intended to strengthen our
competitive position and the completion of our new long-range
cash flow plans. These actions reflected, among other things,
(1) the strategic role of ASA and Comair in our business
(see Note 3 for information about our sale of ASA in 2005);
(2) the projected impact of changes to our fare structure
on the revenues of each of our reporting units; and (3) an
expectation of the continuation of historically high fuel
prices. These factors had a substantial negative impact on the
impairment test results for ASA and Comair. Accordingly, we
recorded an impairment charge for the full value of goodwill at
ASA and Comair.

Our goodwill impairment test for Mainline as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004 resulted in no impairment
because (1) our business plan provides significant benefits
to Mainline; (2) we have achieved substantial cost
reductions under our transformation plan announced in 2004; and
(3) Mainline has a low carrying value.

The following table presents information about our intangible
assets, other than goodwill, at December 31:

We recorded an impairment charge totaling approximately
$9 million for certain of our international routes at
December 31, 2004 due to our decision not to utilize these
routes for the foreseeable future. This

F-27


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

charge is recorded in impairment of intangible assets on our
Consolidated Statements of Operations. At December 31,
2005, our impairment test of other intangible assets resulted in
no impairment.

For additional information about our accounting policy for
goodwill and other intangible assets, see Note 2.

Note 8.     Debt

The following table summarizes our debt at December 31,
2005 and 2004:

F-28


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(1)

Our senior secured debt and our secured debt is collateralized
    by first liens, and in many cases second and junior liens, on
    substantially all of our assets, including but not limited to
    accounts receivable, owned aircraft, spare engines, spare parts,
    flight simulators, ground equipment, landing slots,
    international routes, equity interests in certain of our
    domestic subsidiaries, intellectual property and real property.
    For more information on the Secured Super-Priority
    Debtor-in-Possession Credit Agreement and other senior secured
    debt, see “Debtor-in-Possession Financing” and
    “Financing Agreement with Amex”, respectively, in this
    Note.

(2)

Our variable interest rate long-term debt is shown using
    interest rates which represent LIBOR or Commercial Paper plus a
    specified margin, as provided for in the related agreements. The
    rates shown were in effect at December 31, 2005, if
    applicable.

(3)

For additional information about the repayment terms related to
    these debt maturities, see “Financing Agreement with
    Amex” in this Note.

(4)

On March 4, 2005, we exchanged $176 million principal
    amount of enhanced equipment trust certificates due in November
    2005 (“Exchanged Certificates”) for a like aggregate
    principal amount of enhanced equipment trust certificates due in
    September 2006 and January 2008 (“Replacement
    Certificates”). The effective interest rate on the
    Exchanged and Replacement Certificates is 9.11%.

(5)

In connection with these financings, as amended, General
    Electric Capital Corporation (“GECC”) issued
    irrevocable, direct-pay letters of credit, which totaled
    $403 million at December 31, 2005, to back our
    obligations with respect to $397 million principal amount
    of tax exempt municipal bonds. We are required to reimburse

F-29


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

GECC for drawings under the
    letters of credit. Our reimbursement obligation is secured by
    (1) nine B767-400 and three B777-200 aircraft (“LOC
    Aircraft Collateral”); (2) 93 spare Mainline
    aircraft engines (“Engine Collateral”); and
    (3) certain other assets (see footnote 8 to this table).
    For additional information about the letters of credit and our
    reimbursement obligation to GECC, see “Letter of Credit
    Enhanced Special Facility Bonds” in this Note.

(6)

This debt, as amended (“Spare Engines Loan”), is
    secured by (1) the Engine Collateral; (2) so long as
    the letters of credit discussed in footnote 5 to this table are
    outstanding, the LOC Aircraft Collateral; and (3) certain
    other assets (see footnote 8 to this table). The Spare Engines
    Loan is not repayable at our election prior to maturity. The
    Engine Collateral also secures, on a subordinated basis, up to
    $160 million of certain of our other existing debt and
    aircraft lease obligations to GECC and its affiliates. At
    December 31, 2005, the outstanding amount of these
    obligations is substantially in excess of $160 million.

(7)

This debt, as amended (“Aircraft Loan”), is secured by
    (1) five

B767-400

aircraft (“Other Aircraft Collateral”); (2) the
    Engine Collateral; and (3) substantially all of the
    Mainline aircraft spare parts owned by us (“Spare Parts
    Collateral”). The Aircraft Loan is repayable at our
    election at any time, subject to certain prepayment fees on any
    prepayment.

(8)

This debt, as amended (“Spare Parts Loan”), is secured
    by (1) the Other Aircraft Collateral; (2) the Engine
    Collateral; and (3) the Spare Parts Collateral. Our
    borrowings under the Spare Parts Loan may not exceed specified
    percentages of the then current market value of either the spare
    parts or rotables we have pledged thereunder (each, a
    “Collateral Percentage Test”). In the event we exceed
    either Collateral Percentage Test, we must promptly comply with
    that test by (1) pledging additional spare parts or
    rotables, as applicable; (2) posting cash collateral; or
    (3) prepaying borrowings under the Spare Parts Loan. The
    Spare Parts Collateral also secures up to approximately
    $75 million of (1) our reimbursement obligations under
    the letters of credit discussed in footnote 5 to this table;
    (2) the Spare Engines Loan; and (3) our obligations
    under 12 CRJ-200 aircraft leases. It is also added to the
    collateral that secures, on a subordinated basis, up to
    $160 million of certain of our other existing debt and
    lease obligations to GECC and its affiliates.

(9)

In accordance with SOP 90-7, substantially all of our unsecured
    debt has been classified as liabilities subject to compromise.
    Additionally, certain of our undersecured debt instruments have
    also been classified as liabilities subject to compromise. For
    more information on liabilities subject to compromise, see
    Note 1.

(10)

Approximately $74 million principal amount of debt due in
    installments through June 2011 has interest rates ranging from
    15.46% to 15.25%. The maximum interest rate on the remaining
    secured debt is 7.79% at December 31, 2005.

Future Maturities

The following table summarizes the contractual maturities of our
debt, including current maturities, at December 31, 2005:

Debtor-in-Possession Financing

On September 16, 2005, we entered into a Secured
Super-Priority Debtor-in-Possession Credit Agreement which, as
amended (“DIP Credit Facility”), permits us to borrow
up to $1.9 billion from a syndicate of lenders arranged by
General Electric Capital Corporation (“GECC”) and
Morgan Stanley

F-30


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Senior Funding, Inc. (“Morgan Stanley”), for which
GECC acts as administrative agent. The Bankruptcy Court approved
our entering into the DIP Credit Facility.

The DIP Credit Facility consists of a $600 million Term
Loan A arranged by GECC (the “TLA”), a
$700 million Term Loan B arranged by GECC (the
“TLB”) and a $600 million Term Loan C arranged
jointly by GECC and Morgan Stanley (the “TLC;”
together with the TLA and TLB, collectively, the “DIP
Loans”). We applied a portion of these proceeds to
(1) repay in full the $480 million principal amount
outstanding under our pre-petition credit facility for which
GECC was agent (“GE Pre-Petition Facility”);
(2) repay in full the $500 million principal amount
outstanding under our Amex Pre-Petition Facility (defined
below); and (3) prepay $50 million of the
$350 million principal amount outstanding under our Amex
Post-Petition Facility (defined below). The remainder of the
proceeds of the DIP Loans is available for our general corporate
purposes.

Availability of funds under the TLA is subject to a borrowing
base calculation. If the outstanding amount of the TLA at any
time exceeds the borrowing base, we must immediately repay the
TLA or post cash collateral in an amount equal to the excess.

The TLA, TLB and TLC each mature on March 16, 2008. Prior
to the Amended and Restated DIP Credit Facility (as defined
below), the TLA bore interest, at our option, at LIBOR plus
4.50% or an index rate plus 3.75%; the TLB bore interest, at our
option, at LIBOR plus 6.50% or an index rate plus 5.75%; and the
TLC bore interest, at our option, at LIBOR plus 9.00% or an
index rate plus 8.25%.

We may also request the issuance of up to $200 million in
letters of credit under the DIP Credit Facility, which amount
must be fully cash collateralized at all times such letters of
credit are outstanding.

Our obligations under the DIP Credit Facility are guaranteed by
substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries (the
“Guarantors”). We will be required to make certain
mandatory repayments of the DIP Loans in the event we sell
certain assets, subject to certain exceptions. Any portion of
the DIP Loans that are repaid through either voluntary or
mandatory prepayment may not be reborrowed.

The DIP Loans and the related guarantees are secured by first
priority liens on substantially all of our and the
Guarantors’ present and future assets (including assets
that previously secured the GE Pre-Petition Facility) and by
junior liens on certain of our and our Guarantors’ other
assets (including certain accounts receivable and other assets
subject to a first priority lien securing the Amex Post-Petition
Facility described below), in each case subject to certain
exceptions, including an exception for assets which are subject
to financing agreements that are entitled to the benefits of
Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy Code, to the extent such
financing agreements prohibit such liens.

The DIP Credit Facility includes affirmative, negative and
financial covenants that impose substantial restrictions on our
financial and business operations, including our ability to,
among other things, incur or secure other debt, make
investments, sell assets and pay dividends or repurchase stock.

The financial covenants require us to:

•

maintain unrestricted funds in
    an amount not less than $750 million through May 31,
    2006; $1 billion at all times from June 1, 2006,
    through November 30, 2006; $750 million at all times
    from December 1, 2006, through February 28, 2007; and
    $1 billion at all times thereafter (“Liquidity
    Covenant”);

•

not exceed specified levels of
    capital expenditures during any fiscal quarter; and

•

achieve specified levels of
    EBITDAR (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation,
    amortization and aircraft rent, as defined) for successive
    trailing 12-month periods through March 2008. During 2005, we
    were required to achieve increasing levels of EBITDAR, including
    EBITDAR of $644 million for the 12-month period ending
    December 31, 2005. Thereafter, the minimum EBITDAR level
    for each successive trailing 12-month period continues to
    increase, including $1.372 billion for the 12-month period
    ended December 31, 2006; $1.988 billion for the
    12-month period ending December 31, 2007; and
    $2 billion for each

F-31


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

12-month period ending thereafter. If our cash on hand exceeds
    the minimum cash on hand that we are required to maintain
    pursuant to the Liquidity Covenant, then the EBITDAR level that
    we are required to achieve is effectively reduced by the amount
    of such excess cash, up to a maximum reduction of
    $250 million from the required EBITDAR level.

The DIP Credit Facility contains events of default customary for
debtor-in-possession financings, including cross-defaults to the
Amex Post-Petition Facility and certain change of control
events. The DIP Credit Facility also includes events of default
specific to our business, including if all or substantially all
of our flight and other operations are suspended for longer than
two days, other than in connection with a general suspension of
all U.S. flights, or if certain routes and, subject to certain
materiality thresholds, other routes, and slots and gates are
revoked, terminated or cancelled. Upon the occurrence of an
event of default, the outstanding obligations under the DIP
Credit Facility may be accelerated and become due and payable
immediately.

On March 27, 2006, we executed an amended and restated
credit agreement (the “Amended and Restated DIP Credit
Facility”) with a syndicate of lenders arranged by GECC and
Morgan Stanley that replaced the DIP Credit Facility in its
entirety. The aggregate amounts available to be borrowed are not
changed from the DIP Credit Facility by the Amended and Restated
DIP Credit Facility. However, under the Amended and Restated DIP
Credit Facility, the interest rates on borrowings have been
reduced: the TLA bears interest, at our option, at LIBOR plus
2.75% or an index rate plus 2.00%; the TLB bears interest, at
our option, at LIBOR plus 4.75% or an index rate plus 4.00%; and
the TLC bears interest, at our option, at LIBOR plus 7.50% or an
index rate plus 6.75%. The Amended and Restated DIP Credit
Facility is otherwise substantially the same as the DIP Credit
Facility, including financial covenants, collateral, guarantees,
and events of default, and it allows the execution of amendments
to certain other credit facilities and the Reimbursement
Agreement described below.

Financing Agreement with Amex

On September 16, 2005, we entered into an agreement (the
“Modification Agreement”) with Amex and American
Express Bank, F.S.B. pursuant to which we modified certain
existing agreements with Amex, including two agreements
(“the Amex Pre-Petition Facility”) under which we had
borrowed $500 million from Amex. The Amex Pre-Petition
Facility consisted of substantially identical supplements to the
two existing agreements under which Amex purchases SkyMiles from
us, the Membership Rewards Agreement and the Co-Branded Credit
Card Program Agreement (collectively, the “SkyMiles
Agreements”). The Bankruptcy Court approved our entering
into the Modification Agreement and our assuming the SkyMiles
Agreements. Amex has the right, in certain circumstances, to
impose a significant holdback on our receivables, including for
tickets purchased using an American Express credit card but not
yet used for travel.

As required by the Modification Agreement, on September 16,
2005, we used a portion of the proceeds of our initial borrowing
under the DIP Credit Facility to repay the outstanding principal
amount of $500 million, together with interest thereon,
that we had previously borrowed from Amex under the Amex
Pre-Petition Facility. Simultaneously, we borrowed
$350 million from Amex pursuant to the terms of the Amex
Pre-Petition Facility as modified by the Modification Agreement
(the “Amex Post-Petition Facility”). The amount
borrowed under the Amex Post-Petition Facility will be credited,
in equal monthly installments, towards Amex’s actual
purchases of SkyMiles during the 17-month period commencing in
July 2006. Any unused prepayment credit will carryover to the
next succeeding month with a final repayment date for any then
outstanding advances no later than November 30, 2007. Prior
to March 27, 2006, the outstanding advances bore a fee,
equivalent to interest, at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin of
10.25%. As of the date of effectiveness of the Amended and
Restated DIP Credit Facility, to which Amex consented, the fee
on outstanding advances decreased to a rate of LIBOR plus a
margin of 8.75%.

On October 7, 2005, Amex consented to an amendment to the
DIP Credit Facility in return for a prepayment of
$50 million under the Amex Post-Petition Facility. The
prepayment will be credited in inverse order of monthly
installments during the 17-month period commencing in July 2006.

F-32


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Our obligations under the Amex Post-Petition Facility are
guaranteed by the Guarantors of the DIP Credit Facility. Our
obligations under certain of our agreements with Amex, including
our obligations under the Amex Post-Petition Facility, the
SkyMiles Agreements and the agreement pursuant to which Amex
processes travel and other purchases made from us using Amex
credit cards (“Card Services Agreement”), and the
corresponding obligations of the Guarantors, are secured by
(1) a first priority lien on our right to payment from Amex
for purchased SkyMiles, our interest in the SkyMiles Agreements
and related assets and our right to payment from Amex under, and
our interest in, the Card Services Agreement and (2) a
junior lien on the collateral securing the DIP Credit Facility.

With certain exceptions, the Amex Post-Petition Facility
contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants
substantially the same as in the DIP Credit Facility. The Amex
Post-Petition Facility contains customary events of default,
including cross-defaults to our obligations under the DIP Credit
Facility and to defaults under certain other of our agreements
with Amex. The Amex Post-Petition Facility also includes events
of default specific to our business, including upon cessation of
50% or more of our business operations (measured by net revenue)
and other events of default comparable to those in the DIP
Credit Facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default
under the Amex Post-Petition Facility, the loan under the Amex
Post-Petition Facility may be accelerated and become due and
payable immediately. An event of default under the Amex
Post-Petition Facility results in an immediate cross-default
under the Amended and Restated DIP Credit Facility.

The Amended and Restated DIP Credit Facility and the Amex
Post-Petition Facility are subject to an intercreditor agreement
that generally regulates the respective rights and priorities of
the lenders under each Facility with respect to collateral and
certain other matters.

Boston Airport Terminal Project

During 2001, we entered into lease and financing agreements with
the Massachusetts Port Authority (“Massport”) for the
redevelopment and expansion of Terminal A at Boston’s Logan
International Airport. The new terminal opened in March 2005 and
has enabled us to consolidate all of our domestic operations at
that airport into one location. Project costs were funded with
$498 million in proceeds from Special Facilities Revenue
Bonds issued by Massport on August 16, 2001. We agreed to
pay the debt service on the bonds under an agreement with
Massport and issued a guarantee to the bond trustee covering the
payment of the debt service. For additional information about
these bonds, see the debt table above. Because we have issued a
guarantee of the debt service on the bonds, we have included the
bonds, as well as the related bond proceeds, on our Consolidated
Balance Sheets. The bonds are reflected as liabilities subject
to compromise and the related remaining proceeds, which are held
in a trust, are reflected as restricted investments in other
assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Letter of Credit Enhanced Special Facility Bonds

At December 31, 2005, there were outstanding
$397 million aggregate principal amount of special facility
bonds (“Bonds”) enhanced by letters of credit,
including:

•

$295 million principal
    amount of bonds issued by the Development Authority of Clayton
    County (“Clayton Authority”) to refinance the
    construction cost of certain facilities leased to us at
    Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. We pay debt
    service on these bonds pursuant to loan agreements between us
    and the Clayton Authority.

•

$102 million principal
    amount of bonds issued by other municipalities to refinance the
    construction cost of certain facilities leased to us at
    Cincinnati/ Northern Kentucky International Airport, Salt Lake
    City International Airport and Tampa International Airport. We
    pay debt service on these bonds pursuant to long-term lease
    agreements.

The Bonds (1) have scheduled maturities between 2029 and
2035; (2) currently bear interest at a variable rate that
is determined weekly; and (3) may be tendered for purchase
by their holders on seven days notice. Tendered Bonds are
remarketed at prevailing interest rates.

F-33


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Principal and interest on the Bonds are currently paid through
drawings on irrevocable, direct-pay letters of credit totaling
$403 million issued by GECC pursuant to the Reimbursement
Agreement (defined below). In addition, the purchase price of
tendered Bonds that cannot be remarketed are paid by drawings on
these letters of credit. The GECC letters of credit expire on
May 20, 2008.

Pursuant to our reimbursement obligations under the agreement
between us and GECC (“Reimbursement Agreement”), we
are required to reimburse GECC for drawings on the letters of
credit. Our reimbursement obligation to GECC is secured by
(1) nine B767-400 and three B777-200 aircraft (“LOC
Aircraft Collateral”); (2) 93 spare Mainline aircraft
engines; and (3) certain other assets (see footnote 8 to
the table above in this Note). This collateral also secures
other obligations we have to GECC, as discussed in the footnotes
to the table above in this Note.

If a drawing under a letter of credit is made to pay the
purchase price of Bonds tendered for purchase and not
remarketed, our resulting reimbursement obligation to GECC will
bear interest at a base rate or three-month LIBOR plus a margin.
The principal amount of any outstanding reimbursement obligation
will be repaid quarterly through May 20, 2008.

GECC has the right to cause a mandatory tender for purchase of
all Bonds and terminate the letters of credit if an event of
default occurs or if a minimum collateral value test
(“Collateral Value Test”) is not satisfied on
May 19, 2006, in which case the principal amount of all
reimbursement obligations (including for any Bonds tendered and
not remarketed) would be due and payable immediately. We will
not satisfy the Collateral Value Test if (1) the aggregate
amount of the outstanding letters of credit plus any other
amounts payable by us under the Reimbursement Agreement
(“Aggregate Obligations”) on March 20, 2006 is
more than 60% of the appraised value of the LOC Aircraft
Collateral plus the fair market value of permitted investments
held as part of the collateral and (2) within 60 days
thereafter, we have not either provided additional collateral to
GECC in the form of cash or aircraft or caused a reduction in
the Aggregate Obligations such that the Collateral Value Test is
satisfied. If we fail to satisfy the Collateral Value Test on
May 19, 2006, an event of default will occur. We currently
estimate that, in order to satisfy the Collateral Value Test on
May 19, 2006, we will need to provide GECC with additional
collateral in the form of cash in the amount of approximately
$50 million.

Unless the GECC letters of credit are extended in a timely
manner, we will be required to purchase the Bonds on
May 15, 2008, five days prior to the expiration of the
letters of credit. In this circumstance, we could seek, but
there is no assurance that we would be able (1) to sell the
Bonds without credit enhancement at then-prevailing fixed
interest rates or (2) to replace the expiring letters of
credit with new letters of credit from an alternate credit
provider and remarket the Bonds.

We entered into a letter of intent with GECC in December 2005 to
amend the Reimbursement Agreement to eliminate the Collateral
Value Test, among other things. In February 2006, the Bankruptcy
court approved the letter of intent, but because the completion
of the transactions contemplated in the letter of intent is
subject to definitive documentation and certain other
conditions, there can be no assurance that the Collateral Value
Test will be amended or eliminated. If the Collateral Value Test
is not amended or eliminated, we intend to satisfy it.

Letter of Credit Facility Related to Visa/ MasterCard
    Credit Card Processing Agreement

On January 26, 2006, with the authorization from the
Bankruptcy Court, we entered into a letter of credit facility
with Merrill Lynch. Under the Letter of Credit Reimbursement
Agreement, Merrill Lynch issued a $300 million irrevocable
standby letter of credit (“Merrill Lynch Letter of
Credit”) for the benefit of our Visa/ MasterCard credit
card processor (“Processor”). As contemplated in our
Visa/ MasterCard credit card processing agreement
(“Processing Agreement”), we are providing the Merrill
Lynch Letter of Credit as a substitution for a portion of the
cash reserve that the Processor maintains. Under the Processing
Agreement, the Processor is permitted to maintain a reserve from
our receivables that is equal to the Processor’s potential
liability for tickets purchased with Visa or MasterCard which
have not yet been used for travel (the “unflown ticket
liability”). We estimate that the reserve, which adjusts
daily, will range between

F-34


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

$450 million and $850 million during the term of the
Processing Agreement. The Processing Agreement allows us to
substitute the Merrill Lynch Letter of Credit for a portion of
the cash reserve equal to the lesser of $300 million and
45% of the unflown ticket liability.

The Merrill Lynch Letter of Credit may only be drawn upon
following certain events as described in the Processing
Agreement. In addition, the Processor must first apply both the
portion of the cash reserve that the Processor will continue to
hold and any offsets from collections by the Processor before
drawing on the Merrill Lynch Letter of Credit to cover fare
refunds paid to passengers by the Processor.

Our obligation to reimburse Merrill Lynch under the Merrill
Lynch Letter of Credit for any draws made by the Processor is
not secured and will constitute a super-priority administrative
expense claim that is subject to certain other claims, including
our post-petition financing. The Merrill Lynch Letter of Credit
will expire on January 21, 2008, but will renew
automatically for one year periods thereafter unless Merrill
Lynch notifies the Processor 420 days prior to the
applicable expiration date that it will not renew the Merrill
Lynch Letter of Credit.

Covenants

As discussed above, the DIP Credit Facility and the Amex
Post-Petition Facility (collectively, the “Post-Petition
Financing Agreements”) include certain affirmative,
negative and financial covenants. In addition, as is customary
in the airline industry, our aircraft lease and financing
agreements require that we maintain certain levels of insurance
coverage, including war-risk insurance. Failure to maintain
these coverages may result in an interruption to our operations.
See Note 10 for additional information about our war-risk
insurance currently provided by the U.S. government.

We were in compliance with these covenant requirements at
December 31, 2005 and 2004.

Note 9.     Lease
Obligations

We lease aircraft, airport terminal and maintenance facilities,
ticket offices and other property and equipment from third
parties. As allowed under Section 365 and other relevant
sections of the Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors may assume, assume
and assign, or reject certain executory contracts and unexpired
leases, including, without limitation, leases of real property,
aircraft and aircraft engines, subject to the approval of the
Bankruptcy Court and certain other conditions, including
compliance with Section 1110. Consequently, we anticipate
that our liabilities pertaining to leases will change
significantly in the future.

Rental expense for operating leases, which is recorded on a
straight-line basis over the life of the lease, totaled
$1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005 and
$1.3 billion for each of the years ended December 31,
2004 and 2003. Amounts due under capital leases are recorded as
liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our interest in
assets acquired under capital leases is recorded as property and
equipment on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amortization of
assets recorded under capital leases is included in depreciation
and amortization expense on our Consolidated Statements of
Operations. Our leases do not include residual value guarantees.

F-35


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The following tables summarize, as of December 31, 2005,
our minimum rental commitments under capital leases and
noncancelable operating leases (including certain aircraft under
contract carrier agreements) with initial terms in excess of one
year:

Capital Leases

Operating Leases

(1)

Payments related to Chautauqua aircraft are not included as we
    entered into this agreement prior to June 30, 2003.

At December 31, 2005, we operated 224 aircraft under
operating leases and 47 aircraft under capital leases.
These leases have remaining terms ranging from one month to
11 years. During the December 2004 quarter, we renegotiated
99 aircraft lease agreements (95 operating leases and
four capital leases) as part of our transformation plan
announced in 2004. As a result of changes in certain lease
terms, 33 of the operating leases were reclassified as capital
leases when their new terms were evaluated in accordance with
SFAS No. 13 “Accounting for Leases”
(“SFAS 13”).

In 2003, the EITF reached a consensus on
EITF

01-08

“Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a
Lease”

, which provides guidance whether an arrangement
contains a lease that is within the scope of SFAS 13. The
guidance is applicable to agreements entered into or modified
after June 30, 2003. Since that date, we have entered into
or modified contract carrier agreements with ASA, SkyWest,
Freedom Airlines, Inc. (“Freedom”) and Shuttle
America. These agreements provided us with the right to use 226
aircraft in the Delta Connection program at December 31,
2005. Our rights to use these aircraft are considered leases and
qualified for operating lease treatment under SFAS 13.
Payments related to these aircraft are included in the table
above. For additional information on these contract carriers
agreements, see Note 10.

Subsequent to December 31, 2005, we reached agreement with
a group of creditors on a term sheet to restructure the
financing for 88 Mainline aircraft. On February 15,
2006, the Bankruptcy Court approved

F-36


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

these transactions. We estimate that the closing of these
transactions, which is subject to the completion of definitive
documentation and certain other conditions, would result in
approximately $200 million in annual savings for us over
the next several years compared to our existing rent and debt
service obligations for these aircraft.

Note 10.

Purchase Commitments and Contingencies

Aircraft Order Commitments

Future commitments for aircraft on firm order as of
December 31, 2005 are estimated to be $3 billion. The
following table shows the timing of these commitments:

(1)

Represents advance deposits on certain aircraft on firm order
    for delivery after December 31, 2006.

Our aircraft order commitments as of December 31, 2005
consist of firm orders to purchase five

B777-200

aircraft and
50 B737-800 aircraft. This includes 10 B737-800
aircraft which we have entered into a definitive agreement to
sell to a third party immediately following delivery of these
aircraft to us by the manufacturer starting in 2007. These sales
will reduce our future commitments by approximately
$395 million during the period 2006 - 2008.

Contract Carrier Agreements

Delta Connection Carriers

We have contract carrier agreements with seven regional air
carriers. Under most of these agreements, the regional air
carriers operate some or all of their aircraft using our flight
code, and we schedule those aircraft, sell the seats on those
flights and retain the related revenues. We pay those airlines
an amount, as defined in the applicable agreement, which is
based on a determination of their cost of operating those
flights and other factors intended to approximate market rates
for those services.

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, the
following carriers operated as contract carriers (in addition to
Comair) pursuant to agreements under which we pay amounts based
on a determination of the costs of operating these flights and
other factors:

(1)

The table does not include information with respect to American
    Eagle Airlines, Inc. (“Eagle”) because our agreement
    with Eagle is structured as a revenue proration arrangement,
    which establishes a fixed dollar or percentage division of
    revenues for tickets sold to passengers traveling on connecting
    flight itineraries.

F-37


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(2)

In our Chapter 11 proceedings, we assumed our obligations
    under the contract carrier agreements with ASA and SkyWest
    Airlines. Accordingly, these agreements are not subject to
    rejection pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code.

(3)

ASA became an unaffiliated contract carrier on September 8,
    2005, after we sold ASA to SkyWest. The number of aircraft
    included in the chart reflects 167 regional jet aircraft and 12
    turbo-prop aircraft. The turbo-prop aircraft are scheduled to be
    removed from Delta Connection service by the end of 2007.

(4)

In May 2005, we entered into a contract carrier agreement with
    Mesa Air Group, Inc. (“Mesa”) and its wholly owned
    subsidiary, Freedom. We began placing these aircraft in service
    under the Delta Connection program in October 2005. In March
    2006, we entered into a separate agreement with Mesa and Freedom
    under which Freedom will operate 12 turbo-prop aircraft that
    will be placed into service beginning in July 2006.

(5)

In January 2005, we entered into a contract carrier agreement
    with Republic Holdings and its wholly owned subsidiary Republic
    Airline, Inc. (“Republic Airline”). In August 2005, we
    consented to the assignment of the contract carrier agreement by
    Republic Airline to Shuttle America.

The following table shows the Available Seat Miles
(“ASMs”) and Revenue Passenger Miles
(“RPMs”) operated for us under contract carrier
agreements with:

Contingencies Related to Termination of Contract Carrier
    Agreements

We may terminate the Chautauqua and Shuttle America agreements
without cause at any time after May 2010 and January 2013,
respectively, by providing certain advance notice. If we
terminate either the Chautauqua or Shuttle America agreements
without cause, Chautauqua or Shuttle America, respectively, has
the right to (1) assign to us leased aircraft that the
airline operates for us, provided we are able to continue the
leases on the same terms the airline had prior to the assignment
and (2) require us to purchase or lease any of the aircraft
that the airline owns and operates for us at the time of the
termination. If we are required to purchase aircraft owned by
Chautauqua or Shuttle America, the purchase price would be equal
to the amount necessary to (1) reimburse Chautauqua or
Shuttle America for the equity it provided to purchase the
aircraft and (2) repay in full any debt outstanding at such
time that is not being assumed in connection with such purchase.
If we are required to lease aircraft owned by Chautauqua or
Shuttle America, the lease would have (1) a rate equal to
the debt payments of Chautauqua or Shuttle America for the debt
financing of the aircraft calculated as if 90% of the aircraft
was debt financed by Chautauqua or Shuttle America and
(2) other specified terms and conditions.

We estimate that the total fair values, determined as of
December 31, 2005, of the aircraft that Chautauqua or
Shuttle America could assign to us or require that we purchase
if we terminate without cause our contract carrier agreements
with those airlines are $549 million and $386 million,
respectively. The actual

F-38


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

amount that we may be required to pay in these circumstances may
be materially different from these estimates.

Legal Contingencies

We are involved in various legal proceedings relating to
antitrust matters, employment practices, environmental issues
and other matters concerning our business. We cannot reasonably
estimate the potential loss for certain legal proceedings
because, for example, the litigation is in its early stages or
the plaintiff does not specify the damages being sought.

As a result of our Chapter 11 proceedings, virtually all
pre-petition pending litigation against us is stayed and related
amounts accrued have been classified in liabilities subject to
compromise on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at
December 31, 2005.

Other Contingencies

Regional Airports Improvement Corporation
    (“RAIC”)

We have obligations under a facilities agreement with the RAIC
to pay the bond trustee amounts sufficient to pay the debt
service on $47 million in Facilities Sublease Refunding
Revenue Bonds. These bonds were issued in 1996 to refinance the
construction of certain airport and terminal facilities we use
at Los Angeles International Airport. We also provide a
guarantee to the bond trustee covering payment of the debt
service.

General Indemnifications

We are the lessee under many real estate leases. It is common in
these commercial lease transactions for us, as the lessee, to
agree to indemnify the lessor and other related third parties
for tort, environmental and other liabilities that arise out of
or relate to our use or occupancy of the leased premises. This
type of indemnity would typically make us responsible to
indemnified parties for liabilities arising out of the conduct
of, among others, contractors, licensees and invitees at or in
connection with the use or occupancy of the leased premises.
This indemnity often extends to related liabilities arising from
the negligence of the indemnified parties, but usually excludes
any liabilities caused by either their sole or gross negligence
and their willful misconduct.

Our aircraft and other equipment lease and financing agreements
typically contain provisions requiring us, as the lessee or
obligor, to indemnify the other parties to those agreements,
including certain related parties, against virtually any
liabilities that might arise from the condition, use or
operation of the aircraft or such other equipment.

We believe that our insurance would cover most of our exposure
to such liabilities and related indemnities associated with the
types of lease and financing agreements described above,
including real estate leases.

Certain of our aircraft and other financing transactions include
provisions which require us to make payments to preserve an
expected economic return to the lenders if that economic return
is diminished due to certain changes in law or regulations. In
certain of these financing transactions, we also bear the risk
of certain changes in tax laws that would subject payments to

non-U.S.

lenders
to withholding taxes.

We cannot reasonably estimate our potential future payments
under the indemnities and related provisions described above
because we cannot predict (1) when and under what
circumstances these provisions may be triggered and (2) the
amount that would be payable if the provisions were triggered
because the amounts would be based on facts and circumstances
existing at such time. We also cannot predict the impact, if
any, that our Chapter 11 proceedings might have on these
obligations.

F-39


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Employees Under Collective Bargaining Agreements

At December 31, 2005, we had a total of approximately
55,700 full-time equivalent employees. Approximately 17% of
these employees, including all of our pilots, are represented by
labor unions.

We have been and continue to be in negotiations with ALPA, the
collective bargaining representative of Delta’s pilots, to
reduce our pilot labor costs as required under our business
plan. Because we were not able to reach a consensual agreement
with ALPA, on November 1, 2005, we filed a motion with the
Bankruptcy Court under Section 1113 of the Bankruptcy Code
to reject Delta’s collective bargaining agreement with
ALPA. In December 2005, we reached an interim agreement with
ALPA, which was approved by the Bankruptcy Court and ratified by
Delta’s pilots. For additional information about
Delta’s interim agreement with its pilots, see Note 1.

If we are ultimately authorized to reject Delta’s
collective bargaining agreement with ALPA, ALPA has threatened
to initiate a strike, which we believe should not be permitted
under the Railway Labor Act. However, we cannot predict the
outcome of any effort we might undertake to obtain court relief
to prevent or stop a strike or other forms of work disruption. A
strike or other form of significant work disruption by ALPA
would likely have a material negative impact on our ability to
continue operating our business and would trigger an event of
default under our Post-Petition Financing Agreements if all or
substantially all of our flight and other operations are
suspended for longer than two days. As a result, we could be
required to cease operations permanently.

Comair has reached agreements with ALPA, which represents
Comair’s pilots, and with the International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers (“IAM”), which
represents Comair’s maintenance employees, to reduce the
labor cost of both of these employee groups. These agreements
are, however, conditioned on Comair’s obtaining a specified
level of labor cost reductions under its collective bargaining
agreement with the IBT, representing Comair’s flight
attendants. Because Comair was not able to reach a consensual
agreement with the IBT, on February 22, 2006, Comair filed
a motion with the Bankruptcy Court to reject Comair’s
collective bargaining agreement with the IBT. This motion is
scheduled for hearing in the Bankruptcy Court on March 27,
2006. We cannot predict the outcome of this matter.

War-Risk Insurance Contingency

As a result of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001,
aviation insurers significantly reduced the maximum amount of
insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for
liability to persons (other than employees or passengers) for
claims resulting from acts of terrorism, war or similar events.
At the same time, aviation insurers significantly increased the
premiums for such coverage and for aviation insurance in
general. Since September 24, 2001, the U.S. government
has been providing U.S. airlines with war-risk insurance to
cover losses, including those resulting from terrorism, to
passengers, third parties (ground damage) and the aircraft hull.
The coverage currently extends through August 31, 2006
(with a possible extension to December 31, 2006 at the
discretion of the Secretary of Transportation). The withdrawal
of government support of airline war-risk insurance would
require us to obtain war-risk insurance coverage commercially,
if available. Such commercial insurance could have substantially
less desirable coverage than currently provided by the
U.S. government, may not be adequate to protect our risk of
loss from future acts of terrorism, may result in a material
increase to our operating expenses or may not be obtainable at
all, resulting in an interruption to our operations.

Other

We have certain contracts for goods and services that require us
to pay a penalty, acquire inventory specific to us or purchase
contract specific equipment, as defined by each respective
contract, if we terminate the contract without cause prior to
its expiration date. Because these obligations are contingent
upon whether we terminate the contract without cause prior to
its expiration date, no obligation would exist unless such a
termination was to occur. We also cannot predict the impact, if
any, that our Chapter 11 proceedings might have on these
obligations.

Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and income tax
purposes (see Note 2 for information about our accounting
policy for income taxes). The following table shows significant
components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at
December 31, 2005 and 2004:

The following table shows the current and noncurrent deferred
tax (liability) asset, recorded on our Consolidated Balance

In accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for
Income Taxes” (“SFAS 109”), the current and
noncurrent components of our deferred tax balances are generally
based on the balance sheet classification of the asset or
liability creating the temporary difference. If the deferred tax
asset or liability is not related to a component of our balance
sheet, such as our net operating loss (“NOL”)
carryforwards, the classification is presented based on the
expected reversal date of the temporary difference. Our
valuation allowance has been classified as current or noncurrent
based on the percentages of current and noncurrent deferred tax
assets to total deferred tax assets.

At December 31, 2005, we had $346 million of federal
alternative minimum tax (“AMT”) credit carryforwards,
which do not expire. We also had federal and state pretax NOL
carryforwards of approximately $8.5 billion at
December 31, 2005, substantially all of which will not
begin to expire until 2022. Our ability to utilize our AMT and
NOL carryforwards will be subject to significant limitation if,
as a result of our Chapter 11 filing, we undergo an
ownership change for purposes of Section 382 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. This could result in
the need for an additional valuation allowance, which may be
material. For additional information about the Bankruptcy
Court’s order designed to assist us in preserving our NOLs,
see Note 1.

Valuation Allowance

SFAS 109 requires us to periodically assess whether it is
more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable
income to realize our deferred income tax assets. In making this
determination, we consider all available positive and negative
evidence and make certain assumptions. We consider, among other
things, our deferred tax liabilities; the overall business
environment; our historical earnings and losses; our
industry’s historically cyclical periods of earnings and
losses; and our outlook for future years.

In the June 2004 quarter, we determined that it was unclear as
to the timing of when we will generate sufficient taxable income
to realize our deferred tax assets. Accordingly, during the year
ended December 31, 2004, we recorded an additional
valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets,
which resulted in a $1.2 billion income tax provision on
our 2004 Consolidated Statements of Operations. Until we
determine it is more likely than not that we will generate
sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax
assets, income tax benefits associated with current period
losses will be fully reserved.

Employee Benefit Plans

We sponsor qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension
plans, defined contribution pension plans, healthcare plans, and
disability and survivorship plans for eligible employees and
retirees, and their eligible family members. We reserve the
right to modify or terminate these plans as to all participants
and beneficiaries at any time, except as restricted by the
Internal Revenue Code, the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act (“ERISA”) and our collective bargaining agreements.

We regularly evaluate ways to better manage employee benefits
and control costs. Any changes to the plans or assumptions used
to estimate future benefits could have a significant effect on
the amount of the reported obligation and future annual expense.

Obligations related to our defined benefit plans, other
postretirement benefit plans, and certain postemployment
benefits have been classified as liabilities subject to
compromise, as these obligations may be impacted by the
Chapter 11 reorganization process. We currently cannot
predict how these obligations will be

impacted. For additional information, see “Payment of
Insurance Benefits to Retired Employees” and
“Liabilities Subject to Compromise,” in Note 1.

Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit
    Plans

We sponsor both funded and nonfunded noncontributory defined
benefit pension plans that cover substantially all of our
employees. We use a September 30 measurement date for all
our benefit plans.

Effective December 31, 2005, future pay and service
accruals under our qualified and non-qualified defined benefit
pension plans (collectively, the “Nonpilot Plan”) for
nonpilot employees (“nonpilot employees”) were frozen.
The Nonpilot Plan provides a retirement benefit based on a
combination of a final average earnings formula and a cash
balance formula, subject to the terms of that plan.

Our defined benefit pension plans for pilots (collectively, the
“Pilot Plan”) generally provide benefits based on
years of service and final average salary. Effective
December 31, 2004, the Pilot Plan was amended to freeze
service accruals. Future employee earnings continue to be used
in the calculation of pilots’ pension benefits under the
Pilot Plan. Under the Pilot Plan, Delta pilots who retire can
elect to receive 50% of the present value of their accrued
pension benefit in a lump sum in connection with their
retirement and the remaining 50% of their accrued pension
benefit as an annuity after retirement. While the Pilot Plan is
currently prohibited from making the lump sum payments, it is
currently projected that the lump sum feature would again become
available to pilots in October 2006 if the Pilot Plan is not
subject to termination proceedings prior to that date.

We also sponsor healthcare plans that provide benefits to
substantially all Delta retirees and their eligible dependents.
Benefits under these plans are funded from our current assets
and are subject to co-payments, deductibles and other limits as
described in the plans. Nonpilot employees who are hired on or
after January 1, 2003, or who retire after January 1,
2006 regardless of their date of hire, are not eligible for
company provided post retirement healthcare coverage, although
they may purchase such coverage at full cost. Additionally,
pilots hired after November 11, 2004 are not eligible for
company provided post-age 65 healthcare coverage, although
they may purchase such coverage at full cost.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Obligations (measured at September 30):

Our benefit obligations are impacted by actuarial
(gains) losses resulting from changes in assumptions and
experience different from that assumed at our previous
measurement date. In the table above, the $1.3 billion
increase in 2005 in our pension benefit obligation due to
actuarial losses primarily relates to (1) changes in our
discount rate and participant life expectancy assumptions used
to measure the obligation and (2) the large number of early
pilot retirements and related lump sum distributions from plan
assets.

The $320 million increase in 2005 in the pension benefit
obligation due to curtailment losses relates to (1) the
combined impact on the Nonpilot Plan of the early retirement
window, the Alternative Early Retirement Option
(“AERO”), offered to certain nonpilot employees in
late 2004 and other components of our transformation plan
announced in 2004 and (2) the amendment of the Pilot Plan
to freeze service accruals effective December 31, 2004.
These changes resulted in remeasurements of the associated
benefit obligations on November 30, 2004 and
December 31, 2004.

The $51 million decrease in 2005 in the other
postretirement benefit obligation due to plan amendments relates
to the elimination of company subsidized post-age 65
healthcare coverage for pilots hired after November 11,
2004.

The $487 million decrease in 2004 in the other
postretirement benefit obligation due to plan amendments relates
to (1) the September 30, 2004 amendment of our retiree
medical coverage for nonpilot employees who retire after
January 1, 2006, and (2) the December 31, 2003
remeasurement of our obligation due to the Medicare Act (see
Note 2), which introduced new prescription drug benefits to
retirees. The Medicare Act resulted in a reduction in our
accumulated postretirement benefits obligation
(“APBO”) due to (1) lower expected per capita
claims cost from Medicare’s assumption of a larger portion
of prescription drug costs and (2) lower anticipated
participation rates in our plans that provide postretirement
benefits.

Funded Status (measured at September 30):

In 2005 and 2004, settlement charges for the pension plans of
$129 million and $126 million, respectively, were
recognized between the measurement date and year end. These
related primarily to the Pilot Plan and are discussed in more
detail below as a component of net periodic pension cost.

The 2004 curtailment gain and special termination benefits
relate to changes to our retiree medical coverage for nonpilot
employees who retire after January 1, 2006 as discussed
above; pension credit being given to certain employees
furloughed under our transformation plan; and benefits provided
under AERO.

Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets consist of:

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we recorded adjustments to
intangible assets and accumulated other comprehensive loss (see
Note 14) to recognize our additional minimum pension
liability in accordance with SFAS No. 87,
“Employers’ Accounting for Pensions”
(“SFAS 87”). SFAS 87 requires that this
liability be recognized at year end in an amount equal to the
amount by which the accumulated benefit obligation
(“ABO”) exceeds the fair value of the defined benefit
pension plan assets. An intangible asset is recorded only to the
extent of any unrecognized prior service cost and transition
obligation.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all our defined benefit
pension plans was $12.8 billion and $12.1 billion at

Net periodic benefit cost for the years ended December 31,

During 2005, 2004, and 2003, we recorded settlement charges
totaling $388 million, $257 million, and
$219 million, respectively, in our Consolidated Statements
of Operations. These charges primarily relate to the Pilot Plan
and result from lump sum distributions to pilots who retired. We
recorded these charges in accordance with SFAS No. 88,
“Employers’ Accounting for Settlements and
Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for
Termination Benefits” (“SFAS 88”).
SFAS 88 requires settlement accounting if the cost of all
settlements, including lump sum retirement benefits paid, in a
year exceeds, or is expected to exceed, the total of the service
and interest cost components of pension expense for the same
period.

During 2005 and 2004, we recorded a net curtailment loss of
$434 million and a curtailment gain of $527 million,
respectively, in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The
$434 million net curtailment loss consists of (1) a
$13 million curtailment gain recorded in the December 2005
quarter related to the freeze of benefit accruals effective
December 31, 2005 for the Nonpilot Plan and (2) a
curtailment loss of $447 million related to the impact of
the reduction of nonpilot jobs announced in November 2004 and
the freeze of service accruals under the Pilot Plan effective
December 31, 2004. Additionally, in the December 2004
quarter, we recorded a $527 million curtailment gain
related to the elimination of company subsidized retiree medical
benefits for eligible employees who retire after January 1,
2006. These losses and gains are in accordance with
SFAS 88, which requires curtailment accounting when an
event occurs that significantly reduces the expected years of
future service of current employees or that eliminates future
benefit accruals for a significant number of employees.

Assumptions

We used the following actuarial assumptions to determine our
benefit obligations at September 30, 2005 and 2004 and our
net periodic benefit cost for the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, as measured at September 30:

We have implemented a limit on the amount we will pay for

    healthcare cost trend rate is assumed to decline gradually to
    5.00% by 2010 for health plan costs not subject to this limit
    and to zero by 2007 for health plan costs subject to the limit
    and remain level thereafter.

(2)

Our 2005 assumptions reflect our remeasurements
    (November 30, 2004, December 31, 2004, March 31,
    2005, and June 30, 2005) of certain portions of our
    obligations and represent the weighted average of the
    assumptions used for each measurement. Our 2004 assumptions
    reflect our quarterly remeasurements (December 31, 2003,
    March 31, 2004, and June 30, 2004) of certain portions
    of our obligations and represent the weighted average of the
    assumptions used for each measurement. Our 2003 assumptions
    reflect our October 31, 2002 remeasurement of a portion of
    our obligations and represent the weighted average of the
    September 30, 2002 and October 31, 2002 assumptions.

The expected long-term rate of return on our plan assets was
based on plan-specific asset/ liability investment studies
performed by outside consultants who used historical market
return and volatility data with forward looking estimates based
on existing financial market conditions and forecasts. Modest
excess return expectations versus some market indices were
incorporated into the return projections based on the actively
managed structure of our investment program and its record of
achieving such returns historically.

Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have an effect on the
amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans. A
1% change in the healthcare cost trend rate used in measuring
the APBO for these plans at September 30, 2005, would have
the following effects:

Pension Plan Assets

The weighted-average asset allocation for our pension plans at
September 30, 2005 and 2004 is as follows:

The investment strategy for pension plan assets is to utilize a
diversified mix of global public and private equity portfolios,
public and private fixed income portfolios, and private real
estate and natural resource investments to earn a long-term
investment return that meets or exceeds a 9% annualized return
target. The overall asset mix of the portfolio is more heavily
weighted in equity-like investments, including portions of the
bond portfolio which consist of convertible and high yield
securities. Active management strategies are utilized throughout
the program in an effort to realize investment returns in excess
of market indices. Also, option and currency overlay strategies
are used in an effort to generate modest amounts of additional
income, and a bond duration extension program utilizing fixed
income derivatives is employed in an effort to better align the
market value movements of a portion of the pension plan assets
to the related pension plan liabilities.

Target investment allocations for the pension plan assets are as
follows:

U.S. equity securities

27-41%

Non-U.S. equity securities

12-18%

High quality bonds

15-21%

Convertible and high yield bonds

5-11%

Private equity

15%

Real estate

10%

Cash Flows

In 2006, assuming current plan design, we expect funding of our
defined benefit plans for benefits accrued after our Petition
Date to be approximately $11 million. We believe that while
operating in Chapter 11, we are not required to make
contributions for benefits earned prior to our Petition Date.
Certain entities unsuccessfully challenged this position in
Bankruptcy Court, and the issue is currently on appeal. If the
Nonpilot and Pilot Plans continue after we emerge from
Chapter 11 we may be required to fully fund required
contributions at that date, including contributions related to
benefits earned prior to our Petition Date.

Based on our preliminary five-year forecast and additional
information regarding the assets and liabilities for the defined
benefit pension plans, we believe that, under current pension
funding rules, we would need to seek distress termination of
both the Nonpilot Plan and the Pilot Plan in order to
successfully reorganize and emerge from Chapter 11.
Proposed legislation that passed in the U.S. Senate and is
now pending in a House — Senate Conference Committee
would extend our funding obligations for the defined benefit
pension plans over 20 years. If the pending legislation is
enacted in the form in which it passed the U.S. Senate, we
hope to avoid a distress termination of the Nonpilot Plan,
though there is no assurance that we can do so. We currently
believe, however, that the existence of the lump sum option in
the Pilot Plan and the significant

F-48


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

number of early pilot retirements may make it unlikely that we
could satisfy our funding obligations to that plan even if the
pending legislation is enacted in the form in which it passed
the U.S. Senate.

Our other postretirement benefit plans are funded from current
assets. Assuming current plan design, we expect to make benefit
payments of approximately $142 million for our other
postretirement benefit plans in 2006.

Benefit Payments

Benefit payments are based on the same assumptions used to
measure the related benefit obligations and are paid from both
funded benefit plan trusts and current assets.

Benefit payments in the table below include payments associated
with both our qualified and non-qualified defined benefit plans.
Benefits earned under our qualified pension plans are expected
to be paid from funded benefit plan trusts. The benefits related
to our non-qualified plans are paid from current assets.
Non-qualified benefit payments earned prior to our Petition Date
ceased as of that date. We believe we are not required to make
these payments while we are operating under Chapter 11.
Actual benefit payments may vary significantly from these
estimates.

Benefit payments, which reflect expected service, as
appropriate, are scheduled to be paid in the following years
ending December 31:

(1)

Includes estimated payments of approximately $70 million to
    $80 million per year under our non-qualified defined
    benefit plans for benefits earned prior to the Petition Date.

Other Plans

We also sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible Delta
employees in certain foreign countries. These plans did not have
a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements in
any period presented.

Defined Contribution Pension Plans

Pilot Defined Contribution Plan

We established a defined contribution plan (“Pilot DC
Plan”) for Delta pilots effective January 1, 2005.
During 2005, we recognized expense of $83 million for this
plan. Eligible pilots will receive a contribution ranging from
0% to 22.9% of covered pay, based on the pilot’s age and
years of service on January 1, 2005. Pilots hired on or
after January 1, 2005 will receive a contribution of 10% of
covered pay.

Delta Pilots Money Purchase Pension Plan
    (“MPPP”)

We contributed 5% of covered pay to the MPPP for each eligible
Delta pilot through December 31, 2004. The MPPP is related
to the Pilot Plan. The defined benefit pension payable to a
pilot is reduced by the actuarial equivalent of the accumulated
account balance in the MPPP. During the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003, we recognized expense of
$65 million and $66 million, respectively, for this
plan. Although

F-49


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

contributions to the MPPP ceased effective December 31,
2004, individual accounts will continue to be credited with
investment gains/losses and the actuarial equivalent of the
accumulated account balance at retirement will continue to
offset the participants defined benefit pension benefit.

Delta Family-Care Savings Plan (“Savings Plan”)

Eligible employees may contribute a portion of their covered pay
to the Savings Plan. Generally, we match 50% of nonpilot
employee contributions with a maximum employer contribution of
2% of a participant’s covered pay. In 2003 and 2004, we
provided all eligible Delta pilots with an employer contribution
of 3% of their covered pay. Effective January 1, 2005, the
employer contribution for eligible Delta pilots was reduced to
2% of their covered pay. Prior to the Petition Date, we
generally made our contributions for nonpilots and pilots by
allocating Series B ESOP Convertible Preferred Stock
(“ESOP Preferred Stock”), common stock or cash to the
Savings Plan. Effective on the Petition Date, we began making
all company contributions to the Savings Plan in cash. Our
contributions, which are recorded as salaries and related costs
in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, totaled
$56 million, $85 million and $81 million for the
years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Our Savings Plan includes an employee stock ownership plan
(“ESOP”) feature. When we adopted the ESOP in 1989, we
sold 6,944,450 shares of ESOP Preferred Stock to the
Savings Plan for $500 million. We have recorded unearned
compensation equal to the value of the shares of ESOP Preferred
Stock not yet allocated to participants’ accounts. We
reduced the unearned compensation as shares of ESOP Preferred
Stock were allocated to participants’ accounts. At
December 31, 2005, 3,510,490 shares of ESOP Preferred
Stock were allocated to participants’ accounts, and
1,157,078 shares were held by the ESOP for future
allocations. Subsequent to December 31, 2005, all
unallocated ESOP Preferred stock was allocated to participants
and converted to common stock. See Note 13 for additional
information.

Cash Flows

We expect to contribute approximately $100 million to our
defined contribution pension plans in 2006.

Other Plans

Comair and DAL Global Services, Inc., two of our wholly owned
subsidiaries, sponsor defined contribution retirement plans for
eligible employees. Additionally, we sponsor defined
contribution plans for eligible Delta employees in certain
foreign countries. These plans did not have a material impact on
our Consolidated Financial Statements in any period presented.

Postemployment Benefits

We provide certain other welfare benefits to eligible former or
inactive employees after employment but before retirement,
primarily as part of the disability and survivorship plans.
Postemployment benefit expense was $107 million,
$105 million and $131 million for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We include
the amount funded in excess of the liability in other noncurrent
assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Future period
expenses will vary based on actual claims experience and the
return on plan assets. Gains and losses occur because actual
experience differs from assumed experience. Gains and losses and
prior service costs related to our disability and survivorship
plans are amortized over the average future service period of
employees covered by these plans.

Note 13.

Common and Preferred Stock

During the year ended December 31, 2005, we distributed
from treasury 38 million shares of our common stock for
redemptions of our ESOP Preferred Stock under the Delta
Family-Care Savings Plan. We distributed these shares from
treasury at an average price that is lower than the average
price we paid to purchase these shares. As a result, our
Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2005 reflects an
approximately $1.8 billion decrease in treasury stock at
cost, and a corresponding decrease in additional

F-50

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

-capital. Due to
our Chapter 11 filing, we are no longer redeeming shares of
our ESOP Preferred Stock.

At our Annual Meeting of Shareowners held on May 19, 2005,
shareowners approved an amendment to our Certificate of
Incorporation to increase the number of shares of common stock
that we are authorized to issue from 450 million to
900 million and to decrease the par value of the common
stock from $1.50 per share to $0.01 per share. As a
result of this amendment, our Consolidated Balance Sheet at
December 31, 2005 reflects a $289 million decrease in
common stock and a corresponding increase in additional paid-in
capital.

Stock Option and Other Stock-Based Award Plans

Prior to the Petition Date, we adopted certain plans which
provide for the issuance of common stock in connection with the
exercise of stock options and for other stock-based awards.
Stock options awarded under these plans (1) have an
exercise price equal to the fair value of the common stock on
the grant date; (2) become exercisable one to five years
after the grant date; and (3) expire up to 10 years
after the grant date.

We believe that all of our stock options will be cancelled as
part of our emergence from Chapter 11. Accordingly, in
March 2006, we filed with the Bankruptcy Court a motion seeking
authority to reject our outstanding stock options to avoid the
administrative and other costs associated with our stock option
plans.

The following table includes additional information about these
plans as of December 31, 2005. Except as set forth in
Note 1 to the table, due to our Chapter 11
proceedings, no future awards will be made under these plans:

(1)

During the December 2004 quarter, we adopted these nonpilot and
    pilot plans due to the substantial contributions made by
    employees to our

out-of

-court
    restructuring efforts. We did not seek shareowner approval to
    adopt these plans because the Audit Committee of our Board of
    Directors determined that the delay necessary in obtaining such
    approval would seriously jeopardize our financial viability. The
    New York Stock Exchange accepted our reliance on this exception
    to its shareowner approval policy. The plans provide that shares
    reserved for awards that are forfeited are available for future
    stock option grants. At December 31, 2005, a total of
    approximately 8.8 million shares were available for future
    stock option grants under this forfeiture provision.

(2)

In 1996, shareowners approved broad-based nonpilot and pilot
    stock option plans. Under these two plans, we granted eligible
    employees non-qualified stock options to purchase a total of
    49.4 million shares of common stock in three approximately
    equal installments on October 30, 1996, 1997 and 1998.

(3)

On October 25, 2000, shareowners approved this plan, which
    authorized the grant of stock options and a limited number of
    other stock awards. The plan amends and restates a prior plan
    which was also approved by shareowners.

(4)

On October 22, 1998, the Board of Directors approved this
    plan under which each non-employee director could have received
    an annual grant of non-qualified stock options.

(5)

In 1995, shareowners approved this plan, under which a portion
    of each non-employee director’s compensation for serving as
    a director was paid in shares of common stock.

years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003:

The following table summarizes information about stock options
outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2005:

Payment of Dividends

The determination to pay cash dividends on our ESOP Preferred
Stock and our common stock is at the discretion of our Board of
Directors, and is also subject to the provisions of Delaware
General Corporation Law (“Delaware Law”) and
restrictions in our DIP Credit Facility and Amex Post-Petition
Facility.

In July 2003, our Board of Directors discontinued the payment of
quarterly cash dividends on our common stock due to the
financial challenges facing Delta. We had previously paid a
quarterly dividend of $0.025 per common share.

Effective December 2003, our Board of Directors suspended
indefinitely the payment of dividends on our ESOP Preferred
Stock to comply with provisions of Delaware Law, which limits a
company’s ability to pay dividends. The terms of the ESOP
Preferred Stock provided for cumulative dividends on that stock.
Unpaid dividends on the ESOP Preferred Stock accrued without
interest, until paid, at a rate of $4.32 per share per
year. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, accumulated but unpaid
dividends on the ESOP Preferred Stock totaled $50 million
and $35 million, respectively, and are recorded in
Liabilities Subject to Compromise on our Consolidated Balance
Sheet. Subsequent to December 31, 2005 all outstanding
shares of ESOP Preferred Stock were converted into common stock.
See “ESOP Preferred Stock” below.

ESOP Preferred Stock

In December 2005, we amended the Savings Plan to give eligible
participants the opportunity to receive an in-service
distribution of the ESOP Preferred Stock and common stock in
their ESOP accounts in the Savings Plan. Under this amendment,
which was approved by the Bankruptcy Court, eligible
participants could make an election between December 19,
2005 and January 18, 2006 to receive such an in-service
distribution. Upon its distribution, the ESOP Preferred Stock
was automatically converted in accordance with its terms into
shares of common stock. Subsequent to January 18, 2006, the
trustee of the Savings Plan converted all the remaining shares
of ESOP Preferred Stock into common stock.

Each outstanding share of ESOP Preferred Stock accrued a
cumulative cash dividend of 6% per year of its stated value
of $72.00; was convertible into 1.7155 shares of common
stock, which is equivalent to a conversion price of
$41.97 per share; and had a liquidation preference of
$72.00, plus accrued and unpaid dividends. The ESOP Preferred
Stock generally voted together as a single class with the common
stock and had two votes per share. The conversion rate,
conversion price and voting rights of the ESOP Preferred Stock
were subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.

All shares of ESOP Preferred Stock were held of record by the
trustee of the Savings Plan (see Note 12). At
December 31, 2005, 8,007,213 shares of common stock
were reserved for the conversion of the ESOP Preferred Stock.

Prior to our Chapter 11 filing, we were generally required
to redeem shares of ESOP Preferred Stock (1) to provide for
distributions of the accounts of Savings Plan participants who
terminate employment with us and request a distribution and
(2) to implement annual diversification elections by
Savings Plan participants who are at least age 55 and have
participated in the Savings Plan for at least 10 years. In
these circumstances, shares of ESOP Preferred Stock were
redeemable at a price (“Redemption Price”) equal
to the greater of (1) $72.00 per share or (2) the
fair value of the shares of common stock issuable upon
conversion of the ESOP Preferred Stock to be redeemed, plus, in
either case, accrued and unpaid dividends on the shares of ESOP
Preferred Stock to be redeemed. Under the terms of the ESOP
Preferred Stock, we were able to pay the Redemption Price
in cash, shares of common stock (valued at fair market value),
or in a combination thereof. Due to our Chapter 11 filing,
we ceased redeeming shares of ESOP Preferred Stock.

Shareowner Rights Plan

The Shareowner Rights Plan is designed to protect shareowners
against attempts to acquire Delta that do not offer an adequate
purchase price to all shareowners, or are otherwise not in the
best interest of Delta and our shareowners. Under the plan, each
outstanding share of common stock is accompanied by one-half of
a preferred stock purchase right. Each whole right entitles the
holder to purchase 1/100 of a share of Series D Junior
Participating Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $300,
subject to adjustment.

The rights become exercisable only after a person acquires, or
makes a tender or exchange offer that would result in the person
acquiring, beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our common
stock. If a person acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more
of our common stock, each right will entitle its holder (other
than the acquiring person) to exercise his rights to purchase
our common stock having a market value of twice the exercise
price.

If a person acquires beneficial interest of 15% or more of our
common stock and (1) we are involved in a merger or other
business combination in which we are not the surviving
corporation, or (2) we sell more than 50% of our assets or
earning power, then each right will entitle its holder (other
than the acquiring person) to exercise their rights to purchase
common stock of the acquiring company having a market value of
twice the exercise price.

The rights expire on November 4, 2006. We may redeem the
rights for $0.01 per right at any time before a person
becomes the beneficial owner of 15% or more of our common stock.
We may amend the rights in any respect so long as the rights are
redeemable. At December 31, 2005, 2,250,000 shares of
preferred stock were reserved for issuance under the Shareowner
Rights Plan.

Geographic Information

SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information”
(“SFAS 131”), requires us to disclose certain
information about our operating segments. Operating segments are
defined as components of an enterprise with separate financial
information which is evaluated regularly by the chief operating
decision-maker and is used in resource allocation and
performance assessments.

We are managed as a single business unit that provides air
transportation for passengers and cargo. This allows us to
benefit from an integrated revenue pricing and route network
that includes Mainline, Comair and our contract carriers. The
flight equipment of the carriers is combined to form one fleet
which is deployed through a single route scheduling system. When
making resource allocation decisions, our chief operating
decision maker evaluates flight profitability data, which
considers aircraft type and route economics, but gives no weight
to the financial impact of the resource allocation decision on
an individual carrier basis. Our objective in making resource
allocation decisions is to optimize our consolidated financial
results.

Operating revenues are assigned to a specific geographic region
based on the origin, flight path and destination of each flight
segment. Our operating revenues by geographic region for the
years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 are summarized
in the following table:

(in millions)

Restructuring and Other Reserves

The following table shows changes in our restructuring and other
reserve balances as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
and the associated activity for the years then ended:

The facilities and other reserve represents costs related
primarily to (1) future lease payments for facility
closures and (2) contract termination fees. We recorded
charges of $5 million for future lease payments associated
with the early retirement of leased aircraft, during the period
from January 1, 2005 through the Petition Date.

The severance and related costs reserve represents future
payments associated with our 2005, 2004, 2002 and 2001 voluntary
and involuntary workforce reduction programs. Under the 2005
program, we plan to eliminate 7,000 to 9,000 jobs by the end of
2007. During 2003, we recorded a $21 million adjustment to
prior year reserves based on revised estimates of remaining
costs primarily due to fewer employee reductions under our 2002
involuntary workforce reduction program than originally
anticipated because of higher than expected reductions from
attrition and retirements.

In accordance with
SOP

90-7,

substantially all of our pre-petition restructuring and other
reserves were classified as liabilities subject to compromise.

Note 18.

Equity Investments

WORLDSPAN, L.P. (“Worldspan”)

On June 30, 2003, we sold our 40% equity investment in
Worldspan, for (1) $285 million in cash and (2) a
$45 million subordinated promissory note, which paid
interest at 10% per annum and was scheduled to mature in
2012. As a result of this transaction, we recorded a
$279 million gain ($176 million net of tax) in other
income (expense) on our 2003 Consolidated Statements of
Operations. In addition, we will receive credits totaling
approximately $125 million, which will be recognized
ratably as a reduction of costs through 2012, for future
Worldspan-provided services.

The carrying and fair value of the subordinated promissory note
was $36 million and $38 million at December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively, which reflects a writedown
resulting from a decrease in its fair value. This note was
classified as a trading security under SFAS 115 (see
Note 2). On January 10, 2005,

F-57


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Worldspan redeemed the subordinated promissory note for
$36 million, which represented the carrying value of the
note as of December 31, 2004.

Our equity earnings from this investment totaled
$18 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. We
also received cash dividends from Worldspan of $44 million
for the year ended December 31, 2003.

Worldspan provides us with computer reservation and related
services for which we paid approximately $90 million for
the six-months ended June 30, 2003. As discussed above, we
sold our equity interest in Worldspan on June 30, 2003.

Orbitz, Inc. (“Orbitz”)

During November 2004, we sold our remaining ownership and voting
interest in Orbitz for approximately $143 million. We
recognized a gain of approximately $123 million on this
transaction in gain from sale of investments, net.

During December 2003, Orbitz completed its initial public
offering and the founding airlines of Orbitz, including us, sold
a portion of their Orbitz shares. We received $33 million
from our sale of Orbitz shares. Additionally, we recorded
(1) a SAB 51 gain of $18 million, net of tax, in
additional paid-in capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheet
(see Note 2 for our SAB 51 accounting policy);
(2) a $28 million gain ($17 million net of tax)
in other income (expense) on our Consolidated Statement of
Operations from our sale of Orbitz shares; and (3) a
$4 million loss ($2 million net of tax) in other
income (expense) on our Consolidated Statement of Operations
from previously unrecognized Orbitz losses since our recorded
investment in Orbitz was zero prior to its initial public
offering.

As a result of our sale of a portion of our Orbitz shares in
December 2003, we had a 13% ownership interest and an 18% voting
interest in Orbitz. Prior to that transaction, we had an 18%
ownership and voting interest in Orbitz. We accounted for our
investment in Orbitz under the equity method because we had the
ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over
the financial and operating policies of Orbitz. This ability was
evidenced by, among other things, our right to appoint at least
one of our senior officers to the Board of Directors of Orbitz.

For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the gains
(losses) recorded from our investment in Orbitz were not
material to our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Note 19.

Loss per Share

We calculate basic loss per share by dividing the net loss
available to common shareowners by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding. Diluted loss per share includes
the dilutive effects of stock options and convertible
securities. To the extent stock options and convertible
securities are anti-dilutive, they are excluded from the
calculation of diluted loss per share.

The following table shows our computation of basic and diluted
loss per share:

For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we
excluded from our loss per share calculations all common stock
equivalents, which primarily include stock options, our ESOP
Preferred Stock

F-58


NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

and shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of our
8.0% Convertible Senior Notes due June 3, 2023
(“8.0% Notes”) and our


/


% Convertible
Senior Notes due 2024
(“2


/


% Notes”) (as applicable), because their effect
on loss per share was anti-dilutive. The common stock
equivalents totaled 143.2 million, 78.8 million and
51.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively.

During 2004, we adopted
EITF

04-08,

which
required the adjustment to prior period diluted earnings per
share amounts for contingently convertible securities. We have
outstanding two classes of contingently convertible debt
securities: (1) 8.0% Notes, which we issued in June
2003, and
(2) 2


/


% Notes, which we issued in February 2004.

Due to the adoption of
EITF

04-08

as of
December 31, 2004, we adjusted our basic loss per share for
the three months ended June 30, 2003 to include the
dilutive impact of the 12.5 million shares of common stock
issuable upon conversion of the 8.0% Notes. All other
quarterly and annual diluted loss per share calculations for
periods ending before December 31, 2004 were not impacted
by our adoption of
EITF

04-08

due to
the anti-dilutive nature of these securities.

Note 20.

Government Compensation and Reimbursements

During 2003, we received payments from the U.S. Government
under the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act
totaling (1) $398 million as reimbursement for
passenger and air carrier security fees, which we recorded as a
reduction of operating expenses in our 2003 Consolidated
Statements of Operations, and (2) $13 million related
to the strengthening of flight deck doors, which we recorded as
a reduction to previously capitalized costs.

Note 21.

Valuation and Qualifying Accounts

The following table shows our valuation and qualifying accounts
as of December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, and the associated
activity for the years then ended:

(1)

See Notes 16 and 17 for additional information related to
    leased aircraft and restructuring and other charges.

(2)

The payments and deductions related to the allowance for
    uncollectible accounts receivable represent the write-off of
    accounts considered to be uncollectible, less recoveries.

$29 million of this amount was recorded in accumulated
    other comprehensive loss on our 2004 Consolidated Balance Sheet
    (see Note 14).

$141 million of this amount was recorded in accumulated
    other comprehensive loss on our 2005 Consolidated Balance Sheet

Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)

The following table summarizes our unaudited quarterly results
of operations for 2005 and 2004:

As discussed in Note 2, “Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies — Reclassifications”, for the
year ended December 31, 2005, certain revenues related to
the sale of mileage credits under our SkyMiles frequent flyer
program are recorded as other revenues rather than as selling
expenses. We have reclassified prior period amounts to be
consistent with the current year presentation. These
reclassifications did not impact earnings (loss) from operations
or net loss for any period presented.

The following table shows the effect of these reclassifications
on operating revenues for amounts previously reported in our
Quarterly Reports on
Form

10-Q

for the
quarters ended March 31, 2005, June 30, 2005 and
September 30, 2005 and our 2004
Form

10-K.

The comparability of our financial results during 2005 and 2004
was materially impacted by certain events, as discussed below:

•

On September 14, 2005, we
    and substantially all of our subsidiaries filed voluntary
    petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United
    States Bankruptcy Code. In accordance with
    SOP

90-7,

we
    recorded and categorized all of the bankruptcy related activity
    as a charge to reorganization items and reclassified or accrued
    certain liabilities as liabilities subject to compromise.

•

During 2005 and 2004, we
    recorded certain restructuring, asset writedowns, pension
    settlements and related items, net as follows: (1) a
    $447 million curtailment charge in the March 2005 quarter;
    (2) $388 million in settlement charges primarily
    during the June and December 2005 quarters; and
    (3) $251 million in settlement charges primarily in
    the June and December 2004 quarters. See Note 16 for
    additional information about these items.
