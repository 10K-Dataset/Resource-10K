PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

General Description

We are the world’s largest airline, providing scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo throughout the United States
and around the world. On October 29, 2008, a subsidiary of ours merged with and into Northwest Airlines Corporation (“Northwest”). As a result of this merger, Northwest and its subsidiaries, including Northwest Airlines, Inc.
(“NWA”), became wholly-owned subsidiaries of Delta. We plan to fully integrate the operations of NWA into Delta as promptly as is feasible, which we anticipate we will substantially complete in 2010.

The merger better positions us to manage through economic cycles and volatile fuel prices, invest in our fleet, improve services for customers and
achieve our strategic objectives. We believe the merger will generate approximately $2 billion in annual revenue and cost synergies by 2012 from more effective aircraft utilization, a more comprehensive and diversified route system and cost
synergies from reduced overhead and improved operational efficiency. We expect to incur one-time cash costs of approximately $500 million over approximately three years to integrate the two airlines.

We have developed the following strategy that is intended to make Delta the premier global airline:

•

build a financially viable airline by achieving consistent profitability, top-tier industry pre-tax margins and an
industry-leading balance sheet, including diversifying our revenues from sources such as our SkyMiles

®

frequent flyer program, cargo transportation and our aircraft maintenance, repair and
overhaul business;

•

create a comprehensive worldwide network that is structurally sustainable, drives unit revenue premiums relative to the industry average and generates long-term
profits;

•

maintain responsible and disciplined capital management, including making investments in our aircraft fleet based on demonstrated returns;

•

pursue strategic options to broaden our network scope and long-term viability, including through our merger with Northwest and our expanded marketing alliance with
Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air;

•

build the leading global airline alliance in terms of market presence, distribution, customer experience and financial contribution;

•

deliver industry-leading safety and operational performance coupled with a strong commitment to customer service; and

•

sustain a competitive advantage by building a world-class employee-friendly airline that is productive, diverse, accountable, results-driven and known as a great
place to work.

We are incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. Our principal executive offices are located
at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in Atlanta, Georgia (the “Atlanta Airport”). Our telephone number is (404) 715-2600 and our Internet address is www.delta.com. Information contained on this website is not part of,
and is not incorporated by reference in, this Form 10-K.

Airline Operations

Our global route network is centered around the hub system we operate at airports in Atlanta, Cincinnati, Detroit, Memphis, Minneapolis/St. Paul, New
York-JFK, Salt Lake City, Amsterdam and Tokyo-Narita. Each of these hub operations includes flights that gather and distribute traffic from markets in the geographic region surrounding the hub to domestic and international cities and to other hubs.
The combination of Delta’s strengths in the south, mountain west and northeast United States, Europe and Latin America and NWA’s strengths in the



Index to Financial Statements

midwest and northwest United States and Asia gives the combined company a diversified global network with a presence in every major domestic and
international market. The network is supported by a fleet of aircraft that is varied in terms of size and capabilities, giving us flexibility to adjust aircraft to the network.

Other key characteristics of our route network include:

•

our alliances with foreign airlines, including our membership in SkyTeam, a global airline alliance;

•

Delta’s transatlantic joint venture with Air France and NWA’s transatlantic joint venture with KLM;

•

our domestic alliances, including our marketing alliance with Alaska and Horizon, which we are enhancing to expand our west coast service; and

•

agreements with multiple domestic regional carriers, which operate either as Delta Connection or Northwest Airlink, including our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Comair,
Inc. (“Comair”), Compass Airlines, Inc. (“Compass”) and Mesaba Aviation, Inc. (“Mesaba”).

International Alliances

We have bilateral and multilateral marketing alliances with foreign airlines to improve our
access to international markets. These arrangements can include codesharing, reciprocal frequent flyer program benefits, shared or reciprocal access to passenger lounges, joint promotions, common use of airport gates and ticket counters, ticket
office co-location and other marketing agreements. These alliances often present opportunities in other areas, such as airport ground handling arrangements and aircraft maintenance insourcing.

Our international codesharing agreements enable us to market and sell seats to an expanded number of international destinations. Under international
codesharing arrangements, we and a foreign carrier each publish our respective airline designator codes on a single flight operation, thereby allowing us and the foreign carrier to offer joint service with one aircraft, rather than operating
separate services with two aircraft. These arrangements typically allow us to sell seats on a foreign carrier’s aircraft that are marketed under our designator codes and permit the foreign airline to sell seats on our aircraft that are marketed
under the foreign carrier’s designator code.

Delta has international codeshare arrangements with Aeromexico, Air France, Alitalia,
China Airlines, China Southern, CSA Czech Airlines, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Korean Air and Royal Air Maroc (and some affiliated carriers operating in conjunction with these airlines). In addition to its transatlantic joint venture with KLM
discussed below, NWA has international codeshare arrangements with Air France, Korean Air, and Malev Hungarian Airlines.

SkyTeam.

In addition to our marketing alliance agreements with individual foreign airlines, Delta and NWA are members of the SkyTeam global airline alliance. The other full members of SkyTeam are Aeroflot, Aeromexico, Air France, Alitalia, China
Southern, Continental, CSA Czech Airlines, KLM and Korean Air. One goal of SkyTeam is to link the route networks of the member airlines, providing opportunities for increased connecting traffic while offering enhanced customer service through mutual
codesharing arrangements, reciprocal frequent flyer and lounge programs and coordinated cargo operations. Continental has provided written notice of the termination of its membership in SkyTeam effective October 24, 2009.

In 2002, Delta, Air France, Alitalia, CSA Czech Airlines and Korean Air received limited antitrust immunity from the U.S. Department of Transportation
(“DOT”) that enables us and our immunized partners to offer a more integrated route network and develop common sales, marketing and discount programs for customers.

Air France and KLM Joint Ventures.

In addition to being members in SkyTeam with Air France and KLM, both of which are subsidiaries of the same
holding company, Delta has a transatlantic joint venture agreement



Index to Financial Statements

with Air France and NWA has a transatlantic joint venture agreement with KLM. These agreements provide for the sharing of revenues and costs on transatlantic
routes, as well as coordinated pricing, scheduling, and product development on included routes.

In 2007, Delta entered into its joint
venture agreement with Air France to share decision making, revenues and costs on transatlantic routes. The initial implementation of the joint venture in April 2008 included flights operated by both carriers between Air France’s Paris-Charles
de Gaulle, Paris-Orly and Lyon hubs and our Atlanta, Cincinnati, NewYork-JFK and Salt Lake City hubs, as well as all flights between London Heathrow Airport and the U.S., with plans for the joint venture to be extended to all transatlantic flights
operated by Air France and Delta between North America and Europe and the Mediterranean, as well as all flights between Los Angeles and Tahiti by 2010.

In 1992, NWA entered into its joint venture agreement with KLM to share decision making, revenues and costs on transatlantic routes. Pursuant to this joint venture, NWA and KLM operate an extensive transatlantic
network, including operating joint service between Amsterdam and cities in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, as well as between Amsterdam and India.

Delta, NWA, Air France and KLM are currently negotiating the terms for implementing a combined transatlantic joint venture, which is expected to be implemented no later than November 2009 and would replace the separate joint ventures
described above.

In May 2008, we, NWA, Air France, Alitalia, CSA Czech Airlines and KLM received limited antitrust immunity from the DOT
that enables us and our immunized partners to offer a more integrated route network and develop common sales, marketing and discount programs for customers. The DOT conditioned the continued effectiveness of this antitrust immunity on the
implementation within 18 months of a joint venture agreement among us, NWA, Air France and KLM. A more integrated joint venture would offer significant advantages to consumers, including more choice in flight schedules, travel times, services and
fares. In light of the recent reorganization of Alitalia and its subsidiaries under a new structure with C.A.I. Compagnia Aerea Italiana S.p.A., Delta and NWA have suspended immunized activities with Alitalia (but not codesharing, reciprocal
frequent flyer program benefits, shared or reciprocal access to passenger lounges or other alliance marketing activities) while we seek to transfer the above-described antitrust immunity to the new Alitalia.

Domestic Alliances

We and NWA
have entered into marketing alliances with (1) Continental (including regional carriers affiliated with Continental) and (2) Alaska and Horizon, each of which includes mutual codesharing and reciprocal frequent flyer and airport lounge
access arrangements. Delta also has frequent flyer and reciprocal lounge agreements with Hawaiian Airlines, and a codesharing agreement with American Eagle Airlines (“American Eagle”). NWA also has frequent flyer and codesharing agreements
with several other airlines, including American Eagle, Gulfstream International Airlines, Hawaiian, and Midwest Airlines. These marketing relationships are designed to permit the carriers to retain their separate identities and route networks while
increasing the number of domestic and international connecting passengers using the carriers’ route networks. Continental has provided written notice to Delta and NWA of the termination of its participation in marketing alliances with Delta and
NWA effective July 31, 2009 and April 14, 2009, respectively. We plan to wind down the relationships with Continental in an orderly manner and do not expect the termination of the alliances to have any significant impact.

Regional Carriers

Delta and
NWA have air service agreements with multiple domestic regional air carriers that feed traffic to our route system by serving passengers primarily in small- and medium-sized cities. These arrangements enable us to increase the number of flights we
have available in certain locations, to better match capacity with demand and to preserve our presence in smaller markets. Approximately 23% of our passenger revenue in 2008 related to flying by regional air carriers.



Index to Financial Statements

Through our regional carrier program, we have contractual arrangements with ten regional carriers to
operate regional jet and, in certain cases, turbo-prop aircraft using our “DL” and “NW” designator codes. In addition to our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Comair, Compass and Mesaba, we have contractual arrangements with Atlantic
Southeast Airlines, Inc., a subsidiary of SkyWest, Inc. (“SkyWest”); SkyWest Airlines, Inc., a subsidiary of SkyWest; Chautauqua Airlines, Inc., a subsidiary of Republic Airways Holdings, Inc. (“Republic Holdings”); Shuttle
America Corporation, a subsidiary of Republic Holdings; Freedom Airlines, Inc., a subsidiary of Mesa Air Group, Inc.; Pinnacle Airlines, Inc.; and American Eagle.

With the exception of Eagle and a portion of SkyWest Airlines as described below, these agreements are capacity purchase arrangements, under which Delta and NWA control the scheduling, pricing, reservations, ticketing
and seat inventories for the regional carrier’s flights operating under our “DL” and “NW” designator codes, and we are entitled to all ticket, cargo and mail revenues associated with these flights. We pay those airlines an
amount, as defined in the applicable agreement, which is based on a determination of their cost of operating those flights and other factors intended to approximate market rates for those services. These capacity purchase agreements are long-term
agreements, usually with initial terms of at least ten years, which grant us the option to extend the initial term and provide us the right to terminate the entire agreement, or in some cases remove some of the aircraft from the scope of the
agreement, for convenience at certain future dates. Our arrangements with Eagle, limited to certain flights operated to and from the Los Angeles International Airport, as well as a portion of the flights operated for us by SkyWest Airlines, are
structured as revenue proration agreements. These proration agreements establish a fixed dollar or percentage division of revenues for tickets sold to passengers traveling on connecting flight itineraries.

Frequent Flyer Programs

Delta and NWA both have frequent flyer programs, which are designed to retain and increase traveler loyalty by offering incentives to customers to increase travel on each airline. We are in the process of integrating these programs with a
goal of combining the programs by the beginning of 2010.

Delta’s SkyMiles

®

program allows program members to earn mileage for travel awards by flying on Delta, Delta’s regional carriers and other participating airlines. Mileage credit may also be earned by using
certain services offered by program participants, such as credit card companies, hotels, car rental agencies, telecommunication services and internet services. In addition, individuals and companies may purchase mileage credits. We reserve the right
to terminate the program with six months’ advance notice, and to change the program’s terms and conditions at any time without notice.

SkyMiles mileage credits can be redeemed for free or upgraded air travel on Delta and participating airlines, for membership in our Crown Room Club and for other program participant awards. Travel awards are subject to certain transfer
restrictions and capacity-controlled seating. In some cases, blackout dates may apply. Program accounts with no activity for 12 consecutive months after enrollment are deleted. Miles will not expire so long as, at least once every two years, the
participant (1) takes a qualifying flight on Delta or a Delta Connection carrier, (2) earns miles through one of our program participants, (3) buys miles from Delta or (4) redeems miles for any program award.

NWA’s frequent flyer program is known as “WorldPerks.” Under the WorldPerks program, miles are earned by flying on NWA or its
alliance partners and by using the services of program participants for such things as credit card use, hotel stays, car rentals and other activities. NWA sells mileage credits to alliance and non-airline program participants. WorldPerks
members accumulate mileage in their accounts and later redeem mileage for free or upgraded travel on NWA and alliance participants. WorldPerks members that achieve certain mileage thresholds also receive enhanced service benefits from NWA such
as special service lines, advance flight boarding and upgrades.

Cargo

Delta Cargo is the largest cargo carrier among the U.S. passenger airlines, based on revenue. Through the strength of our global network, we are able to connect all of the world’s major freight gateways. We
generate cargo revenues in domestic and international markets primarily through the use of cargo space on regularly scheduled passenger aircraft. Additionally, we have a limited, focused network of freighters that tie together the key freight
markets in Asia and connect to three gateways in the U.S.

Delta Cargo is a member of SkyTeam Cargo, the world’s largest global
airline cargo alliance. The alliance, whose other members are Aeromexico Cargo, Air France Cargo, Alitalia Cargo, CSA Czech Airlines Cargo, KLM Cargo and Korean Air Cargo, offers a global network with over 16,000 daily flights spanning 6 continents.
This alliance offers cargo customers a consistent international product line, and the partners work to jointly improve their efficiency and effectiveness in the marketplace.

MRO

Our maintenance, repair and overhaul (“MRO”) operations known
as Delta TechOps is the largest airline MRO in North America with state-of-the-art facilities worldwide. In addition to providing maintenance and engineering support for the combined Delta and NWA fleets of nearly 800 aircraft, Delta TechOps
serves more than 125 aviation and airline customers from around the world. Delta TechOps employs approximately 8,500 maintenance professionals and is one of the most experienced MRO providers in the world.

Among the key services we offer are:

•

Airframe Maintenance—aircraft overhaul for both widebody and narrowbody craft;

•

Component Maintenance—repair, overhaul, and test facilities for electromechanical components and avionics;

•

Fuel

Our results of
operations are significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel. The following table shows our aircraft fuel consumption and costs for 2006 through 2008.

Total operating expense for 2008 reflects a $7.3 billion non-cash charge from an impairment of goodwill and
other intangible assets and $1.1 billion in primarily non-cash merger-related charges. Including these charges, fuel costs accounted for 28% of total operating expense.

Our aircraft fuel purchase contracts do not provide material protection against price increases or assure the availability of our fuel supplies. We
purchase most of our aircraft fuel under contracts that establish the price based on various market indices. We also purchase aircraft fuel on the spot market, from off-shore sources and under contracts that permit the refiners to set the price.

We use derivative instruments, which are comprised of crude oil, heating oil and jet fuel swap, collar and call option contracts, in an
effort to manage our exposure to changes in aircraft fuel prices.



Index to Financial Statements

We are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel, but it is impossible to predict the
future availability or price of aircraft fuel. Weather-related events, natural disasters, political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries, changes in government policy concerning aircraft fuel production, transportation or marketing,
changes in aircraft fuel production capacity, environmental concerns, and other unpredictable events may result in fuel supply shortages and fuel price increases in the future.

Competition

We face significant competition with respect to routes,
services and fares. Our domestic routes are subject to competition from both new and existing carriers, some of which have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us. In particular, we face significant
competition at our hub airports in Atlanta, Cincinnati, Detroit, Memphis, Minneapolis/St. Paul, New York-JFK, Salt Lake City, Amsterdam and Tokyo-Narita either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close
proximity to our hubs. We also face competition in smaller to medium-sized markets from regional jet operators. Our ability to compete effectively depends, in significant part, on our ability to maintain a cost structure that is competitive with
other carriers.

In addition, we compete with foreign carriers, both on interior U.S. routes and in international markets. International
marketing alliances formed by domestic and foreign carriers, including the Star Alliance (among United Airlines, Lufthansa German Airlines and others and which Continental has announced its intention to join in October 2009) and the oneworld
Alliance (among American Airlines, British Airways and others) have significantly increased competition in international markets. The adoption of liberalized Open Skies Aviation Agreements with an increasing number of countries around the world,
including in particular the Open Skies Treaty with the Member States of the European Union, has accelerated this trend. Through marketing and codesharing arrangements with U.S. carriers, foreign carriers have obtained access to interior U.S.
passenger traffic. Similarly, U.S. carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation, such as transatlantic services to and beyond European cities, through alliances with international carriers.

Regulatory Matters

The DOT
and the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) exercise regulatory authority over air transportation in the U.S. The DOT has authority to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity required for airlines to provide domestic air
transportation. An air carrier that the DOT finds fit to operate is given unrestricted authority to operate domestic air transportation (including the carriage of passengers and cargo). Except for constraints imposed by regulations regarding
“Essential Air Services,” which are applicable to certain small communities, airlines may terminate service to a city without restriction.

The DOT has jurisdiction over certain economic and consumer protection matters, such as unfair or deceptive practices and methods of competition, advertising, denied boarding compensation, baggage liability and
disabled passenger transportation. The DOT also has authority to review certain joint venture agreements between major carriers. The FAA has primary responsibility for matters relating to air carrier flight operations, including airline operating
certificates, control of navigable air space, flight personnel, aircraft certification and maintenance and other matters affecting air safety.

Authority to operate international routes and international codesharing arrangements is regulated by the DOT and by the governments of the foreign countries involved. International route awards are also subject to the approval of the
President of the U.S. for conformance with national defense and foreign policy objectives.

The Transportation Security Administration and
the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, each a division of the Department of Homeland Security, are responsible for certain civil aviation security matters, including passenger and baggage screening at U.S. airports and international passenger
prescreening prior to entry into or departure from the U.S.



Index to Financial Statements

Airlines are also subject to various other federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. For
example, the U.S. Department of Justice has jurisdiction over airline competition matters. The U.S. Postal Service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail. Labor relations in the airline industry, as discussed below, are
generally governed by the Railway Labor Act. Environmental matters are regulated by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental entities. Privacy of passenger and employee data is regulated by domestic and foreign laws and regulations.

Fares and Rates

Airlines set ticket prices in most domestic and international city pairs without governmental regulation, and the industry is characterized by significant price competition. Certain international fares and rates are subject to the
jurisdiction of the DOT and the governments of the foreign countries involved. Many of our tickets are sold by travel agents, and fares are subject to commissions, overrides and discounts paid to travel agents, brokers and wholesalers.

Route Authority

Our flight
operations are authorized by certificates of public convenience and necessity and also by exemptions issued by the DOT. The requisite approvals of other governments for international operations are controlled by bilateral agreements with, or permits
or approvals issued by, foreign countries. Because international air transportation is governed by bilateral or other agreements between the U.S. and the foreign country or countries involved, changes in U.S. or foreign government aviation policies
could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements, diminish the value of our international route authorities or otherwise affect our international operations. Bilateral agreements between the U.S. and various foreign countries served
by us are subject to renegotiation from time to time.

Certain of our international route authorities are subject to periodic renewal
requirements. We request extension of these authorities when and as appropriate. While the DOT usually renews temporary authorities on routes where the authorized carrier is providing a reasonable level of service, there is no assurance this
practice will continue in general or with respect to a specific renewal. Dormant route authority may not be renewed in some cases, especially where another U.S. carrier indicates a willingness to provide service.

Airport Access

Operations at
four major domestic airports and certain foreign airports served by us are regulated by governmental entities through allocations of “slots” or similar regulatory mechanisms which limit the rights of carriers to conduct operations at those
airports. Each slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period.

In the
U.S., the FAA currently regulates the allocation of slots, slot exemptions, operating authorizations, or similar capacity allocation mechanisms at Reagan in Washington, D.C., LaGuardia and JFK in New York, and Newark. Our operations at these
airports generally require the allocation of slots or analogous regulatory authorities. Similarly, our operations at Tokyo’s Narita Airport, London’s Gatwick and Heathrow airports and other international airports are regulated by local
slot coordinators pursuant to the International Air Transport Association’s Worldwide Scheduling Guidelines and applicable local law. We currently have sufficient slots or analogous authorizations to operate our existing flights, and we have
generally been able to obtain the rights to expand our operations and to change our schedules. There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to do so in the future because, among other reasons, such allocations are subject to changes in
governmental policies.

Environmental Matters

The Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 recognizes the rights of operators of airports with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as such programs do not interfere unreasonably with
interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system. This statute generally provides that



Index to Financial Statements

local noise restrictions on Stage 3 aircraft first effective after October 1, 1990, require FAA approval. While we have had sufficient scheduling
flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions in the past, our operations could be adversely impacted if locally-imposed regulations become more restrictive or widespread.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) is authorized to regulate aircraft emissions and has historically implemented emissions
control standards previously adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization (“ICAO”). Our aircraft comply with the existing EPA standards as applicable by engine design date. ICAO has adopted additional aircraft engine emissions
standards applicable to engines certified after December 31, 2007, but the EPA has not yet proposed a rule that incorporates these new ICAO standards.

Concern about climate change and greenhouse gases may result in additional regulation of aircraft emissions in the U.S. and abroad. We may become subject to taxes, charges or additional requirements to obtain permits
for greenhouse gas emissions. In July 2008, the European Union approved legislation to include aviation in their emissions trading system (“ETS”). Beginning in 2012, any airline with flights originating or landing in the European Union
will be subject to the ETS and will be required to buy a permit for its greenhouse gas emissions. We expect that such a system will impose significant costs on our operations in the European Union. Similar cap and trade restrictions are being
proposed in the United States. In the event that U.S. legislation or regulation is enacted or in the event similar legislation or regulation is enacted in other jurisdictions where we operate or where we may operate in the future, it could result in
significant costs for us and the airline industry. At this time, we cannot predict whether any such legislation or regulation would apportion costs between one or more jurisdictions in which we operate flights, which could result in multiple
taxation or permitting requirements from multiple jurisdictions. Certain credits may be available to reduce the costs of permits in order to mitigate the impact of such regulations on consumers. At this time, we cannot predict whether we or the
aviation industry in general will have access to offsets or credits. We are carefully monitoring and evaluating the potential impact of such legislative and regulatory developments.

We have been identified by the EPA as a potentially responsible party (a “PRP”) with respect to certain Superfund Sites, and have entered into
consent decrees regarding some of these sites. Our alleged disposal volume at each of these sites is small when compared to the total contributions of all PRPs at each site and liability at many of these sites has been resolved through our Chapter
11 proceedings. We are aware of soil and/or ground water contamination present on our current or former leaseholds at several domestic airports. To address this contamination, we have a program in place to investigate and, if appropriate, remediate
these sites. Although the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.

We are also subject to various other federal, state and local laws governing environmental matters, including the management and disposal of chemicals,
waste and hazardous materials, protection of surface and subsurface waters, and regulation of air emissions and drinking water.

Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program

We participate in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet program (the “CRAF
Program”), which permits the U.S. military to use the aircraft and crew resources of participating U.S. airlines during airlift emergencies, national emergencies or times of war. We have agreed to make available under the CRAF Program a portion
of our international range aircraft from October 1, 2008 until September 30, 2009. As of October 1, 2008, the following numbers of our international range aircraft are available for CRAF activation:



Index to Financial Statements

The CRAF Program has only been activated twice, both times at the Stage I level, since it was created in
1951.

Regulatory and Legislative Proposals

Concerns about airport congestion issues have caused the DOT and FAA to consider various proposals for access to certain airports, including “congestion-based” landing fees and programs that would withdraw
slots from existing carriers and reallocate those slots (either by lottery to carriers with little or no current presence at such airports or by auction to the highest bidder). These proposals, if enacted, could negatively impact our existing
services and our ability to respond to competitive actions by other airlines.

Employee Matters

Railway Labor Act

Our
relations with labor unions in the U.S. are governed by the Railway Labor Act. Under the Railway Labor Act, a labor union seeking to represent an unrepresented craft or class of employees is required to file with the National Mediation Board (the
“NMB”) an application alleging a representation dispute, along with authorization cards signed by at least 35% of the employees in that craft or class. The NMB then investigates the dispute and, if it finds the labor union has obtained a
sufficient number of authorization cards, conducts an election to determine whether to certify the labor union as the collective bargaining representative of that craft or class. Under the NMB’s usual rules, a labor union will be certified as
the representative of the employees in a craft or class only if more than 50% of those employees vote for union representation. A certified labor union then enters into negotiations toward a collective bargaining agreement with the employer.

Under the Railway Labor Act, a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire, but instead becomes
amendable as of a stated date. Either party may request that the NMB appoint a federal mediator to participate in the negotiations for a new or amended agreement. If no agreement is reached in mediation, the NMB may determine, at any time, that an
impasse exists and offer binding arbitration. If either party rejects binding arbitration, a 30-day “cooling off” period begins. At the end of this 30-day period, the parties may engage in “self help,” unless the President of the
U.S. appoints a Presidential Emergency Board (“PEB”) to investigate and report on the dispute. The appointment of a PEB maintains the “status quo” for an additional 60 days. If the parties do not reach agreement during this
period, the parties may then engage in “self help.” “Self help” includes, among other things, a strike by the union or the imposition of proposed changes to the collective bargaining agreement by the airline. Congress and the
President have the authority to prevent “self help” by enacting legislation that, among other things, imposes a settlement on the parties.

Collective Bargaining

As of December 31, 2008, we had a total of 84,306 full-time equivalent employees. Approximately 42% of these employees were represented by unions,
including the following domestic employee groups.

(1)

On February 26, 2009, the NMB accepted a request by AMFA to terminate its certification to represent pre-merger NWA
aircraft maintenance technicians and related employees.

Labor unions periodically engage in organizing efforts to
represent various groups of our employees, including at our airline subsidiaries, that are not represented for collective bargaining purposes.

The successful integration of NWA into Delta and achievement of the anticipated benefits of the merger depend significantly on integrating Delta’s and NWA’s employee groups and on maintaining productive employee relations. The
integration of Delta and NWA workforces will be challenging in part because approximately 80% of the pre-merger Northwest employees are represented by labor unions while, among U.S. based pre-merger Delta employees, only the Delta pilots and flight
dispatchers (who combined constitute approximately 17% of the total pre-merger Delta employees) are represented by labor unions. Completing the integration of the workforces of the two airlines will require the resolution of potentially difficult
issues relating to representation of various work groups and the relative seniority of the work groups at each carrier. Unexpected delay, expense or other challenges to integrating the workforces could impact the expected synergies from the
combination of Delta and NWA and affect our financial performance.

Under procedures that have been utilized by the NMB, each labor union
that currently represents U.S.-based employees at Delta or NWA, as well as other groups of employees with a sufficient showing of interest, will have an opportunity to invoke the NMB’s jurisdiction to address representation issues arising from
the merger. Once its jurisdiction is invoked, the NMB’s rules call for it to first determine whether Delta and NWA have combined or will combine to form a single carrier. On January 7, 2009, the NMB ruled that Delta and NWA now constitute
a single transportation system for representation purposes under the Railway Labor Act.



Index to Financial Statements

The NMB has utilized certain procedures to address and resolve representation issues arising from airline
mergers which generally have included the following:

•

Where employees in the same craft or class at the two carriers are represented by the same union, that union will be certified to represent the combined group,
without an election.

•

Where employees in the same craft or class at the two carriers have different representation status—either they are represented by different unions or one
group is represented by a union and the other is not—the NMB’s rules provide for a representation election among the combined employee groups if the groups are “comparable” in size. In general, the NMB has considered two
groups to be comparable in size if the smaller group is at least 35% of the combined group. If the representation election results in the combined group not being represented by a union, the collective bargaining agreement covering the group that
had previously been unionized will terminate.

•

If the two groups are not comparable in size, the smaller group will be folded into and have the same representation status as the larger group. Even where the two
groups are not comparable in size, the smaller group can still obtain an election if, within 14 days after the NMB’s single carrier determination with respect to that group, the smaller group submits a showing of interest from at least 35% of
the combined group. The showing of interest can consist of authorization cards as well as the seniority list of the smaller group, if the smaller group had been represented by a union.

In view of these procedures, we believe that a representation election may occur in one or more combined employee groups. Under the NMB’s rules, a
labor union generally will be certified as the representative of the employees in a craft or class only if more than 50% of those employees vote for union representation. If a labor union is certified to represent a combined group, the terms and
conditions of employment of the combined work group ultimately will be subject to negotiations toward a joint collective bargaining agreement. Completing joint collective bargaining agreements covering combined work groups that choose to be
represented by a labor union could take significant time, which could delay or impede our ability to achieve targeted synergies from the merger.

With respect to integration of seniority lists, where the two employee groups in a craft or class have different representation status, federal law requires that seniority integration be governed by the procedures first issued by the Civil
Aeronautics Board in the Allegheny-Mohawk merger – known as the Allegheny-Mohawk Labor Protective Provisions. In general, Allegheny-Mohawk Labor Protective Provisions require that seniority be integrated in a “fair and equitable”
manner and that any disputes not resolved by negotiations may be submitted to binding arbitration by a neutral arbitrator. This requirement is consistent with the seniority protection policy that has been adopted by the Delta board of directors.
Where both groups are represented by the same union prior to the merger, seniority integration is governed by the union’s bylaws and policies. The integration of the seniority lists of the pilots of Delta and NWA as well as flight dispatchers,
meteorologists, and technicians and related Technical Operations employees have been resolved.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

Risk Factors Relating to
Delta

Our business and results of operations are dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. High fuel costs or
cost increases could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results. Likewise, significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel would materially adversely affect our operations and operating results.

Our operating results are significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Fuel prices have increased substantially in
the last five years and spiked at record high levels in 2008 before falling dramatically during the latter part of the year. In 2008, our average fuel price per gallon rose 41% to $3.16, as compared to an average price of $2.24 in 2007, which was 6%
higher than our average price of $2.12 in 2006 and significantly higher than fuel prices in the earlier part of this decade. The fuel costs represented 38%, 31% and 30% of our operating expense in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Total operating
expense for 2008 reflects a $7.3 billion non-cash charge from an impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets and $1.1 billion in primarily non-cash merger-related charges. Including these charges, fuel costs accounted for 28% of total
operating expense. These increasing costs have had a significant negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Our
ability to pass along the increased costs of fuel to our customers is limited by the competitive nature of the airline industry. We often have not been able to increase our fares to offset the effect of increased fuel costs in the past and we may
not be able to do so in the future.

In addition, our aircraft fuel purchase contracts do not provide material protection against price
increases or assure the availability of our fuel supplies. We purchase most of our aircraft fuel under contracts that establish the price based on various market indices. We also purchase aircraft fuel on the spot market, from offshore sources and
under contracts that permit the refiners to set the price. In an effort to manage our exposure to changes in fuel prices, we use derivative instruments, which are comprised of crude oil, heating oil and jet fuel swap, collar and call option
contracts, though we may not be able to successfully manage this exposure. Depending on the type of hedging instrument used, our ability to benefit from declines in fuel prices may be limited.

We are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel, but it is impossible to predict the future availability or price of aircraft fuel.
Weather-related events, natural disasters, political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries, changes in governmental policy concerning aircraft fuel production, transportation or marketing, changes in aircraft fuel production
capacity, environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in additional fuel supply shortages and fuel price increases in the future. Additional increases in fuel costs or disruptions in fuel supplies could have additional negative
effects on us.

The global economic recession has resulted in weaker demand for air travel and may create challenges for us that
could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

As the effects of the global economic recession
have been felt in our domestic and international markets, we are experiencing weaker demand for air travel. Our demand began to slow during the December 2008 quarter and we believe worsening global economic conditions in 2009 will substantially
reduce U.S. airline industry revenues in 2009 compared to 2008. As a result, we have announced plans to further reduce our consolidated capacity by 6-8% in 2009 compared to 2008 (which reflects planned domestic capacity reductions of 8-10% and
international capacity reductions of 3-5%), and have offered voluntary workforce reduction programs for eligible employees. Demand for air travel could continue to fall if the global economic recession continues, and overall demand may fall much
lower than we are able prudently to reduce capacity. The weakness in the United States and international economies could have a significant negative impact on our future results of operations.

The global financial crisis may have an impact on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict.

The continued credit crisis and related turmoil in the global financial system has had and may continue to have an impact on our
business and our financial condition. For example, our ability to access the capital markets



Index to Financial Statements

may be severely restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to do so, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and
business conditions. In addition, the credit crisis could have an impact on our remaining fuel hedging contracts or our interest hedging contracts if counterparties are forced to file for bankruptcy or are otherwise unable to perform their
obligations.

The financial crisis and economic downturn have also resulted in broadly lower investment asset returns and values, including
in the defined benefit pension plans that we sponsor for eligible employees and retirees. Our funding obligations for these plans, which have been frozen for future benefit accruals, are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
(“ERISA”). Estimates of pension plan funding requirements can vary materially from actual funding requirements because the estimates are based on various assumptions concerning factors outside our control, including, among other things,
the market performance of assets; statutory requirements; and demographic data for participants, including the number of participants and the rate of participant attrition. Due primarily to the recent decline in the investment markets, we currently
expect our contributions to these plans to significantly increase for 2010 and thereafter, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

The financial crisis also resulted in us being unable to access $139 million invested with the Reserve Primary Fund as of February 28, 2009. The Reserve Primary Fund is a money market fund that has suspended
redemptions and is being liquidated. We had invested approximately $1.1 billion in this fund, have received distributions of $925 million and have recorded a $13 million loss to the cost basis of our pro rata share of the estimated loss in the fund.
While we expect to receive substantially all of our current holdings in this fund, we cannot predict when this will occur or the amount we will receive.

Our obligation to post collateral in connection with our fuel hedge contracts may have a substantial impact on our short-term liquidity.

Under fuel hedge contracts that we may enter into from time to time, counterparties to those contracts may require us to fund the margin associated with
any loss position on the contracts. At December 31, 2008, our counterparties required us to fund $1.2 billion of fuel hedge margin. If fuel prices continue to fall, we may be required to post a significant amount of additional collateral, which
could have an impact on the level of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments until those contracts are settled.

Our substantial indebtedness may limit our financial and operating activities and may adversely affect our ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs.

We have substantial indebtedness, which could:

•

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds
available for other purposes;

•

make us more vulnerable to economic downturns, adverse industry conditions or catastrophic external events;

•

limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures;

•

reduce our flexibility in planning for or responding to changing business and economic conditions; and/or

•

place us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors that have relatively less debt than we have.

In addition, a substantial level of indebtedness, particularly because substantially all of our assets are currently subject to liens, could limit our
ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. We have historically had substantial liquidity needs in the operation of our business. These liquidity
needs could vary significantly and may be affected by general economic conditions, industry trends, performance and many other factors not within our control.



Index to Financial Statements

Certain of our credit facilities include financial and other covenants that impose restrictions on
our financial and business operations.

The exit facility financing credit agreements of Delta and NWA and the liquidity facility
credit agreement of NWA each contain financial covenants that require Delta or NWA, respectively, to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, minimum unrestricted cash reserves and minimum collateral coverage ratios. In addition, each of the
credit facilities contains other negative covenants customary for such financings. These covenants may have a material adverse impact on our operations. In addition, if we fail to comply with the covenants in any credit facility and are unable to
obtain a waiver or amendment, an event of default would result under that facility.

Each of the credit facilities also contains other
events of default customary for such financings. If an event of default were to occur, the lenders could, among other things, declare outstanding borrowings under the respective credit facilities immediately due and payable, and our cash may become
restricted. We cannot provide assurance that we would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance borrowings under any of the credit facilities if such borrowings were accelerated upon an event of default. In addition, an event of default or
declaration of acceleration under any of the credit facilities could also result in an event of default under other financing agreements of Delta and NWA.

Employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions may adversely affect our operations.

Our
business is labor intensive, utilizing large numbers of pilots, flight attendants and other personnel. Approximately 42% of our workforce is unionized. Strikes or labor disputes with our unionized employees may adversely affect our ability to
conduct business. Relations between air carriers and labor unions in the U.S. are governed by the Railway Labor Act, which provides that a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire, but instead becomes
amendable as of a stated date. The Railway Labor Act generally prohibits strikes or other types of self-help actions both before and after a collective bargaining agreement becomes amendable, unless and until the collective bargaining processes
required by the Railway Labor Act have been exhausted.

In addition, if we or our affiliates are unable to reach agreement with any of our
unionized work groups on future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements or if additional segments of our workforce become unionized, we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages, subject to the requirements
of the Railway Labor Act. Likewise, if third party regional carriers with whom we have contract carrier agreements are unable to reach agreement with their unionized work groups on current or future negotiations regarding the terms of their
collective bargaining agreements, those carriers may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages, subject to the requirements of the Railway Labor Act, which could have a negative impact on our operations.

The ability to realize fully the anticipated benefits of our merger with Northwest may depend on the successful integration of the businesses of
Delta and Northwest.

Our merger with Northwest involves the combination of two companies which operated as independent public
companies prior to the merger. The combined company will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating its business practices and operations. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss
of key employees, diversion of each company’s management’s attention, the disruption or interruption of, or the loss of momentum in our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, any of which
could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger, or could reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely effect our business and financial
results.

The integration of the Delta and NWA workforces will present significant challenges, including the possibility of
labor-related disagreements that may adversely affect our operations.

The successful integration of Delta and Northwest and
achievement of the anticipated benefits of the combination depend significantly on integrating Delta’s and NWA’s employee groups and on maintaining productive employee relations. The integration of Delta and NWA workforces will be
challenging in part because



Index to Financial Statements

approximately 80% of the NWA employees are represented by labor unions while, among U.S. based employees, only the pre-merger Delta pilots and flight
dispatchers (who combined constitute approximately 17% of the total pre-merger Delta employees) are currently represented by labor unions. The integration of the workforces of the two airlines will require the resolution of potentially difficult
issues relating to representation of various work groups and the relative seniority of the work groups at each carrier. Unexpected delay, expense or other challenges to integrating the workforces could impact the expected synergies from the
combination of Delta and Northwest and affect the financial performance of the combined company.

Interruptions or disruptions in
service at one of our hub airports could have a material adverse impact on our operations.

Our business is heavily dependent on our
operations at the Atlanta Airport and at our other hub airports in Cincinnati, Detroit, Memphis, Minneapolis/St. Paul, New York-JFK, Salt Lake City, Amsterdam and Tokyo-Narita. Each of these hub operations includes flights that gather and distribute
traffic from markets in the geographic region surrounding the hub to other major cities and to other Delta hubs. A significant interruption or disruption in service at the Atlanta airport or at one of our other hubs could have a serious impact on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We are increasingly dependent on technology in our operations, and if
our technology fails or we are unable to continue to invest in new technology, our business may be adversely affected.

We have
become increasingly dependent on technology initiatives to reduce costs and to enhance customer service in order to compete in the current business environment. For example, we have made significant investments in delta.com, check-in kiosks and
related initiatives. The performance and reliability of the technology are critical to our ability to attract and retain customers and our ability to compete effectively. These initiatives will continue to require significant capital investments in
our technology infrastructure to deliver these expected benefits. If we are unable to make these investments, our business and operations could be negatively affected. In addition, we may face challenges associated with integrating complex systems
and technologies that support the separate operations of Delta and NWA. If we are unable to manage these challenges effectively, our business and results of operation could be negatively affected.

In addition, any internal technology error or failure or large scale external interruption in technology infrastructure we depend on, such as power,
telecommunications or the internet, may disrupt our technology network. Any individual, sustained or repeated failure of technology could impact our customer service and result in increased costs. Like all companies, our technology systems and
related data may be vulnerable to a variety of sources of interruption due to events beyond our control, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers and other security issues. While we have
in place, and continue to invest in, technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans, these measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to prevent a business disruption and its adverse financial consequences to our business.

If we experience losses of senior management personnel and other key employees, our operating results could be adversely affected.

We are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees to execute our business plans. If
we experience a substantial turnover in our leadership and other key employees, our performance could be materially adversely impacted. Furthermore, we may be unable to attract and retain additional qualified executives as needed in the future.

Our credit card processors have the ability to take significant holdbacks in certain circumstances. The initiation of such holdbacks
likely would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.

We sell a substantial number of tickets that are paid for by
customers who use credit cards. Our credit card processing agreements provide that no future holdback of receivables or reserve is required except in certain



Index to Financial Statements

circumstances, including in which we do not maintain a required level of unrestricted cash. If circumstances were to occur that would allow either processor
to initiate a holdback, the negative impact on our liquidity likely would be significant.

We are at risk of losses and adverse
publicity stemming from any accident involving our aircraft.

An aircraft crash or other accident could expose us to significant
tort liability. The insurance we carry to cover damages arising from any future accidents may be inadequate. In the event that the insurance is not adequate, we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident. In addition, any accident
involving an aircraft that we operate or an aircraft that is operated by an airline that is one of our codeshare partners could create a public perception that our aircraft are not safe or reliable, which could harm our reputation, result in air
travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft and harm our business.

Our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to
offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes is subject to limitation and may be further limited as a result of the merger with Northwest and the employee equity issuance, together with other equity transactions.

In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), a corporation that
undergoes an “ownership change” is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses (“NOLs”), to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock
ownership of certain stockholders increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders’ lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years).

As of December 31, 2008, Delta reported approximately $9.2 billion of federal and state NOL carryforwards. As of December 31, 2008,
Northwest reported approximately $5.3 billion of federal and state NOL carryforwards. Both Delta and Northwest experienced an ownership change in 2007 as a result of their respective plans of reorganization under Chapter 11 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Delta and Northwest elected out of Section 382(l)(5) of the Code, in which case Section 382(l)(6) of the Code will be applicable to the ownership changes that occurred pursuant
to our respective plans of reorganization. As a result of the merger, Northwest experienced a subsequent ownership change. Delta also may experience a subsequent ownership change as a result of the merger and the issuance of equity to employees in
connection with the merger, together with other transactions involving the sale of our common stock within the testing period. Even if the merger and the employee equity issuance did not result in an ownership change, the merger and the employee
equity issuance has significantly increased the likelihood there will be a subsequent ownership change for Delta as a result of transactions involving sale of our common stock.

The Northwest ownership change resulting from the merger and the potential occurrence of a second ownership change for Delta could limit the ability to
utilize pre-change NOLs that are not currently subject to limitation, and could further limit the ability to utilize NOLs that are currently subject to limitation. The amount of the annual limitation generally is equal to the value of the stock of
the corporation immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the adjusted federal tax-exempt rate, set by the Internal Revenue Service. Limitations imposed on the ability to use NOLs to offset future taxable income could cause
U.S. federal income taxes to be paid earlier than otherwise would be paid if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such NOLs to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such NOLs. Similar rules and
limitations may apply for state income tax purposes.

Transfer restrictions on our stock issued in connection with our Plan of
Reorganization may limit the liquidity of our stock.

To reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect on our ability to utilize our
net operating loss carryovers, our certificate of incorporation contains certain restrictions on the transfer of our stock. These transfer restrictions will be effective until May 1, 2009, subject to extension for an additional three years.
These transfer restrictions may adversely affect the ability of certain holders of our stock to dispose of or acquire shares of our stock during the period the restrictions are in place. Furthermore, while the purpose of these transfer restrictions
is to prevent an “ownership change” from occurring within the meaning of section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, no assurance can be given that such an ownership change will not occur.

Risk Factors Relating to the Airline Industry

The airline industry is highly competitive and, if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace, our business, financial condition and
operating results will be materially adversely affected.

We face significant competition with respect to routes, services and
fares. Our domestic routes are subject to competition from both new and established carriers, some of which have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us. In particular, we face significant competition at
our hub airports in Atlanta, Cincinnati, Detroit, Memphis, Minneapolis/St. Paul, New York-JFK, Salt Lake City, Amsterdam and Tokyo-Narita either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our
hubs. We also face competition in smaller to medium-sized markets from regional jet operators.

Low-cost carriers, including Southwest,
AirTran and JetBlue, in the U.S. have placed significant competitive pressure on us and other network carriers in the domestic market. In addition, other network carriers have also significantly reduced their costs over the last several years. Our
ability to compete effectively depends, in part, on our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure. If we cannot maintain our costs at a competitive level, then our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially
adversely affected. In light of increased jet fuel costs and other issues in recent years, we expect consolidation to occur in the airline industry. As a result of consolidation, we may face significant competition from larger carriers that may be
able to generate higher amounts of revenue and compete more efficiently.

In addition, we compete with foreign carriers, both on interior
U.S. routes, due to marketing and codesharing arrangements, and in international markets. International marketing alliances formed by domestic and foreign carriers, including the Star Alliance (among United Airlines, Lufthansa German Airlines and
others and which Continental has announced its intention to join in October 2009) and the oneworld Alliance (among American Airlines, British Airways and others) have significantly increased competition in international markets. The adoption of
liberalized Open Skies Aviation Agreements with an increasing number of countries around the world, including in particular the Open Skies agreement with the Member States of the European Union, has accelerated this trend. Through marketing and
codesharing arrangements with U.S. carriers, foreign carriers have obtained access to interior U.S. passenger traffic. Similarly, U.S. carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation, such as transatlantic services to and
beyond European cities, through alliances with international carriers.

Terrorist attacks or international hostilities may adversely
affect our business, financial condition and operating results.

The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 caused fundamental
and permanent changes in the airline industry, including substantial revenue declines and cost increases, which resulted in industry-wide liquidity issues. Additional terrorist attacks or fear of such attacks, even if not made directly on the
airline industry, would negatively affect us and the airline industry. The potential negative effects include increased security, insurance and other costs and lost revenue from increased ticket refunds and decreased ticket sales. Our financial
resources might not be sufficient to absorb the adverse effects of any further terrorist attacks or other international hostilities involving the U.S.

The airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation, and new regulations may increase our operating costs.

Airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that result in significant costs. For instance, the FAA from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the
maintenance and operation of aircraft that necessitate significant expenditures. We expect to continue incurring expenses to comply with the FAA’s regulations.

Other laws, regulations, taxes and airport rates and charges have also been imposed from time to time that significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce revenues. For example, the Aviation and



Index to Financial Statements

Transportation Security Act, which became law in November 2001, mandates the federalization of certain airport security procedures and imposes additional
security requirements on airports and airlines, most of which are funded by a per ticket tax on passengers and a tax on airlines. The federal government has on several occasions proposed a significant increase in the per ticket tax. The proposed
ticket tax increase, if implemented, could negatively impact our revenues.

Proposals to address congestion issues at certain airports or
in certain airspace, particularly in the Northeast U.S., have included concepts such as “congestion-based” landing fees, “slot auctions” or other alternatives that could impose a significant cost on the airlines operating in
those airports or airspace and impact the ability of those airlines to respond to competitive actions by other airlines. Furthermore, events related to extreme weather delays in late 2006 and early 2007 have caused Congress and the DOT to consider
proposals related to airlines’ handling of lengthy flight delays during extreme weather conditions. The enactment of such proposals could have a significant negative impact on our operations. In addition, some states have also enacted or
considered enacting such regulations.

Future regulatory action concerning climate change and aircraft emissions could have a significant
effect on the airline industry. For example, the European Commission is seeking to impose an emissions trading scheme applicable to all flights operating in the European Union, including flights to and from the U.S. Laws or regulations such as this
emissions trading scheme or other U.S. or foreign governmental actions may adversely affect our operations and financial results.

We and
other U.S. carriers are subject to domestic and foreign laws regarding privacy of passenger and employee data that are not consistent in all countries in which we operate. In addition to the heightened level of concern regarding privacy of passenger
data in the U.S., certain European government agencies are initiating inquiries into airline privacy practices. Compliance with these regulatory regimes is expected to result in additional operating costs and could impact our operations and any
future expansion.

Our insurance costs have increased substantially as a result of the September 11 terrorist attacks, and
further increases in insurance costs or reductions in coverage could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results.

As a result of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, aviation insurers significantly reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for liability to persons (other than employees or
passengers) for claims resulting from acts of terrorism, war or similar events. At the same time, aviation insurers significantly increased the premiums for such coverage and for aviation insurance in general. Since September 24, 2001, the U.S.
government has been providing U.S. airlines with war-risk insurance to cover losses, including those resulting from terrorism, to passengers, third parties (ground damage) and the aircraft hull. The coverage currently extends through March 31,
2009 and the Secretary of Transportation has discretion to extend coverage through May 31, 2009. The withdrawal of government support of airline war-risk insurance would require us to obtain war-risk insurance coverage commercially, if
available. Such commercial insurance could have substantially less desirable coverage than that currently provided by the U.S. government, may not be adequate to protect our risk of loss from future acts of terrorism, may result in a material
increase to our operating expenses or may not be obtainable at all, resulting in an interruption to our operations.

PROPERTIES

Flight Equipment

Our active aircraft fleet at December 31, 2008 is summarized in the following table:

The above table:

•

includes three B-767-300, four DC-9, two B-767-300ER, two MD-88 and one B-757-200 aircraft which are temporarily grounded; and

•

excludes aircraft flown by our third party contract carriers. For additional information, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



Index to Financial Statements

Our purchase commitments (firm orders) for aircraft, as well as options to purchase additional aircraft,
as of December 31, 2008 are shown in the following tables:

(1)

Includes 31 aircraft, which we have entered into definitive agreements to sell to third parties immediately following
delivery of these aircraft to us by the manufacturer.

(2)

Includes 2 aircraft orders we assigned to a regional air carrier.

(3)

We have excluded from the table above our order of 18 B-787-8 aircraft. The Boeing Company (“Boeing”) has
informed us that Boeing will be unable to meet the contractual delivery schedule for these aircraft. We are in discussions with Boeing regarding this situation.

(1)

Aircraft options have scheduled delivery slots, while rolling options replace options and are assigned delivery slots as
options expire or are exercised.

Ground Facilities

We lease most of the land and buildings that we occupy. Delta’s largest aircraft maintenance base, various computer, cargo, flight kitchen and
training facilities and most of its principal offices are located at or near the Atlanta Airport, on land leased from the City of Atlanta generally under long-term leases. Delta owns a portion of its principal offices, its Atlanta reservations
center and other real property in Atlanta. NWA owns its primary offices, which are located near the Minneapolis/St. Paul International Airport, including its corporate offices located on a 160-acre site east of the airport. Other NWA owned
facilities include reservations centers in Baltimore, Maryland, Tampa, Florida, Minot, North Dakota and Chisholm, Minnesota, and a data processing center in Eagan, Minnesota. NWA also owns property in Tokyo, including a 1.3-acre site in
downtown Tokyo and a 33-acre land parcel, 512-room hotel and flight kitchen located near Tokyo’s Narita International Airport.

We
lease ticket counter and other terminal space, operating areas and air cargo facilities in most of the airports that we serve. At most airports, we have entered into use agreements which provide for the non-exclusive use of runways, taxiways, and
other improvements and facilities; landing fees under these agreements normally are based on the number of landings and weight of aircraft. These leases and use agreements generally run for



Index to Financial Statements

periods of less than one year to 30 years or more, and often contain provisions for periodic adjustments of lease rates, landing fees and other charges
applicable under that type of agreement. Examples of major leases and use agreements at hub or other significant airports that will expire in the next several years include, among others: (1) our Atlanta Airport central passenger terminal lease
and the airport use agreement, which expire in 2010; (2) our Salt Lake City International Airport use and lease agreement, which expires in 2010; and (3) NWA’s Memphis International Airport use and lease agreement, which expires in
2009. We also lease aircraft maintenance facilities and air cargo facilities at certain airports, including, among others: (1) our main Atlanta maintenance base; (2) our Atlanta air cargo facilities and our hangar and air cargo facilities
at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport and Salt Lake City International Airport; and (3) NWA hangar and air cargo facilities at the Detroit Metropolitan International Airport, Minneapolis/St. Paul International Airport and
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Our aircraft maintenance facility leases generally require us to pay the cost of providing, operating and maintaining such facilities, including, in some cases, amounts necessary to pay debt service on special
facility bonds issued to finance their construction. We also lease marketing, ticketing and reservations offices in certain locations for varying terms.

In recent years, some airports have increased or sought to increase the rates charged to airlines to levels that we believe are unreasonable. The extent to which such charges are limited by statute or regulation and
the ability of airlines to contest such charges has been subject to litigation and to administrative proceedings before the DOT. If the limitations on such charges are relaxed, or the ability of airlines to challenge such proposed rate increases is
restricted, the rates charged by airports to airlines may increase substantially.

The City of Atlanta is currently implementing portions
of a ten year capital improvement program (the “CIP”) at the Atlanta Airport. Implementation of the CIP should increase the number of flights that may operate at the airport and reduce flight delays. The CIP includes, among other things, a
9,000 foot full-service runway that opened in May 2006, related airfield improvements, additional terminal and gate capacity, new cargo and other support facilities and roadway and other infrastructure improvements. If fully implemented, the CIP is
currently estimated by the City of Atlanta to cost approximately $6.8 billion, which exceeds the $5.4 billion CIP approved by the airlines in 1999. The CIP will not be complete until at least 2012, with individual projects scheduled to be
constructed at different times. A combination of federal grants, passenger facility charge revenues, increased user rentals and fees, and other airport funds are expected to be used to pay CIP costs directly and through the payment of debt service
on bonds. Certain elements of the CIP have been delayed, some may be eliminated and there is no assurance that the CIP will be fully implemented. Failure to implement certain portions of the CIP in a timely manner could adversely impact our
operations at the Atlanta Airport.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Chapter 11 Proceedings

As discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, on September 14, 2005, we and certain of our subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions
for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court. On April 25, 2007, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving and confirming the Plan of Reorganization and the Plan of Reorganization became effective,
allowing Delta to emerge from bankruptcy on April 30, 2007. The reorganization cases were jointly administered under the caption “In re Delta Air Lines, Inc., et al., Case No. 05-17923-ASH.” As of the date of the Chapter 11
filing, then pending litigation was generally stayed, and absent further order of the Bankruptcy Court, most parties may not take any action to recover on pre-petition claims against Delta and our subsidiaries that were a part of the Chapter 11
proceedings.

On April 24, 2007, the Bankruptcy Court approved the Cincinnati Airport Settlement Agreement with the Kenton County
Airport Board (“KCAB”) and UMB Bank, N.A., the trustee (the “Bond Trustee”) for the Series 1992 Bonds (as defined below), to restructure certain of our lease and other obligations at the Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky International
Airport (the “Cincinnati Airport”). The Series 1992 Bonds include: (1) the $419 million Kenton County Airport Board Special Facilities Revenue Bonds, 1992 Series A (Delta Air Lines, Inc.



Index to Financial Statements

Project), $397 million of which were then outstanding; and (2) the $19 million Kenton County Airport Board Special Facilities Revenue Bonds, 1992 Series
B (Delta Air Lines, Inc. Project), $16 million of which were then outstanding.

The Cincinnati Airport Settlement Agreement, among other
things:

•

provides for agreements under which we will continue to use certain facilities at the Cincinnati Airport at substantially reduced costs;

•

settles all disputes among us, the KCAB, the Bond Trustee and the former, present and future holders of the 1992 Bonds (the “1992 Bondholders”);

•

gives the Bond Trustee, on behalf of the 1992 Bondholders, a $260 million allowed general, unsecured pre-petition claim in our bankruptcy proceedings; and

•

provides for our issuance of $66 million principal amount of senior unsecured notes to the Bond Trustee on behalf of the 1992 Bondholders.

On May 3, 2007, the parties to the Cincinnati Airport Settlement Agreement implemented that agreement in accordance
with its terms. A small number of 1992 Bondholders (the “Objecting Bondholders”) challenged the settlement in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. In August 2007, the District Court affirmed the Bankruptcy
Court’s order approving the settlement. The Objecting Bondholders appealed the decision of the District Court to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which in February 2009 upheld the District Court’s decision. The objecting
Bondholders have filed a petition with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit for a rehearing en banc.

Delta Family-Care
Savings Plan Litigation

On March 16, 2005, a retired Delta employee filed an amended class action complaint in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against Delta, certain current and former Delta officers and certain current and former Delta directors on behalf of himself and other participants in the Delta Family-Care Savings Plan
(“Savings Plan”). The amended complaint alleges that the defendants were fiduciaries of the Savings Plan and, as such, breached their fiduciary duties under ERISA to the plaintiff class by (1) allowing class members to direct their
contributions under the Savings Plan to a fund invested in Delta common stock; and (2) continuing to hold Delta’s contributions to the Savings Plan in Delta’s common and preferred stock. The amended complaint seeks damages unspecified
in amount, but equal to the total loss of value in the participants’ accounts from September 2000 through September 2004 from the investment in Delta stock. Defendants deny that there was any breach of fiduciary duty, and have moved to dismiss
the complaint. The District Court stayed the action against Delta due to the bankruptcy filing and granted the motion to dismiss filed by the individual defendants. The plaintiffs appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
Circuit the District Court’s decision to dismiss the complaint against the individual defendants but voluntarily dismissed this appeal, pending resolution of the automatic stay of their claim against Delta. The parties have reached an agreement
in principle to resolve this matter on a class-wide basis under which the plaintiffs would receive a $4.5 million general, unsecured pre-petition claim in Delta’s Chapter 11 proceedings. The settlement is subject to the completion of definitive
documentation and Bankruptcy Court approval.

Sheets Electronic Quotation Service (“Pink Sheets”) maintained by Pink Sheets LLC for the National Quotation Bureau, Inc. The ticker symbol “DALRQ” was assigned to our Old Common Stock for over-the-counter quotations. On
April 30, 2007, the Old Common Stock was canceled pursuant to the terms of our Plan of Reorganization and we have no continuing obligations with respect to the Old Common Stock.

The following table sets forth for the periods indicated, the highest and lowest sales price for our common stock authorized in connection with our
emergence from bankruptcy as reported on the NYSE for the period beginning April 30, 2007 and for our Old Common Stock as reported on the Pink Sheets for the period through April 27, 2007. The quotations from the Pink Sheets reflect
inter-dealer prices, without retail markup, markdown or commissions, and may not represent actual transactions.

(1)

The common stock commenced trading on April 26, 2007 on a “when-issued” basis and was listed on the New
York Stock Exchange and began trading under the ticker symbol “DAL” on May 3, 2007.

(2)

The Old Common Stock was canceled pursuant to the terms of our Plan of Reorganization and no further trading occurred
after April 27, 2007.

Holders

As of February 1, 2009, there were approximately 2,813 holders of record of our common stock.

Dividends

We expect to retain any future earnings to fund our operations and meet our cash and liquidity needs. In addition, our ability to pay
dividends or repurchase common stock is restricted under credit facilities that we entered into in connection with our emergence from bankruptcy. Therefore, we do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

General Information

On October 29, 2008 (the “Closing
Date”), we completed our merger (the “Merger”) with Northwest, creating the world’s largest airline. We now offer service to 378 worldwide destinations in 66 countries and expect to serve more than 170 million passengers
each year. Combined with the reach of SkyTeam, our global airline alliance, and our codeshare partners, our customers can fly to 570 destinations in 111 countries. The Merger better positions us to manage through economic cycles and volatile oil
prices, invest in our fleet, improve services for customers and achieve our strategic objectives.

Year in Review

For 2008, we reported a consolidated net loss of $8.9 billion, which reflects (1) a $7.3 billion non-cash charge from an
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, (2) $1.1 billion in primarily non-cash Merger-related charges, (3) significantly increased fuel costs and (4) weakened demand due to the onset of a global recession.

During 2008, fuel prices fluctuated dramatically. Fuel is one of our most significant costs. At the beginning of the year, crude oil prices hovered
around $100 per barrel, escalating to $145 per barrel by mid-summer. We were not able to increase revenues through ticket prices, fuel surcharges or other passenger service fees to cover all of our higher fuel costs. Accordingly, we reduced capacity
by 5% in the second half of the year compared to our 2008 plan. As part of this capacity reduction, we removed 31 aircraft from our operating fleet, of which 22 have been sold or returned to the lessors and nine remain temporarily grounded or held
for sale. We also offered voluntary workforce reduction programs to our U.S. based non-pilot employees during the year. These programs helped us right-size our workforce to the capacity reductions. Approximately 4,200 employees, or 8% of our
pre-Merger workforce, elected to participate in these programs.

Throughout the summer months, fuel prices remained at record high levels
and were forecasted to continue to rise. Based on this outlook, we added fuel hedges to protect against further escalating fuel costs. However, fuel prices fell dramatically during the third and fourth quarters, creating sizable losses on our fuel
hedge contracts in the fourth quarter. Losses on our derivative contracts that relate to jet fuel purchases in 2009 are deferred on our Consolidated Balance Sheet for 2008 and will be recognized in 2009 when the hedged jet fuel is purchased and
consumed.

Northwest Merger

We
believe the Merger will generate approximately $2 billion in annual revenue and cost synergies by 2012 from more effective aircraft utilization, a more comprehensive and diversified route system and cost synergies from reduced overhead and
improved operational efficiency. We expect to realize the following benefits from integrating the operations of Delta and Northwest:

•

As a globally-balanced airline, we are better positioned to compete in the Open Skies environment by combining Delta’s strengths in the south, mountain west
and northeast United States, Europe and Latin America with Northwest’s presence in the midwest and northwest United States and Asia;

•

We expect the combined company to have the financial strength and flexibility to weather cyclical conditions in the airline industry; and

•

Delta’s and Northwest’s complementary networks and common membership in the SkyTeam alliance are expected to ease the combination of operations that have
complicated past mergers within the airline industry.



Index to Financial Statements

In connection with the closing of the Merger, we awarded to substantially all U.S. based Delta and
Northwest employees an aggregate of 101 million shares of common stock. This award recognizes the critical role of our employees in assisting us achieve our financial, operational and customer service goals. As a result of this award, we
recorded $791 million in one-time primarily non-cash charges to restructuring and Merger-related items.

We expect to incur one-time cash
costs of approximately $500 million over approximately three years to integrate the two airlines. We plan to integrate the operations of Northwest into Delta as promptly as is feasible, which we anticipate we will substantially complete in 2010.

Outlook

We
believe a combination of lower fuel prices, capacity reductions, and merger synergies better positions us to effectively manage our business through the current economic crisis. Nevertheless, we expect to report a significant loss in the March 2009
quarter primarily due to fuel hedge losses coupled with the impact of the global recession, which has weakened demand for air travel, and the first quarter traditionally being our weakest quarter due to seasonality.

Fuel Prices and Other Costs

In 2009, we
expect to use approximately four billion gallons of jet fuel. At that level of consumption, a $1 change in the average annual per barrel price of crude oil can impact our financial results by approximately $100 million. Accordingly, the volatility
of fuel prices will continue to have a major impact on our financial results.

As discussed above, at current market prices we will
recognize losses on hedge contracts that we entered into in 2008 when fuel prices were much higher. The majority of these losses will be recognized in the first half of 2009, as the hedged fuel is purchased and consumed. In January 2009, we have
added new hedges that reflect current market prices, approximating 16% of our estimated 2009 consumption. Should fuel prices remain at their current levels, we will realize significant savings in fuel costs compared to 2008.

We expect higher pension expense in 2009 compared to 2008 from a decline in the value of our defined benefit plan assets driven by market conditions and
increases in certain other operating expenses in 2009 compared to 2008 due to timing delays between the reduction in capacity and our ability to remove certain capacity-related costs. We also expect to record approximately $260 million of higher
interest expense related to increased amortization of debt discount, reflecting lower fair value of Northwest debt as of the Closing Date.

Demand
and Capacity

The global economic recession has resulted in weaker demand for air travel. Our demand began to slow during the
December 2008 quarter and we believe worsening global economic conditions in 2009 will substantially reduce U.S. airline industry revenues in 2009 compared to 2008. As a result, we have announced plans to further reduce capacity by 6-8% in 2009
compared to 2008 (which reflect planned reductions in domestic capacity of 8-10% and international capacity of 3-5%). If economic conditions continue to worsen, we expect to make additional reductions to our capacity. We believe we have flexibility
in our network and fleet to remove additional capacity if the environment warrants.

In December 2008, we announced additional voluntary
workforce reduction programs for U.S. based non-pilot employees to align staffing with the planned capacity reductions. Approximately 2,100 employees elected to participate. We expect to record between $40 million and $50 million in restructuring
charges during the March 2009 quarter for these programs.



Index to Financial Statements

Merger Synergies

As discussed above, we expect to generate significant synergies from the Merger. Our key early integration efforts will focus on (1) technology, (2) employees, (3) standardizing our fleet across the two
airlines and (4) achieving a single operating certificate.

We believe that we will recognize $500 million in synergy benefits in
2009, primarily in the second half of the year. Our ability to realize the synergies will depend, among other things, on our successfully aligning technologies of the two airlines, receiving a single operating certificate and resolving labor
representation differences while maintaining productive employee relations.

We have made significant progress regarding integration of our
workgroups, including reaching joint collective bargaining agreements and integrated seniority lists with our pilots and flight dispatchers and reaching agreement on a seniority list with our meteorologists. Recently, the NMB accepted a request by
the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association (“AMFA”) to terminate AMFA’s certification to represent pre-merger NWA aircraft maintenance technicians and related employees, which will allow us to integrate these workgroups promptly. In
addition, the Delta flight attendant seniority committee has reached a position on a combined seniority list that we believe is consistent with the position of the Association of Flight Attendants (“AFA”), which was certified to represent
the NWA flight attendants prior to the merger. The integration of some portions of the rest of the Delta and NWA workforces may be challenging in part because representation and seniority integration issues must be resolved and two of the unions,
the AFA and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which represents NWA’s airport employees and other categories of ground employees, have not said when they will seek to proceed to resolve those issues.

Background and Combined Financial Results of the Predecessor and Successor

In September 2005, we and substantially all of our subsidiaries (the “Delta Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter
11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”). On April 30, 2007 (the “Effective Date”), the Delta Debtors emerged from bankruptcy. References in this Form 10-K to “Successor” refer to Delta on or after
May 1, 2007, after giving effect to (1) the cancellation of Delta common stock issued prior to the Effective Date; (2) the issuance of new Delta common stock and certain debt securities in accordance with the Delta Debtors’ Joint
Plan of Reorganization (“Delta’s Plan of Reorganization”); and (3) the application of fresh start reporting. References to “Predecessor” refer to Delta prior to May 1, 2007.

Upon emergence from Chapter 11, we adopted fresh start reporting in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Statement of
Position 90-7, “Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code” (“SOP 90-7”). The adoption of fresh start reporting resulted in our becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes. Due to our
adoption of fresh start reporting on April 30, 2007, the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations include the results of operations for (1) the year ended December 31, 2008 of the Successor, (2) the eight months ended
December 31, 2007 of the Successor, (3) the four months ended April 30, 2007 of the Predecessor and (4) the year ended December 31, 2006 of the Predecessor.

For purposes of management’s discussion and analysis of the results of operations in this Form 10-K, we combined the results of operations for the
four months ended April 30, 2007 of the Predecessor with the eight months ended December 31, 2007 of the Successor. We then compare (1) Delta’s results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 with the 2007
combined results and (2) the 2007 combined results with the Predecessor’s results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2006. We also discuss significant fresh start reporting adjustments (“Fresh Start Adjustments”),
which impacted comparability.

We believe the 2007 combined results of operations provide management and investors with a more meaningful
perspective on Delta’s financial and operational performance than if we did not combine the results of operations of the Predecessor and the Successor in this manner. Similarly, we combine the financial results of the Predecessor and the
Successor when discussing our sources and uses of cash for the year ended December 31, 2007.

Results of Operations—2008 Compared to 2007 Combined

Operating Revenue

Northwest Operations.

As a result of the Merger, our results of operations for 2008 include
Northwest’s operations for the period from October 30 to December 31, 2008, increasing our operating revenue $2.0 billion. The addition of Northwest to our operations for that period increased available seat miles (“ASMs”),
or capacity, 10% for the full year.

Mainline Passenger Revenue.

Mainline passenger revenue increased primarily due to
(1) the inclusion of Northwest’s operations, (2) fare increases in response to increased fuel charges, (3) pricing and scheduling initiatives and (4) our increased service to international destinations. The increase in
passenger revenue reflects a rise of 6% and 7% in passenger mile yield and passenger revenue per available seat mile (“PRASM”), respectively.

•

North American Passenger Revenue

. North American passenger revenue increased 8%, driven by a 2.1 point increase in load factor and a 6% increase in PRASM on
a 1% increase in capacity. The passenger mile yield increased 4%. The increases in passenger revenue and PRASM reflect (1) the inclusion of Northwest’s operations and (2) fare increases, higher yields and our reduction of domestic
flights in response to high fuel prices and the slowing economy. Excluding Northwest’s operations, we reduced domestic capacity by 7% for the year.

•

International Passenger Revenue

. International passenger revenue increased 38%, driven by a 27% increase in capacity due to growth in our international
operations and the inclusion of Northwest’s operations, and a 9% increase in PRASM. The passenger mile yield increased 9%. These results reflect an increase in yields due to fuel surcharges and increases in service to international
destinations, primarily in the Atlantic and Latin America markets, from the restructuring of our route network. Excluding Northwest’s operations, we increased international capacity by 14% for the year.



Index to Financial Statements

Regional carriers

. Passenger revenue of regional affiliates increased due to the inclusion of
Northwest’s operations. Excluding Northwest’s operations, regional carriers revenue declined $58 million primarily due to an 8% decrease in capacity in response to high fuel prices and the slowing economy, as well as the termination of
certain contract carrier agreements.

Cargo

. Cargo revenue increased due to the inclusion of Northwest’s operations and an
increase in fuel surcharges, improved yields, and higher international volume.

Other, net

. Other, net revenue increased primarily
due to the inclusion of Northwest’s operations. Excluding Northwest’s operations, other, net revenue increased $485 million primarily due to (1) new or increased administrative service charges and baggage handling fees, (2) growth in
aircraft maintenance and staffing services to third parties and (3) higher SkyMiles program revenue.

Operating Expense

(1)

Restructuring and merger-related items reflects $333 million in one-time merger-related charges, as discussed
below related to Northwest for the period from October 30 to December 31, 2008.



Index to Financial Statements

Northwest Operations.

As a result of the Merger, 2008 includes Northwest’s operations for the
period from October 30 to December 31, 2008, increasing operating expense $2.1 billion. The addition of Northwest for that period increased capacity 10% for the full year.

Restructuring and merger-related items.

Restructuring and merger-related items totaled a $1.1 billion charge, primarily consisting of the
following:

•

Merger-related charges.

$978 million in one-time primarily non-cash charges relating to the issuance or vesting of employee equity awards in connection with
the Merger.

•

Severance and related costs.

$114 million in restructuring and related charges in connection with two voluntary workforce reduction programs for U.S.
non-pilot employees announced in March 2008 in which approximately 4,200 employees elected to participate.

•

Facilities and other.

$25 million in facilities charges primarily related to accruals for future lease obligations for previously announced plans to close
operations in Concourse C at the Cincinnati Northern Kentucky International Airport (the “Cincinnati Airport”).

•

Contract carrier restructuring.

$14 million in charges associated with the early termination of certain capacity purchase agreements with contract carriers.

Impairments.

During the March 2008 quarter, we experienced a significant decline in market capitalization driven
primarily by record fuel prices and overall airline industry conditions. In addition, the announcement of our intention to merge with Northwest established a stock exchange ratio based on the relative valuation of Delta and Northwest. As a result of
these indicators, we determined goodwill was impaired and recorded a non-cash charge of $6.9 billion. In addition to the goodwill impairment charge, in the June 2008 quarter, we recorded a non-cash charge of $357 million to reduce the carrying value
of certain intangible assets based on their revised estimated fair values.

Fuel expense

. Fuel expense, including contract carriers,
increased $2.2 billion, primarily due to higher average fuel prices, partially offset by fuel hedge gains and reduced consumption from lower capacity. Fuel prices averaged $3.18 per gallon, including fuel hedge gains of $134 million, for 2008,
compared to $2.24 per gallon, including fuel hedge gains of $51 million, for 2007.

Salaries and related costs.

A $109 million
increase primarily from a 6% average increase in pilots and flight attendants to staff increased international flying, annual pay increases for all pilot and non-pilot non-management employees, and increases in group insurance rates, partially
offset by a 3% average decrease in headcount primarily related to two voluntary workforce reduction programs.

Aircraft maintenance
materials and outside repairs.

A $73 million increase primarily due to growth in our third party maintenance and repair business.

Passenger service.

A $67 million increase primarily associated with (1) the increased cost of catering on international flights, (2) product upgrades in our Business Elite cabins and (3) unfavorable foreign currency
exchange rates.

Profit sharing.

A $158 million charge related to our broad-based employee profit sharing plan in 2007. We did not
record any profit sharing expense in 2008. This plan provides that, for each year in which we have an annual pre-tax profit (as defined), we will pay at least 15% of that profit to eligible employees.

Operating Income and Operating Margin

We
reported an operating loss of $8.3 billion for 2008 and operating income of $1.1 billion for 2007. Operating margin, which is the ratio of operating (loss) income to operating revenues, was (37)% and 6% for 2008 and 2007, respectively.



Index to Financial Statements

Other (Expense) Income

Other expense, net for 2008 was $727 million, compared to $492 million for 2007. This change is attributable to (1) a $53 million, or 8%, increase in interest expense primarily due to a higher level of debt
outstanding, including Northwest debt for the period from October 30 to December 31, 2008 and the borrowing of the entire amount of our $1.0 billion revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility”), partially offset by the repayment of
our debtor-in-possession financing facilities (the “DIP Facility”) and other higher floating rate debt in connection with our emergence from Chapter 11, (2) a $36 million decrease in interest income primarily from lower cash balances
prior to the Merger and lower interest rates compared to 2007 and (3) a $146 million increase to miscellaneous, net due to the following:

Reorganization Items, Net

Reorganization items, net totaled a $1.2 billion gain for 2007, primarily consisting of the following:

•

Emergence gain.

A net $2.1 billion gain due to our emergence from bankruptcy, comprised of (1) a $4.4 billion gain related to the discharge of
liabilities subject to compromise in connection with the settlement of claims, (2) a $2.6 billion charge associated with the revaluation of our SkyMiles frequent flyer obligation and (3) a $238 million gain from the revaluation of our
remaining assets and liabilities to fair value.

•

Aircraft financing renegotiations and rejections

. A $440 million charge for estimated claims primarily associated with the restructuring of the financing
arrangements for 143 aircraft and adjustments to prior claims estimates.

•

Contract carrier agreements

. A net charge of $163 million in connection with amendments to certain contract carrier agreements.

•

Emergence compensation

. In accordance with Delta’s Plan of Reorganization, we made $130 million in lump-sum cash payments to approximately 39,000
eligible non-contract, non-management employees. We also recorded an additional charge of $32 million related to our portion of payroll related taxes associated with the issuance, as contemplated by Delta’s Plan of Reorganization, of
approximately 14 million shares of common stock to those employees.

•

Pilot collective bargaining agreement

. An $83 million allowed general, unsecured claim in connection with the agreement between Comair, Inc., our wholly
owned subsidiary (“Comair”), and the Air Line Pilots Association (“ALPA”) to reduce Comair’s pilot labor costs.



Index to Financial Statements

•

Facility leases

. A net $43 million gain, which primarily reflects (1) a $126 million net gain related to our settlement agreement with the Massachusetts
Port Authority partially offset by (2) a net $80 million charge from an allowed general, unsecured claim in connection with the settlement relating to the restructuring of certain of our lease and other obligations at the Cincinnati Airport.

Income Tax Benefit (Provision)

We recorded an income tax benefit of $119 million for 2008 as a result of the impairment of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. The impairment of goodwill did not result in an income tax benefit as goodwill is not
deductible for income tax purposes. We did not record an income tax benefit for the remainder of our loss for 2008, as it is fully reserved by a valuation allowance.

For 2007, we recorded an income tax provision totaling $207 million. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets, excluding the effect of the deferred tax liabilities that are
unable to be used as a source of income against these deferred tax assets, based on our belief that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized in the future. We will continue to assess the need for a full valuation allowance in
future periods. In accordance with SOP 90-7, any reduction in the valuation allowance as a result of the recognition of deferred tax assets is adjusted through goodwill, followed by other indefinite-lived intangible assets until the net carrying
cost of these assets is zero. Accordingly, during 2007, we reduced goodwill by $211 million with respect to the realization of pre-emergence deferred tax assets.

Results of Operations—2007 Combined Compared to 2006

Fresh Start Adjustments

During the eight months ended December 31, 2007, Fresh Start Adjustments resulted in a $157 million increase to pre-tax income for the year ended
December 31, 2007. The Fresh Start Adjustments consist of the following:

SkyMiles Frequent Flyer Program

. We revalued our frequent flyer award liability to
estimated fair value and changed our accounting policy from an incremental cost method to a deferred revenue method. Fair value represents the estimated price that third parties would require us to pay for them to assume the obligation of redeeming
miles under the SkyMiles program. Fresh Start Adjustments for the SkyMiles program (including the change in accounting policy for that program) increased operating revenue by $188 million.



Index to Financial Statements

Fuel Hedging

. Prior to the adoption of fresh start reporting on April 30, 2007, we recorded
as a component of stockholders’ deficit in other comprehensive loss $46 million of deferred gains related to our fuel hedging program. This gain would have been recognized as an offset to fuel expense as the underlying fuel hedge contracts were
settled. However, as required by fresh start reporting, accumulated other comprehensive loss prior to emergence from Chapter 11 was reset to zero. Accordingly, Fresh Start Adjustments resulted in a non-cash increase to fuel expense of $46 million.

Depreciation

. We revalued property and equipment to fair value, which reduced the net book value of these assets by $1.0 billion.
In addition, we adjusted the depreciable lives of flight equipment to reflect revised estimated useful lives. As a result, depreciation expense decreased by $127 million.

Amortization of Intangible Assets

. We valued our intangible assets at fair value, which increased the net book value of intangible assets (excluding goodwill) by $2.9 billion, of which $956 million relates to
amortizable intangible assets. As a result, amortization expense increased by $146 million.

Aircraft Maintenance Materials and Outside
Repairs

. We changed the way we account for certain maintenance parts that were previously capitalized and depreciated. After emergence, we expense these parts as they are placed on the aircraft. This change resulted in an increase in aircraft
maintenance materials and outside repairs expense of $52 million.

Interest Expense

. The revaluation of our debt and capital lease
obligations resulted in a decrease in interest expense due to the amortization of premiums from adjusting these obligations to fair value. During 2007, $33 million in future premium credits were accelerated in connection with accounting for
(1) an amendment to certain financing arrangements and (2) the prepayment of certain secured debt. As a result, interest expense decreased by $70 million.

Other Fresh Start Adjustments

. We recorded other Fresh Start Adjustments relating primarily to the revaluation of our aircraft leases. These adjustments increased operating expense by $19 million and
non-operating expense by $3 million.

Accounting Adjustments

During 2006, we recorded certain out-of-period adjustments (“Accounting Adjustments”) in our Consolidated Financial Statements that affect the comparability of our results for the years ended
December 31, 2007 and 2006. These adjustments resulted in a net non-cash charge approximating $310 million to our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2006, consisting of:

•

A $112 million charge in landing fees and other rents. This adjustment is associated primarily with our airport facility leases at New York-JFK. It resulted from
historical differences associated with recording escalating rent expense based on actual rent payments instead of on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

•

A $108 million net charge related to the sale of mileage credits under our SkyMiles frequent flyer program. This includes an $83 million decrease in passenger
revenue, a $106 million decrease in other, net revenue, and an $81 million decrease in other operating expense. This net charge primarily resulted from the reconsideration of our position with respect to the timing of recognizing revenue associated
with the sale of mileage credits that we expect will never be redeemed for travel.

•

A $90 million charge in salaries and related costs to adjust our accrual for postemployment healthcare benefits. This adjustment is due to healthcare payments
applied to this accrual over several years, which should have been expensed as incurred.

We believe the Accounting
Adjustments, considered individually and in the aggregate, are not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2006. In making this assessment, we



Index to Financial Statements

considered qualitative and quantitative factors, including our substantial net loss in that year, the non-cash nature of the Accounting Adjustments, our
substantial stockholders’ deficit at December 31, 2006, and our status as a debtor-in-possession under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code during that year.

Operating Revenue

Operating revenue totaled $19.2 billion for 2007, a $1.6 billion, or 9%, increase compared to
2006. Passenger revenue increased 9% on a 3% increase in ASMs, or capacity, and a 1.9 point increase in load factor. The increase in passenger revenue reflects a rise of 4% and 7% in passenger mile yield and PRASM, respectively. Mainline passenger
revenue increased primarily due to (1) strong passenger demand, (2) our increased service to international destinations, (3) increased SkyMiles revenue associated with Fresh Start Adjustments discussed above and (4) the negative
impact of Accounting Adjustments recorded in 2006 as discussed above. Passenger revenue of regional affiliates increased primarily due to increased flying by our contract carriers, which resulted in an 8% increase in revenue passenger miles
(“RPMs”), or traffic, on 7% greater capacity. Other, net revenue increased primarily due to (1) increased SkyMiles revenue due to a change in accounting methodology and Fresh Start Adjustments discussed above, (2) increased
administrative service charges and baggage handling fees, (3) growth in aircraft maintenance and staffing services to third parties and (4) the negative impact of Accounting Adjustments recorded in 2006 as discussed above.

North American Passenger Revenue

. North American passenger revenue increased 3%, driven by
a 2.5 point increase in load factor and a 7% increase in PRASM on a 3% decline in capacity. The passenger mile yield increased 3%. The increases in passenger revenue and PRASM reflect (1) strong passenger demand and (2) revenue and
network productivity improvements, including right-sizing capacity to better meet customer demand and the continued restructuring of our route network to reduce less productive short haul domestic flights and reallocate widebody aircraft to
international routes. As a result of our efforts to right-size capacity in domestic markets, we increased flying by our contract carriers.



Index to Financial Statements

International Passenger Revenue

. International passenger revenue increased 28%, generated by a 17%
increase in RPMs on a 16% increase in capacity and an 11% increase in PRASM. The passenger mile yield increased 9%. These results reflect increases in service to international destinations, primarily in the Atlantic and Latin America markets, from
the restructuring of our route network. Our mix of domestic versus international capacity was 67% and 33%, respectively, for 2007, compared to 71% and 29%, respectively, for 2006.

Operating Expense

Operating expense was $18.1 billion for 2007, a $584 million, or 3%, increase compared to 2006.
Operating capacity increased 3% to 151.8 billion ASMs due mainly to increases in service to international destinations, primarily in the Atlantic and Latin America markets, from the restructuring of our route network and higher contract carrier
flying from our initiatives to right-size capacity. Cost per available seat mile (“CASM”) increased 1% to 11.90¢.

Aircraft fuel and related taxes

. Aircraft fuel and related taxes increased primarily due to higher average fuel prices and increased Mainline consumption. These increases were partially offset by gains on our fuel hedging
derivatives. Fuel prices averaged $2.21 per gallon, including fuel hedge gains of $51 million, for 2007, compared to $2.10 per gallon, including fuel hedge losses of $108 million, for 2006.

Salaries and related costs

. The decrease in salaries and related costs reflects a decline of (1) $382 million due to benefit cost reductions
for our pilot and non-pilot employees and (2) $90 million due to a charge during 2006 associated with Accounting Adjustments discussed above. These decreases were partially offset by (1) expense associated with share-based compensation
resulting from equity awards granted upon emergence from bankruptcy and (2) an 8% increase in Mainline headcount due to our expansion at New York-JFK and our assumption of Atlantic Southeast Airlines, Inc. (“ASA”) ramp operations in
Atlanta.

Contract carrier arrangements

. Contract carrier arrangements expense increased due to a 16% growth in contract carrier
flying from our business plan initiatives to right-size capacity in domestic markets and due to higher average fuel prices. Fuel prices for our contract carriers averaged $2.37 per gallon for 2007, compared to $2.22 per gallon for 2006.



Index to Financial Statements

Depreciation and amortization.

Depreciation expense decreased primarily due to (1) a lower
depreciable asset base resulting from $127 million in Fresh Start Adjustments discussed above and (2) 2006 adjustments to accelerate depreciation on certain limited life parts and aircraft. These decreases were partially offset by amortization
expense of $146 million related to intangibles created in connection with the Fresh Start Adjustments discussed above.

Contracted
services

. The increase in contracted services is primarily due to (1) higher outsourcing related to information technology, cargo handling services and our aircraft cleaning services, (2) international expansion and (3) New
York-JFK facility improvements.

Landing fees and other rents.

Landing fees and other rents decreased primarily due to a charge
recorded in 2006 associated with Accounting Adjustments discussed above and due to benefits of restructuring certain contracts and lease obligations in bankruptcy.

Aircraft Rent.

The decline in aircraft rent expense is primarily due to the renegotiation and rejection of certain leases in connection with our restructuring under Chapter 11 and Fresh Start Adjustments
discussed above.

Profit sharing

. Our broad-based employee profit sharing plan provides that, for each year in which we have an
annual pre-tax profit (as defined), we will pay at least 15% of that profit to eligible employees. Based on our pre-tax earnings, we accrued $158 million under the profit sharing plan for 2007.

Operating Income and Operating Margin

We
reported operating income of $1.1 billion and $58 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating margin, which is the ratio of operating income to operating revenues, was 6% and less than 1% for 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Other (Expense) Income

Other expense, net for
2007 was $492 million, compared to $820 million for 2006. This change is substantially attributable to (1) a 25%, or $218 million, net decrease in interest expense primarily due to the repayment of the DIP Facility in connection with our
emergence from Chapter 11 and Fresh Start Adjustments discussed above, partially offset by interest expense on borrowings under a senior secured exit financing facility, which we entered into in conjunction with our emergence from bankruptcy (the
“Exit Facilities”), (2) a $59 million increase in interest income primarily from interest earned due to bankruptcy initiatives that was classified within reorganization items, net, in 2006 and (3) a $51 million increase to
miscellaneous, net, primarily related to fuel hedge losses in 2006 and foreign currency gains in 2007 due to an increased number of transactions denominated in foreign currencies.

Reorganization Items, Net

Reorganization items, net totaled a $1.2 billion gain for 2007. For
additional information about these items, see “Results of Operations—2008 Compared to 2007 Combined.”

Reorganization items,
net totaled a $6.2 billion charge for 2006, primarily consisting of the following:

•

Pilot pension termination

. $2.2 billion and $801 million allowed general, unsecured claims in connection with our settlement agreements with the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation (“the PBGC”) and a group representing retired pilots, respectively. Charges for these claims were offset by $1.3 billion in settlement gains associated with the derecognition of the previously recorded
obligations for the qualified defined benefit pension plan for Delta pilots (the “Delta Pilot Plan”) and the related pilot non-qualified plans upon the termination of these plans.



Index to Financial Statements

•

Pilot collective bargaining agreement

. A $2.1 billion allowed general, unsecured claim in connection with our comprehensive agreement with ALPA reducing our
pilot labor costs.

•

Aircraft financing renegotiations and rejections

. A $1.7 billion charge for estimated claims associated with restructuring the financing arrangements for 188
aircraft and the rejection of 16 aircraft leases.

•

Retiree healthcare benefit claims

. A $539 million charge for allowed general, unsecured claims in connection with agreements that we reached with committees
representing both pilot and non-pilot retired employees reducing their postretirement healthcare benefits.

Income Tax (Provision)
Benefit

For 2007, we recorded an income tax provision totaling $207 million. For additional information about this provision, see
“Results of Operations—2008 Compared to 2007 Combined.”

For 2006, we recorded an income tax benefit totaling $765 million.
The amount primarily reflects a decrease to our deferred tax asset valuation allowances from the reversal of accrued pension liabilities associated with the Delta Pilot Plan and pilot non-qualified plan obligations upon each plan’s termination.

Financial Condition and Liquidity

Our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $4.5 billion at December 31, 2008 compared to $2.8 billion at December 31, 2007. This increase primarily reflects our Merger with Northwest,
in which we acquired $2.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $1.0 billion we received from American Express for an advance purchase of SkyMiles and the borrowing of $1.0 billion under the Revolving Facility that is a part of our
senior secured exit financing facilities (the “Exit Facilities”), partially offset by $1.2 billion of fuel hedge margin that we were required to post with counterparties.

The counterparties under our fuel hedge contracts have the right to require us to secure our obligations under those contracts by posting the margin
associated with any loss position on those contracts. Our contracts related to the margin balance as of the end of 2008 generally settle during the first half of 2009. If fuel prices continue to fall, we may be required to post additional collateral
under those contracts.

We expect to meet our cash needs for 2009 from cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments and financing arrangements. We have an undrawn $500 million revolving credit facility. With respect to our aircraft order commitments at December 31, 2008, we have financing commitments from third parties, cancellation rights or
definitive agreements to sell certain aircraft to third parties immediately following delivery of those aircraft to us by the manufacturer.

While we do not currently anticipate a need to access the capital markets to meet our cash needs in 2009, the continued credit crisis and related turmoil in the global financial system may restrict our ability to access the markets at a
time when we would like, or need, to do so. These conditions could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. In addition, our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms for future needs
could be affected by the fact that substantially all of our assets are subject to liens.

The financing agreements of Delta and its
subsidiaries contain certain affirmative, negative and financial covenants. We were in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2008.



Index to Financial Statements

Significant Liquidity Events

Significant liquidity events during 2008 were as follows:

•

American Express Agreement.

In December 2008, we entered into a multi-year extension of our exclusive Co-brand Credit Card relationship with American Express
(the “American Express Agreement”). As part of the American Express Agreement, we received $1.0 billion from American Express for an advance purchase of SkyMiles. We also expect to receive an additional $1.0 billion benefit from
contract improvements through 2010.

•

Exit financing facility.

In August 2008, we borrowed the entire amount of our $1.0 billion Revolving Facility under the Exit Facilities to increase our
financial flexibility.

•

Hedge Margin.

In accordance with our fuel and interest rate hedge contracts, we were required to post $1.1 billion of margin with counterparties.

•

Northwest financing facility

. In October 2008, Northwest entered into a $500 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”),
which matures at the earlier of (1) October 2009 (with respect to $300 million of such facility) or October 2011 (with respect to $200 million of such facility) or (2) the date that Northwest Airlines, Inc., is no longer a separate legal
entity and an operating airline, including when it is merged with and into Delta Air Lines, Inc. As of December 31, 2008, there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility.

For additional information regarding these matters, see Notes 4 and 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Combined Sources and Uses of Cash

Cash flows from
operating activities

Cash used in operating activities totaled $1.7 billion for 2008, and cash provided by operating activities was
$1.4 billion for 2007. Cash used in operating activities for 2008 reflects (1) an increase in aircraft fuel payments due to record high fuel prices for most of the year, (2) the posting of $1.1 billion in margin with counterparties
primarily from our estimated fair value loss position on our fuel hedge contracts at December 31, 2008, (3) the payment of $438 million in premiums for fuel hedge derivatives entered into during 2008, (4) a $444 million decrease in
advance ticket sales due to the slowing economy and (5) the payment of $158 million in 2008 under our broad-based employee profit sharing plan related to 2007. Cash used in operating activities was partially offset by cash flows driven by a
$3.5 billion increase in operating revenue, $2.0 billion of which is directly attributable to Northwest’s operations since the Closing Date.

Cash flows from operating activities in 2007 reflect $875 million in cash used under Delta’s Plan of Reorganization to satisfy bankruptcy-related obligations under our comprehensive agreement with ALPA and
settlement agreement with the PBGC. Cash flows from operating activities during 2007 also reflect (1) the release of $804 million from restricted cash pursuant to an amendment to our Visa/Mastercard credit card processing agreement,
(2) revenue and network productivity improvements, including right-sizing capacity to better meet customer demand and the continued restructuring of our route network to reduce less productive short haul domestic flights and reallocate widebody
aircraft to international routes and (3) a $476 million decrease in short-term investments primarily from sales of auction rate securities.

Cash
flows from investing activities

Cash provided by investing activities totaled $1.6 billion for 2008, and cash used in investing
activities was $625 million for 2007. Cash provided by investing activities in 2008 reflects (1) the inclusion of $2.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents from Northwest in the Merger and (2) $609 million in restricted cash and cash



Index to Financial Statements

equivalents, primarily related to $500 million of cash from a Northwest borrowing that was released from escrow. These inflows were partially offset by
investments of $1.3 billion for flight equipment and $241 million for ground property and equipment.

Cash used in investing activities in
2007 reflects investments of $810 million for flight equipment and advanced payments for aircraft commitments and $226 million for ground property and equipment. During 2007, restricted cash decreased by $185 million. In addition, we received $34
million and $83 million from the sale of our investments in priceline.com Incorporated and ARINC Incorporated, respectively.

Cash flows from financing
activities

Cash provided by financing activities totaled $1.7 billion for 2008, and cash used in financing activities was $120 million
in 2007. Cash provided by financing activities in 2008 primarily reflects (1) $1.0 billion in borrowings under the Revolving Facility, (2) $1.0 billion received under the American Express Agreement for an advance purchase of SkyMiles, and
(3) $1.0 billion from aircraft financing. Cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by the repayment of $1.6 billion of long-term debt and capital lease obligations.

Cash used in financing activities in 2007 primarily reflects (1) the repayment of the DIP Facility with a portion of the proceeds available under
the Exit Facilities and existing cash, (2) the prepayment of $863 million of secured debt with a portion of the proceeds from the sale of enhanced equipment trust certificates and (3) scheduled principal payments on long-term debt and
capital lease obligations. During 2007, we also received $181 million in proceeds from an amendment to certain financing arrangements in which the outstanding principal amount was increased to $415 million and the interest rate we pay under this
facility was reduced.

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008 that relate to debt, operating leases, aircraft order commitments,
capital leases, contract carrier obligations, other material, noncancelable purchase obligations and other commitments. The table does not include commitments that are contingent on events or other factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time,
some of which are discussed in footnotes to this table and in the text immediately following the footnotes.

(1)

Interest payments, excluding the impact of our interest rate hedges, related to long-term debt are included in the
table. The principal portion of these obligations is included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Estimated amounts for future interest and related payments in connection with our long-term debt obligations are based on the fixed and variable
interest rates specified in the associated debt agreements. Estimates on variable rate interest were calculated using implied short-term LIBOR based on LIBOR at December 31, 2008. Also included in the table are other debt-related payments,
which represent credit enhancements required in conjunction with certain financing agreements.

(2)

This amount represents our minimum fixed obligations under our contract carrier agreements with ASA, Chautauqua
Airlines, Inc. (“Chautauqua”), Freedom Airlines, Inc. (“Freedom”), Pinnacle Airlines, Inc. (“Pinnacle”), Shuttle America Corporation (“Shuttle America”) and SkyWest Airlines, Inc. (“SkyWest
Airlines”) (excluding contract carrier aircraft lease payments accounted for as operating leases).

(3)

This amount includes our noncancelable operating leases and our lease payments related to aircraft under our contract
carrier agreements with ASA, Chautauqua, Freedom, Pinnacle, Shuttle America and SkyWest Airlines.

(4)

We have excluded from the table our order of 18 B-787-8 aircraft. The Boeing Company (“Boeing”) has informed
us that Boeing will be unable to meet the contractual delivery schedule for these aircraft. We are in discussions with Boeing regarding this situation.

Our firm orders to purchase 33 B-737-800 aircraft include 31 B-737-800 aircraft, which we have entered into definitive agreements to sell to two third parties immediately following delivery of these aircraft to us by
the manufacturer. We have not received any notice that these parties have defaulted on their purchase obligations. These sales will reduce our future commitments by approximately $1.3 billion during the period from 2009 through 2011 ($490 million,
$730 million and $40 million for 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively).

(5)

Interest payments related to capital lease obligations are included in the table. The present value of these
obligations, excluding interest, is included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

(6)

Includes purchase obligations pursuant to which we are required to make minimum payments for goods and services,
including but not limited to insurance, outsourced human resource services, marketing, maintenance, technology, sponsorships and other third party services and products.

(7)

Represents commitments to certain vendors for which we are obligated to generate specified amounts of revenue related to
ticket booking fees.

(8)

In addition to the contractual obligations included in the table, we have significant cash obligations that are not
included in the table. For example, we will pay wages required under collective bargaining agreements, fund pension plans (as discussed below) purchase capacity under contract carrier arrangements (as discussed below), settle tax contingency
reserves (as discussed below) and pay credit card processing fees and fees for other goods and services, including those related to fuel, maintenance and commissions. While we are parties to legally binding contracts regarding these goods and
services, the actual commitment is contingent on certain factors such as volume and/or variable rates that are uncertain or unknown at this time. Therefore, these items are not included in the table. In addition, purchase orders made in the ordinary
course of business are excluded from the table and any amounts which we are liable for under the purchase orders are included in current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Payments under our profit-sharing plan or pursuant to our 2007
Performance Compensation Plan are contingent on factors unknown at this time and, therefore, are not included in this table.

The following items are not included in the table above:

Pension Plans.

We sponsor qualified defined contribution (“DC
Plans”) and defined benefit pension plans (“DB Plans”) for eligible employees and retirees. Our funding obligations for these plans are governed by ERISA. Estimates of pension plan funding requirements can vary materially from actual
funding requirements because the estimates are based on various assumptions, including those described below.

DC Plans.

During
2008, we contributed approximately $215 million to our DC Plans or directly to employees that otherwise would have been contributed to the DC Plans on their behalf, but for limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. In 2009, we expect to
contribute approximately $300 million related to our DC Plans.

DB Plans.

During 2008, we contributed approximately $115 million to
our DB Plans, which include a defined benefit pension plan for eligible non-pilot Delta employees and retirees (the “Delta Non-Pilot Plan”) and defined benefit pension plans for eligible Northwest employees and retirees (the
“Northwest Pension Plans”). These plans have been frozen for future benefit accruals.

The Pension Protection Act of 2006 allows
commercial airlines to elect alternative funding rules (“Alternative Funding Rules”) for defined benefit plans that are frozen. Under the Alternative Funding Rules, the unfunded liability for a frozen defined benefit plan may be funded
over a fixed 17-year period and is calculated using an 8.85% interest rate. Delta elected the Alternative Funding Rules for the Delta Non-Pilot Plan, effective April 1, 2007; and Northwest elected the Alternative Funding Rules for the Northwest
Pension Plans, effective October 1, 2006.

The Alternative Funding Rules allow us to reduce the funding obligations for the Delta
Non-Pilot Plan and the Northwest Pension Plans over the next several years compared to what our funding obligations would be under rules applicable to other DB plans. While the Alternative Funding Rules also make our funding obligations for these
plans more predictable, our estimates of future funding requirements of the Delta Non-Pilot Plan and



Index to Financial Statements

Northwest Pension Plans are based on various assumptions concerning factors outside our control, including, among other things, the market performance of
assets; statutory requirements; and demographic data for participants, including the number of participants and the rate of participant attrition. Results that vary significantly from our assumptions could have a material impact on our future
funding obligations.

We estimate that the funding requirements for the Delta Non-Pilot Plan and the Northwest Pension Plans will total
approximately $275 million in 2009. Due primarily to the recent decline in the investment markets, we expect our contributions to these plans to significantly increase for 2010 and thereafter.

Contract Carrier Agreements

. During the year ended December 31, 2008, seven regional air carriers (“Contract Carriers”) operated
for us (in addition to our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Comair, Inc. (“Comair”), Compass Airlines, Inc. (“Compass”) and Mesaba Aviation, Inc. (“Mesaba”)) pursuant to capacity purchase agreements. Under these agreements,
the regional air carriers operate some or all of their aircraft using our flight designator codes, and we control the scheduling, pricing, reservations, ticketing and seat inventories of those aircraft and retain the revenues associated with those
flights. We pay those airlines an amount, as defined in the applicable agreement, which is based on a determination of their cost of operating those flights and other factors intended to approximate market rates for those services.

The above table shows our minimum fixed obligations under these capacity purchase agreements (excluding Comair, Compass and Mesaba). The obligations set
forth in the table contemplate minimum levels of flying by the Contract Carriers under the respective agreements and also reflect assumptions regarding certain costs associated with the minimum levels of flying such as for fuel, labor, maintenance,
insurance, catering, property tax and landing fees. Accordingly, our actual payments under these agreements could differ materially from the minimum fixed obligations set forth in the table above.

For information regarding payments we may be required to make in connection with certain terminations of our capacity purchase agreements with Chautauqua
and Shuttle America, see “Contingencies Related to Termination of Contract Carrier Agreements” in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

FIN 48.

We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109,” on January 1, 2007. The total amount of unrecognized
tax benefits on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2008 is $29 million. We have accrued $5 million for the payment of interest and $8 million for the payment of penalties related to these unrecognized tax benefits.

We are currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service for the 2005 through 2007 tax years. The audit is substantially complete and is expected to
close in early 2009.

Legal Contingencies

. We are involved in various legal proceedings relating to employment practices,
environmental issues and other matters concerning our business. We cannot reasonably estimate the potential loss for certain legal proceedings because, for example, the litigation is in its early stages or the plaintiff does not specify the damages
being sought.

Other Contingent Obligations under Contracts

. In addition to the contractual obligations discussed above, we have
certain contracts for goods and services that require us to pay a penalty, acquire inventory specific to us or purchase contract specific equipment, as defined by each respective contract, if we terminate the contract without cause prior to its
expiration date. Because these obligations are contingent on our termination of the contract without cause prior to its expiration date, no obligation would exist unless such a termination occurs.

For additional information about other contingencies not discussed above, as well as information related to general indemnifications, see Note 8 of the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Application of Critical Accounting Policies

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions, which are
based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.

Frequent Flyer Programs.

We have a frequent flyer program (the “SkyMiles Program”) offering incentives to increase travel on Delta. This
program allows participants to earn mileage credits by flying on Delta, Contract Carriers and participating airlines, as well as through participating companies such as credit card companies, hotels and car rental agencies. We also sell mileage
credits to other airlines and to non-airline businesses. Mileage credits can be redeemed for free or upgraded air travel on Delta and participating airlines, for membership in our Crown Room Club and for other program awards.

In the Merger, we assumed Northwest’s frequent flyer program (the “WorldPerks Program”). We are consolidating the SkyMiles and WorldPerks
Programs, which will ultimately provide for the combining of miles from each program at a one-to-one ratio. The WorldPerks Program is accounted for under the same methodology as the SkyMiles Program.

We use the residual method for revenue recognition of mileage credits. The fair value of the mileage credit component is determined based on prices at
which we sell mileage credits to other airlines, currently $0.0054 per mile and is re-evaluated at least annually. Under the residual method, the portion of the revenue from the sale of mileage credits that approximates fair value is deferred and
recognized as passenger revenue when miles are redeemed and services are provided based on the weighted- average price of all miles that have been deferred. The portion of the revenue received in excess of the fair value is recognized in income
immediately and classified as other, net revenue.

For mileage credits which we estimate are not likely to be redeemed
(“Breakage”), we recognize the associated value proportionally during the period in which the remaining mileage credits are expected to be redeemed. The estimate of Breakage is based on historical redemption patterns. A change in
assumptions as to the period over which mileage credits are expected to be redeemed, the actual redemption activity for mileage credits or our estimate of the fair value of mileage credits expected to be redeemed could have a material impact on our
revenue in the year in which the change occurs and in future years. At December 31, 2008, the aggregate deferred revenue balance associated with our frequent flyer programs was $5.1 billion. A hypothetical 1% change in our outstanding number of
miles estimated to be redeemed would result in a $49 million impact on our deferred revenue liability.

Purchase Accounting
Measurements.

On the Closing Date, Northwest revalued its assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 141, “Business Combinations” (“SFAS
141”). These changes in value did not result in gains or losses, but were instead an input to the calculation of goodwill related to the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired
and liabilities assumed from Northwest in the Merger. Additional changes in the fair values of these assets and liabilities from the current estimated values, as well as changes in other assumptions, could significantly impact the reported value of
goodwill.

The fair value of Northwest’s debt and capital lease obligations was determined by estimating the present value of amounts
to be paid at appropriate interest rates as of the Closing Date. These rates were determined with swap rates, LIBOR rates and market spreads as of the Closing Date. The market spreads, which were determined with the assistance of third party
financial institutions, took into consideration the credit risk and the structure of the instruments as well as the underlying collateral supporting the instruments.



Index to Financial Statements

Fair value measurements for goodwill and other intangible assets included significant unobservable
inputs, which generally include a five-year business plan, 12-months of historical revenues and expenses by city pair, projections of available seat miles, revenue passenger miles, load factors, and operating costs per available seat mile and a
discount rate.

One of the significant inputs underlying the intangible fair value
measurements performed on the Closing Date is the discount rate. We determined the discount rate using the weighted average cost of capital of the airline industry, which was measured using a Capital Asset Pricing Model (“CAPM”). The CAPM
in the valuation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles utilized a 50% debt and 50% equity structure. The historical average debt-to-equity structure of the major airlines since 1990 is also approximately 50% debt and 50% equity, which was
similar to Northwest’s debt-to-equity structure at emergence from Chapter 11. The return on debt was measured using a bid-to-yield analysis of major airline corporate bonds. The expected market rate of return for equity was measured based on
the risk free rate, the airline industry beta, and risk premiums based on the Federal Reserve Statistical Release H. 15 or Ibbotson

®

Stocks, Bonds, Bills, and Inflation

®

Valuation Yearbook, Edition 2008. These factors resulted in a 13% discount rate. This compares to an 11% discount rate used at emergence by Northwest.

The fair value of Northwest’s pension and postretirement plans was determined by measuring the plans funded status as of the closing of the Merger.
Any excess projected benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets was recognized as a liability. One of the significant assumptions in determining our projected benefit obligation is the discount rate. We determined the discount rate
primarily by reference to annualized rates earned on high quality fixed income investments and yield-to-maturity analysis specific to estimated future benefit payments, which resulted in a weighted average discount rate of 7.8%. Other significant
assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate, retirement age, and mortality assumptions. These assumptions are discussed further in Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Derivative Instruments.

In an effort to manage our exposure to changes in aircraft fuel prices, we periodically enter into derivative instruments
comprised of crude oil, heating oil and jet fuel swap, collar, and call option contracts to hedge a portion of our projected aircraft fuel requirements, including those of our Contract Carriers under capacity purchase agreements. We record our
derivative contracts in accordance with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity” (“SFAS 133”). Our fuel derivative instruments are valued using market data derived from quantitative models and
processes to generate forward curves and volatilities.

We believe our fuel hedge contracts will be highly effective during their term in
offsetting changes in cash flow attributable to the volatility in jet fuel prices. We perform both a prospective and retrospective assessment to this effect, at least quarterly, including assessing the possibility of counterparty default. If we
determine that a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively and recognize subsequent changes in the fair value of the hedge on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. As a result of our
effectiveness assessment at December 31, 2008, we believe our hedge contracts will continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flow attributable to the volatility in jet fuel prices.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

Goodwill reflects (1) the excess of the reorganization
value of the Successor over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets, net of liabilities, from the adoption of fresh start reporting, adjusted for impairment, and (2) the excess of purchase price over the fair values of the
tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Northwest in the Merger. The following table reflects the change in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2008:

During the March 2008 quarter, we experienced a significant decline in market capitalization
driven primarily by record fuel prices and overall airline industry conditions. In addition, the announcement of our intention to merge with Northwest established a stock exchange ratio based on the relative valuation of Delta and Northwest.
For additional information about the Merger, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We determined that these factors combined with further increases in fuel prices were an indicator that a goodwill impairment test was
required pursuant to SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”). As a result, we estimated fair value based on a discounted projection of future cash flows, supported with a market-based valuation. We
determined that goodwill was impaired and recorded a non-cash charge of $6.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. In estimating fair value, we based our estimates and assumptions on the same valuation techniques employed and levels of
inputs used to estimate the fair value of goodwill upon adoption of fresh start reporting.

Identifiable intangible assets reflect
intangible assets (1) recorded as a result of our adoption of fresh start reporting upon emergence from bankruptcy and (2) acquired in the Merger. Indefinite-lived assets are not amortized. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on
a straight-line basis or under the undiscounted cash flows method over the estimated economic life of the respective agreements and contracts.

In addition to the goodwill impairment charge, we recorded a non-cash charge of $357 million ($238 million after tax) for the year ended December 31, 2008 to reduce the carrying value of certain intangible assets based on their revised
estimated fair values.

In accordance with SFAS 142, we apply a fair value-based impairment test to the net book value of goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on an interim basis. The annual impairment test date for our goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangible assets is October 1.

In evaluating our goodwill for impairment, we first compare our one reporting unit’s fair value
to its carrying value. We estimate the fair value of our reporting unit by considering (1) our market capitalization, (2) any premium to our market capitalization an investor would pay for a controlling interest (“Control
Premium”), (3) the potential value of synergies and other benefits that could result from such interest, (4) market multiple and recent transaction values of peer companies and (5) projected discounted future cash flows, if
reasonably estimable. If the reporting unit’s fair value exceeds its carrying value, no further testing is required. If, however, the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, we then determine the amount of the impairment
charge, if any. We recognize an impairment charge if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value.

We perform the impairment test for our indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the asset’s fair value to its carrying value. Fair value is estimated based on recent market transactions where available or projected discounted
future cash flows. We recognize an impairment charge if the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value.



Index to Financial Statements

At October 1, 2008, we performed an impairment test of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
assets, which resulted in no impairment charge. For both goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, changes in assumptions or circumstances, including, but not limited to, (1) negative trends in our market capitalization,
(2) volatile fuel prices, (3) declining passenger mile yields, (4) lower demand as a result of the weakening U.S. and global economy, (5) interruption to our operations due to an employee strike, terrorist attack, or other
reasons and/or (6) consolidation of competitors within the industry, which are not offset by other factors such as improved yield or an increase in Control Premiums, could result in an impairment in the year in which the change occurs and in
future years. For additional information about our accounting policy for goodwill and other intangible assets, see Notes 1 and 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Long-Lived Assets

. Our flight equipment and other long-lived assets have a recorded value of $20.6 billion on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at
December 31, 2008. This value is based on various factors, including the assets’ estimated useful lives and their estimated salvage values. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets” (“SFAS 144”), we record impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired and the estimated future cash flows generated by those assets are less than
their carrying amounts. If we decide to permanently remove flight equipment or other long-lived assets from operations, these assets will be evaluated under SFAS 144 and could result in an impairment. The impairment loss recognized is the amount by
which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value.

In order to evaluate potential impairment as required by SFAS
144, we group assets at the fleet type level (the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows) and then estimate future cash flows based on projections of passenger yield, fuel costs, labor costs and other relevant factors. We estimate
aircraft fair values using published sources, appraisals and bids received from third parties, as available. For additional information about our accounting policy for the impairment of long-lived assets, see Notes 1 and 5 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Income Tax Valuation Allowance and Contingencies

. In accordance with SFAS No. 109,
“Accounting for Income Taxes,” deferred tax assets should be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The future realization of our net
deferred tax assets depends on the availability of sufficient future taxable income. In making this determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions. We consider, among other things, our deferred
tax liabilities, the overall business environment, our historical earnings and losses, our industry’s historically cyclical periods of earnings and losses, and potential, current and future tax planning strategies.

Our income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax
authorities. Although we believe that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable, we have established tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions we have taken, which
could result in additional liabilities for taxes and interest. We review the reserves as circumstances warrant and adjust the reserves as events occur that affect our potential liability, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations,
conclusion of tax audits, a change in exposure based on current calculations, identification of new issues, release of administrative guidance or the rendering of a court decision affecting a particular issue. We would adjust the income tax
provision in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.

Prior to January 1, 2009, in the event that
an adjustment to the income tax provision relates to a pre-emergence tax position or Northwest Merger-related tax position, we would adjust goodwill followed by other indefinite-lived intangible assets until the net carrying value of these assets is
zero. Beginning January 1, 2009, any adjustments to the income tax provision in regard to pre-emergence tax positions will be made through the income tax provision pursuant to SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations”
(“SFAS 141R”).

For additional information about income taxes, see Notes 1 and 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Pension Plans

. We sponsor DB Plans for our eligible employees and retirees. We currently estimate
that expense for our DB Plans in 2009 will be approximately $420 million. The effect of our DB Plans on our Consolidated Financial Statements is subject to many assumptions. We believe the most critical assumptions are (1) the weighted average
discount rate and (2) the expected long-term rate of return on the assets of our DB Plans. For additional information regarding these assumptions, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

We determine our weighted average discount rate on our measurement date primarily by reference to annualized rates earned on high quality fixed income
investments and yield-to-maturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments. We used a weighted average discount rate of 6.49% and 6.37% at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Additionally, our weighted average discount
rate for net periodic benefit cost in each of the past three years has varied from the rate selected on our measurement date, ranging from 5.67% to 7.19% between 2006 and 2008, due to remeasurements throughout the year. The impact of a 0.50% change
in our weighted average discount rate is shown in the table below.

The expected long-term rate of return on the assets of our DB Plans is
based primarily on plan specific investment studies using historical returns on our DB Plans’ assets with forward looking estimates based on existing financial market conditions and forecasts. Modest excess return expectations versus some
market indices are incorporated into the return projections based on the actively managed structure of the investment programs and their records of achieving such returns historically. We review our rate of return on plan asset assumptions annually.
These assumptions are largely based on the asset category rate-of-return assumptions developed annually with our pension investment advisors, however, our annual investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly
influence our evaluation. The investment strategy for pension plan assets is to utilize a diversified mix of global public and private equity portfolios, public and private fixed income portfolios, and private real estate and natural resource
investments to earn a long-term investment return that meets or exceeds a 9% annualized return target. The impact of a 0.50% change in our expected long-term rate of return is shown in the table below.

For additional information about our pension plans, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In March 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued SFAS No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities—an amendment to FASB Statement 133” (“SFAS 161”). SFAS 161 changes the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities. Entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures
about (1) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (2) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS 133, and (3) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s
financial position, financial performance and cash flows. SFAS 161 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning on January 1, 2009. We currently provide significant information about our hedging activities and use of
derivatives in our quarterly and annual filings. Accordingly, we expect the adoption of SFAS 161 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.



Index to Financial Statements

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 141R. SFAS 141R provides guidance for recognizing and measuring
goodwill acquired in a business combination and requires disclosure of information to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. It also revises the treatment of valuation
allowance adjustments related to income tax benefits in existence prior to a business combination or prior to the adoption of fresh start reporting. Under SFAS 141, any reduction in the valuation allowance as a result of the recognition of deferred
tax assets is adjusted through goodwill, followed by other indefinite-lived intangible assets until the net carrying costs of these assets is zero. By contrast, SFAS 141R requires that any reduction in this valuation allowance be reflected through
the income tax provision. SFAS 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning on January 1, 2009. For additional information regarding SFAS 141R, see Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We have significant market risk exposure related to aircraft fuel prices and interest rates. Market risk is the potential negative impact of adverse changes in these prices or rates on our Consolidated Financial Statements. To manage the
volatility relating to these exposures, we periodically enter into derivative transactions pursuant to stated policies. We expect adjustments to the fair value of financial instruments accounted for under SFAS 133 to result in ongoing volatility in
earnings and stockholders’ equity.

The following sensitivity analyses do not consider the effects of a change in demand for air
travel, the economy as a whole or actions we may take to seek to mitigate our exposure to a particular risk. For these and other reasons, the actual results of changes in these prices or rates may differ materially from the following hypothetical
results.

Aircraft Fuel Price Risk

Our results of operations are materially impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel. We periodically use derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, which are comprised of crude oil, heating oil and jet fuel swap, collar
and call option contracts, in an effort to manage our exposure to changes in aircraft fuel prices.



Index to Financial Statements

For 2008, aircraft fuel and related taxes, including our Contract Carriers, accounted for 28%
of our total operating expense. Aircraft fuel and related taxes increased 53% in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to higher average fuel prices. Fuel prices averaged $3.16 per gallon, including fuel hedge losses of $65 million, for 2008
compared to $2.24 per gallon, including fuel hedge gains of $51 million, for 2007.

In the Merger, we assumed all of Northwest’s
outstanding fuel hedge contracts. On the Closing Date, we designated certain of Northwest’s derivative instruments, comprised of crude oil collar and swap contracts, as hedges in accordance with SFAS 133. As of December 31, 2008, these
contracts had an estimated fair value loss of $163 million. The remaining Northwest derivative contracts that were not designated as hedges had an estimated fair value loss of $318 million. We will mark-to-market the derivative contracts not
designated as hedges on a monthly basis in aircraft fuel expense and related taxes. The mark-to-market on these contracts may result in increased volatility in earnings compared to our fuel hedge contracts designated under SFAS 133, for which
changes in underlying commodity prices result in valuation changes that are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.

In
September 2008, one of our fuel hedge contract counterparties, Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. (“Lehman Brothers”), filed for bankruptcy. As a result, we terminated our fuel hedge contracts with Lehman Brothers prior to their scheduled
settlement dates. Additionally, during the December 2008 quarter, we terminated certain fuel hedge contracts with other counterparties to reduce our exposure to projected fuel hedge losses due to the decrease in crude oil prices. In accordance with
SFAS 133, we recorded an unrealized loss of $324 million, which represents the effective portion of these terminated contracts at the date of settlement, in accumulated other comprehensive income on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. These losses will
be reclassified into earnings in accordance with their original contract settlement dates through December 2009. The ineffective portion of these contracts at the date of settlement resulted in an $11 million charge.



Index to Financial Statements

As of January 31, 2009, our open fuel hedging position, excluding contracts we terminated early for the
years ending December 31, 2009 and 2010 is as follows:

The following table shows the projected impact to aircraft fuel expense and fuel hedge margin
based on the impact of our open fuel hedge contracts at January 31, 2009, excluding contracts we terminated early, assuming the following per barrel of crude oil sensitivities for 2009:

Projection based upon estimated unhedged jet fuel price per gallon of $1.83 and estimated aircraft fuel
consumption of 4.0 billion gallons for 2009.

(2)

Projection based upon average futures prices per gallon by contract settlement month.

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to market
risk from adverse changes in interest rates is primarily associated with our long-term debt obligations. Market risk associated with our fixed and variable rate long-term debt relates to the potential reduction in fair value and negative impact to
future earnings, respectively, from an increase in interest

rates. We had $8.2 billion and $4.5 billion of fixed-rate debt and $9.7 billion and $3.8 billion of variable-rate debt at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. At December 31, 2008 an increase of 100 basis points in average annual interest rates would have decreased the estimated fair value of our fixed-rate long-term debt by $155 million, inclusive of the impact of our interest rate swap
agreements and increased interest expense on our variable-rate long-term debt by $92 million, inclusive of the impact of our interest rate swap and cap agreements.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

Our results of operations may be impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations on
the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency-denominated operating revenues and expense. Our largest exposure comes from the Japanese yen. In general, a weakening yen relative to the U.S. dollar results in (1) our operating income being unfavorably
impacted to the extent net yen-denominated revenues exceed expenses and (2) recognition of a non-operating foreign currency gain due to the remeasurement of net yen-denominated liabilities. To manage exchange rate risk, we execute both our
international revenue and expense transactions in the same foreign currency to the extent practicable. We believe changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our results of operations.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of our disclosure controls and
procedures, which have been designed to permit us to effectively identify and timely disclose important information. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the controls and procedures were
effective as of December 31, 2008 to ensure that material information was accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.

Changes In Internal Control

Except as set forth below, during the three months ended December 31, 2008, we did not make any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

On October 29, 2008, we completed our Merger with Northwest. As
permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, management has elected to exclude Northwest from management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2008.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.



Index to Financial Statements

Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies may deteriorate.

On
October 29, 2008, we completed our Merger with Northwest. As permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, management has elected to exclude Northwest from management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2008. Assets and revenues of Northwest represent 45% and 9%, respectively, of our total assets and total revenues as reported in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2008. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008 using the criteria issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework. Based on that evaluation, management believes that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2008.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, the independent
registered public accounting firm who also has audited our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Ernst & Young’s report on our internal control over financial reporting appears on the following page.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Delta Air Lines, Inc.

We have audited Delta Air Lines, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Delta Air Lines, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As indicated in the accompanying Report of Management, management’s
assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Northwest Airlines Corporation, which is included in the 2008 consolidated financial statements of Delta Air
Lines, Inc. and constituted 45% of total assets as of December 31, 2008 and 9% of total revenues for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Delta Air Lines, Inc. also did not include an evaluation of the
internal control over financial reporting of Northwest Airlines Corporation.

In our opinion, Delta Air Lines, Inc. maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the COSO criteria

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Delta Air Lines, Inc. as of December 31, 2008 (Successor) and 2007 (Successor),
and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2008 (Successor), the eight-month period ended December 31, 2007 (Successor), four-month period
ended April 30, 2007 (Predecessor) and the year ended December 31, 2006 (Predecessor) of Delta Air Lines, Inc. and our report dated March 1, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Delta Air Lines, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Delta Air Lines, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2008 (Successor) and 2007 (Successor), and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’
equity (deficit), and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2008 (Successor), eight-month period ended December 31, 2007 (Successor), four-month period ended April 30, 2007 (Predecessor) and year ended December 31, 2006
(Predecessor). These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Delta Air Lines, Inc. at December 31, 2008 (Successor) and 2007 (Successor), and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2008 (Successor), eight-month period ended
December 31, 2007 (Successor), four-month period ended April 30, 2007 (Predecessor) and year ended December 31, 2006 (Predecessor), in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, on April 25, 2007, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming the plan of
reorganization, which became effective on April 30, 2007. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with AICPA Statement of Position 90-7, “Financial Reporting by Entities in
Reorganization Under the Bankruptcy Code,” for the Successor Company as a new entity with assets, liabilities and a capital structure having carrying values not comparable with prior periods as described in Note 1.

As discussed in Note 10, in 2007 the Company adopted the measurement date provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans.” As discussed in Note 9, in 2007 the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.” Also as discussed in Note 10, in 2006 the Company adopted the recognition provisions of SFAS No. 158.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Delta Air Lines, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2008 (Successor), based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 1, 2009 expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Background

Delta Air Lines, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is the world’s largest airline, providing scheduled
air transportation for passengers and cargo throughout the United States (“U.S.”) and around the world.

On October 29, 2008
(the “Closing Date”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Delta (“Merger Sub”) merged (the “Merger”) with and into Northwest Airlines Corporation. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 14, 2008,
among Delta, Merger Sub and Northwest Airlines Corporation (the “Merger Agreement”), on the Closing Date (1) Northwest Airlines Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Northwest Airlines, Inc. (collectively,
“Northwest”), became wholly-owned subsidiaries of Delta and (2) each share of Northwest common stock outstanding on the Closing Date or issuable under Northwest’s Plan of Reorganization (as defined below) was converted into the
right to receive 1.25 shares of Delta common stock. We accounted for the Merger in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 141, “Business Combinations” (“SFAS 141”), whereby the
purchase price paid to effect the Merger was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Northwest based on their estimated fair values.

Unless otherwise indicated, Delta Air Lines, Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiaries are collectively referred to as “Delta,” “we,”
“us,” and “our.” Prior to October 30, 2008, these references do not include Northwest.

In September 2005, we and
substantially all of our subsidiaries (the “Delta Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”). On April 30, 2007 (the “Effective
Date”), the Delta Debtors emerged from bankruptcy. Upon emergence from Chapter 11, we adopted fresh start reporting in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Statement of Position 90-7, “Financial
Reporting by Entities in Reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code” (“SOP 90-7”). The adoption of fresh start reporting resulted in our becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, the Consolidated Financial
Statements on or after May 1, 2007 are not comparable to the Consolidated Financial Statements prior to that date.

Fresh start
reporting requires resetting the historical net book value of assets and liabilities to fair value by allocating the entity’s reorganization value to its assets and liabilities pursuant to SFAS 141. The excess reorganization value over the fair
value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Deferred income taxes are determined in conformity with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (“SFAS
109”). For additional information regarding the impact of fresh start reporting on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the Effective Date, see Note 11.

References in this Form 10-K to “Successor” refer to Delta on or after May 1, 2007, after giving effect to (1) the cancellation of Delta common stock issued prior to the Effective Date,
(2) the issuance of new Delta common stock and certain debt securities in accordance with the Delta Debtors’ Joint Plan of Reorganization (“Delta’s Plan of Reorganization”), and (3) the application of fresh start
reporting. References to “Predecessor” refer to Delta prior to May 1, 2007.

In September 2005, Northwest and substantially
all of its subsidiaries (the “Northwest Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. On May 31, 2007, the Northwest Debtors emerged from bankruptcy pursuant to the Northwest
Debtors’ First Amended Joint and Consolidated Plan of Reorganization (“Northwest’s Plan of Reorganization”).

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Our Consolidated Financial
Statements include the accounts of Delta Air Lines, Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. As a result of the Merger, the accounts of Northwest are included for the period from October 30 to December 31, 2008.

In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements for the Predecessor, we applied SOP 90-7, which requires that the financial statements for periods
while operating as a debtor-in-possession under Chapter 11 distinguish transactions and events that were directly associated with the reorganization from the ongoing operations of the business. Accordingly, certain revenues, expenses, realized gains
and losses and provisions for losses that were realized or incurred in the bankruptcy proceedings were recorded in reorganization items, net on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

We have eliminated all material intercompany transactions in our Consolidated Financial Statements. We do not consolidate the financial statements of any
company in which we have an ownership interest of 50% or less unless we control that company or it is a variable interest entity for which we are the primary beneficiary. We did not control any company in which we had an ownership interest of 50% or
less, or have any material variable interest entity for any period presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Use of Estimates

We are required to make estimates and assumptions when preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP. These
estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.

New Accounting Standards

In March 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the
“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities—an amendment to FASB Statement No. 133” (“SFAS 161”). SFAS 161 changes the disclosure requirements for
derivative instruments and hedging activities. Entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about (1) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (2) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for
under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS 133”), and (3) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, financial
performance and cash flows. SFAS 161 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning on January 1, 2009. We currently provide significant information about our hedging activities and use of derivatives in our quarterly and annual
filings. Accordingly, we expect the adoption of SFAS 161 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations” (“SFAS 141R”). SFAS 141R provides guidance for recognizing and measuring goodwill acquired in a business combination and
requires disclosure of information to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of a business combination. It also revises the treatment of valuation allowance adjustments related to income tax benefits in
existence prior to a business combination or prior to the adoption of fresh start reporting. Under SFAS 141, any reduction in the valuation allowance as a result of the recognition of deferred tax assets is adjusted through goodwill, followed by
other indefinite-lived intangible assets until the net carrying costs of these assets is zero. By contrast, SFAS 141R requires that any reduction in this valuation allowance be reflected through the income tax provision. SFAS 141R is effective for
fiscal years beginning on January 1, 2009. For additional information regarding SFAS 141R, see Note 9.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We classify short-term, highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased as cash and cash equivalents. These investments are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value.

Short-Term Investments

At
December 31, 2008, our short-term investments were comprised of an investment in The Reserve Primary Fund (the “Primary Fund”), a money market fund that is undergoing an orderly liquidation. In accordance with SFAS No. 115,
“Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” we record these investments as available-for-sale securities at fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

At December 31, 2008, the fair value of our investment in the Primary Fund was $212 million. The cost of this investment was $225 million. In
mid-September 2008, the net asset value of the Primary Fund decreased below $1 per share as a result of the Primary Fund’s valuing at zero its holdings of debt securities issued by Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. (“Lehman Brothers”),
which filed for bankruptcy on September 15, 2008. Accordingly, we recorded an other than temporary impairment of $13 million as an unrealized loss to the cost basis of our pro rata share of the estimated loss in this investment.

We have requested the redemption of our investment in the Primary Fund. We expect distributions will occur as the Primary Fund’s assets mature or
are sold. While we expect to receive substantially all of our current holdings in the Primary Fund, we cannot predict when this will occur or the amount we will receive. Accordingly, we have reclassified our investment from cash and cash equivalents
to short-term investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2008.

At December 31, 2007, our short-term
investments were comprised of insured auction rate securities. For additional information regarding our accounting for auction rate securities, see “Investments in Debt and Equity Securities” in this Note.

Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents

Restricted cash and cash equivalents included in current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets totaled $429 million and $520 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Restricted cash recorded in other noncurrent assets
on our Consolidated Balance Sheets totaled $24 million and $15 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Restricted cash and cash equivalents are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value.

At December 31, 2008, our restricted cash and cash equivalents primarily related to cash held to meet certain projected self-insurance obligations
and employee benefits.

At December 31, 2007, our restricted cash primarily related to (1) $295 million held in a grantor trust
for the benefit of Delta pilots to fund the then remaining balance of an obligation we had under our comprehensive agreement with the Air Line Pilots Association, International (“ALPA”), the collective bargaining representative of Delta
pilots, to reduce pilot labor costs and (2) cash held to meet certain projected self-insurance obligations. The amount in the grantor trust was classified as restricted cash with a corresponding note payable on our Consolidated Balance Sheet
until the amount was distributed in January 2008.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Our results of operations are materially impacted by changes in aircraft fuel prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. In an effort to
manage our exposure to these risks, we periodically enter into various derivative instruments, including fuel, interest rate and foreign currency hedges. In accordance with SFAS 133,

F-9


Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

we are required to recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognize
certain changes in their fair value on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

We believe our hedge contracts will be highly effective
during their term in offsetting changes in cash flow or fair value attributable to the hedged risk. We perform both a prospective and retrospective assessment to this effect at least quarterly, including assessing the possibility of counterparty
default. If we determine that a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively and recognize subsequent changes in the fair value of the hedge to aircraft fuel and related taxes on our
Consolidated Statements of Operations. As a result of our effectiveness assessment at December 31, 2008, we believe our hedge contracts will continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flow or fair value attributable to the
hedged risk.

Cash flow hedges

For
derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges under SFAS 133, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into
earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The effective portion of the derivative represents the change in fair value of the hedge that offsets the change in fair value of the hedged item. To the
extent the change in the fair value of the hedge does not perfectly offset the change in the fair value of the hedged item, the ineffective portion of the hedge is immediately recognized in other (expense) income on our Consolidated Statements of
Operations. The following table summarizes the accounting treatment and classification of our cash flow hedges on our Consolidated Financial Statements:

(


)

In the Merger, we assumed Northwest’s outstanding hedge contracts, which include fuel, interest rate and foreign
currency cash flow hedges. On the Closing Date, we designated certain of these contracts as hedges in accordance with SFAS 133. The remaining Northwest derivative contracts that were not designated under SFAS 133 did not qualify for hedge
accounting.

(


)

Ineffectiveness on our fuel hedge option contracts is calculated using a “perfectly effective” hypothetical
derivative, which acts as a proxy for the fair value of the change in expected cash flows from the purchase of aircraft fuel.

F-10


Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Fair value hedges

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge under SFAS 133, the gain or loss on the derivative and the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk
are recognized in current earnings. We include the gain or loss on the hedged item in the same account as the offsetting loss or gain on the related derivative instrument, resulting in no impact to our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The
following table summarizes the accounting treatment and classification of our fair value hedges on our Consolidated Financial Statements:

Hedge Margin

In accordance with our hedge agreements, (1) we may require counterparties to fund the margin associated with our gain position on hedge contracts and (2) counterparties may require us to fund the margin
associated with our loss position on these contracts. The amount of the margin, if any, is periodically adjusted based on the fair value of the hedge contracts. The margin requirements are intended to mitigate a party’s exposure to market
volatility and the associated contracting party risk. We do not offset margin funded to counterparties or margin funded to us by counterparties against fair value amounts recorded for our hedge contracts.

The hedge margin we receive from counterparties is recorded, as appropriate, in cash and cash equivalents or restricted cash, with the offsetting
obligation in other accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The margin we provide to counterparties is recorded in hedge margin receivable or restricted cash on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. All cash flows associated with
purchasing and settling fuel hedge contracts are classified as operating cash flows on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

In
accordance with our interest rate swap and cap agreements, which we assumed from Northwest in the Merger and which qualify as cash flow hedges, the respective counterparties are not required to fund margin to us and we are not required to fund
margin to them.

We record sales of passenger tickets in air traffic liability on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Passenger revenue is recognized when we provide transportation or when the ticket expires unused, reducing the related air traffic liability. We periodically evaluate the estimated air traffic liability and record any
resulting adjustments in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period in which the evaluations are completed. These adjustments relate primarily to refunds, exchanges, transactions with other airlines and other items for which final
settlement occurs in periods subsequent to the sale of the related tickets at amounts other than the original sales price.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Taxes and Fees.

We are required to charge certain taxes and fees on our passenger tickets,
including U.S. federal transportation taxes, federal security charges, airport passenger facility charges and foreign arrival and departure taxes. These taxes and fees are legal assessments on the customer for which we have an obligation to act as a
collection agent. Because we are not entitled to retain these taxes and fees, we do not include such amounts in passenger revenue. We record a liability when the amounts are collected and reduce the liability when payments are made to the applicable
government agency or operating carrier.

Frequent Flyer Programs.

We have a frequent flyer program (the “SkyMiles
Program”) offering incentives to increase travel on Delta. This program allows participants to earn mileage credits by flying on Delta, regional air carriers (“Contract Carriers”) and participating airlines, as well as through
participating companies such as credit card companies, hotels and car rental agencies. We also sell mileage credits to other airlines and to non-airline businesses. Mileage credits can be redeemed for free or upgraded air travel on Delta and
participating airlines, for membership in our Crown Room Club and for other program awards.

In the Merger, we assumed Northwest’s
frequent flyer program (the “WorldPerks Program”). We are consolidating the SkyMiles and WorldPerks Programs, which will ultimately provide for the combining of miles from each program at a one-to-one ratio. The WorldPerks Program is
accounted for under the same methodology as the SkyMiles Program.

Upon emergence from bankruptcy, we changed our accounting policy to a
deferred revenue model for all frequent flyer miles. As a result, we account for all miles earned and sold as separate deliverables in a multiple element revenue arrangement as prescribed by Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-21,
“Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.”

We use the residual method for revenue recognition of mileage credits. The
fair value of the mileage credit component is determined based on prices at which we sell mileage credits to other airlines, currently $0.0054 per mile and is re-evaluated at least annually. Under the residual method, the portion of the revenue from
the sale of mileage credits that approximates fair value is deferred and recognized as passenger revenue when miles are redeemed and services are provided based on the weighted-average price of all miles that have been deferred. The portion of the
revenue received in excess of the fair value (the “Marketing Premium”) is recognized in income when the related marketing services are provided and classified as other, net revenue.

For mileage credits which we estimate are not likely to be redeemed (“Breakage”), we recognize the associated value proportionally during the
period in which the remaining mileage credits are expected to be redeemed. The estimate of Breakage is based on historical redemption patterns. A change in assumptions as to the period over which mileage credits are expected to be redeemed, the
actual redemption activity for mileage credits or our estimate of the fair value of mileage credits expected to be redeemed could have a material impact on our revenue in the year in which the change occurs and in future years.

Prior to the adoption of fresh start reporting, we accounted for frequent flyer miles earned on Delta flights on an incremental cost basis as an accrued
liability and as operating expense, while miles sold to airline and non-airline businesses were accounted for on a deferred revenue basis. For SkyMiles accounts with sufficient mileage credits to qualify for a free travel award, we recorded a
liability for the estimated incremental cost of flight awards that were earned and expected to be redeemed for travel on Delta or other airlines. Our incremental costs included (1) our system average cost per passenger for fuel, food and other
direct passenger costs for awards to be redeemed on Delta and (2) contractual costs for awards to be redeemed on other airlines. We periodically recorded adjustments to this liability in other operating expense on our Consolidated Statements of
Operations and other accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets based on awards earned, awards redeemed, changes in our estimated incremental costs and changes to the SkyMiles Program.

Regional Carriers Revenue.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, we had contract
carrier agreements with 12 Contract Carriers, including our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Comair, Inc. (“Comair”), Compass Airlines, Inc. (“Compass”) and Mesaba Aviation, Inc. (“Mesaba”). Compass and Mesaba began operating
as Contract Carriers on the Closing Date. Our Contract Carrier agreements are structured as either (1) capacity purchase agreements whereby we purchase all or a portion of the Contract Carrier’s capacity and are responsible for selling the
seat inventory we purchase or (2) revenue proration agreements, which are based on a fixed dollar or percentage division of revenues for tickets sold to passengers traveling on connecting flight itineraries. We record revenue related to all of
our Contract Carrier agreements as regional carriers passenger revenue. We record expenses related to our Contract Carrier agreements, excluding Comair, Compass and Mesaba, as contract carrier arrangements expense.

Cargo Revenue

Cargo revenue is recognized in our
Consolidated Statements of Operations when we provide the transportation.

Other, net Revenue

Other, net revenue includes revenue from (1) the Marketing Premium component of the sale of mileage credits in the SkyMiles and WorldPerks Programs
discussed above, (2) our sale of seats on other airlines’ flights under codeshare agreements and (3) other miscellaneous service revenue. Our revenue from other airlines’ sale of seats on our flights under codeshare agreements is
recorded in passenger revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Long-Lived Assets

The following table shows our property and equipment at December 31, 2008 and 2007:

During the year ended December 31, 2008, we sold 20 aircraft, including seven CRJ-100 aircraft,
five B-757-200 aircraft, four A320-200 aircraft, and four DC-9-30 aircraft. In addition, we sold two B-747-200F airframes and one EMB-120 airframe. Proceeds from these sales totaled $123 million and resulted in a gain of $21 million.

F-13


Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

We record property and equipment at cost and depreciate or amortize these assets on a straight-line
basis to their estimated residual values over their respective estimated useful lives. Residual values for owned spare parts and simulators are generally 5% of cost except when guaranteed by a third party for a different amount. In connection with
our adoption of fresh start reporting, we increased our residual values for flight equipment from 5% to 10% of cost. Additionally, we adjusted the net book values of property and equipment to their estimated fair values and adjusted the estimated
useful lives of flight equipment. The estimated useful lives for major asset classifications are as follows:

(1)

We capitalize certain internal and external costs incurred to develop internal-use software. For the year ended
December 31, 2008, the eight months ended December 31, 2007, the four months ended April 30, 2007 and the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded $99 million, $67 million, $34 million and $109 million, respectively, for
amortization of internal-use software. The net book value of these assets totaled $229 million and $246 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

In accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” we record impairment losses on
long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired and the estimated future cash flows generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts. For long-lived assets held for sale, we record
impairment losses when the carrying amount is greater than the fair value less the cost to sell. We discontinue depreciation of long-lived assets when these assets are classified as held for sale.

To determine impairments for aircraft used in operations, we group assets at the fleet-type level (the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash
flows) and then estimate future cash flows based on projections of capacity, passenger yield, fuel costs, labor costs and other relevant factors. If impairment occurs, the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the aircraft’s
carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value. We estimate aircraft fair values using published sources, appraisals and bids received from third parties, as available.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill reflects (1) the excess of the
reorganization value of the Successor over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets, net of liabilities, from the adoption of fresh start reporting, adjusted for impairment, and (2) the excess of purchase price over the
fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Northwest in the Merger.

Identifiable
intangible assets reflect intangible assets (1) recorded as a result of our adoption of fresh start reporting upon emergence from bankruptcy and (2) acquired in the Merger. Indefinite-lived assets are not amortized. Definite-lived
intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis or under the cash flows method over the estimated economic life of the respective agreements and contracts.

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”), we apply a fair value-based impairment test to the net book value of goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangible assets on an annual

F-14


Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

basis and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on an interim basis. The annual impairment test date
for our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets is October 1.

In evaluating our goodwill for impairment, we first compare our
one reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying value. We estimate the fair value of our reporting unit by considering (1) our market capitalization, (2) any premium to our market capitalization an investor would pay for a controlling
interest , (3) the potential value of synergies and other benefits that could result from such interest, (4) market multiple and recent transaction values of peer companies and (5) projected discounted future cash flows, if reasonably
estimable. If the reporting unit’s fair value exceeds its carrying value, no further testing is required. If, however, the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, we then determine the amount of the impairment charge, if
any. We recognize an impairment charge if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value.

We
perform the impairment test for our indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the asset’s fair value to its carrying value. Fair value is estimated based on recent market transactions where available or projected discounted future cash
flows. We recognize an impairment charge if the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value.

Changes in assumptions or
circumstances could result in an additional impairment in the period in which the change occurs and in future years. Factors which could cause impairment include, but are not limited to, (1) negative trends in our market capitalization,
(2) volatile fuel prices, (3) declining passenger mile yields, (4) lower demand as a result of the weakening U.S. and global economy, (5) interruption to our operations due to an employee strike, terrorist attack, or other
reasons and (6) consolidation of competitors within the industry.

Interest Expense

While operating as a debtor-in-possession under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, in accordance with SOP 90-7, we recorded interest expense only to the
extent (1) interest would be paid during our Chapter 11 proceedings or (2) it was probable interest would be an allowed priority, secured or unsecured claim. Interest expense recorded on our Consolidated Statements of Operations totaled
$705 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, $390 million for the eight months ended December 31 2007, $262 million for the four months ended April 30, 2007 and $870 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Contractual
interest expense (including interest expense that was associated with obligations classified as liabilities subject to compromise) totaled $366 million for the four months ended April 30, 2007 and $1.2 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2006.

Income Taxes

In accordance with SFAS 109, we account for deferred income taxes under the liability method. Under this method, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial
statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as measured by current enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when necessary. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded net as current and
noncurrent deferred income taxes on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Our income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions
that are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and other tax authorities. Although we believe that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable, we have established tax and interest
reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions we have taken, which could result in additional liabilities for taxes and interest. We review the reserves as circumstances warrant and adjust the reserves as events
occur

F-15

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

that affect our potential liability, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, conclusion of tax audits, a change in exposure based on current
calculations, identification of new issues, release of administrative guidance or the rendering of a court decision affecting a particular issue. We would adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the facts that give rise to the
revision become known.

Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

We record our investments in student loan backed auction rate securities acquired in the Merger as available-for-sale securities at fair value. Any change
in the fair value of these securities is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. At December 31, 2008, the fair value of our student loan backed auction rate securities was $38 million. The cost of these investments was $45
million.

We record our investments in insured auction rate securities as trading securities at fair value. Any change in the fair value of
these securities is recorded in other (expense) income on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the fair value of our insured auction rate securities was $83 million and $107 million, respectively. The cost
of these investments was $110 million.

Due to the protracted failure in the auction process and contractual maturities averaging 27 years
for our insured auction rate securities and 32 years for our student loan backed auction rate securities, we have reclassified our auction rate securities to long-term within other noncurrent assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at
December 31, 2008.

Because auction rate securities are not actively traded, fair values were estimated by discounting the cash flows
expected to be received over the remaining maturities of the underlying securities. The valuations are based on our assessment of observable yields on instruments bearing comparable risks and consider the creditworthiness of the underlying debt
issuer. Changes in market conditions could result in further adjustments to the fair value of these securities.

Deferred Gains on Sale and Leaseback
Transactions

We amortize deferred gains on the sale and leaseback of property and equipment under operating leases over the lives
of these leases. The amortization of these gains is recorded as a reduction to rent expense. Gains on the sale and leaseback of property and equipment under capital leases reduce the carrying value of the related assets.

Manufacturers’ Credits

We periodically
receive credits in connection with the acquisition of aircraft and engines. These credits are deferred until the aircraft and engines are delivered, and then applied on a pro rata basis as a reduction to the cost of the related equipment.

Maintenance Costs

We record
maintenance costs in aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs on our Consolidated Statements of Operations as they are incurred. Modifications that enhance the operating performance or extend the useful lives of airframes or engines are
capitalized and amortized over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining lease term, whichever is shorter.

F-16


Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Inventories

Inventories of expendable parts related to flight equipment are carried at moving average cost and charged to operations as consumed. An allowance for obsolescence is provided over the remaining useful life of the
related fleet for spare parts expected to be available at the date aircraft are retired from service. We also provide allowances for parts currently identified as excess or obsolete to reduce the carrying costs to the lower of cost or net realizable
value. These parts are assumed to have an estimated residual value of 5% of the original cost. In connection with our adoption of fresh start reporting upon emergence from bankruptcy, we recorded our expendable parts inventories at fair value.

Advertising Costs

We expense
advertising costs as other selling expenses in the year incurred. Advertising expense was $114 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, $121 million for the eight months ended December 31, 2007, $51 million for the four months ended
April 30, 2007 and $150 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Commissions

We record passenger commissions in prepaid expenses and other on our Consolidated Balance Sheets when the related passenger tickets are sold. Passenger
commissions are recognized in operating expense on our Consolidated Statements of Operations when the related revenue is recognized.

Stock-Based
Compensation

Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value provisions of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share
Based Payment” (“SFAS 123R”). SFAS 123R requires companies to measure the cost of employee services in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The fair value of our stock options is
estimated using an options pricing model. The resulting cost for all equity awards is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards (usually the vesting period of the awards).

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

We record our cash equivalents and short-term investments at estimated fair value. The estimated fair values of other financial instruments, including debt and derivative instruments, have been determined using available market information
and valuation methodologies, primarily discounted cash flow analyses and an options pricing model.

Accounting Adjustments

During 2006, we recorded certain out-of-period adjustments (“Accounting Adjustments”) in our Consolidated Financial Statements that are
reflected in our results for the year ended December 31, 2006. These adjustments resulted in an aggregate net non-cash charge approximating $310 million to our Consolidated Statement of Operations.

We believe the Accounting Adjustments, considered individually and in the aggregate, were not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the
year ended December 31, 2006. In making this assessment, we considered qualitative and quantitative factors, including our substantial net loss in that year, the non-cash nature of the Accounting Adjustments, our substantial stockholders’
deficit at December 31, 2006 and our status as a debtor-in-possession under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code during that year.

NOTE 2. NORTHWEST MERGER

On the Closing Date, Northwest became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Delta. Northwest is a major air carrier that provides scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo throughout the U.S. and around the world.

The Merger better positions us to manage through economic cycles and volatile fuel prices, invest in our fleet, improve services for
customers and achieve our strategic objectives. We believe the Merger will generate significant annual revenue and cost synergies by 2012 from more effective aircraft utilization, a more comprehensive and diversified route system and cost synergies
from reduced overhead and improved operational efficiency.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each share of Northwest common stock
outstanding on the Closing Date or issuable under Northwest’s Plan of Reorganization was converted into the right to receive 1.25 shares of Delta common stock. We issued, or expect to issue, a total of 339 million shares of Delta common
stock for these purposes, or approximately 41% of the sum of the shares of Delta common stock (1) outstanding on the Closing Date (including shares issued to Northwest stockholders in the Merger), (2) issuable in exchange for shares of
Northwest common stock reserved for issuance under Northwest’s Plan of Reorganization, (3) reserved for issuance under Delta’s Plan of Reorganization and (4) issuable to our employees in connection with the Merger.

We accounted for the Merger in accordance with SFAS 141, whereby the purchase price paid to effect the Merger was allocated to the tangible and
identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Northwest based on their estimated fair values as of the Closing Date. For accounting purposes, the Merger was valued at $3.4 billion. This amount was derived from the
339 million shares of Delta common stock we issued or expect to issue, as discussed above, at a price of $9.60 per share, the average closing price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange for the five consecutive trading days that
include the two trading days before, the day of and the two trading days after the public announcement of the Merger Agreement on April 14, 2008, and capitalized Merger-related transaction costs. The purchase price also includes the fair value
of Delta stock options and other equity awards issued on the Closing Date in exchange for similar securities of Northwest. Northwest stock options and other equity awards vested on the Closing Date and were assumed by Delta and modified to provide
for the purchase of Delta common stock. Accordingly, the number of shares and, if applicable, the price per share were adjusted for the 1.25 exchange ratio. Vested stock options held by employees of Northwest are considered part of the purchase
price.

The preliminary purchase price is calculated as follows:

F-18


Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The table below represents the allocation of the total consideration to tangible and intangible
assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Northwest in the Merger based on our estimate of their respective fair values on the Closing Date:

In accordance with SFAS 141, the purchase price allocation is subject to adjustment for up to one
year after the Closing Date when additional information on asset and liability valuations becomes available. We have not finalized our review of certain liabilities recorded in the Merger. Any changes to the initial estimates of the fair value of
the assets and liabilities will be recorded as adjustments to those assets and liabilities and residual amounts will be allocated to goodwill.

The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Northwest in the Merger was allocated to goodwill. We believe that the portion of the purchase
price attributable to goodwill represents the benefits expected to be realized from the Merger, as discussed above. This goodwill is not deductible or amortizable for tax purposes.

The following table summarizes the identifiable intangible assets acquired:

The following unaudited pro forma combined results of operations give effect to the Merger as if
it had occurred at the beginning of the periods presented. The unaudited pro forma combined results of operations do not purport to represent Delta’s consolidated results of operations had the Merger occurred on the dates assumed, nor are these
results necessarily indicative of Delta’s future consolidated results of operations. We expect to realize significant benefits from integrating the operations of Delta and Northwest, as discussed above, and to incur certain one-time cash costs.
The unaudited pro forma combined results of operations do not reflect these benefits or costs. Additionally, to improve the comparability of the information presented, the unaudited pro forma combined results of operations for the year ended
December 31, 2007 include pro forma historical results of operations of Delta and Northwest adjusted to reflect (1) the impact of fresh start reporting as if both companies had emerged from bankruptcy on January 1, 2007 and
(2) changes in accounting principles as if adoption had occurred on January 1, 2007.

Includes a $1.1 billion one-time primarily non-cash charge relating to the issuance or vesting of employee equity awards
in connection with the Merger.

Includes $11.6 billion in non-cash charges from impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets for Delta
and Northwest prior to the closing of the Merger. For additional information regarding Delta’s impairment, see Note 5.

NOTE 3.
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Upon emerging from bankruptcy, we adopted SFAS 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS
157”), which defines fair value, establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis. SFAS 157
clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that
should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, SFAS 157 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in
measuring fair value as follows:

•

Level 1.

Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;

F-20


Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

•

Level 2

. Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and

•

Level 3

. Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are based on one or more of three valuation techniques noted in SFAS 157.
The three valuation techniques are identified in the tables below. Where more than one technique is noted, individual assets or liabilities were valued using one or more of the noted techniques. The valuation techniques are as follows:

(a)

Market approach

. Prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.

(b)

Cost approach.

Amount that would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement cost).

(c)

Income approach.

Techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount based on market expectations (including present value techniques, option-pricing and excess
earnings models).

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

Due to uncertainty regarding the timing of the distribution of our current holdings in the Primary
Fund and the amount we will receive from the distribution, we changed our valuation technique for the Primary Fund to an income approach using a discounted cash flow model during the September 2008 quarter. Accordingly, our short-term investments at
December 31, 2008, comprised of these securities, changed from Level 1 to Level 3 within SFAS 157’s three-tier fair value hierarchy since initial valuation upon acquisition earlier in 2008.

Our fuel hedge option derivative contracts are valued under the income approach using option-pricing models. During 2008, we reevaluated the valuation
inputs used for our option contracts. As a result, we reclassified these contracts from Level 2 to Level 3 within SFAS 157’s three-tier fair value hierarchy since valuation at December 31, 2007.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis


Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed from Northwest

(1)

These valuations were based on the present value of future cash flows for specific assets derived from our projections
of future revenue, expense and airline market conditions. These cash flows were discounted to their present value using a rate of return that considers the relative risk of not realizing the estimated annual cash flows and time value of money.

(2)

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets
acquired and liabilities assumed from Northwest in the Merger. Indefinite-lived and definite-lived intangible assets are identified by type in Note 5. Fair value measurements for goodwill and other intangible assets included significant unobservable
inputs which generally include a five-year business plan, 12-months of historical revenues and expenses by city pair, projections of available seat miles, revenue passenger miles, load factors, and operating costs per available seat mile and a
discount rate.

One of the significant unobservable inputs underlying the intangible fair value measurements performed on the Closing
Date is the discount rate. We determined the discount rate using the weighted average cost of capital of the airline industry, which was measured using a Capital Asset Pricing Model (“CAPM”). The CAPM in the valuation of goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangibles utilizing a 50% debt and 50% equity structure. The historical average debt-to-equity structure of the major airlines since 1990 is also approximately 50% debt and 50% equity, which was similar to Northwest’s
debt-to-equity structure at emergence from Chapter 11. The return on debt was measured using a bid-to-yield analysis of major airline corporate bonds. The expected market rate of return for equity was measured based on the risk free rate, the
airline industry beta, and risk premiums based on the Federal Reserve Statistical Release H. 15 or Ibbotson

®

Stocks, Bonds, Bills, and Inflation

®

Valuation Yearbook, Edition 2008. These factors resulted in a 13%
discount rate. This compares to an 11% discount rate used at emergence by Northwest.

(3)

The fair value of Northwest’s WorldPerks Program liability was determined based on the estimated price that third
parties would require us to pay for them to assume the obligation for miles expected to be redeemed under the WorldPerks Program. This estimated price was determined based on the weighted-average equivalent ticket value of a WorldPerks award which
is redeemed for travel on Northwest, Delta or a participating airline. The weighted-average equivalent ticket value contemplates differing classes of service, domestic and international itineraries and the carrier providing the award travel.

In evaluating our goodwill for impairment, we first compare our one reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying
value. We estimate the fair value of our reporting unit by considering (1) our market capitalization, (2) any premium to our market capitalization an investor would pay for a controlling interest, (3) the potential value of synergies
and other benefits that could result from such interest, (4) market multiple and recent transaction values of peer companies and (5) projected discounted future cash flows, if reasonably estimable.

(2)

We perform the impairment test for our indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the asset’s fair value to
its carrying value. Fair value is estimated based on recent market transactions, where available, or projected discounted future cash flows.

At December 31, 2007, we had goodwill of $12.1 billion, indefinite-lived intangible assets of $2.0 billion and definite-lived intangible assets of $809 million. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we
recorded non-cash impairment charges of $6.9 billion for goodwill, $314 million for indefinite-lived intangible assets and $43 million for definite-lived intangible assets.

Aircraft Fuel Price Risk

Our results of operations are materially impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel. In an effort to manage our exposure to changes in aircraft fuel prices, we periodically enter into derivative instruments
comprised of crude oil, heating oil and jet fuel swap, collar and call option contracts to hedge a portion of our projected aircraft fuel requirements, including those of our Contract Carriers under capacity purchase agreements. As of
December 31, 2008, our open fuel hedge contracts in a gain position had an aggregate estimated fair value gain of $26 million, which is recorded in prepaid expenses and other and other noncurrent assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, and
our open fuel hedge contracts in a loss position had an aggregate estimated fair value loss of $1.2 billion, which includes $481 million related to Northwest, as discussed below, and is recorded in hedge derivatives liability on our Consolidated
Balance Sheet.

In the Merger, we assumed all of Northwest’s outstanding fuel hedge contracts. On the Closing Date, we designated
certain of Northwest’s derivative instruments, comprised of crude oil collar and swap contracts, as hedges in accordance with SFAS 133. As of December 31, 2008, these contracts had an estimated fair value loss of $163 million. The
remaining Northwest derivative contracts that were not designated as hedges had an estimated fair value loss of $318 million.

In September
2008, one of our fuel hedge contract counterparties, Lehman Brothers, filed for bankruptcy. As a result, we terminated our fuel hedge contracts with Lehman Brothers prior to their scheduled settlement dates. Additionally, during the December 2008
quarter, we terminated certain fuel hedge contracts with other counterparties to reduce our exposure to projected fuel hedge losses due to the decrease in crude oil prices. In accordance with SFAS 133, we recorded an unrealized loss of $324 million,
which represents the effective portion of these terminated contracts at the date of settlement, in accumulated other comprehensive income on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. These losses will be reclassified into the Consolidated Statements of
Operations in accordance with their original contract settlement dates through December 2009. The ineffective portion of

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

these contracts at the date of settlement resulted in an $11 million charge, which we recorded to other (expense) income on our Consolidated Statement of
Operations for the year ended December 31, 2008.

As of December 31, 2008, our open fuel hedge (loss) gain position, excluding
contracts we terminated early with Lehman Brothers, for the years ending December 31, 2009 and 2010 is as follows:

Prior to the adoption of fresh start reporting, we recorded as a component of stockholders’
deficit a $46 million unrealized gain related to our fuel hedging program. This gain would have been recognized as an offset to aircraft fuel expense as the underlying fuel hedge contracts were settled. However, as required by fresh start reporting,
our accumulated stockholders’ deficit and accumulated other comprehensive loss were reset to zero. Accordingly, fresh start reporting adjustments eliminated the unrealized gain and increased aircraft fuel expense and related taxes by $46
million for the eight months ended December 31, 2007.

Gains (losses) recorded on our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the
year ended December 31, 2008, the eight months ended December 31, 2007, the four months ended April 30, 2007 and the year ended December 31, 2006 related to our fuel hedge contracts are as follows:

(1)

We recorded a mark-to-market adjustment of $91 million related to Northwest derivative contracts settling in 2009 that
were not designated as hedges under SFAS 133 for the year ended December 31, 2008.

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to market risk from adverse changes in interest rates is associated with our long-term debt obligations, cash portfolio, workers’
compensation obligations and pension, postemployment and postretirement benefits.

F-26


Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Market risk associated with our fixed and variable rate long-term debt relates to the potential
reduction in fair value and negative impact to future earnings, respectively, from an increase in interest rates. The following table presents information about our fixed and variable rate debt and the fair value of our debt at December 31,
2008 and 2007:

(1)

The aggregate fair value of our secured and unsecured debt was based primarily on reported market values and recently
completed market transactions.

During the June 2008 quarter, we entered into interest rate swap agreements designated as
fair value hedges under SFAS 133 to convert our interest rate exposure on a portion of our debt portfolio from a fixed rate to a floating rate. The interest rate swap agreements have an aggregate notional amount of $1.0 billion and mature from
September 2011 through July 2012, which corresponds to the maturity dates of the designated debt instruments. The floating rates are based on three month LIBOR plus a margin. These interest rate swap agreements had a fair value gain of $74 million
and a corresponding interest receivable of $17 million, which were recorded in other noncurrent assets and accounts receivable, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. In accordance with fair value hedge accounting, the carrying value of
our long-term debt at December 31, 2008 included $74 million of fair value adjustments.

In the Merger, we assumed
Northwest’s outstanding interest rate swap and cap agreements. On the Closing Date, we designated these derivative instruments as cash flow hedges under SFAS 133 for purposes of converting our interest rate exposure on a portion of our debt
portfolio from a floating rate to a fixed rate. The interest rate swap and cap agreements have an aggregate notional amount of $1.7 billion and mature from December 2009 through May 2019, which corresponds to the maturity dates of the designated
debt instruments. The floating rates are based on three month LIBOR plus a margin. These interest rate swap and cap agreements had a fair value loss of $95 million, which is recorded in hedge derivatives liability and other noncurrent liabilities on
our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Market risk associated with our cash portfolio relates to the potential change in interest income from a
decrease in interest rates. Workers’ compensation obligation risk relates to the potential changes in our future obligations and expenses from a change in interest rates used to discount these obligations. Pension, postemployment and
postretirement benefits risk relates to the potential changes in our benefit obligations, funding and expenses from a change in interest rates.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

We are subject to foreign currency exchange risk because we have revenue and expense
denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the euro, the British pound, the Japanese yen and the Canadian dollar. To manage exchange rate risk, we attempt to execute both our international revenue and expense transactions in the same foreign
currency to the extent practicable. From time to time, we may also enter into foreign currency options and forward contracts.

In the
Merger, we assumed Northwest’s outstanding foreign currency derivative instruments. On the Closing Date, we designated certain of these derivative instruments, comprised of Japanese yen forward and collar

F-27


Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

contracts, as cash flow hedges under SFAS 133. The forward and collar contracts have an aggregate notional amount of 45 billion Japanese yen maturing monthly
between January 2009 and December 2009. As of December 31, 2008, we have hedged approximately 30% of anticipated 2009 yen-denominated cash flows from sales. These foreign currency derivative instruments had a fair value loss of $48 million,
which is recorded in hedge derivatives liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

We did not have any foreign currency hedge contracts
at December 31, 2007.

Credit Risk

To manage credit risk associated with our aircraft fuel price and interest rate hedging programs, we select counterparties based on their credit ratings and limit our exposure to any one counterparty. We also monitor the market position of
this program and our relative market position with each counterparty.

Due to the continued decline in crude oil prices during the December
2008 quarter, we realized a significant increase to our estimated fair value loss position on our fuel hedge contracts. Accordingly, counterparties required us to post $1.2 billion of fuel hedge margin, which is recorded in hedge margin receivable
on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2008.

Due to the significant changes in interest rates during the December 2008
quarter, our interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges were in a gain position. Accordingly, we required counterparties to post $91 million of margin associated with these agreements. The margin has been recorded to hedge margin
receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as a reduction to the fuel hedge margin counterparties required us to post.

Our accounts
receivable are generated largely from the sale of passenger airline tickets and cargo transportation services. The majority of these sales are processed through major credit card companies, resulting in accounts receivable that may be subject to
certain holdbacks by the credit card processors.

We also have receivables from the sale of mileage credits under our SkyMiles and
WorldPerks Programs to participating airlines and non-airline businesses such as credit card companies, hotels and car rental agencies. We believe the credit risk associated with these receivables is minimal and that the allowance for uncollectible
accounts that we have provided is appropriate.

Self-Insurance Risk

We self-insure a portion of our losses from claims related to workers’ compensation, environmental issues, property damage, medical insurance for
employees and general liability. Losses are accrued based on an estimate of the ultimate aggregate liability for claims incurred, using independent actuarial reviews based on standard industry practices and our historical experience. A portion of
our projected workers’ compensation liability is secured with restricted cash collateral.

NOTE 5. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

The following table reflects the change in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2008:

During the March 2008 quarter, we experienced a significant decline in market capitalization
driven primarily by record fuel prices and overall airline industry conditions. In addition, the announcement of our intention to merge with Northwest established a stock exchange ratio based on the relative valuation of Delta and Northwest
(see Note 2). We determined that these factors combined with further increases in fuel prices were an indicator that a goodwill impairment test was required pursuant to SFAS 142. As a result, we estimated fair value based on a discounted
projection of future cash flows, supported with a market-based valuation. We determined that goodwill was impaired and recorded a non-cash charge of $6.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. In estimating fair value, we based our
estimates and assumptions on the same valuation techniques employed and levels of inputs used to estimate the fair value of goodwill upon adoption of fresh start reporting.

In addition to the goodwill impairment charge, we recorded a non-cash charge of $357 million ($238 million after tax) for the year ended
December 31, 2008 to reduce the carrying value of certain intangible assets based on their revised estimated fair values. This charge was included in impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on our Consolidated Statement of Operations
for the year ended December 31, 2008. The following tables reflect the changes in the carrying amount of intangible assets at December 31, 2008:

Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

(1)

As a result of fresh start reporting upon emergence from bankruptcy, we recorded a $480 million indefinite-lived
intangible asset associated with our membership in SkyTeam, a global airline alliance, which includes Northwest, that permits carriers to retain their separate identities and route networks while increasing the number of domestic and international
connecting passengers using the carriers’ route networks. In connection with the impairment analysis performed during the June 2008 quarter, we recorded a non-cash charge of $199 million related to our SkyTeam alliance to reduce the carrying
values to their revised estimated fair values. Included within this amount is $103 million associated with the portion of our SkyTeam alliance agreements that is directly attributable to Northwest.

In December 2008, we announced a multi-year extension of our Co-brand Credit Card relationship with American
Express (the “American Express Agreement”). Accordingly, we extended the useful life of the American Express Agreement intangible asset to the date the contract expires.

Total amortization expense recognized for the year ended December 31, 2008, the eight months
ended December 31, 2007, the four months ended April 30, 2007 and the year ended December 31, 2006 was $207 million, $147 million, $1 million, and $1 million, respectively. The following table summarizes the expected amortization
expense for our definite-lived intangible assets:

NOTE 6. DEBT

The following table summarizes our debt at December 31, 2008 and 2007:

(1)

Our variable interest rate long-term debt is shown using interest rates which represent LIBOR or an index rate plus a
specified margin. The rates shown were in effect at December 31, 2008, if applicable.

(2)

On the Effective Date, we entered into a senior secured exit financing facility (the “Exit Facilities”) to
borrow up to $2.5 billion. For additional information, see “Delta Exit Financing” below.

(3)

In August 2006, Northwest entered into a $1.2 billion senior corporate credit facility (the “Bank Credit
Facility”). For additional information, see “Bank Credit Facility” below.

(4)

As of December 31, 2008, Delta has two outstanding financing arrangements with GECC referred to as the “Spare
Engines Loan” and the “Spare Parts Loan”. The Spare Engines Loan and the Spare Parts Loan are secured by certain spare Mainline aircraft engines (“Engine Collateral”) and certain Mainline aircraft spare parts that we own
(“Spare Parts Collateral”). The Engine Collateral and Spare Parts Collateral also secure leases for up to 22 CRJ-200 aircraft and, on a subordinated basis, certain other aircraft lease obligations to GECC and its affiliates. The Spare
Engines Loan is not repayable at our election prior to maturity.

(5)

As of December 31, 2008, the Certificates are secured by 148 aircraft. Included in the amount as of December 31,
2008 shown in the table is an aggregate of $1.3 billion in Certificates issued in 2007, which have a weighted average interest rate of 7.4%, are due in installments through 2022 and are collateralized by 36 aircraft.

(6)

In October 2008, Northwest entered into a $500 million revolving credit facility (the “$500 Million Revolving
Credit Facility”). For additional information, see “$500 Million Revolving Credit Facility” below.

(7)

As of December 31, 2008, we have $6.2 billion of secured loans secured by 285 aircraft, not including aircraft
securing the Certificates. During 2008, we entered into agreements to borrow up to $1.6 billion to finance the purchase of 35 aircraft. In 2008, we took delivery of and financed 23 aircraft.

(8)

In December 2008, we announced a multi-year extension of the American Express Agreement. As part of the American Express
Agreement, we received $1.0 billion from American Express for an advance purchase of SkyMiles, which amount is classified as long-term debt. This obligation will not be satisfied by cash payments, but through the purchases of SkyMiles by American
Express over an expected two year period beginning in December 2010.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

(9)

This item includes a reduction in the carrying value of (1) Northwest’s debt as a result of purchase
accounting related to the Merger and (2) the debt recorded in connection with the American Express Agreement. This item also includes fair value adjustments to our long-term debt in connection with our adoption of fresh start reporting upon our
emergence from bankruptcy. These adjustments will be amortized to interest expense over the remaining maturities of the respective debt.

Delta Exit Financing

The Exit Facilities consist of a $1.0 billion first-lien revolving credit facility (the
“Revolving Facility”), a $600 million first-lien synthetic revolving facility (the “Synthetic Facility”) (together with the Revolving Facility, the “First-Lien Facilities”), and a $900 million second-lien term loan
facility (the “Term Loan” or the “Second-Lien Facility”). During 2008, we borrowed the entire amount of the Revolving Facility. Borrowings under the First-Lien Facilities are due in April 2012 and borrowings under the Second-Lien
Facility are due in April 2014.

Our obligations under the Exit Facilities are guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic
subsidiaries, including, after the closing of the Merger, Northwest Airlines Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries (the “Guarantors”). The Exit Facilities and the related guarantees are secured by liens on substantially all of our
and the Guarantors’ present and future assets (excluding, in the case of Northwest Guarantors, assets subject to existing liens at the time of closing of the Merger) (the “Collateral”). The First-Lien Facilities are secured by a first
priority security interest in the Collateral. The Second-Lien Facility is secured by a second priority security interest in the Collateral.

The Exit Facilities include affirmative, negative and financial covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things, incur additional secured indebtedness, make investments, sell or otherwise dispose of assets if not in compliance
with the collateral coverage ratio tests, pay dividends or repurchase stock. These covenants may have a material adverse impact on our operations. The Exit Facilities contain financial covenants that require us to:

•

maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (defined as the ratio of (1) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and aircraft rent, and
subject to other adjustments to net income (“EBITDAR”) to (2) the sum of gross cash interest expense, cash aircraft rent expense and the interest portion of our capitalized lease obligations, for successive trailing 12-month periods
ending at each quarter-end date through the maturity date of the respective Exit Facilities), which minimum ratio will range from 1.00:1 to 1.20:1 in the case of the First-Lien Facilities and from 0.85:1 to 1.02:1 in the case of the Second-Lien
Facility;

•

maintain unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and permitted investments of not less than $750 million in the case of the First-Lien Facilities and $650 million in
the case of the Second-Lien Facility;

•

maintain a minimum total collateral coverage ratio (defined as the ratio of (1) certain of the Collateral that meets specified eligibility standards
(“Eligible Collateral”) to (2) the sum of the aggregate outstanding exposure under the First-Lien Facilities and the Second-Lien Facility and the aggregate termination value of certain hedging agreements) of 125% at all times; and

•

in the case of the First-Lien Facilities, also maintain a minimum first-lien collateral coverage ratio (together with the total collateral coverage ratio described
above, the “collateral coverage ratios”) (defined as the ratio of (1) Eligible Collateral to (2) the sum of the aggregate outstanding exposure under the First Lien Facilities and the aggregate termination value of certain hedging
agreements) of 175% at all times.

The Exit Facilities contain events of default customary for senior secured exit
financings, including cross-defaults to other material indebtedness and certain change of control events. The Exit Facilities also include events of default specific to our business, including the suspension of all or substantially all of our
flights and

F-32


Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

other operations for more than two consecutive days (other than as a result of a Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) suspension due to
extraordinary events similarly affecting other major U.S. air carriers). Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the outstanding obligations under the Exit Facilities may be accelerated and become due and payable immediately and our cash may
become restricted.

Bank Credit Facility

The Bank Credit Facility consisted of a $1.05 billion term loan facility and a $175 million revolving credit facility. On the date of the Merger, the outstanding term loan facility amount was $773 million and the outstanding revolving
credit facility amount was $131 million. The final maturity date of the Bank Credit Facility, as amended, is the earlier of (1) the date that Northwest Airlines, Inc. is no longer a separate legal entity and an operating airline, including when
it is merged with and into Delta Air Lines, Inc. or (2) December 31, 2010. The Bank Credit Facility is secured by a first lien on Northwest’s Pacific route authorities.

The Bank Credit Facility contains financial covenants that require Northwest to maintain (1) unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments of not less than $750 million, (2) a minimum total collateral coverage ratio (defined as the ratio of (i) the appraised value of the collateral to (ii) the sum of the aggregate outstanding exposure under the Bank Credit
Facility, the aggregate termination value of certain hedging agreements and certain pari passu obligations) of 150% and (3) a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, defined as the ratio of EBITDAR to consolidated fixed charges. Fixed charges are
defined as interest expense and aircraft rent expense (without giving effect to any acceleration of rental expense). Additionally, certain aircraft sublease rental income is excluded from EBITDAR and reduces aircraft rental expense in fixed charges.
Compliance by Northwest with this financial covenant has been waived through March 31, 2009 followed by a phase-in period as set forth below:

The Bank Credit Facility contains events of default that are customary for financings of its type,
including cross-defaults to other material indebtedness and maintenance of pledged slots and routes. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the outstanding obligations under the Bank Credit Facility may be accelerated and become due and payable
immediately.

$500 Million Revolving Credit Facility

The $500 Million Revolving Credit Facility matures at the earlier of (1) October 2009 (with respect to $300 million of such facility) or October 2011 (with respect to $200 million of such facility) or
(2) the date that Northwest Airlines, Inc. is no longer a separate legal entity and an operating airline, including when it is merged with and into Delta Air Lines, Inc. Borrowings under the $500 Million Revolving Credit Facility can be prepaid
without penalty and amounts prepaid can be reborrowed. Borrowings under the $500 Million Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by Northwest Airlines Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries. The $500 Million Revolving Credit Facility and
related guarantees are secured by substantially all of Northwest’s unencumbered assets as of October 29, 2008.

F-33


Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The $500 Million Revolving Credit Facility contains financial covenants that require Northwest to
maintain (1) unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, together with the undrawn amount of the $500 Million Revolving Credit Facility (“Cash Liquidity”), of not less than $1.25 billion, (2) a minimum
collateral coverage threshold (defined as the appraised value of certain eligible collateral) of not less than $625 million and (3) a minimum ratio of EBITDAR to consolidated fixed charges that is currently the same as the Bank Credit Facility.

The $500 Million Revolving Credit Facility contains events of default customary for financings of its type, including cross-defaults to
other material indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the outstanding obligations under the $500 Million Revolving Credit Facility may be accelerated and become due and payable immediately and our cash may become restricted.
Additionally, if at any time Cash Liquidity is less than $2.75 billion, the commitment of each lender under the $500 Million Revolving Credit Facility is reduced by 50%.

Other

The financing agreements of Delta and its subsidiaries contain certain affirmative,
negative and financial covenants. In addition, as is customary in the airline industry, the aircraft lease and financing agreements of Delta and its subsidiaries require that we maintain certain levels of insurance coverage, including war-risk
insurance. Failure to maintain these coverages may result in an interruption to our operations. For additional information about our war-risk insurance currently provided by the U.S. Government, see Note 8.

We were in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2008. Substantially all of our assets are subject to liens.

Future Maturities

The following table
summarizes scheduled maturities of our debt, including current maturities, at December 31, 2008:

The scheduled maturities of our debt under the Bank Credit Facility and any borrowings under the
$500 Million Revolving Credit Facility will be accelerated (as discussed above) when Northwest Airlines, Inc. is no longer a separate legal entity and an operating airline, including when it is merged with and into Delta Air Lines, Inc. The merger
of Northwest Airlines, Inc. into Delta Air Lines, Inc. is dependent on several factors, including but not limited to receiving a single operating certificate as granted by the FAA. Receiving such a certificate generally takes 12 to 24 months after
an acquisition. Currently, the receipt of the certificate and eventual merger into Delta Air Lines, Inc. are expected to occur in 2010. As a result, we have classified borrowings under the Bank Credit Facility as long-term on our Consolidated
Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2008.

NOTE 7. LEASE OBLIGATIONS

We lease aircraft, airport terminals and maintenance facilities, ticket offices and other property and equipment from third parties. Rental expense for operating leases, which is recorded on a straight-line basis over
the life of the lease term, totaled $850 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, $470 million for the eight months ended December 31, 2007, $261 million for the four months ended April 30, 2007 and $961 million for the year
ended December 31, 2006. Amounts due under capital leases are recorded as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our interest in assets acquired under capital leases is recorded as property and equipment on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets. Amortization of assets recorded under capital leases is included in depreciation and amortization expense on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Our leases do not include residual value guarantees.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

At December 31, 2008, we operated 258 aircraft under operating leases and 81 aircraft under
capital leases. Our contract carriers operated 443 aircraft under operating leases. Leases for aircraft operated by us and our contract carriers have expiration dates ranging from 2009 to 2025. During the four months ended April 30, 2007
and the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded estimated claims relating to the restructuring of the financing arrangements for many of our aircraft and the rejection of certain of our leases in connection with our bankruptcy proceedings.

NOTE 8. PURCHASE COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Aircraft Order Commitments

Future commitments for aircraft on firm order as of December 31, 2008 are estimated
to be approximately $2.9 billion. The following table shows the timing of these commitments:

Our aircraft order commitments as of December 31, 2008 consist of firm orders to purchase
eight B-777-200LR aircraft, five B-737-700 aircraft, 33 B-737-800 aircraft, two A320-200 aircraft, five A319-100 aircraft and 10 CRJ-900 aircraft.

We have excluded from the table above our order for 18 B-787-8 aircraft. The Boeing Company (“Boeing”) has informed us that Boeing will be unable to meet the contractual delivery schedule for these aircraft. We are in discussions
with Boeing regarding this situation.

Our firm orders to purchase 33 B-737-800 aircraft include 31 B-737-800 aircraft, which we have
entered into definitive agreements to sell to two third parties immediately following delivery of these aircraft to us by the manufacturer. We have not received any notice that these parties have defaulted on their purchase obligations. These sales
will reduce our future commitments by approximately $1.3 billion during the period from 2009 through 2011 ($490 million, $730 million and $40 million for 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively).

We have financing commitments from third parties, cancellation rights or, with respect to the 31 B-737-800 aircraft referred to above, definitive
agreements to sell, all Mainline and CRJ-900 aircraft on firm order as of December 31, 2008. Under these financing commitments, third parties have agreed to finance, on a long-term secured basis, a substantial portion of the purchase price of
the covered aircraft,

Our firm orders to purchase 10 CRJ-900 aircraft include two CRJ-900 aircraft, which we have assigned to a Contract
Carrier. We are required to cure any default by the Contract Carrier of its purchase obligation, and have certain indemnification rights against the Contract Carrier for costs incurred in effecting such a cure.

Contract Carrier Agreements

During the year
ended December 31, 2008, we had Contract Carrier agreements with 12 Contract Carriers, including our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Comair, Compass and Mesaba.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Capacity Purchase Agreements

. During the year ended December 31, 2008, seven Contract
Carriers operated for us (in addition to Comair, Compass and Mesaba) pursuant to capacity purchase agreements. Under these agreements, the Contract Carriers operate some or all of their aircraft using our flight designator codes, and we control the
scheduling, pricing, reservations, ticketing and seat inventories of those aircraft and retain the revenues associated with those flights. We pay those airlines an amount, as defined in the applicable agreement, which is based on a determination of
their cost of operating those flights and other factors intended to approximate market rates for those services.

The following table shows
our minimum fixed obligations under these capacity purchase agreements (excluding Comair, Compass and Mesaba). The obligations set forth in the table contemplate minimum levels of flying by the Contract Carriers under the respective agreements and
also reflect assumptions regarding certain costs associated with the minimum levels of flying such as for fuel, labor, maintenance, insurance, catering, property tax and landing fees. Accordingly, our actual payments under these agreements could
differ materially from the minimum fixed obligations set forth in the table below.

(1)

These amounts exclude contract carrier lease payments accounted for as operating leases, which are described in Note 7.
The contingencies described below under “Contingencies Related to Termination of Contract Carrier Agreements” are not included in this table.

The following table shows by Contract Carrier and contract (1) the number of aircraft in operation as of December 31, 2008, (2) the number of aircraft scheduled to be in operation as of
December 31, 2009, (3) the number of aircraft scheduled to be in operation immediately prior to the expiration date of the agreement and (4) the expiration date of the agreement:

The table above was not subject to the audit procedures of our Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm.

We have an agreement with ASA, SkyWest Airlines and SkyWest, Inc. (“SkyWest”), the parent company of ASA and
SkyWest Airlines, under which the parties collectively determine whether the aircraft are operated by ASA or SkyWest Airlines.

(2)

In March 2008, we issued a notice to Freedom to terminate, effective June 30, 2008, its ERJ-145 capacity purchase
agreement due to Freedom’s failure to meet certain minimum operational performance requirements under the agreement. Freedom filed a lawsuit against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia alleging, among other
things, that our termination of the agreement was wrongful. In May 2008, the District Court granted Freedom’s request for a preliminary injunction, temporarily enjoining us from terminating Freedom’s ERJ-145 capacity purchase agreement. We

Revenue Proration Agreements

. As of December 31, 2008, we had a revenue proration agreement with American
Eagle Airlines, Inc. In addition, a portion of our contract carrier agreement with SkyWest Airlines is structured as a revenue proration agreement. These agreements establish a fixed dollar or percentage division of revenues for tickets sold to
passengers traveling on connecting flight itineraries.

Contingencies Related to Termination of Contract Carrier Agreements

We may terminate the Chautauqua and Shuttle America agreements without cause at any time after May 2010 and July 2015, respectively, by providing certain
advance notice. If we terminate either the Chautauqua or Shuttle America agreements without cause, Chautauqua or Shuttle America, respectively, has the right to (1) assign to us leased aircraft that the airline operates for us, provided we are
able to continue the leases on the same terms the airline had prior to the assignment and (2) require us to purchase or lease any of the aircraft that the airline owns and operates for us at the time of the termination. If we are required to
purchase aircraft owned by Chautauqua or Shuttle America, the purchase price would be equal to the amount necessary to (1) reimburse Chautauqua or Shuttle America for the equity it provided to purchase the aircraft and (2) repay in full
any debt outstanding at such time that is not being assumed in connection with such purchase. If we are required to lease aircraft owned by Chautauqua or Shuttle America, the lease would have (1) a rate equal to the debt payments of Chautauqua
or Shuttle America for the debt financing of the aircraft calculated as if 90% of the aircraft was debt financed by Chautauqua or Shuttle America and (2) other specified terms and conditions.

We estimate that the total fair values, determined as of December 31, 2008, of the aircraft that Chautauqua or Shuttle America could assign to us or
require that we purchase if we terminate without cause our contract carrier agreements with those airlines (the “Put Right”) are approximately $255 million and $418 million,

F-38


Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

respectively. The actual amount that we may be required to pay in these circumstances may be materially different from these estimates. If the
Chautauqua or Shuttle America Put Right is exercised, we must also pay to the exercising carrier 10% interest (compounded monthly) on the equity the carrier provided when it purchased the put aircraft. These equity
amounts for Chautauqua and Shuttle America total $25 million and $62 million, respectively.

Legal Contingencies

We are involved in various legal proceedings relating to employment practices, environmental issues and other matters concerning our business. We cannot
reasonably estimate the potential loss for certain legal proceedings because, for example, the litigation is in its early stages or the plaintiff does not specify the damages being sought.

Cincinnati Airport Settlement

On April 24,
2007, the Bankruptcy Court approved our settlement agreement (the “Cincinnati Airport Settlement Agreement”) with the Kenton County Airport Board (“KCAB”) and UMB Bank, N.A., the trustee (the “Bond Trustee”) for the
Series 1992 Bonds (as defined below), to restructure certain of our lease and other obligations at the Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky International Airport (the “Cincinnati Airport”). The Series 1992 Bonds include: (1) the $419 million
Kenton County Airport Board Special Facilities Revenue Bonds, 1992 Series A (Delta Air Lines, Inc. Project), $397 million of which were then outstanding; and (2) the $19 million Kenton County Airport Board Special Facilities Revenue Bonds, 1992
Series B (Delta Air Lines, Inc. Project), $16 million of which were then outstanding.

The Cincinnati Airport Settlement Agreement, among
other things:

•

provides for agreements under which we will continue to use certain facilities at the Cincinnati Airport at substantially reduced costs;

•

settles all disputes among us, the KCAB, the Bond Trustee and the former, present and future holders of the 1992 Bonds (the “1992 Bondholders”);

•

gives the Bond Trustee, on behalf of the 1992 Bondholders, a $260 million allowed general, unsecured claim in our bankruptcy proceedings; and

•

provides for our issuance of $66 million principal amount of senior unsecured notes to the Bond Trustee on behalf of the 1992 Bondholders.

On May 3, 2007, the parties to the Cincinnati Airport Settlement Agreement implemented that agreement in accordance
with its terms. A small group of bondholders (the “Objecting Bondholders”) challenged the settlement in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. In August 2007, the District Court affirmed the Bankruptcy Court’s
order approving the settlement. The Objecting Bondholders appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which in February 2009 upheld the District Court’s decision. The Objecting Bondholders have filed a petition with the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit for a rehearing en banc.

Credit Card Processing Agreements

Visa/MasterCard Processing Agreement

In August 2008,
we entered into an amendment to our Visa/MasterCard credit card processing agreement (the “Amended Processing Agreement”) that, among other things, extended the term of the agreement to December 31, 2011. The Amended Processing
Agreement provides that no cash reserve (“Reserve”) is required except in certain circumstances, including in which we do not maintain a required level of unrestricted cash.

F-39


Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

In those circumstances where the processor can establish a Reserve, the amount of the Reserve would
be equal to the potential liability of the credit card processor for tickets purchased with Visa or MasterCard that had not yet been used for travel. There was no Reserve as of December 31, 2008 and 2007.

American Express

In December 2008, we amended
our American Express credit card processing agreement (the “Amended Card Service Agreement”). The Amended Card Service Agreement provides that no withholding of our receivables will occur except in certain circumstances, including in which
we do not maintain a required level of unrestricted cash. In those circumstances where American Express is permitted to withhold our receivables, the amount that can be withheld is an amount up to American Express’ potential liability for
tickets purchased with the American Express credit card that had not yet been used for travel. No amounts were withheld as of December 31, 2008 and 2007

.

Other Contingencies

General Indemnifications

We are the lessee under many commercial real estate leases. It is common in these transactions for us, as the lessee, to agree to indemnify the lessor and
the lessor’s related parties for tort, environmental and other liabilities that arise out of or relate to our use or occupancy of the leased premises. This type of indemnity would typically make us responsible to indemnified parties for
liabilities arising out of the conduct of, among others, contractors, licensees and invitees at or in connection with the use or occupancy of the leased premises. This indemnity often extends to related liabilities arising from the negligence of the
indemnified parties, but usually excludes any liabilities caused by either their sole or gross negligence and their willful misconduct.

Our aircraft and other equipment lease and financing agreements typically contain provisions requiring us, as the lessee or obligor, to indemnify the other parties to those agreements, including certain of those parties’ related
persons, against virtually any liabilities that might arise from the condition, use or operation of the aircraft or such other equipment.

We believe that our insurance would cover most of our exposure to such liabilities and related indemnities associated with the types of lease and financing agreements described above, including real estate leases. However, our insurance
does not typically cover environmental liabilities, although we have certain policies to meet the requirements of applicable environmental laws.

Certain of our aircraft and other financing transactions include provisions which require us to make payments to preserve an expected economic return to the lenders if that economic return is diminished due to certain changes in law or
regulations. In certain of these financing transactions, we also bear the risk of certain changes in tax laws that would subject payments to non-U.S. lenders to withholding taxes.

We cannot reasonably estimate our potential future payments under the indemnities and related provisions described above because we cannot predict
(1) when and under what circumstances these provisions may be triggered and (2) the amount that would be payable if the provisions were triggered because the amounts would be based on facts and circumstances existing at such time.

Employees Under Collective Bargaining Agreements

At December 31, 2008, we had 84,306 full-time equivalent employees. Approximately 42% of these employees, including all of our pilots, are represented by labor unions.

On February 26, 2009, the National Mediation Board accepted a request by the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association (“AMFA”) to terminate its
certification to represent pre-merger Northwest Airlines, Inc. aircraft maintenance technicians and related employees. Approximately 900 employees were represented by AMFA.

War-Risk Insurance Contingency

As a result of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001,
aviation insurers significantly reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for liability to persons (other than

F-40


Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

employees or passengers) for claims resulting from acts of terrorism, war or similar events. At the same time, aviation insurers significantly increased the
premiums for such coverage and for aviation insurance in general. Since September 24, 2001, the U.S. government has been providing U.S. airlines with war-risk insurance to cover losses, including those resulting from terrorism, to
passengers, third parties (ground damage) and the aircraft hull. The coverage currently extends through March 31, 2009, and the Secretary of Transportation has discretion to extend coverage through May 31, 2009. The withdrawal of
government support of airline war-risk insurance would require us to obtain war-risk insurance coverage commercially, if available. Such commercial insurance could have substantially less desirable coverage than currently provided by the U.S.
government, may not be adequate to protect our risk of loss from future acts of terrorism, may result in a material increase to our operating expense or may not be obtainable at all, resulting in an interruption to our operations.

Other

We have certain contracts for goods and
services that require us to pay a penalty, acquire inventory specific to us or purchase contract specific equipment, as defined by each respective contract, if we terminate the contract without cause prior to its expiration date. Because these
obligations are contingent on our termination of the contract without cause prior to its expiration date, no obligation would exist unless such a termination occurs.

NOTE 9. INCOME TAXES

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes. The following table shows significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2008 and 2007:

F-41


Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The following table shows the current and noncurrent deferred tax assets (liabilities), recorded on
our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2008 and 2007:

Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities, net

)

(855

Total deferred tax liabilities, net

$

(713

The current and noncurrent components of our deferred tax balances are generally based on the
balance sheet classification of the asset or liability creating the temporary difference. If the deferred tax asset or liability is not based on a component of our balance sheet, such as our net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards, the
classification is presented based on the expected reversal date of the temporary difference. Our valuation allowance has been classified as current or noncurrent based on the percentages of current and noncurrent deferred tax assets to total
deferred tax assets.

At December 31, 2008, we had (1) $505 million of federal alternative minimum tax (“AMT”) credit
carryforwards, which do not expire and (2) $14.5 billion of federal and state pretax NOL carryforwards, substantially all of which will not begin to expire until 2022.

Both Delta and Northwest realized a change of ownership for the purposes of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code as a result of the issuance of
new common stock upon their emergence from bankruptcy. We currently expect this change will not significantly limit our ability to utilize our AMT credit or NOLs in the carryforward period. On the Closing Date, as a result of the Merger, Northwest
experienced a subsequent ownership change. Delta also may experience a subsequent ownership change under Section 382 as a result of the Merger and the issuance of equity to employees in connection with the Merger, together with other
transactions involving the sale of our common stock. If the change is determined to have occurred in 2008, we do not expect that this change will significantly limit our ability to utilize our NOLs in the carryforward period.

FIN 48

We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48,
“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109,” on January 1, 2007 to evaluate our uncertain tax positions. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits on the Consolidated Balance Sheet
at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 are $29 million and $143 million, respectively. This includes $10 million of tax benefits as of December 31, 2008 and $38 million of tax benefits as of December 31, 2007, that if
recognized subsequent to December 31, 2008, will affect the effective tax rate.

We accrue interest related to unrecognized tax
benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expense. At December 31, 2008, we have accrued $5 million for the payment of interest and $8 million for the payment of penalties. The impact related to interest and penalties on our
Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 was not material.

We are currently under the audit by the
IRS for the 2005 through 2007 tax years. The audit is substantially complete and is expected to close in early 2009.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The following table summarizes the changes to the amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the year
ended December 31, 2008, the eight months ended December 31, 2007 and the four months ended April 30, 2007:

Valuation Allowance

SFAS 109 requires us to periodically assess whether it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets. In making this determination, we consider all
available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions. We consider, among other things, our deferred tax liabilities, the overall business environment, our historical earnings and losses, our industry’s historically cyclical
periods of earnings and losses and potential, current and future tax planning strategies. We cannot presently determine when we will be able to generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets.

Upon emergence from bankruptcy, we recorded a valuation allowance of $4.8 billion on our Fresh Start Consolidated Balance Sheet. On the Closing Date of
the Merger in accordance with purchase accounting, we recorded a valuation allowance of $2.7 billion related to Northwest deferred tax assets. Prior to January 1, 2009, any reduction in the valuation allowance as a result of the recognition of
deferred tax assets is adjusted through goodwill, followed by other indefinite lived intangible assets until the net carrying costs of these assets is zero. Beginning January 1, 2009, pursuant to SFAS 141R, any reduction in this valuation
allowance will be reflected through the income tax provision.

Our income tax benefit (provision) for the year ended December 31,
2008, the eight months ended December 31, 2007, the four months ended April 30, 2007 and the year ended December 31, 2006 consisted of:

NOTE 10. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

We sponsor defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, postretirement healthcare plans, and disability and survivorship plans for eligible employees and retirees, and their eligible family members.

Northwest Merger

In accordance
with SFAS 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions” (“SFAS 87”) and SFAS 106, “Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions” (“SFAS 106”), when an employer is acquired in a
merger, any excess of projected benefit obligation over the plan assets is recognized as a liability and any excess of plan assets over the projected benefit obligation is recognized as a plan asset. The recognition of a new liability or a new asset
by the acquirer, at the date of the merger, results in the elimination of any (1) previously existing unrecognized net gain or loss, (2) unrecognized prior service cost and (3) unrecognized net transition obligation. In addition, the
new liability or asset is measured using actuarial assumptions, as determined by the purchaser. All significant weighted-average assumptions used were determined based on our policies that are discussed below in “Assumptions.”

Defined Benefit Pension, Other Postretirement, and Postemployment Benefit Plans

Defined Benefit Pension Plans.

We sponsor a defined benefit pension plan for eligible non-pilot Delta employees and retirees (the “Delta
Non-Pilot Plan”) and defined benefit pension plans for eligible Northwest employees and retirees (the “Northwest Pension Plans”). These plans have been closed to new entrants and frozen for future benefit accruals.

The Pension Protection Act of 2006 allows commercial airlines to elect alternative funding rules (“Alternative Funding Rules”) for defined
benefit plans that are frozen. Under the Alternative Funding Rules, the unfunded liability for a frozen defined benefit plan may be amortized over a fixed 17-year period and is calculated using an 8.85% interest rate. Delta elected the Alternative
Funding Rules for the Delta Non-Pilot Plan, effective April 1, 2007 and Northwest elected the Alternative Funding Rules for the Northwest Pension Plans effective October 1, 2006. We estimate that the funding requirements under these plans
will be approximately $275 million in 2009.

Defined Contribution Pension Plans.

Prior to the Merger, both Delta and Northwest
sponsored several defined contribution plans and we continue to sponsor all of those plans. These plans each generally cover different employee groups at Delta and Northwest, and employer contributions vary by each plan. The cost associated with our
defined contribution pension plans is reflected in the tables below.

F-44


Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Postretirement Healthcare Plans.

We sponsor healthcare plans that provide benefits to eligible
retirees and their dependents who are under age 65. During bankruptcy, we generally eliminated company-paid post age 65 healthcare coverage, except for (1) limited subsidies available to a limited group of retirees and their dependents and
(2) a group of retirees who retired prior to 1987 and receive lifetime company-paid medical and dental benefits. Benefits under these plans are funded from our current assets and are subject to co-payments, deductibles and other limits as
described in the plans.

Postemployment Plans.

We provide certain other welfare benefits to eligible former or inactive employees
after employment, but before retirement, primarily as part of the disability and survivorship plans. These disability and survivorship plans provide benefits to substantially all Delta employees and Northwest pilots as a result of a
participant’s death or disability.

SFAS 158.

On December 31, 2006, we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions
of SFAS No. 158 “Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of SFAS Nos. 87, 88, 106, 132(R)” (“SFAS 158”). SFAS 158 required that we recognize the funded status of our
defined benefit pension plans, other postretirement plans, and certain of our postemployment plans on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2006. Because the requirement to measure the funded status of a plan as of our year-end was
not effective for the year ended December 31, 2006, we continued to measure our benefit plans with a September 30 measurement date. As of April 30, 2007, we adopted the provision requiring year-end measurement, which eliminated our
early measurement date. The impact of the elimination of our early measurement date is reflected in the table below.

periodic benefit cost in 2009 are actuarial losses of $33 million and $18 million in pension and other postemployment benefits, respectively, and an actuarial gain of $18 million relating to other postretirement benefits.

Net periodic cost (benefit) for the year ended December 31, 2008, the eight months ended December 31, 2007, the four months ended
April 30, 2007 and the year ended December 31, 2006 included the following components:

Assumptions

We used the following actuarial assumptions to determine our benefit obligations at December 31, 2008, December 31, 2007 and April 30, 2007 and our net periodic (benefit) cost for the periods
presented:

(1)

Our 2008 and 2007 benefit obligations are measured using the RP 2000 combined healthy mortality table projected to 2013
and 2010, respectively.

(2)

Not applicable to frozen defined benefit pension plans or other postretirement benefit plans.

(3)

The assumed healthcare cost trend rate at December 31, 2008 is assumed to decline gradually to 5.00% by 2015 and
remain level thereafter.

(4)

Our 2008, 2007 and 2006 assumptions reflect various remeasurements of certain portions of our obligations and represent
the weighted average of the assumptions used for each measurement date.

Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have an
effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans. A 1% change in the healthcare cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated plan benefit obligation (“APBO”) for these plans at December 31, 2008, would
have the following effects:

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was based on plan-specific investment studies
using historical market return and volatility data with forward looking estimates based on existing financial market conditions and forecasts. Modest excess return expectations versus some market indices were incorporated into the return projections
based on the actively managed structure of the investment programs and their records of achieving such returns historically. We review our rate of return on plan asset assumptions annually. These assumptions are largely based on the asset category
rate-of-return assumptions developed annually with our pension investment advisors. The advisors’ asset category return assumptions are based in part on a review of historical asset returns, but also emphasize current market conditions to
develop estimates of future risk and return.

F-49


Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Pension Plan Assets

Delta and Northwest have adopted and implemented investment policies for their defined benefit pension plans that incorporate strategic asset allocation mixes intended to best meet their long-term pension obligations.
This asset allocation policy mix is reviewed every 2-5 years or earlier as deemed necessary. On a regular basis, actual asset allocations are rebalanced toward the prevailing targets. The targeted and actual weighted-average asset allocations for
the pension plans at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 are as follows:

The investment strategies for pension plan assets are to utilize a diversified mix of global
public and private equity portfolios, public and private fixed income portfolios, and private real estate and natural resource investments. The overall asset mix of the portfolios is more heavily weighted in equity-like investments, including
portions of the bond portfolio, which consist of convertible and high yield securities. Active management strategies are utilized where feasible in an effort to realize investment returns in excess of market indices. Also, currency overlay strategy
is used in an effort to generate modest amounts of additional income. A bond duration extension program utilizing fixed income derivatives is employed in an effort to better align the market value movements of a portion of the pension plan assets to
the related pension plan liabilities.

Benefit Payments

Benefit payments in the table below are based on the same assumptions used to measure the related benefit obligations and are paid from both funded benefit plan trusts and current assets. Actual benefit payments may
vary significantly from these estimates. Benefits earned under our pension plans and certain postemployment benefit plans are expected to be paid from funded benefit plan trusts, while our other postretirement benefits are funded from current
assets.

The following table summarizes, as of December 31, 2008, the benefit payments that are scheduled to be paid in the following
years ending December 31:

Other Plans

We also sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees in certain foreign countries. These plans did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements in any period presented.

Profit Sharing Program

Our
broad based employee profit sharing program provides that, for each year in which we have an annual pre-tax profit, as defined, we will pay at least 15% of that profit to employees. If the annual pre-tax profit is greater than $2.5 billion, we will
pay 20% of the amount that exceeds $2.5 billion. Based on our pre-tax earnings, we accrued $158 million under the profit sharing program in 2007. We did not record an accrual under the profit sharing program in 2008.

NOTE 11. CHAPTER 11 PROCEEDINGS

Bankruptcy Claims Resolution

Under Delta’s Plan of Reorganization, most holders of allowed general, unsecured claims against the Delta Debtors received or
will receive Delta common stock in satisfaction of their claims. Delta’s Plan of Reorganization contemplates the distribution of 400 million shares of common stock. As of February 18, 2009, under Delta’s Plan of Reorganization,
we have (1) distributed 321 million shares of common stock to holders of $13.5 billion of allowed general, unsecured claims, (2) issued 14 million shares of common stock to eligible non-contract, non-management employees and
(3) reserved 65 million shares of common stock for future issuance to holders of allowed general, unsecured claims.

Northwest’s Plan of Reorganization generally provides for the distribution of Northwest common stock to the Northwest Debtors’ creditors, employees and others in satisfaction of allowed general, unsecured claims. Pursuant to the
Merger Agreement, and as discussed in Note 2, each outstanding share of Northwest common stock (including shares issuable pursuant to Northwest’s Plan of Reorganization) was converted into the right to receive 1.25 shares of Delta common stock.
As of February 18, 2009, eight million shares of Delta common stock were reserved for issuance in exchange for shares of Northwest common stock that, but for the Merger, would have been issued under Northwest’s Plan of Reorganization.

The Delta Debtors and the Northwest Debtors will continue to settle claims and file objections with the Bankruptcy Courts regarding
claims. In light of the substantial number and amount of claims filed, we expect the claims resolution process will take considerable time to complete. We believe there will be no further material impact to the Consolidated Statements of Operations
from the settlement of claims because the holders of such claims will receive under Delta’s and Northwest’s Plan of Reorganization (collectively, the “Plans of Reorganizations”), as the case may be, only their pro rata share of
the distributions of common stock contemplated by the Plans of Reorganization.

Reorganization Items, net

The following table summarizes the components of reorganization items, net on our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the four months ended April 30, 2007 and the year ended December 31, 2006:

(1)

The discharge of claims and liabilities primarily relates to allowed general, unsecured claims in our Chapter 11
proceedings, such as (a) ALPA’s claim under our comprehensive agreement reducing pilot labor costs; (b) the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation’s (the “PBGC”) claim relating to the termination of the Delta Pilot Plan;
(c) claims relating to changes in postretirement healthcare benefits and the rejection of our non-qualified retirement plans; (d) claims associated with debt and certain municipal bond obligations based upon their rejection;
(e) claims relating to the restructuring of financing arrangements or the rejection of leases for aircraft; and (f) other claims due to the rejection or modification of certain executory contracts, unexpired leases and contract carrier
agreements.

In accordance with Delta’s Plan of Reorganization, we discharged our obligations to holders of allowed general, unsecured claims in exchange for the distribution of
386 million newly issued shares of common stock and the issuance of certain debt securities and obligations. Accordingly, in discharging our liabilities subject to compromise, we recognized a reorganization gain of $4.4 billion as follows:

(2)

We revalued our SkyMiles frequent flyer obligation at fair value as a result of fresh start reporting, which resulted in
a $2.6 billion reorganization charge.

(3)

We revalued our assets and liabilities at estimated fair value as a result of fresh start reporting. This resulted in a
$238 million gain, primarily reflecting the fair value of newly recognized intangible assets, which was partially offset by reductions in the fair value of tangible property and equipment.

(4)

Estimated claims for the four months ended April 30, 2007 relate to the restructuring of the financing arrangements
for 143 aircraft, the rejection of two aircraft leases and adjustments to prior claims estimates. Estimated claims for the year ended December 31, 2006 relate to the restructuring of the financing arrangements for 188 aircraft and the
rejection of 16 aircraft leases.

to our surrender of warrants to purchase up to 3.5 million shares of Republic Holdings common stock. Additionally, in connection with an amendment to our contract carrier agreement with Freedom, a subsidiary of Mesa Air Group, Inc., which,
among other things, reduced the rates we pay that carrier, we recorded a $35 million allowed general, unsecured claim.

(6)

In accordance with Delta’s Plan of Reorganization, we made $130 million in lump-sum cash payments to approximately
39,000 eligible non-contract, non-management employees. We also recorded an additional charge of $32 million related to our portion of payroll related taxes associated with the issuance, as contemplated by Delta’s Plan of
Reorganization, of approximately 14 million shares of common stock to these employees.

Allowed general, unsecured claims of $83 million for the four months ended April 30, 2007 and $2.1 billion for the

For the four months ended April 30, 2007, we recorded a net $43 million gain, primarily reflecting a $126 million
net gain in connection with our settlement agreement with the Massachusetts Port Authority, which was partially offset by a net $80 million charge from an allowed general, unsecured claim under the Cincinnati Airport Settlement Agreement.

Allowed general, unsecured claims in connection with agreements reached with committees representing pilot and non-pilot
retired employees reducing their postretirement healthcare benefits.

(12)

$2.2 billion and $801 million allowed general, unsecured claims in connection with our settlement agreements with the
PBGC and a group representing retired pilots, respectively. Charges for these claims were offset by $1.3 billion in settlement gains associated with the derecognition of previously recorded Delta Pilot Plan and pilot non-qualified plan obligations
upon each plan’s termination.

Fresh Start Consolidated Balance Sheet

Upon emergence from Chapter 11, we adopted fresh start reporting, which required us to revalue our assets and liabilities to fair value. In estimating
fair value, we based the estimates and assumptions on guidance prescribed by SFAS No. 157. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair value measurements.

To facilitate the calculation of the enterprise value of the Successor, management developed financial projections for the Successor using a number of
estimates and assumptions. The enterprise and corresponding reorganization value of the Successor was based on financial projections using various valuation methods, including (1) a comparison of our projected performance to the market values
of comparable companies, (2) a review and analysis of several recent transactions in the airline industry and (3) a calculation of the present value of future cash flows based on our projections. Utilizing these methodologies, the
reorganization value of the Successor was estimated to be in the range of $9.4 billion and $12.0 billion. The enterprise value, and corresponding reorganization value, was dependent upon achieving the future financial results set forth in our
projections, as well as the realization of certain other assumptions. There can be no assurance the projections will be achieved or the assumptions will be realized. The excess reorganization value (using the low end of the range) over the fair
value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets, net of liabilities, was not reflected as goodwill in the Fresh Start Consolidated Balance Sheet. The financial projections and estimates of enterprise and reorganization value are not
incorporated in this Form 10-K.

All estimates, assumptions and financial projections, including the fair value adjustments, the financial
projections and the enterprise and reorganization value projections, are subject to significant uncertainties and the resolution of contingencies beyond our control. Accordingly, there can be no assurance the estimates, assumptions and financial
projections will be realized, and actual results could vary materially.

The adjustments set forth in the following Fresh Start
Consolidated Balance Sheet in the columns captioned “Debt Discharge, Reclassifications and Distribution to Creditors,” “Repayment of Debtor-in-Possession (“DIP”) Facility and New Exit Financing” and “Revaluation of
Assets and Liabilities” reflect the effect of the

consummation of the transactions contemplated by Delta’s Plan of Reorganization, including the settlement of various liabilities, securities issuances,
incurrence of new indebtedness and cash payments.

The effects of Delta’s Plan of Reorganization and fresh start reporting on our
Consolidated Balance Sheet at April 30, 2007 are as follows:

•

Debt Discharge, Reclassifications and Distribution to Creditors

. Adjustments reflect the elimination of liabilities subject to compromise totaling $19.3
billion on our Consolidated Balance Sheet immediately prior to the Effective Date. Excluding certain liabilities assumed by the Successor, liabilities subject to compromise of $13.8 billion were discharged in the Chapter 11 cases. Adjustments
include:

(a)

The recognition or reinstatement of $561 million to accounts payable, accrued salaries and related benefits comprised of (1) a $225 million obligation to the PBGC relating to
the termination of the Delta Pilot Plan (which is reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet net of a $3 million discount) and (2) $339 million to reinstate or accrue certain liabilities related to the current portion of our pension and
postretirement benefit plans and for certain administrative claims and cure costs.

(b)

The recognition of $697 million in other notes payable comprised of (1) a $650 million obligation relating to our comprehensive agreement with ALPA reducing pilot labor costs
(which is reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet net of a $19 million discount) and (2) $66 million principal amount of senior unsecured notes (following the reduction of the $85 million face value of the notes for the application of
certain payments made by us in 2006 and 2007) under the Cincinnati Airport Settlement Agreement.

(c)

The reinstatement of $4.2 billion to pension, postretirement and related benefits comprised of (1) $3.2 billion associated with the Delta Non-Pilot Plan and other long-term
accrued benefits and (2) $1.0 billion associated with postretirement benefits.

•

Repayment of DIP Facility and New Exit Financing

. Adjustments reflect the repayment of the DIP Facility and borrowing under the Exit Facilities. Financing
fees related to (1) the DIP Facility were written off at the Effective Date and (2) fees related to the Exit Facilities were capitalized and will be amortized over the term of the facility.

•

Revaluation of Assets and Liabilities

. Significant adjustments reflected in the Fresh Start Consolidated Balance Sheet based on the revaluation of assets and
liabilities are summarized as follows:

(a)

Property and equipment, net

. A net adjustment of $1.0 billion to reduce the net book value of fixed assets to their estimated fair value.

(b)

Goodwill

. An adjustment of $12.1 billion to reflect reorganization value of the Successor in excess of the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets, net of
liabilities. During 2007, goodwill decreased by $149 million as a result of net adjustments in the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. These adjustments were recorded on the Successor’s opening balance sheet at May 1, 2007.

(c)

Intangibles

. An adjustment of $2.9 billion to recognize identifiable intangible assets. These intangible assets reflect the estimated fair value of our trade name, takeoff
and arrival slots, SkyTeam alliance agreements, marketing agreements, customer relationships and certain contracts. Certain of these assets will be subject to an annual impairment review.

(d)

Long-term debt and capital leases

. An adjustment of $398 million primarily to reflect a $223 million net premium associated with long-term debt and a $138 million net premium
associated with capital lease obligations to be amortized to interest expense over the life of such debt and capital lease obligations.

(e)

SkyMiles deferred revenue

. An adjustment to revalue our obligation under the SkyMiles Program to reflect the estimated fair value of miles to be redeemed in
the future. Adjustments of $620 million and $2.0 billion were reflected for the fair value of these miles in current and long-term classifications, respectively. Effective with our emergence from bankruptcy, we changed our accounting policy from an
incremental cost basis to a deferred revenue model for miles earned

through travel. The fair value of our SkyMiles frequent flyer award liability was determined based on the estimated price that third parties would require us
to pay for them to assume the obligation for miles expected to be redeemed under the SkyMiles Program. This estimated price was determined based on the weighted-average equivalent ticket value of a SkyMiles award redeemed for travel on Delta or a
participating airline. The weighted-average equivalent ticket value contemplates differing classes of service, domestic and international itineraries and the carrier providing the award travel. At April 30, 2007, we recorded deferred revenue
equal to $0.0083 for each mile we estimate will ultimately be redeemed under the SkyMiles Program.

(f)

Noncurrent liabilities—other

. An adjustment of $1.2 billion primarily related to the tax effect of fresh start valuation adjustments.

(g)

Total stockholders’ deficit

. The adoption of fresh start reporting resulted in a new reporting entity with no beginning retained earnings or accumulated deficit. All
common stock of the Predecessor was eliminated and replaced by the new equity structure of the Successor based on Delta’s Plan of Reorganization. The Fresh Start Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects initial stockholders’ equity value of
$9.4 billion, representing the low end in the range of $9.4 billion to $12.0 billion estimated in our financial projections developed in connection with Delta’s Plan of Reorganization. The low end of the range is estimated to reflect market
conditions as of the Effective Date and therefore was used to establish initial stockholders’ equity value.

Note 12. Equity and
Equity-Based Compensation

Equity

Common Stock.

On the Effective Date, all common stock issued by the Predecessor was cancelled. In connection with our emergence from bankruptcy, we began issuing shares of new common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, pursuant to
Delta’s Plan of Reorganization. The new common stock is subject to the terms of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “New Certificate”), which supersedes the Certificate of Incorporation in effect prior to the
Effective Date.

The New Certificate authorizes us to issue a total of 2.0 billion shares of capital stock, of which 1.5 billion may be
shares of common stock and 500 million may be shares of preferred stock. Delta’s Plan of Reorganization contemplates the issuance of 400 million shares of common stock, consisting of 386 million shares to holders of allowed
general, unsecured claims and up to 14 million shares to approximately 39,000 non-contract, non-management employees under the Delta Air Lines, Inc. 2007 Performance Compensation Plan (the “2007 Plan”). Delta’s Plan of
Reorganization also contemplates the issuance of common stock under the 2007 Plan for management employees.

In connection with the Merger,
we issued, or expect to issue, a total of 339 million shares of Delta common stock in exchange for the Northwest common stock outstanding on the Closing Date or issuable under Northwest’s Plan of Reorganization. Additionally, in connection
with the Merger, we (1) agreed to issue 50 million shares of common stock to eligible Delta and Northwest pilots; (2) granted 34 million shares of common stock to substantially all U.S. based non-pilot employees of Delta and
Northwest; and (3) granted 17 million shares of restricted stock and non-qualified stock options to purchase 12 million shares of common stock to management personnel. The awards to management personnel will fully vest over
approximately three years, subject to the participant’s continued employment.

Preferred Stock.

The New Certificate permits us
to issue preferred stock in one or more series. It authorizes the Board of Directors (1) to fix the descriptions, powers (including voting powers), preferences, rights, qualifications, limitations and restrictions with respect to any series of
preferred stock and (2) to specify the number of shares of any series of preferred stock. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, no preferred stock was issued and outstanding.

F-56

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Treasury Stock.

We generally withhold shares of Delta common stock to cover employees’
portion of required tax withholdings when employee equity awards are issued or vest. These shares are valued at cost, which equals the market price of the common stock on the date of issuance or vesting. In December 2008, we sold from treasury
approximately 18 million shares of our common stock that were previously withheld as the employee portion of tax withholdings on the issuance and vesting of employee equity awards in connection with the Merger. The $192 million of net
proceeds from the offering will be used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2008, there were approximately eight million shares of common stock held in treasury at a weighted average cost of $20.11 per share. Substantially all of
these shares were withheld to cover the employees’ portion of required tax withholdings on equity awards.

Equity-Based Compensation

Successor

Upon emergence from Chapter
11, we adopted with Bankruptcy Court approval the 2007 Plan, a broad based equity and cash compensation plan. The 2007 Plan provides for grants of restricted stock, stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, performance
awards, including cash incentive awards, and other stock based awards. Shares of common stock issued under the 2007 Plan may be made available from authorized but unissued common stock or common stock we acquire. If any shares of our common stock
are covered by an award that is cancelled, forfeited or otherwise terminates without delivery of shares (including shares surrendered or withheld for payment of the exercise price of an award or taxes related to an award), then such shares will
again be available for issuance under the 2007 Plan. In connection with the Merger, we amended the 2007 Plan with stockholder approval to increase the number of shares of Delta common stock issuable under the plan from 30 million to
157 million. The purpose of this amendment was to permit Delta to grant equity to substantially all employees of the combined company in connection with the Merger. As of December 31, 2008, 36 million shares remain available for
future grants under the 2007 Plan.

Under SFAS 123R, non-cash compensation expense for equity awards is recognized over the employee’s
requisite service period (generally, the vesting period of the award). We use straight-line recognition for awards with installment vesting, as allowed under SFAS 123R. During the year ended December 31, 2008 and the eight months ended
December 31, 2007, we recognized expense associated with restricted stock, stock option, and performance share grants of $66 million and $109 million in salaries and related costs, respectively. Additionally, the closing of the Merger
constituted a change in control under the 2007 Plan, which caused the vesting of substantially all previously unvested equity awards and resulted in the recording of $75 million in expense to restructuring and merger-related items. These expenses do
not represent cash payments actually made to employees; rather it represents non-cash compensation expense for financial reporting purposes. The actual value of these awards to the recipients depends on the price of Delta common stock when the
awards vest.

As of December 31, 2008, approximately $187 million of total unrecognized costs related to unvested shares and options
are expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average period of 1.3 years. Approximately $83 million is expected to be recognized in 2009.

Stock Grants.

In connection with the Merger, we granted equity to substantially all employees of Delta and Northwest. U.S. based non-pilot, non-management employees received 34 million shares of common
stock. Pilot employees were granted the right to receive 50 million shares of common stock. The fair value of these grants was based on the closing price of the common stock on the date of grant and resulted in the recording of a $791 million
charge in restructuring and merger-related items. In 2007, upon emergence from Chapter 11, we issued 14 million shares of common stock to non-contract, non-management employees. Employees may hold or sell these shares without restriction.

Merger Awards.

In connection with the Merger, we made grants of restricted stock and stock options to approximately 700 management
level employees under the 2007 Plan. As discussed below, these grants vest over three years, subject to the employee’s continued employment.

F-57


Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Restricted Stock

. Restricted stock is common stock that may not be sold or otherwise
transferred for a period of time and that is subject to forfeiture in certain circumstances. The fair value of the restricted stock awards is based on the closing price of the common stock on the date of grant. In connection with the Merger, we
granted 17 million shares of restricted stock, which, subject to the employee’s continued employment, vest over three years in four installments (20% on May 1, 2009, 20% on November 1, 2009, 20% on May 1, 2010, and 40% on
November 1, 2011). Upon emergence from Chapter 11, we granted eight million shares of restricted stock to eligible employees. Substantially all of these awards, to the extent not previously vested, vested upon the closing of the Merger. We
expect substantially all unvested restricted stock awards at December 31, 2008 to vest during the vesting period.

The following table
summarizes restricted stock activity for the year ended December 31, 2008:

Stock Options.

Stock option awards are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing
price of Delta common stock on the date of grant. Generally, outstanding employee options vest over several years and have a 10-year term, subject to the employee’s continued employment.

The fair value of stock options is determined at the grant date using an options pricing model based on several assumptions. The risk-free rate is based
on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect for the expected term of the options at the time of grant. The dividend yield on our common stock is assumed to be zero since we do not pay dividends and have no current plans to do so. Due to the impact of our
Chapter 11 proceedings, our historical volatility data and employee stock option exercise patterns were not considered in determining the volatility and expected life assumptions. Prior to the Merger, volatility assumptions were based on
(1) historical volatilities of the stock of comparable airlines whose shares are traded using daily stock price returns equivalent to the expected term of the options and (2) implied volatilities. We no longer consider implied volatilities
in setting our expected volatility assumptions, as we believe due to current market conditions implied volatility is no longer a reasonable indicator of future volatility of Delta common stock. The expected life of the options was developed using
the simplified assumption that the option will be exercised evenly from the time it becomes exercisable to expiration, as allowed by Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, “Share Based Payments.”

In connection with the Merger, we granted stock options to purchase 12 million shares of common stock. These options become exercisable in four
installments (20% on May 1, 2009, 20% on November 1, 2009, 20% on May 1, 2010, and 40% on November 1, 2011), subject to the employee’s continued employment. Upon emergence from Chapter 11, we granted options to purchase four
million shares of common stock to eligible employees. Substantially all of these awards, to the extent not previously exercisable, became exercisable upon the closing of the Merger. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, outstanding stock options under
the Northwest 2007 Stock Incentive Plan were assumed by Delta and modified to provide for the purchase of Delta common stock. Accordingly, the number of shares and the exercise price were adjusted for the 1.25 exchange ratio.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The weighted average fair value of options was determined based on the following assumptions:

The following table summarizes stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2008:

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during the year ended
December 31, 2008 and the eight months ended December 31, 2007 was $4.86 and $10.82, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the year ended December 31, 2008 was $0.1 million and Delta received $0.4 million
in cash from the exercise of those options. No options were exercised during the eight months ended December 31, 2007.

Performance
Shares.

Performance shares are long-term incentive opportunities which are payable in common stock and are generally contingent upon our achieving certain financial goals. During 2008 and 2007, we granted performance shares with an aggregate
target payout opportunity covering approximately two million shares of common stock. The closing of the Merger caused the vesting at target of substantially all previously unvested performance shares.

Note 14. Geographic Information

SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,” requires us to disclose certain information about our
operating segments. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise with separate financial information which are evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker and are used in resource allocation and performance
assessments.

F-60


Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

We are managed as a single business unit that provides air transportation for passengers and cargo.
This allows us to benefit from an integrated revenue pricing and route network. Our flight equipment forms one fleet, which is deployed through a single route scheduling system. When making resource allocation decisions, our chief operating decision
maker evaluates flight profitability data, which considers aircraft type and route economics, but gives no weight to the financial impact of the resource allocation decision on an individual carrier basis. Our objective in making resource allocation
decisions is to optimize our consolidated financial results.

Operating revenue is assigned to a specific geographic region based on the
origin, flight path and destination of each flight segment. Our operating revenue by geographic region for the year ended December 31, 2008, the eight months ended December 31, 2007, the four months ended April 30, 2007 and the year
ended December 31, 2006 are summarized in the following table:

Our tangible assets consist primarily of flight equipment, which is mobile across geographic
markets. Accordingly, assets are not allocated to specific geographic regions.

The following table shows charges recorded in restructuring and merger-related items on our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended
December 31, 2008:

(1)

Relates to two voluntary workforce reduction programs for U.S. non-pilot employees announced in March 2008 in which
approximately 4,200 employees elected to participate. These programs were intended to align staffing with planned capacity reductions.

(2)

Relates to the early termination of certain capacity purchase agreements with our Contract Carriers.

(3)

Primarily relates to the closing of operations in Concourse C at the Cincinnati Airport. Upon our exit from Concourse C,
we recorded a one-time charge of $18 million based on the estimated present value of future rents.

(4)

Includes a one-time primarily non-cash charge of $907 million relating to the issuance or vesting of employee equity
awards in connection with the Merger.

F-61


Index to Financial Statements

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The following table shows the balances for these restructuring charges as of December 31, 2008,
and the activity for the year then ended:

In December 2008, we announced additional voluntary workforce reduction programs for U.S.
non-pilot employees to align staffing with planned capacity reductions. Approximately 47,000 employees were eligible for these programs by notifying us of their decision to participate in the period which began in January 2009 and ended in February
2009 (the “Election Period”). We did not record any charge for these programs at December 31, 2008 because we could not reasonably estimate on that date who would elect to participate in the programs. During the Election Period,
approximately 2,100 employees decided to participate. Accordingly, we expect to record between $40 million and $50 million in restructuring charges during the March 2009 quarter for these programs.

In 2007, we did not have any restructuring and merger-related items. In 2006, we recorded a $13 million charge in restructuring and merger-related items
on our Consolidated Statement of Operations. This charge was primarily due to a $29 million charge related to our decision to reduce staffing by approximately 7,000 to 9,000 jobs by December 2007, partially offset by a $21 million reduction in
accruals associated with prior year workforce reduction programs.

Note 16. (Loss) Earnings Per Share

We calculate basic (loss) earnings per share by dividing the net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding. In accordance with SFAS No. 128, “Earnings per Share,” shares issuable upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, such as shares issuable under Delta’s Plan of Reorganization and in connection with
the Merger, are considered outstanding and included in the computation of basic earnings per share. Accordingly, all 386 million shares contemplated by Delta’s Plan of Reorganization to be distributed to holders of allowed general,
unsecured claims are included in the calculation of earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2008 and the eight months ended December 31, 2007. Similarly, the calculation of basic loss per share for the year ended
December 31, 2008 includes, in connection with the Merger, (1) 50 million shares of Delta common stock we agreed to issue on behalf of Delta and Northwest pilots and (2) nine million shares of Delta common stock reserved for
issuance, after giving effect to the 1.25 exchange ratio, in exchange for shares of Northwest common stock that, but for the Merger, would have been issued under Northwest’s Plan of Reorganization.

Upon emergence from bankruptcy, we discharged our liabilities subject to compromise, which included convertible debt. As
a result, we recognized a gain of $216 million for the four months ended April 30, 2007. In connection with this discharge, 37 million shares of common stock were assumed issued for purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share.

(4)

For the year ended December 31, 2006, we excluded from our loss per share calculation all common stock equivalents
because their effect was anti-dilutive. These common stock equivalents include (1) stock options and preferred stock through the dates of their cancellation and conversion during our bankruptcy proceedings and (2) shares of common stock
issuable upon conversion of our convertible debt. These common stock equivalents totaled 37 million shares for the year ended December 31, 2006.
