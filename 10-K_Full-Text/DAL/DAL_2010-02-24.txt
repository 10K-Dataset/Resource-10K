PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

General

We
provide scheduled air transportation for passengers and
cargo throughout the United States and around the world. In
October 2008, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours merged with and into Northwest Airlines
Corporation (“Northwest”). As a result of this merger,  Northwest and its subsidiaries, including Northwest Airlines, Inc.
(“NWA”), became our wholly-owned subsidiaries. On December 31, 2009,
NWA merged with and into Delta, ending NWA’s existence as a separate entity. We anticipate that we
will complete the integration of NWA’s operations into Delta during 2010.

We are incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. Our principal executive offices
are located at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in Atlanta, Georgia (the “Atlanta
Airport”). Our telephone number is (404) 715-2600 and our Internet address is www.delta.com.
Information contained on this website is not part of, and is not incorporated by reference in, this
Form 10-K.

Financial
Strategies

Complete the integration of Northwest

. We believe the Northwest merger better positions us to
manage through economic cycles and volatile fuel prices, invest in our fleet, improve services for
customers and achieve our strategic objectives. We also believe the merger will generate approximately
$2 billion in annual revenue and cost synergies by 2012 from more effective aircraft utilization, a
more comprehensive and diversified route system and  reduced overhead and improved
operational efficiency.

Right-size our operations.

In response to the global recession and high fuel prices, we
reduced domestic and international capacity to better match capacity with demand. We have focused
on removing the associated capacity-related costs, including aircraft fleet and staffing. To reduce
fleet costs, we removed 18 mainline passenger aircraft from the fleet during 2009, retired our
entire fleet of B-747-200F freighter aircraft during 2009 and plan to remove over 30 regional jets
from our network beginning in mid-2009 and continuing through early 2011. We have reduced staffing
primarily through voluntary reduction programs as well as normal attrition. At December 31, 2009,
our total workforce was 4% lower than the combined workforce of Delta and NWA at December 31, 2008.

Improve
our operating margins.

We believe that the scope  of our network, combined with
investments we are making in our product and customer service, will enable us to generate a unit
revenue premium to the industry and that our cost structure allows us to generate highly
competitive unit costs, both of which provide the tools to improve our operating margins. By
strengthening our network, entering into joint ventures and expanding
our alliances, we believe we
are better able to improve unit revenues. And while our consolidated non-fuel unit costs are the
lowest among the major network carriers, we have additional improvement opportunities as we reduce
costs associated with right-sizing our business, increase productivity and realize merger
synergies.

Strengthen our balance sheet.

We currently, and will continue to, prudently manage costs and
free cash flow to conserve liquidity. We finished 2009 with $5.4 billion in unrestricted liquidity
(consisting of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and undrawn revolving credit facility
capacity). We have no immediate need for significant aircraft purchases and currently have limited
aircraft capital expenditures planned for the next three years. We will continue to focus on cost
discipline and cash flow generation toward our goal of further strengthening our balance sheet.

Flight Plan

Providing
a safe, secure operation is our first and most fundamental obligation
to our customers and employees, as well as to the communities we
serve. The key goals of our 2010 flight plan include (1) positioning
Delta as the global airline of choice, (2) enhancing our customer
service, (3) promoting positive employee relations, (4)
building a diversified, profitable worldwide network and global
alliance and (5) delivering industry-leading financial results.



Airline Operations

Our global route network gives us a presence in every major domestic and international
market. Our route network is centered around the hub system we operate at airports in Atlanta,
Cincinnati, Detroit, Memphis, Minneapolis/St. Paul, New York-JFK, Salt Lake City, Paris-Charles de
Gaulle, Amsterdam and Tokyo-Narita. Each of these hub operations includes flights that gather and
distribute traffic from markets in the geographic region surrounding the hub to domestic and
international cities and to other hubs. Our network is supported by a fleet of aircraft that is
varied in terms of size and capabilities, giving us flexibility to adjust aircraft to the network.

Expanding
our presence in New York City through increased focus on  corporate
customers, expanded and improved airport facilities
and increased and expanded  service into and out of New York City is a key component of our network strategy. For
example, we continue to make investments in our international
operations at New York-JFK and explore
long-term options to upgrade the facility. In addition, in August 2009, we announced our intention
to make New York’s LaGuardia Airport a domestic hub through a slot transaction with US Airways. The
agreement calls for US Airways to transfer 125 operating slot pairs to us at LaGuardia and for us
to transfer 42 operating slot pairs to US Airways at Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C. We
also plan to swap gates at LaGuardia to consolidate all of our operations (including the Delta
Shuttle) into an expanded main terminal facility with 11 additional
gates. The United States Department of
Transportation (“DOT”) has issued a tentative order on the transaction that would require the
divestiture of 20 slot pairs at LaGuardia and 14 slot pairs at Reagan National.  We and US Airways are
reviewing the tentative order to determine our next steps.

Other key characteristics of our route network include:

•

our alliances with foreign airlines, including our membership in SkyTeam, a
global airline alliance;

•

our transatlantic joint venture with Air France KLM;

•

our domestic alliances, including our marketing alliance with Alaska Airlines
and Horizon Air, which we are enhancing to expand our west coast service; and

•

agreements with multiple domestic regional carriers, which operate as Delta
Connection, including our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Comair, Inc., Compass Airlines, Inc.
and Mesaba Aviation, Inc.

International Alliances

We have bilateral and multilateral marketing alliances with foreign airlines to improve our
access to international markets. These arrangements can include codesharing, reciprocal frequent
flyer program benefits, shared or reciprocal access to passenger lounges, joint promotions, common
use of airport gates and ticket counters, ticket office co-location and other marketing agreements.
These alliances often present opportunities in other areas, such as airport ground handling
arrangements and aircraft maintenance insourcing.

Our international codesharing agreements enable us to market and sell seats to an expanded
number of international destinations. Under international codesharing arrangements, we and a
foreign carrier each publish our respective airline designator codes on a single flight operation,
thereby allowing us and the foreign carrier to offer joint service with one aircraft, rather than
operating separate services with two aircraft. These arrangements typically allow us to sell seats
on a foreign carrier’s aircraft that are marketed under our designator code and permit the foreign
airline to sell seats on our aircraft that are marketed under the foreign carrier’s designator
code.

We have international codeshare arrangements with Aeromexico, Air France, Alitalia, Avianca,
China Airlines, China Southern, CSA Czech Airlines, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Korean Air, Malev
Hungarian Airlines, Royal Air Maroc and Virgin Blue (and some affiliated carriers operating in
conjunction with some of these airlines).



SkyTeam

. In addition to our marketing alliance agreements with individual foreign airlines, we
are a member of the SkyTeam global airline alliance. The other full members of SkyTeam are
Aeroflot, Aeromexico, Air France, Alitalia, China Southern, CSA Czech Airlines, KLM and Korean Air.
One goal of SkyTeam is to link the route networks of the member airlines, providing opportunities
for increased connecting traffic while offering enhanced customer service through mutual
codesharing arrangements, reciprocal frequent flyer and lounge programs and coordinated cargo
operations.

We have received antitrust immunity from the DOT that
enables us and our immunized alliance partners (Air France KLM, Alitalia, CSA Czech Airlines and Korean Air) to offer a more
integrated route network and develop common sales, marketing and discount programs for customers.
In July 2009, Delta and Virgin Blue International Airlines (VAustralia),
Virgin Blue Airlines, Pacific Blue Airlines (Australia) and Pacific Blue Airlines (New Zealand)
filed an application with the DOT for antitrust immunity.

Air France KLM joint venture

. In addition to being members in SkyTeam with Air France and KLM,
both of which are subsidiaries of the same holding company, we have a transatlantic joint venture
agreement with Air France and KLM. This agreement provides for the sharing of revenues and costs on
transatlantic routes, as well as coordinated pricing, scheduling, and product development on
included routes. Pursuant to this joint venture, we and Air France KLM operate an extensive
transatlantic network, primarily on routes between North America and Europe, and secondarily on
routes between North America and Africa, the Middle East and India, and routes between Europe and
Central America and several countries in northern South America.

Domestic Alliances

We have entered into a marketing alliance with Alaska and Horizon, which includes mutual
codesharing and reciprocal frequent flyer and airport lounge access arrangements. In 2009, we
enhanced our alliance agreement with Alaska and Horizon to provide for more extensive cooperation
with respect to our west coast presence.

We also have frequent flyer and reciprocal lounge agreements with Hawaiian Airlines, and
codesharing agreements with American Eagle Airlines (“American Eagle”), US Helicopter and Midwest
Airlines. These marketing relationships are designed to permit the carriers to retain their
separate identities and route networks while increasing the number of domestic and international
connecting passengers using the carriers’ route networks.

Regional Carriers

We have air service agreements with multiple domestic regional air carriers that feed traffic
to our route system by serving passengers primarily in small-and medium-sized cities. These
arrangements enable us to increase the number of flights we have available in certain locations, to
better match capacity with demand and to preserve our presence in smaller markets. Approximately
22% of our passenger revenue in 2009 related to flying by regional air carriers.

Through our regional carrier program, we have contractual arrangements with 10 regional
carriers to operate regional jet and, in certain cases, turbo-prop aircraft using our “DL”
designator code. In addition to our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Comair, Compass and Mesaba, we have
contractual arrangements with Atlantic Southeast Airlines, Inc., a subsidiary of SkyWest, Inc.
(“SkyWest”); SkyWest Airlines, Inc., a subsidiary of SkyWest; Chautauqua Airlines, Inc., a
subsidiary of Republic Airways Holdings, Inc. (“Republic Holdings”); Shuttle America Corporation, a
subsidiary of Republic Holdings; Freedom Airlines, Inc., a subsidiary of Mesa Air Group, Inc.;
Pinnacle Airlines, Inc.; and American Eagle.

With the exception of American Eagle and a portion of SkyWest Airlines as described below,
these agreements are capacity purchase arrangements, under which we control the scheduling,
pricing, reservations, ticketing and seat inventories for the regional carriers’ flights operating
under our “DL” designator code, and we are entitled to all ticket, cargo and mail revenues
associated with these flights. We pay those airlines an amount, as defined in the applicable
agreement, which is based on a determination of their cost of operating those flights and other
factors intended to approximate market rates for those services. These capacity purchase agreements
are long-term agreements, usually with initial terms of at least 10 years, which grant us the
option to extend the initial term. Certain of these agreements provide us the right to terminate
the entire agreement, or in some cases remove some of the aircraft from the scope of the agreement,
for convenience at certain future dates.



Our arrangements with American Eagle, limited to certain flights operated to and from the Los
Angeles International Airport, as well as a portion of the flights operated for us by SkyWest
Airlines, are structured as revenue proration agreements. These proration agreements establish a
fixed dollar or percentage division of revenues for tickets sold to passengers traveling on
connecting flight itineraries.

Frequent Flyer Program

Our SkyMiles® frequent flyer program is designed to retain and increase traveler loyalty by
offering incentives to customers to increase travel on Delta. The SkyMiles program allows program
members to earn mileage for travel awards by flying on Delta, Delta’s regional carriers and other
participating airlines. Mileage credit may also be earned by using certain services offered by
program participants, such as credit card companies, hotels, car rental agencies, and
telecommunication services. In addition, individuals and companies may purchase mileage credits. We
reserve the right to terminate the program with six months advance notice, and to change the
program’s terms and conditions at any time without notice.

SkyMiles program mileage credits can be redeemed for free or upgraded air travel on Delta and
participating airlines, for membership in our Delta Sky Clubs® and for other program participant
awards. Mileage credits are subject to certain transfer restrictions and travel awards are subject
to capacity-controlled seating. Program accounts with no activity for 12 consecutive months after
enrollment are deleted. Miles will not expire so long as, at least once every two years, the
participant (1) takes a qualifying flight on Delta, a Delta Connection carrier or other
participating airlines, (2) earns miles through one of our program participants, (3) buys miles
from Delta or (4) redeems miles for any program award.

Cargo

Through
the strength of our global network, our cargo operations are able to connect all of the world’s major freight
gateways. We generate cargo revenues in domestic and international markets primarily through the
use of cargo space on regularly scheduled passenger aircraft. We are a member of SkyTeam Cargo, a global airline cargo alliance.
The alliance, whose other members are Aeromexico Cargo, Air France Cargo, Alitalia Cargo, CSA Czech
Airlines Cargo, KLM Cargo and Korean Air Cargo, offers a global
network spanning six continents. This
alliance offers cargo customers a consistent international product line, and the partners work to
jointly improve their efficiency and effectiveness in the marketplace.

MRO

Our maintenance, repair and overhaul (“MRO”) operations known as Delta TechOps is the largest
airline MRO in North America. In addition to providing
maintenance and engineering support for our fleet of approximately 800 aircraft, Delta TechOps serves more
than 150 aviation and airline customers from around the world. Delta TechOps employs approximately
8,800 maintenance professionals and is one of the most experienced MRO providers in the world.

Fuel

Our results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability
of aircraft fuel. The following table shows our aircraft fuel consumption and costs for 2007
through 2009.

Total operating expense for 2008 reflects a $7.3 billion non-cash charge from an
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets and $1.1 billion in primarily non-cash
merger-related charges. Including these charges, fuel costs accounted for 28% of total
operating expense.



Our aircraft fuel purchase contracts do not provide material protection against price
increases or assure the availability of our fuel supplies. We purchase most of our aircraft fuel
under contracts that establish the price based on various market indices. We also purchase aircraft
fuel on the spot market, from off-shore sources and under contracts that permit the refiners to set
the price.

We use derivative instruments, which are comprised of crude oil, heating oil and jet fuel
swap, collar and call option contracts, in an effort to manage our exposure to changes in aircraft
fuel prices.

We are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel, but it is impossible to
predict the future availability or price of aircraft fuel. Weather-related events, natural
disasters, political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries, changes in government
policy concerning aircraft fuel production, transportation or marketing, changes in aircraft fuel
production capacity, environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in fuel
supply shortages and fuel price increases in the future.

Competition

We face significant competition with respect to routes, services and fares. Our domestic
routes are subject to competition from both new and existing carriers, some of which have lower
costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us. In particular, we
face significant competition at our hub airports in Atlanta, Cincinnati, Detroit, Memphis,
Minneapolis/St. Paul, New York-JFK, Salt Lake City, Paris-Charles de Gaulle, Amsterdam and
Tokyo-Narita either directly at those airports or from the hubs of other airlines that compete on a
connecting basis. We also face competition in smaller to medium-sized markets from regional jet
operators. Our ability to compete effectively depends, in significant part, on our ability to
maintain a cost structure that is competitive with other carriers.

In addition, we compete with foreign carriers for U.S. passengers traveling to international
destinations, as well as between foreign points. International marketing alliances formed by
domestic and foreign carriers, including the Star Alliance (among United Air Lines, Continental
Airlines, Lufthansa German Airlines, Air Canada and others) and the oneworld alliance (among
American Airlines, British Airways, Qantas and others) have significantly increased competition in
international markets. The adoption of liberalized Open Skies Aviation Agreements with an
increasing number of countries around the world, including in particular the Open Skies Treaty with
the Member States of the European Union, has accelerated this trend. Japan has reached agreement
in principle with the United States on an open skies agreement, contingent upon the successful
completion of DOT alliance approval for its carriers. Through marketing and codesharing
arrangements with U.S. carriers, foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior U.S.
passenger traffic beyond traditional U.S. gateway cities. Similarly, U.S. carriers have increased
their ability to sell international transportation, such as services to and beyond traditional
European and Asian gateway cities, through alliances with international carriers.

Regulatory Matters

The DOT and the Federal Aviation Administration (the “FAA”) exercise regulatory authority over air transportation in the U.S. The DOT
has authority to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity required for airlines to
provide domestic air transportation. An air carrier that the DOT finds fit to operate is given
unrestricted authority to operate domestic air transportation (including the carriage of passengers
and cargo). Except for constraints imposed by regulations regarding “Essential Air Services,” which
are applicable to certain small communities, airlines may terminate service to a city without
restriction.

The DOT has jurisdiction over certain economic and consumer protection matters, such as unfair
or deceptive practices and methods of competition, advertising, denied boarding compensation,
baggage liability and disabled passenger transportation. The DOT also has authority to review
certain joint venture agreements between major carriers. The FAA has primary responsibility for
matters relating to air carrier flight operations, including airline operating certificates,
control of navigable air space, flight personnel, aircraft certification and maintenance and other
matters affecting air safety.

Authority to operate international routes and international codesharing arrangements is
regulated by the DOT and by the governments of the foreign countries involved. International
certificate authorities are also subject to the approval of the U.S. President for conformance with
national defense and foreign policy objectives.



The Transportation Security Administration and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, each a
division of the Department of Homeland Security, are responsible for certain civil aviation
security matters, including passenger and baggage screening at U.S. airports and international
passenger prescreening prior to entry into or departure from the U.S.

Airlines are also subject to various other federal, state, local and foreign laws and
regulations. For example, the U.S. Department of Justice has jurisdiction over airline competition
matters. The U.S. Postal Service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail.
Labor relations in the airline industry, as discussed below, are generally governed by the Railway
Labor Act. Environmental matters are regulated by various federal, state, local and foreign
governmental entities. Privacy of passenger and employee data is regulated by domestic and foreign
laws and regulations.

Fares and Rates

Airlines set ticket prices in all domestic and most international city pairs without
governmental regulation, and the industry is characterized by significant price competition.
Certain international fares and rates are subject to the jurisdiction of the DOT and the
governments of the foreign countries involved. Many of our tickets are sold by travel agents, and
fares are subject to commissions, overrides and discounts paid to travel agents, brokers and
wholesalers.

Route Authority

Our flight operations are authorized by certificates of public convenience and necessity and
also by exemptions and limited-entry frequency awards issued by the DOT. The requisite approvals of
other governments for international operations are controlled by bilateral agreements with, or
permits or approvals issued by, foreign countries. Because international air transportation is
governed by bilateral or other agreements between the U.S. and the foreign country or countries
involved, changes in U.S. or foreign government aviation policies could result in the alteration or
termination of such agreements, diminish the value of our international route authorities or
otherwise affect our international operations. Bilateral agreements between the U.S. and various
foreign countries served by us are subject to renegotiation from time to time. Notably, the U.S.
and Japan have begun steps to revise their bilateral agreement.

Certain of our international route authorities are subject to periodic renewal requirements.
We request extension of these authorities when and as appropriate. While the DOT usually renews
temporary authorities on routes where the authorized carrier is providing a reasonable level of
service, there is no assurance this practice will continue in general or with respect to a specific
renewal. Dormant route authority may not be renewed in some cases, especially where another U.S.
carrier indicates a willingness to provide service.

Airport Access

Operations at four major domestic airports and certain foreign airports served by us are
regulated by governmental entities through allocations of “slots” or similar regulatory mechanisms
which limit the rights of carriers to conduct operations at those airports. Each slot represents
the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time
period.

In the U.S., the FAA currently regulates the allocation of slots, slot exemptions, operating
authorizations, or similar capacity allocation mechanisms at Reagan National in Washington, D.C.,
LaGuardia and JFK in New York, and Newark. Our operations at these airports generally require the
allocation of slots or analogous regulatory authorities. Similarly, our operations at Tokyo’s
Narita Airport, London’s Gatwick and Heathrow airports and other international airports are
regulated by local slot coordinators pursuant to the International Air Transport Association’s
Worldwide Scheduling Guidelines and applicable local law. We recently
filed an application with the DOT to offer customers nonstop service
between Tokyo’s Haneda Airport and Seattle, Detroit, Los
Angeles and Honolulu. We currently have sufficient slots or
analogous authorizations to operate our existing flights, and we have generally been able to obtain
the rights to expand our operations and to change our schedules. There is no assurance, however,
that we will be able to do so in the future because, among other reasons, such allocations are
subject to changes in governmental policies.



Environmental Matters

Noise

. The Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 recognizes the rights of operators of
airports with noise problems to implement local noise abatement programs so long as such programs
do not interfere unreasonably with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air
transportation system. This statute generally provides that local noise restrictions on Stage 3
aircraft first effective after October 1, 1990, require FAA approval. While we have had sufficient
scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions in the past, our operations could be
adversely impacted if locally-imposed regulations become more restrictive or widespread.

Emissions

. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) is authorized to regulate
aircraft emissions and has historically implemented emissions control standards previously adopted
by the International Civil Aviation Organization (“ICAO”). Our aircraft comply with the existing
EPA standards as applicable by engine design date. ICAO has adopted additional aircraft engine
emissions standards applicable to engines certified after December 31, 2007, but the EPA has not
yet proposed a rule that incorporates these new ICAO standards.

Concern about climate change and greenhouse gases may result in additional regulation of
aircraft emissions in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, we may become subject to taxes, charges or
additional requirements to obtain permits or purchase allowances or emission credits for greenhouse
gas emissions in various jurisdictions, which could result in taxation or permitting requirements
from multiple jurisdictions for the same operations. Ongoing discussions between the United States
and other nations, including the discussions that resulted in an accord reached at the United
Nations Climate Change Conference 2009 in Copenhagen in December 2009, may lead to international
treaties focusing on greenhouse gas emissions.

The European Union has adopted the most significant emissions regulatory system by publishing
a directive requiring its member countries to implement regulations including aviation in the
European Union’s emissions trading system (“ETS”). Under these regulations, any airline with
flights originating or landing in the European Union will be subject to the ETS and, beginning in
2012, may be required to purchase emissions allowances or credits if the airline exceeds the number
of free credits allocated to it under the ETS. We expect that such a system would impose
significant costs on our operations in the European Union. Under the ETS, each airline is required
to file emissions plans with a specific member country. Prior to NWA ceasing existence as a
separate entity, we filed emissions plans in Germany (with respect to Delta) and the Netherlands
(with respect to NWA) under protest. The Air Transport Association and three U.S. carriers have
filed an action in the United Kingdom challenging the legality of the ETS on various grounds;
however, airlines will be required to comply with the ETS unless
interim relief is granted.

Cap and trade restrictions have also been proposed in the United States. In addition, other
legislative or regulatory action, including by the EPA, to regulate greenhouse gas emissions is
possible. In particular, the EPA has found that greenhouse gases threaten the public health and welfare,
which could result in regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft. In the event that legislation or regulation is enacted in the U.S. or in the event
similar legislation or regulation is enacted in jurisdictions other than the European Union where
we operate or where we may operate in the future, it could result in significant costs for us and
the airline industry. At this time, we cannot predict whether any such legislation or regulation
would apportion costs between one or more jurisdictions in which we operate flights. Under these
systems, certain credits may be available to reduce the costs of permits in order to mitigate the
impact of such regulations on consumers, but we cannot predict whether we or the airline industry
in general will have access to offsets or credits. We are monitoring and evaluating the
potential impact of such legislative and regulatory developments. In addition to direct costs,
such regulation may have a greater effect on the airline industry through increases in fuel costs
that could result from fuel suppliers passing on increased costs that they incur under such a
system.

We seek to minimize the impact of carbon emissions from our operations through reductions in
our fuel consumption and other efforts. We have reduced the fuel needs of our aircraft fleet
through the retirement and replacement of certain elements of our fleet and with newer, more fuel
efficient aircraft. In addition, we have implemented fuel saving procedures in our flight and
ground support operations that further reduce carbon emissions. We are also supporting efforts to
develop alternative fuels and efforts to modernize the air traffic control system in the U.S., as
part of our efforts to reduce our emissions and minimize our impact on the environment.



Other Environmental Matters

. We have been identified by the EPA as a potentially responsible
party (a “PRP”) with respect to certain Superfund Sites, and have entered into consent decrees
regarding some of these sites. Our alleged disposal volume at each of these sites is small when
compared to the total contributions of all PRPs at each site. We are aware of soil and/or ground
water contamination present on our current or former leaseholds at several domestic airports. To
address this contamination, we have a program in place to investigate and, if appropriate,
remediate these sites. Although the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with
certainty, management believes that the resolution of these matters will not have a material
adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.

We are also subject to various other federal, state and local laws governing environmental
matters, including the management and disposal of chemicals, waste and hazardous materials,
protection of surface and subsurface waters and regulation of air emissions and drinking water.

Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program

We participate in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet program (the “CRAF Program”), which permits the
U.S. military to use the aircraft and crew resources of participating U.S. airlines during airlift
emergencies, national emergencies or times of war. We have agreed to make available under the CRAF
Program a portion of our international range aircraft from October 1, 2009 until September 30,
2010. As of October 1, 2009, the following numbers of our international range aircraft are
available for CRAF activation:

Employee Matters

Railway Labor Act

Our relations with labor unions in the U.S. are governed by the Railway Labor Act. Under the
Railway Labor Act, a labor union seeking to represent an unrepresented craft or class of employees
is required to file with the National Mediation Board (the “NMB”) an application alleging a
representation dispute, along with authorization cards signed by at least 35% of the employees in
that craft or class. The NMB then investigates the dispute and, if it finds the labor union has
obtained a sufficient number of authorization cards, conducts an election to determine whether to
certify the labor union as the collective bargaining representative of that craft or class. Under
the NMB’s usual rules, a labor union will be certified as the representative of the employees in a
craft or class only if more than 50% of those employees vote for union representation. A certified
labor union then enters into negotiations toward a collective bargaining agreement with the
employer.

Under the Railway Labor Act, a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor
union does not expire, but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date. Either party may request
that the NMB appoint a federal mediator to participate in the negotiations for a new or amended
agreement. If no agreement is reached in mediation, the NMB may determine, at any time, that an
impasse exists and offer binding arbitration. If either party rejects binding arbitration, a 30-day
“cooling off” period begins. At the end of this 30-day period, the parties may engage in “self
help,” unless the U.S. President appoints a Presidential Emergency Board (“PEB”) to investigate and
report on the dispute. The appointment of a PEB maintains the “status quo” for an additional 60
days. If the parties do not reach agreement during this period, the parties may then engage in
“self help.” “Self help” includes, among other things, a strike by the union or the imposition of
proposed changes to the collective bargaining agreement by the airline. Congress and the President
have the authority to prevent “self help” by enacting legislation that, among other things, imposes
a settlement on the parties.



Collective Bargaining

As of December 31, 2009, we had 81,106 full-time equivalent employees. Approximately 39% of
these employees were represented by unions, including the following domestic employee groups.

Labor unions periodically engage in organizing efforts to represent various groups of our
employees, including at our airline subsidiaries, that are not represented for collective
bargaining purposes.

Integration
of a number of the workgroups (including pilots and aircraft maintenance technicians) has been
successfully completed. Completion of the integration of certain workgroups (including flight
attendants, airport employees and reservations employees) will
require the resolution of representation issues. We cannot predict
when these representation issues will be resolved. However, as a result of our obtaining a single operating
certificate from the FAA, completing the merger of the NWA reservations system into Delta’s system, and the merger of NWA into Delta, we believe we can achieve many of the synergies
of integrating the pre-merger Northwest operations into Delta’s
before the remaining employee representation issues are resolved.

Under procedures that have been utilized by the NMB, each labor union that represented
U.S.-based employees at pre-merger Delta or NWA, as well as other groups of employees with a
sufficient showing of interest, may invoke the NMB’s jurisdiction to address representation issues
arising from the merger. Once its jurisdiction is invoked, the NMB’s rules call for it to first
determine whether the airlines have combined or will combine to form a single carrier. On January
7, 2009, the NMB ruled that Delta and NWA constitute a single transportation system for
representation purposes under the Railway Labor Act in response to applications filed by certain of
the pre-merger unions at Delta and NWA.

The NMB has utilized certain procedures to address and resolve representation issues arising
from airline mergers which generally have included the following:

•

Where employees in the same craft or class at the two carriers are represented
by the same union, that union will be certified to represent the combined group, without an
election.



•

Where employees in the same craft or class at the two carriers have different
representation status—either they are represented by different unions or one group is
represented by a union and the other is not—the NMB’s rules provide for a representation
election among the combined employee groups if the groups are “comparable” in size. In
general, the NMB has considered two groups to be comparable in size if the smaller group is
at least 35% of the combined group. If the representation election results in the combined
group not being represented by a union, the collective bargaining agreement covering the
group that had previously been unionized will terminate.

•

If the two groups are not comparable in size, the smaller group will be folded
into and have the same representation status as the larger group. Even where the two groups
are not comparable in size, the smaller group can still obtain an election if, within 14
days after the NMB’s single carrier determination with respect to that group, the smaller
group submits a showing of interest from at least 35% of the combined group. The showing of
interest can consist of authorization cards as well as the seniority list of the smaller
group, if the smaller group had been represented by a union.

Based upon these procedures, representation and related issues have been resolved in
U.S.-based workgroups represented by six of the eight labor unions at Delta and NWA pre-merger. The
NMB recently issued a formal proposal to change the voting rules for representation elections in
the airline industry to provide that a majority of votes cast (rather than a majority of votes
eligible to be cast) is necessary to certify a union to represent a craft or class of employees.
Concurrent with the NMB’s proposal, the two remaining pre-merger NWA unions, the Association of
Flight Attendants-CWA, which represented flight attendants at pre-merger NWA, and the International
Association of Machinists, which represented various categories of ground employees at pre-merger
NWA, withdrew applications that they had filed with the National Mediation Board to resolve
post-merger representation issues at Delta. While it is unclear when representation issues will be
resolved in those workgroups, we are proceeding with a substantial portion of our operational
integration.

If a labor union is certified to represent a combined group post-merger, the terms and
conditions of employment of the combined work group ultimately will be subject to negotiations
toward a joint collective bargaining agreement. Completing joint collective bargaining agreements
covering combined work groups that choose to be represented by a labor union could take significant
time, which could delay or impede our ability to achieve targeted synergies from the merger.

With respect to integration of seniority lists, where the two employee groups in a craft or
class have different representation status, federal law requires that seniority integration be
governed by the procedures first issued by the Civil Aeronautics Board in the Allegheny-Mohawk
merger—known as the Allegheny-Mohawk Labor Protective Provisions. In general, Allegheny-Mohawk
Labor Protective Provisions require that seniority be integrated in a “fair and equitable” manner
and that any disputes not resolved by negotiations may be submitted to binding arbitration by a
neutral arbitrator. This requirement is consistent with the seniority protection policy that has
been adopted by the Delta board of directors. Where both groups are represented by the same union
prior to the merger, seniority integration is governed by the union’s bylaws and policies. The
integration of the seniority lists of the pilots of Delta and NWA as well as flight dispatchers,
meteorologists and aircraft maintenance technicians and related Technical Operations employees have
been resolved.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Risk Factors Relating to Delta

Our business and results of operations are dependent on the price and availability of aircraft
fuel. High fuel costs or cost increases could have a materially adverse effect on our operating
results. Likewise, significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel would materially
adversely affect our operations and operating results.

Our operating results are significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of
aircraft fuel. Fuel prices have increased substantially since the middle part of the last decade
and spiked at record high levels in 2008 before falling dramatically during the latter part of
2008. In 2009, our average fuel price per gallon was $2.15. In 2008, our average fuel price per
gallon was $3.16, a 41% increase from an average price of $2.24 in 2007, which in turn was
significantly higher than fuel prices just a few years earlier. Fuel costs represented 29%, 38%,
and 31% of our operating expense in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Total operating expense for
2008 reflects a $7.3 billion non-cash charge from an impairment of goodwill and other intangible
assets and $1.1 billion in primarily non-cash merger-related charges. Including these charges, fuel
costs accounted for 28% of total operating expense in 2008. Fuel costs have had a significant
negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Our ability to pass along the increased costs of fuel to our customers is limited by the
competitive nature of the airline industry. We often have not been able to increase our fares to
offset the effect of increased fuel costs in the past and we may not be able to do so in the
future.

In addition, our aircraft fuel purchase contracts do not provide material protection against
price increases or assure the availability of our fuel supplies. We purchase most of our aircraft
fuel under contracts that establish the price based on various market indices. We also purchase
aircraft fuel on the spot market, from offshore sources and under contracts that permit the
refiners to set the price. In an effort to manage our exposure to changes in fuel prices, we use
derivative instruments, which are comprised of crude oil, heating oil and jet fuel swap, collar and
call option contracts, though we may not be able to successfully manage this exposure. Depending on
the type of hedging instrument used, our ability to benefit from declines in fuel prices may be
limited.

We are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel, but it is impossible to
predict the future availability or price of aircraft fuel. Weather-related events, natural
disasters, political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries, changes in governmental
policy concerning aircraft fuel production, transportation or marketing, changes in aircraft fuel
production capacity, environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in additional
fuel supply shortages and fuel price increases in the future. Additional increases in fuel costs or
disruptions in fuel supplies could have additional negative effects on us.

The global economic recession has resulted in weaker demand for air travel and may create
challenges for us that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of
operations.

As the effects of the global economic recession have been felt in our domestic and
international markets, we have experienced significantly weaker demand for air travel. Our demand
began to slow during the December 2008 quarter and global economic conditions in 2009 substantially
reduced U.S. airline industry revenues in 2009 compared to 2008. As a result, we reduced our
consolidated capacity by 6% in 2009 compared to the combined capacity of Delta and Northwest during
2008. Demand for air travel could remain weak if an economic recovery is slow or even fall further
if a recession returns, and overall demand could fall lower than we are able prudently to reduce
capacity. The weakness in the United States and international economies is having a significant
negative impact on our results of operations and could continue to have a significant negative
impact on our future results of operations.

The global financial crisis may have an impact on our business and financial condition in ways
that we currently cannot predict.

The credit crisis and related turmoil in the global financial system has had and may continue
to have an impact on our business and our financial condition. In particular, the financial crisis
and economic downturn resulted in broadly lower
investment asset returns and values, including in the defined benefit pension plans that we
sponsor for eligible employees and



retirees. As of December 31, 2009, the defined benefit pension
plans had an estimated benefit obligation of approximately $17.0 billion and were funded through
assets with a value of approximately $7.6 billion. We estimate that our funding requirements for
our defined benefit pension plans, which are governed by ERISA and have been frozen for future
accruals, are approximately $720 million in 2010. The significant level of required funding is due
primarily to the decline in the investment markets in 2008, which negatively affected the value of
our pension assets. Estimates of pension plan funding requirements can vary materially from actual
funding requirements because the estimates are based on various assumptions concerning factors
outside our control, including, among other things, the market performance of assets; statutory
requirements; and demographic data for participants, including the number of participants and the
rate of participant attrition. Results that vary significantly from our assumptions could have a
material impact on our future funding obligations.

Our obligation to post collateral in connection with our fuel hedge contracts may have a
substantial impact on our short-term liquidity.

Under fuel hedge contracts that we may enter into from time to time, counterparties to those
contracts may require us to fund the margin associated with any loss position on the contracts. For
example, at December 31, 2008, our counterparties required us to fund $1.2 billion of fuel hedge
margin. However, at December 31, 2009, counterparties were required to fund us a net $10 million.
If fuel prices fall significantly below the levels at the time we enter into hedging contracts, we
may be required to post a significant amount of collateral, which could have an impact on the level
of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.

Our substantial indebtedness may limit our financial and operating activities and may adversely
affect our ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs.

We have substantial indebtedness, which could:

In addition, a substantial level of indebtedness, particularly because substantially all of
our assets are currently subject to liens, could limit our ability to obtain additional financing
on acceptable terms or at all for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate
purposes. We have historically had substantial liquidity needs in the operation of our business.
These liquidity needs could vary significantly and may be affected by general economic conditions,
industry trends, performance and many other factors not within our control.



Agreements governing our debt, including credit agreements and indentures, include financial and
other covenants that impose restrictions on our financial and business operations.

Our credit facilities and indentures for secured notes have various financial and other
covenants that require us to maintain, depending on the particular agreement, minimum fixed charge
coverage ratios, minimum unrestricted cash reserves and/or minimum collateral coverage ratios. The
value of the collateral that has been pledged in each facility may change over time, including due
to factors that are not under our control, resulting in a situation where we may not be able to
maintain the collateral coverage ratio. In addition, the credit facilities and indentures contain
other negative covenants customary for such financings. If we fail to comply with these covenants
and are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment, an event of default would result. These covenants
are subject to important exceptions and qualifications.

The credit facilities and indentures also contain other events of default customary for such
financings. If an event of default were to occur, the lenders or the trustee could, among other
things, declare outstanding amounts due and payable, and our cash may become restricted. We cannot
provide assurance that we would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance the borrowings or
notes under any of the credit facilities if such amounts were accelerated upon an event of default.
In addition, an event of default or declaration of acceleration under any of the credit facilities
or the indentures could also result in an event of default under other of our financing agreements.

Employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions may adversely affect our operations.

Our business is labor intensive, utilizing large numbers of pilots, flight attendants and
other personnel. As of December 31, 2009, approximately 39% of our workforce was unionized. Strikes
or labor disputes with our unionized employees may adversely affect our ability to conduct
business. Relations between air carriers and labor unions in the United States are governed by the
Railway Labor Act, which provides that a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a
labor union does not expire, but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date. The Railway Labor
Act generally prohibits strikes or other types of self-help actions both before and after a
collective bargaining agreement becomes amendable, unless and until the collective bargaining
processes required by the Railway Labor Act have been exhausted.

In addition, if we or our affiliates are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized
work groups on future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements or
if additional segments of our workforce become unionized, we may be subject to work interruptions
or stoppages, subject to the requirements of the Railway Labor Act. Likewise, if third party
regional carriers with whom we have contract carrier agreements are unable to reach agreement with
their unionized work groups on current or future negotiations regarding the terms of their
collective bargaining agreements, those carriers may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages,
subject to the requirements of the Railway Labor Act, which could have a negative impact on our
operations.

The ability to realize fully the anticipated benefits of our merger with Northwest may depend on
the successful integration of the businesses of Delta and Northwest.

Our merger with Northwest involved the combination of two companies which operated as
independent public companies prior to the merger. We are devoting significant attention and
resources to integrating our business practices and operations in order to achieve the benefits of
the merger, including expected synergies. If we are unable to integrate our business practices and
operations in a manner that allows us to achieve the anticipated revenue and cost synergies, or if
achievement of such synergies takes longer or costs more than expected, the anticipated benefits of
the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. In
addition, it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees,
diversion of management’s attention, the disruption or interruption of, or the loss of momentum in
our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, any of
which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or
our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger, or could reduce our earnings or
otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results. We expect to incur total cash costs
of approximately $500 million over approximately three years to integrate the two airlines.



Completion of the integration of the Delta and NWA workforces may present significant challenges.

The successful integration of the pre-merger Northwest operations into Delta and achievement
of the anticipated benefits of the combination depend significantly on integrating the pre-merger
Delta and NWA employee groups and on maintaining productive employee relations. While integration
of a number of the workgroups (including pilots and aircraft maintenance technicians) has been
successfully completed, completion of the integration of certain workgroups (including flight
attendants, airport employees and reservations employees) of the two pre-merger airlines will
require the resolution of potentially difficult issues, including but not limited to the process and
timing for determining whether the combined post-merger workgroups wish to have union
representation. Unexpected delay, expense or other challenges to integrating the workforces could
impact the expected synergies from the merger and affect our financial performance.

Interruptions or disruptions in service at one of our hub airports could have a material adverse
impact on our operations.

Our business is heavily dependent on our operations at the Atlanta airport and at our other
hub airports in Cincinnati, Detroit, Memphis, Minneapolis/St. Paul, New York-JFK, Salt Lake City,
Paris-Charles de Gaulle, Amsterdam and Tokyo-Narita. Each of these hub operations includes flights
that gather and distribute traffic from markets in the geographic region surrounding the hub to
other major cities and to other Delta hubs. A significant interruption or disruption in service at
the Atlanta airport or at one of our other hubs could have a serious impact on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

We are increasingly dependent on technology in our operations, and if our technology fails or we
are unable to continue to invest in new technology or integrate the systems and technologies of
Delta and Northwest, our business may be adversely affected.

We have become increasingly dependent on technology initiatives to reduce costs and to enhance
customer service in order to compete in the current business environment. For example, we have made
significant investments in delta.com, check-in kiosks and related initiatives. The performance and
reliability of the technology are critical to our ability to attract and retain customers and our
ability to compete effectively. These initiatives will continue to require significant capital
investments in our technology infrastructure. If we are unable
to make these investments, our business and operations could be negatively affected. In addition,
we may face challenges associated with integrating complex systems and technologies that supported
the separate operations of Delta and Northwest. If we are unable to manage these challenges
effectively, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.

In addition, any internal technology error or failure or large scale external interruption in
technology infrastructure we depend on, such as power, telecommunications or the internet, may
disrupt our technology network. Any individual, sustained or repeated failure of technology could
impact our customer service and result in increased costs. Our technology systems and related data
may be vulnerable to a variety of sources of interruption due to events beyond our control,
including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses,
hackers and other security issues. While we have in place, and continue to invest in, technology
security initiatives and disaster recovery plans, these measures may not be adequate or implemented
properly to prevent a business disruption and its adverse financial consequences to our business.

If we experience losses of senior management personnel and other key employees, our operating
results could be adversely affected.

We are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key
employees to execute our business plans. If we experience a substantial turnover in our leadership
and other key employees, our performance could be materially adversely impacted. Furthermore, we
may be unable to attract and retain additional qualified executives as needed in the future.



Our credit card processors have the ability to take significant holdbacks in certain
circumstances. The initiation of such holdbacks likely would have a material adverse effect on
our liquidity.

Most of the tickets we sell are paid for by customers who use credit cards. Our credit card
processing agreements provide that no holdback of receivables or reserve is required except in
certain circumstances, including if we do not maintain a required level of unrestricted cash. If
circumstances were to occur that would allow American Express or our Visa/MasterCard processor to
initiate a holdback, the negative impact on our liquidity likely would be material.

We are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from any accident involving our aircraft.

An aircraft crash or other accident could expose us to significant tort liability. The
insurance we carry to cover damages arising from any future accidents may be inadequate. In the
event that the insurance is not adequate, we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an
accident. In addition, any accident involving an aircraft that we operate or an aircraft that is
operated by an airline that is one of our codeshare partners could create a public perception that
our aircraft are not safe or reliable, which could harm our reputation, result in air travelers
being reluctant to fly on our aircraft and harm our business.

Our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S.
federal income tax purposes is subject to limitation.

In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, a corporation
that undergoes an “ownership change” is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its
pre-change net operating losses (“NOLs”), to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership
change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders (generally 5% shareholders,
applying certain look-through rules) increases by more than 50 percentage points over such
stockholders’ lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years).

As of December 31, 2009, Delta reported a consolidated federal and state NOL carryforward of
approximately $17.3 billion. Both Delta and Northwest experienced an ownership change in 2007 as a
result of their respective plans of reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As
a result of the merger, Northwest experienced a subsequent ownership change. Delta also experienced
a subsequent ownership change on December 17, 2008 as a result of the merger, the issuance of
equity to employees in connection with the merger and other transactions involving the sale of our
common stock within the testing period.

The Delta and Northwest ownership changes resulting from the merger could limit the ability to
utilize pre-change NOLs that were not subject to limitation, and could further limit the ability to
utilize NOLs that were already subject to limitation. Limitations imposed on the ability to use
NOLs to offset future taxable income could cause U.S. federal income taxes to be paid earlier than
otherwise would be paid if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such NOLs to expire
unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such NOLs. Similar rules and
limitations may apply for state income tax purposes. NOLs generated subsequent to December 17, 2008
are not limited.

Our merger with Northwest affects the comparability of our historical financial results.

On October 29, 2008, a subsidiary of Delta merged with and into Northwest. Our historical
financial results under GAAP include the results of Northwest for periods after October 29, 2008,
but not for periods before October 29, 2008. Accordingly, while our financial results for the year
ended December 31, 2009 include the results of Northwest for the entire period, our financial
results for the year ended December 31, 2008 include the results of Northwest only for the period
from October 30 to December 31, 2008. This complicates your ability to compare our results of
operations and financial condition for periods that include Northwest’s results with periods that
do not.



Risk Factors Relating to the Airline Industry

The airline industry is highly competitive and, if we cannot successfully compete in the
marketplace, our business, financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely
affected.

We face significant competition with respect to routes, services and fares. Our domestic
routes are subject to competition from both new and established carriers, some of which have lower
costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us. In particular, we
face significant competition at our hub airports in Atlanta, Cincinnati, Detroit, Memphis,
Minneapolis/St. Paul, New York-JFK, Salt Lake City, Paris-Charles de Gaulle, Amsterdam and
Tokyo-Narita either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in
close proximity to our hubs. We also face competition in smaller to medium-sized markets from
regional jet operators.

Low-cost carriers, including Southwest, AirTran and JetBlue, have placed significant
competitive pressure on us in the United States and on other network carriers in the domestic
market. In addition, other network carriers have also significantly reduced their costs over the
last several years. Our ability to compete effectively depends, in part, on our ability to maintain
a competitive cost structure. If we cannot maintain our costs at a competitive level, then our
business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. In
light of increased jet fuel costs and other issues in recent years, we expect consolidation to
occur in the airline industry. As a result of consolidation, we may face significant competition
from larger carriers that may be able to generate higher amounts of revenue and compete more
efficiently.

In addition, we compete with foreign carriers, both on interior U.S. routes, due to marketing
and codesharing arrangements, and in international markets. Through marketing and codesharing
arrangements with U.S. carriers, foreign carriers have obtained access to interior U.S. passenger
traffic. Similarly, U.S. carriers have increased their ability to sell international
transportation, such as transatlantic services to and beyond European cities, through alliances
with international carriers. International marketing alliances formed by domestic and foreign
carriers, including the Star Alliance (among United Airlines, Continental, Lufthansa German
Airlines and others) and the oneworld Alliance (among American Airlines, British Airways and
others) have also significantly increased competition in international markets. The adoption of
liberalized Open Skies Aviation Agreements with an increasing number of countries around the world,
including in particular the Open Skies agreement between the United States and the Member States of
the European Union, has accelerated this trend. Similarly, the recent Open Skies agreement between
the United States and Japan could significantly increase competition among carriers serving those
markets.

The rapid spread of contagious illnesses can have a material adverse effect on our business and
results of operations.

The rapid spread of a contagious illness, such as the H1N1 flu virus, can have a material
adverse effect on the demand for worldwide air travel and therefore have a material adverse effect
on our business and results of operations. Acceleration of the spread of H1N1 during the flu
season in the Northern Hemisphere could have a significant adverse impact on the demand for air
travel and as a result our financial results in addition to the impact that we experienced during
the spring of 2009. Moreover, our operations could be negatively affected if employees are
quarantined as the result of exposure to a contagious illness. Similarly, travel restrictions or
operational problems resulting from the rapid spread of contagious illnesses in any part of the
world in which we operate may have a materially adverse impact on our business and results of
operations.

Terrorist attacks or international hostilities may adversely affect our business, financial
condition and operating results.

The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 caused fundamental and permanent changes in the
airline industry, including substantial revenue declines and cost increases, which resulted in
industry-wide liquidity issues. Additional terrorist attacks or fear of such attacks, even if not
made directly on the airline industry, could negatively affect us and the airline industry. The
potential negative effects include increased security, insurance and other costs and lost revenue
from increased ticket refunds and decreased ticket sales. Our financial resources might not be
sufficient to absorb the adverse effects of any further terrorist attacks or other international
hostilities involving the United States.



The airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation, and new regulations may
increase our operating costs.

Airlines are subject to
extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that result in
significant costs. For instance, the FAA from time to time
issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that
necessitate significant expenditures. We expect to continue incurring expenses to comply with the
FAA’s regulations.

Other laws, regulations, taxes and airport rates and charges have also been imposed from time
to time that significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce revenues. For example,
the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, which became law in November 2001, mandates the
federalization of certain airport security procedures and imposes additional security requirements
on airports and airlines, most of which are funded by a per ticket tax on passengers and a tax on
airlines. The federal government has on several occasions proposed a significant increase in the
per ticket tax. The proposed ticket tax increase, if implemented, could negatively impact our
results of operations.

Proposals to address congestion issues at certain airports or in certain airspace,
particularly in the Northeast United States, have included concepts such as “congestion-based”
landing fees, “slot auctions” or other alternatives that could impose a significant cost on the
airlines operating in those airports or airspace and impact the ability of those airlines to
respond to competitive actions by other airlines. Furthermore, events related to extreme weather
delays have caused Congress and the DOT to consider proposals related
to airlines’ handling of lengthy flight delays during extreme weather conditions. The recent
enactment of such a regulation by the DOT could have a
negative impact on our operations in certain circumstances.

Future regulatory action concerning climate change and aircraft emissions could have a
significant effect on the airline industry. For example, the European
Commission has adopted an emissions trading scheme applicable to all flights operating in the European Union,
including flights to and from the United States. We expect that such a system will impose
significant costs on our operations in the European Union. Other laws or regulations such as this
emissions trading scheme or other U.S. or foreign governmental actions may adversely affect our
operations and financial results, either through direct costs in our operations or through
increases in costs for jet fuel that could result from jet fuel suppliers passing on increased
costs that they incur under such a system.

We and other U.S. carriers are subject to domestic and foreign laws regarding privacy of
passenger and employee data that are not consistent in all countries in which we operate. In
addition to the heightened level of concern regarding privacy of passenger data in the United
States, certain European government agencies are initiating inquiries into airline privacy
practices. Compliance with these regulatory regimes is expected to result in additional operating
costs and could impact our operations and any future expansion.

Our insurance costs have increased substantially as a result of the September 11, 2001 terrorist
attacks, and further increases in insurance costs or reductions in coverage could have a material
adverse impact on our business and operating results.

As a result of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, aviation insurers significantly
reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for liability
to persons (other than employees or passengers) for claims resulting from acts of terrorism, war or
similar events. At the same time, aviation insurers significantly increased the premiums for such
coverage and for aviation insurance in general. Since September 24, 2001, the U.S. government has
been providing U.S. airlines with war-risk insurance to cover losses, including those resulting
from terrorism, to passengers, third parties (ground damage) and the aircraft hull. The coverage
currently extends through August 31, 2010. The withdrawal of government support of airline war-risk
insurance would require us to obtain war-risk insurance coverage commercially, if available. Such
commercial insurance could have substantially less desirable coverage than that currently provided
by the U.S. government, may not be adequate to protect our risk of loss from future acts of
terrorism, may result in a material increase to our operating expenses or may not be obtainable at
all, resulting in an interruption to our operations.

Aircraft Commitments

Future purchase commitments for aircraft as of December 31, 2009 are estimated to total
approximately $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010. Approximately $800 million of the
$1.1 billion is associated with the purchase of 20 B-737-800 aircraft for which we have entered
into definitive agreements to sell to third parties immediately following delivery of those
aircraft to us by the manufacturer. We have not received any notice that these parties have
defaulted on their purchase obligations. The remaining commitments relate to the purchase of two
B-777-200LR aircraft, two B-737-800 aircraft and 11 previously owned MD-90 aircraft. We have no
aircraft purchase commitments after December 31, 2010.



As of December 31, 2009, we have financing commitments from third parties or, with respect to
20 of the 22 B-737-800 aircraft referred to above, definitive agreements to sell, all aircraft
subject to purchase commitments, except for nine of the 11 previously owned MD-90 aircraft. Under
these financing commitments, third parties have agreed to finance on a long-term basis a
substantial portion of the purchase price of the covered aircraft.

Our aircraft purchase commitments described above do not include our orders for:

•

18 B-787-8 aircraft. The Boeing Company (“Boeing”) has informed us that Boeing
will be unable to meet the contractual delivery schedule for these aircraft. We are in
discussions with Boeing regarding this situation.

•

five A319-100 aircraft and two A320-200 aircraft. We have the right to cancel
these orders.

Ground Facilities

We lease most of the land and buildings that we occupy. Our largest aircraft maintenance
base, various computer, cargo, flight kitchen and training facilities and most of our principal
offices are located at or near the Atlanta airport, on land leased from the City of Atlanta
generally under long-term leases. We own our Atlanta reservations center, other real property in
Atlanta and the former NWA headquarters building and flight training buildings, which are located
near the Minneapolis/St. Paul International Airport. Other owned facilities include reservations
centers in Tampa, Florida, Minot, North Dakota and Chisholm, Minnesota, and a data processing
center in Eagan, Minnesota. We also own property in Tokyo, including a 1.3-acre site in downtown
Tokyo and a 33-acre land parcel, 512-room hotel and flight kitchen located near Tokyo’s Narita
International Airport.

We lease ticket counter and other terminal space, operating areas and air cargo facilities in
most of the airports that we serve. At most airports, we have entered into use agreements which
provide for the non-exclusive use of runways, taxiways, and other improvements and facilities;
landing fees under these agreements normally are based on the number of landings and weight of
aircraft. These leases and use agreements generally run for periods of less than one year to 30
years or more, and often contain provisions for periodic adjustments of lease rates, landing fees
and other charges applicable under that type of agreement. Examples of major leases and use
agreements at hub or other significant airports that will expire in the next few years include,
among others: (1) our Salt Lake City International Airport use and lease agreement, which expires
in 2010; and (2) our Memphis International Airport use and lease agreement, which expires in 2010.
We also lease aircraft maintenance facilities and air cargo facilities at certain airports,
including, among others: (1) our main Atlanta maintenance base; (2) our Atlanta air cargo
facilities and our hangar and air cargo facilities at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky
International Airport, Salt Lake City International Airport, Detroit Metropolitan International
Airport, Minneapolis/St. Paul International Airport and Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Our
aircraft maintenance facility leases generally require us to pay the cost of providing, operating
and maintaining such facilities, including, in some cases, amounts necessary to pay debt service on
special facility bonds issued to finance their construction. We also lease marketing, ticketing and
reservations offices in certain locations for varying terms.



In recent years, some airports have increased or sought to increase the rates charged to
airlines to levels that we believe are unreasonable. The extent to which such charges are limited
by statute or regulation and the ability of airlines to contest such charges has been subject to
litigation and to administrative proceedings before the DOT. If the limitations on such charges are
relaxed, or the ability of airlines to challenge such proposed rate increases is restricted, the
rates charged by airports to airlines may increase substantially.

The
City of Atlanta is currently implementing portions of a 10 year capital improvement
program (the “CIP”) at the Atlanta airport. Implementation of the CIP should increase the number of
flights that may operate at the airport and reduce flight delays. The CIP includes, among other
things, a 9,000 foot full-service runway that opened in May 2006, related airfield improvements,
additional terminal and gate capacity, new cargo and other support facilities and roadway and other
infrastructure improvements. The CIP will not be complete until at least 2012, with individual
projects scheduled to be constructed at different times. A combination of federal grants, passenger
facility charge revenues, increased user rentals and fees, and other airport funds are expected to
be used to pay CIP costs directly and through the payment of debt service on bonds. Certain
elements of the CIP have been delayed, some may be eliminated and there is no assurance that the
CIP will be fully implemented. Failure to implement certain portions of the CIP in a timely manner
could adversely impact our operations at the Atlanta airport.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

First Bag Fee Antitrust Litigation

In May, June and July, 2009, a number of purported class action antitrust lawsuits were filed
in the U.S. District Courts for the Northern District of Georgia, the Middle District of Florida,
and the District of Nevada, against Delta and AirTran Airways (“AirTran”).

In these cases, the plaintiffs originally alleged that Delta and AirTran engaged in collusive
behavior in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act in November 2008 based upon certain public
statements made in October 2008 by AirTran’s CEO at an analyst conference concerning fees for the
first checked bag, Delta’s imposition of a fee for the first checked bag on November 4, 2008 and
AirTran’s imposition of a similar fee on November 12, 2008. The plaintiffs sought to assert claims
on behalf of an alleged class consisting of passengers who paid the fist bag fee after December 5,
2008 and seek injunctive relief and unspecified treble damages. All of these cases have been
consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in the Northern District of Georgia by the Multi-District
Litigation (“MDL”) Panel.

In February 2010, the plaintiffs in the MDL proceeding filed a Consolidated Amended Class
Action Complaint which substantially expanded the scope of the original complaint. In the
consolidated amended complaint, the plaintiffs add new allegations concerning alleged signaling by
both Delta and AirTran based upon statements made to the investment community by both carriers
relating to industry capacity levels during 2008-2009. The plaintiffs also add a new cause of
action against Delta alleging attempted monopolization in violation of Sherman Act § 2, paralleling
a claim previously asserted against AirTran but not Delta.

We believe the claims in these cases are without merit and are
vigorously defending these lawsuits.

Chapter 11 Proceedings

On September 14, 2005, Delta and substantially all of its subsidiaries (the “Delta Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions for
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court. On April 25,
2007, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving and confirming the Plan of Reorganization and
the Plan of Reorganization became effective, allowing the  Delta Debtors to emerge from bankruptcy on April 30,
2007. The reorganization cases were jointly administered under the caption “In re Delta Air Lines,
Inc., et al., Case No. 05-17923-ASH.” As of the date of the Chapter 11 filing, then pending
litigation was generally stayed, and absent further order of the Bankruptcy Court, most parties may
not take any action to recover on pre-petition claims against the Delta Debtors.



Delta Family-Care Savings Plan Litigation

On March 16, 2005, a retired Delta employee filed an amended class action complaint in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against Delta, and certain current and former
Delta officers and  directors on behalf of himself and other
participants in the Delta Family-Care Savings Plan (“Savings Plan”). The amended complaint alleges
that the defendants were fiduciaries of the Savings Plan and, as such, breached their fiduciary
duties under ERISA to the plaintiff class by (1) allowing class members to direct their
contributions under the Savings Plan to a fund invested in Delta common stock; and (2) continuing
to hold Delta’s contributions to the Savings Plan in Delta’s common and preferred stock. The
amended complaint seeks damages unspecified in amount, but equal to the total loss of value in the
participants’ accounts from September 2000 through September 2004 from the investment in Delta
stock. Defendants deny that there was any breach of fiduciary duty. The District Court stayed the
action against Delta due to Delta’s Chapter 11 proceedings and granted a motion to dismiss filed by
the individual defendants. The Bankruptcy Court has ruled that a class claim filed against Delta in
its Chapter 11 proceedings will be subordinated to any claim related to equity interests in Delta,
which did not receive any distribution pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization. The plaintiff has appealed this order.

Canadian Passenger Surcharge Antitrust Litigation

On July 31, 2009, two parallel putative class actions were filed against a number of Canadian,
Asian, European, and U.S. carriers (including Delta) in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. Both
allege that the defendants colluded to fix the price of passenger surcharges, in Canada-Asia and
Canada-Europe markets respectively. There are no allegations in the complaints of any specific act
by Delta in furtherance of either conspiracy. The complaints seek damages in excess of $100
million. We believe the allegations against Delta are without merit and intend to vigorously defend
these cases.

Dividends

We expect to retain any future earnings to fund our operations and meet our cash and liquidity
needs. In addition, our ability to pay dividends or repurchase common stock is restricted under
credit facilities that we entered into in connection with our emergence from bankruptcy. Therefore,
we do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.



Stock Performance Graph

The following graph compares the cumulative total returns during the period from April 30,
2007 to December 31, 2009 of our common stock to the Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Index and the Amex
Airline Index. The comparison assumes $100 was invested on April 30, 2007 in each of our common
stock and the indices and assumes that all dividends were reinvested. Data for periods prior to
April 30, 2007 is not shown because of the period we were in bankruptcy and the lack of
comparability of financial results before and after April 30, 2007.

ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

On October 29, 2008, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours merged with and into Northwest Airlines Corporation. Our
Consolidated Financial Statements include the results of operations of Northwest and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries for the period from October 30 to December 31, 2008. For additional
information regarding purchase accounting, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

In September 2005, we and substantially all of our subsidiaries (the “Delta Debtors”) filed
voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On April 30, 2007 (the “Effective Date”), the Delta Debtors emerged from
bankruptcy. Upon emergence from Chapter 11, we adopted fresh start reporting which resulted in our
becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, consolidated financial data on
or after May 1, 2007 is not comparable to the consolidated financial data prior to that date.

References in this Form 10-K to “Successor” refer to Delta on or after May 1, 2007, after
giving effect to (1) the cancellation of Delta common stock issued prior to the Effective Date, (2)
the issuance of new Delta common stock and certain debt securities in accordance with the Delta
Debtors’ Joint Plan of Reorganization (“Delta’s Plan of Reorganization”), and (3) the application
of fresh start reporting. References to “Predecessor” refer to Delta prior to May 1, 2007.

The following table presents selected financial and operating data. We derived the
Consolidated Summary of Operations and Other Financial and Statistical Data for (1) the years ended
December 31, 2009 and 2008 of the Successor, (2) the eight months ended December 31, 2007 of the
Successor, (3) the four months ended April 30, 2007 of the Predecessor and (4) the years ended

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

General Information

We provide scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo throughout the United States
(“U.S.”) and around the world. On October 29, 2008 (the “Closing Date”), a wholly-owned subsidiary
of ours merged (the “Merger”) with and into Northwest
Airlines Corporation. On the Closing Date, Northwest Airlines
Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Northwest
Airlines, Inc. (collectively, “Northwest”), became
wholly-owned subsidiaries of Delta. On December 31, 2009, Northwest
Airlines, Inc. merged with and into Delta. As a result of this
merger, Northwest Airlines, Inc. ceased to exist as a separate entity. We
believe the Merger better positions us to manage through economic cycles and volatile fuel prices,
invest in our fleet, improve services for customers and achieve our strategic objectives.

Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). In accordance with GAAP, our financial results include the
results of Northwest for the periods after the Closing Date, but not for periods on or before the
Closing Date. Our financial results under GAAP for the year ended December 31, 2009 include the
results of Northwest for the full year. In contrast, our financial results under GAAP for the year
ended December 31, 2008 include the results of Northwest only from October 30 to December 31, 2008.
Accordingly, our financial results under GAAP for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 are
not comparable.

In the accompanying “Financial Highlights — 2009 GAAP Compared to 2008 Combined” and “Results
of Operations — 2009 GAAP Compared to 2008 Combined,” we sometimes use information that is derived
from our Consolidated Financial Statements, but that is not presented in accordance with GAAP.
Certain of this information is considered “non-GAAP financial measures” under the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission rules. These non-GAAP financial measures include financial information for
the year ended December 31, 2008 presented on a combined basis, which means the financial results
for pre-Merger Delta and pre-Merger Northwest are combined beginning January 1, 2008. We believe
this presentation of the 2008 financial results provides a more meaningful basis for comparing
Delta’s financial performance in 2009 and 2008. See “Results of Operations — 2009 GAAP Compared to
2008 Combined” and “Supplemental Information” below for the reasons we use combined and other
non-GAAP financial measures, as well as a reconciliation to the corresponding measures under GAAP.
The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be
considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results.

Financial Highlights — 2009 GAAP Compared to 2008 Combined

For 2009, we reported a net loss of $1.2 billion. These results reflect significant weakness
in the airline revenue environment due to the global recession and $1.4 billion in fuel hedge
losses. Our net loss for the year also includes a $407 million charge for merger-related items, a
$321 million non-cash income tax benefit and an $83 million non-cash loss on the extinguishment of
debt.

Total operating revenue declined $6.2 billion, or 18%, in 2009 on a 6% decrease in system
capacity, or available seat mile (“ASMs”), compared with 2008 on a combined basis. Passenger
revenue accounted for $5.9 billion of the decrease. Passenger revenue per ASM (“PRASM”) declined
14% on a 14% decrease in passenger mile yield. The decrease in passenger mile yield reflects (1)
significantly reduced demand, particularly in international markets, (2) a reduction in business
demand, (3) competitive pricing pressures and (4) lower fuel surcharges due to the year-over-year
decline on fuel prices.

Volatile fuel prices continue to represent a significant risk to our business and the airline
industry as a whole. While our fuel cost per gallon declined 35% in 2009 compared to 2008 on a
combined basis, contributing to $5.4 billion in lower fuel expense excluding the mark-to-market
adjustments related to fuel hedges settling in future periods, crude oil prices have risen 78% from
December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009.

We have focused on maintaining a competitive cost structure through disciplined spending,
productivity initiatives and accelerating Merger synergies. Our consolidated operating cost per ASM
(“CASM”), excluding special items (as defined in “Supplemental Information” below) and fuel
expense, increased 4% on a 6% lower capacity in 2009 compared to 2008 on a combined basis. The
increase primarily reflects an increase in pension expense from a decrease in value in pension
trust assets due to declines in the financial markets during 2008.



At December 31, 2009, we had $4.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments, and $685 million in undrawn revolving credit facilities. In 2009, we completed $3.2
billion in financing transactions. For additional information regarding these financing
transactions, see Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Business Overview

Recent Initiatives.

We believe that our global network, hub structure and alliances with other
airlines enables us to offer customers a service which results in a competitive advantage over other domestic and international airlines. In 2009,
we implemented a joint venture with Air France-KLM that further strengthens our transatlantic
network, expanded our alliance agreement with Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air to enhance our West
coast presence, and received U.S. Department of Transportation approval for a codesharing agreement
with Virgin Blue, which will expand our network between the U.S. and Australia and the South
Pacific.

Expanding our presence in New York City through increased corporate sales, improved facilities
and increased and new service from New York is a key component of our network strategy. For
example, we continue to make investments in our international operation at New York-JFK and explore
long-term options to upgrade the facility. In addition, in August 2009, we announced our intention
to make New York’s LaGuardia Airport a domestic hub through a slot transaction with US Airways. The
agreement calls for US Airways to transfer 125 operating slot pairs to us at LaGuardia and for us
to transfer 42 operating slot pairs to US Airways at Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C. We
also plan to swap gates at LaGuardia to consolidate all of our operations (including the Delta
Shuttle) into an expanded main terminal facility with 11 additional gates. The U.S. Department of
Transportation has issued a tentative order on the transaction that would require the
divestiture of 20 slot pairs at LaGuardia and 14 slot pairs at Reagan National. We and US Airways are
reviewing the tentative order to determine our next steps.

We also plan to invest $1 billion through mid-2013 to improve the customer experience and the
efficiency of our aircraft fleet. Planned enhancements include installing full flat-bed seats in
BusinessElite on 90 trans-oceanic aircraft, adding in-seat audio and video throughout Economy Class
on 68 widebody aircraft, adding First Class cabins to 66 CRJ-700 aircraft and installing winglets
on more than 170 aircraft to extend aircraft range and increase fuel efficiency.

Merger Synergies.

As a result of our integration efforts, we achieved more than $700 million
in Merger synergy benefits in 2009, and we are targeting an additional $600 million in Merger
synergy benefits in 2010. In 2009, we completed a significant portion of our Merger integration,
including combining frequent flyer programs, consolidating and rebranding all airport facilities
and achieving a single operating certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration. Our ability
to fully realize targeted annual synergies of $2 billion by 2012 is dependent on various factors,
including the integration of technologies of the two pre-Merger airlines, which we expect to occur
in the first half of 2010. In January 2010, we completed the integration of the Northwest
reservations system, including the transition of Northwest flights and passenger reservations into
the Delta system.

Results of Operations — 2009 GAAP Compared to 2008 Combined

In this section, we compare Delta’s results of operations under GAAP for the year ended
December 31, 2009 with Delta’s results on a combined basis for the year ended December 31, 2008.

As discussed in “General Information” above, Delta’s results of operations for 2008 on a
combined basis add (1) Delta’s results of operations under GAAP for 2008, which includes
Northwest’s results from October 30 to December 31, 2008; and (2) Northwest’s results from January
1 to October 29, 2008. We believe this presentation of the 2008 financial results provides a more
meaningful basis for comparing Delta’s financial performance in 2009 and 2008.

Mainline Passenger Revenue.

Mainline passenger revenue decreased in 2009 compared to 2008
on a combined basis primarily due to weakened demand for air travel from the global recession,
capacity reductions and the effects of the H1N1 virus on passenger travel. Passenger mile yield and
PRASM both declined 15%.

•

Domestic Passenger Revenue

. Domestic passenger revenue decreased 20% from a 14%
decrease in PRASM on an 8% decline in capacity. The passenger mile yield decreased 14%,
reflecting (1) a reduction in business demand due to the global recession, (2) an overall
decrease in average fares due to competitive pricing pressures and (3) lower fuel
surcharges due to the year-over-year decline in fuel prices.

•

International Passenger Revenue

. International passenger revenue decreased 24% from
an 18% decrease in PRASM on an 7% decline in capacity. The passenger mile yield decreased
17%, reflecting (1) significantly reduced demand for international travel, (2)
competitive pricing pressures (especially in the Atlantic market, which experienced a 20%
decrease in passenger mile yield), primarily from a significant decrease in business
demand due to the global recession and (3) the impact of the H1N1 virus, most notably in
the Pacific and Latin America markets. The decrease in passenger mile yield in the Atlantic market also reflects
unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and lower fuel surcharges due to the
year-over-year decline in fuel prices.



Regional carriers

. Passenger revenue of regional carriers declined $804 million primarily as a
result of a 13% decrease in passenger mile yield while traffic and capacity remained flat. The
decrease in passenger mile yield reflects (1) a reduction in demand for air travel due to the
global recession and (2) an overall decrease in average fares due to competitive pricing pressures.

Cargo

. Cargo revenue decreased due to capacity reductions, significantly reduced cargo yields
and international volume as a result of the global recession, and lower fuel surcharges due to the
year-over-year decline in fuel prices. During 2009, we retired our remaining 10 dedicated freighter
B-747-200F aircraft, which contributed to a 40% decline in capacity.

Other, net

. Other, net revenue increased $241 million primarily due to new or increased
baggage handling fees and higher SkyMiles program revenue, partially offset by decreased revenue
from our alliance agreements and a reduction in our aircraft maintenance and repair service.

Aircraft fuel and related taxes

. Aircraft fuel and related taxes decreased $5.0 billion in
2009 compared to 2008 on a combined basis primarily due to (1) $4.8 billion associated with lower
average fuel prices and (2) $858 million from a 7% decline in fuel consumption due to capacity
reductions. These decreases were partially offset by $1.4 billion in fuel hedge losses for 2009,
compared to $666 million in fuel hedge losses for 2008. The fuel hedge losses in 2009 are primarily
from hedges purchased in 2008 during the period fuel prices reached record highs and were expected
to continue to rise.

Salaries and related costs

. Salaries and related costs increased $289 million due to (1) pay
increases for pilot and non-pilot frontline employees, (2) higher pension expense from a decline in
the value of our defined benefit plan assets as a result of market conditions and (3) Delta airline
tickets awarded to employees as part of an employee recognition program. These increases were
partially offset by a 5% average decrease in headcount primarily related to workforce reduction
programs.

Contract carrier arrangements

. Contract carrier arrangements expense decreased $844 million
primarily due to decreases of (1) $714 million associated with lower average fuel prices and (2)
$119 million from a 7% decline in fuel consumption due to capacity reductions.

Depreciation and amortization.

Depreciation and amortization decreased $784 million as a
result of (1) $641 million in impairment related charges recorded in the year ended December 31,
2008, primarily related to certain definite-lived intangible assets and aircraft, and (2) $125
million related to the December 2008 multi-year extension of our co-brand credit card relationship
with American Express (the “American Express Agreement”), extending the useful life of the American
Express Agreement intangible asset to the date the contract expires.

Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs.

Aircraft maintenance materials and outside
repairs decreased $347 million primarily from capacity reductions.

Passenger commissions and other selling expenses.

Passenger commissions and other selling
expenses decreased $362 million primarily in connection with the passenger revenue decrease.

Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets.

During 2008, we experienced a significant
decline in market capitalization primarily from record high fuel prices and overall airline
industry conditions. In addition, the announcement of our intention to merge with Northwest
established a stock exchange ratio based on the relative valuation of Delta and Northwest. We
determined goodwill was impaired and recorded a non-cash charge of $10.2 billion on a combined
basis. We also recorded a non-cash charge of $955 million on a combined basis to reduce the
carrying value of certain intangible assets based on their revised estimated fair values.

Restructuring and merger-related items.

Restructuring and merger-related items decreased $949
million, primarily due to the following:

•

During 2009, we recorded a $288 million charge for merger-related items associated
with integrating the operations of Northwest into Delta, including costs related to
information technology, employee relocation and training, and re-branding of aircraft and
stations. We expect to incur total cash costs of approximately $500 million over
approximately three years to integrate the two airlines.

•

For 2009, we recorded a $119 million charge in connection with employee workforce
reduction programs.

•

During 2008, we recorded $1.2 billion primarily in non-cash, merger-related charges
related to the issuance or vesting of employee equity awards in connection with the
Merger and $114 million in restructuring and related charges in connection with voluntary
workforce reduction programs. In addition, we recorded charges of $25 million related to
the closure of certain facilities and $14 million associated with the early termination
of certain contract carrier arrangements.

Other expense, net for 2009 was $1.3 billion, compared to $1.2 billion for 2008 on a combined
basis. This change is primarily attributable to (1) a $200 million increase in interest expense
from increased amortization of debt discount, (2) a $151 million decrease in interest income
primarily from significantly reduced short-term interest rates, (3) an $83 million non-cash loss
for the write-off of the unamortized discount on the extinguishment of the Northwest senior secured
exit financing facility (the “Bank Credit Facility”) and (4) a $421 million favorable change in

We consider all income sources, including other comprehensive income, in determining the
amount of tax benefit that should be allocated to continuing operations. For 2009, we recorded an
income tax benefit of $344 million, including a non-cash income tax benefit of $321 million on the
loss from continuing operations, with an offsetting non-cash income tax expense of $321 million on
other comprehensive income. We did not record an income tax benefit for the remainder of our loss
for 2009. The deferred tax asset resulting from such a net operating loss was fully reserved by a
valuation allowance.

We recorded an income tax benefit of $330 million for 2008 on a combined basis as a result of
the impairment of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. The impairment of goodwill did not result
in an income tax benefit as goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. We did not record
an income tax benefit as a result of our loss for 2008. The deferred tax asset resulting from such
a net operating loss is fully reserved by a valuation allowance.



Results of Operations—2008 GAAP Compared to 2007 Predecessor plus Successor

In September 2005, we and substantially all of our subsidiaries (the “Delta Debtors”) filed
voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On April 30, 2007 (the “Effective Date”), the Delta Debtors emerged from
bankruptcy. References in this Form 10-K to “Successor” refer to Delta on or after May 1, 2007,
after giving effect to (1) the cancellation of Delta common stock issued prior to the Effective
Date; (2) the issuance of new Delta common stock and certain debt securities in accordance with the
Delta Debtors’ Joint Plan of Reorganization (“Delta’s Plan of Reorganization”); and (3) the
application of fresh start reporting. References to “Predecessor” refer to Delta prior to May 1,
2007.

We adopted fresh start reporting upon emergence from Chapter 11, which resulted in our
becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes. Due to our adoption of fresh start
reporting on April 30, 2007, the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2007
include the results of operations for (1) the four months ended April 30, 2007 of the Predecessor
and (2) the eight months ended December 31, 2007 of the Successor.

In this section, we added the results of operations for the four months ended April 30, 2007
of the Predecessor with the eight months ended December 31, 2007 of the Successor. We then compared
(1) Delta’s results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 under GAAP with (2) the 2007
Predecessor plus Successor results. We believe this presentation of the 2007 financial results
provides a more meaningful basis for comparing Delta’s financial performance in 2008 and 2007.

Northwest Operations.

As a result of the Merger, our results of operations under GAAP for
2008 include Northwest’s operations for the period from October 30 to December 31, 2008, which
increased our operating revenue by $2.0 billion in 2008 compared to the 2007 Predecessor plus
Successor results. The addition of Northwest to our operations for that period increased ASMs, or
capacity, 10% for the full year.

Mainline Passenger Revenue.

Mainline passenger revenue increased in 2008 compared to the
2007 Predecessor plus Successor results primarily due to (1) the inclusion of Northwest’s operations,
(2) fare increases in response to increased fuel charges, (3) pricing and scheduling initiatives
and (4) our increased service to international destinations. The increase in passenger revenue
reflects a rise of 6% and 7% in passenger mile yield and PRASM, respectively.

•

Domestic Passenger Revenue

. Domestic passenger revenue increased 8%, due to a 2.1
point increase in load factor and a 6% increase in PRASM on a 1% increase in capacity.
The passenger mile yield increased 4%. The increases in passenger revenue and PRASM
reflect (1) the inclusion of Northwest’s operations and (2) fare increases, higher yields
and our reduction of domestic flights in response to high fuel prices and the slowing
economy. Excluding Northwest’s operations, we reduced domestic capacity by 7% for the
year.

•

International Passenger Revenue

. International passenger revenue increased 38%, due
to a 27% increase in capacity from growth in our international operations and the
inclusion of Northwest’s operations, and a 9% increase in PRASM. The passenger mile yield
increased 9% due to fuel surcharges and increases in service to international
destinations, primarily in the Atlantic and Latin America markets, from the restructuring
of our route network. Excluding Northwest’s operations, we increased international
capacity by 14% for the year.

Regional carriers

. Passenger revenue of regional affiliates increased due to the
inclusion of Northwest’s operations. Excluding Northwest’s operations, regional carriers revenue
declined $58 million primarily due to an 8% decrease in capacity in response to high fuel prices
and the slowing economy, as well as the termination of certain contract carrier agreements.

Cargo

. Cargo revenue increased due to the inclusion of Northwest’s operations and an increase
in fuel surcharges, improved cargo yields, and higher international volume.

Other, net

. Other, net revenue increased primarily due to the inclusion of Northwest’s
operations. Excluding Northwest’s operations, other, net revenue increased $485 million primarily
due to (1) new or increased administrative service charges and baggage handling fees, (2) growth in
aircraft maintenance and staffing services to third parties and (3) higher SkyMiles program
revenue.

Restructuring and merger-related items include $333 million in one-time
merger-related charges, as discussed below related to Northwest for the period from October 30
to December 31, 2008.

Northwest Operations.

As a result of the Merger, our results of operations under GAAP for
2008 include Northwest’s operations for the period from October 30 to December 31, 2008, which
increased operating expense by $2.1 billion in 2008 compared to the 2007 Predecessor plus Successor
results. The addition of Northwest for that period increased capacity 10% for the full year.

Restructuring and merger-related items.

Restructuring and merger-related items totaled a $1.1
billion charge, primarily consisting of the following:

•

Merger-related charges.

$978 million in one-time primarily non-cash charges
relating to the issuance or vesting of employee equity awards in connection with the
Merger.

•

Severance and related costs.

$114 million in restructuring and related charges in
connection with two voluntary workforce reduction programs for U.S. non-pilot employees
announced in March 2008 in which approximately 4,200 employees elected to participate.

•

Facilities and other.

$25 million in facilities charges primarily related to
accruals for future lease obligations for previously announced plans to close operations
in Concourse C at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport (the “Cincinnati
Airport”).



•

Contract carrier restructuring.

$14 million in charges associated with the early
termination of certain capacity purchase agreements with regional air carriers.

Impairments.

During 2008, we experienced a significant decline in market capitalization
primarily from record high fuel prices and overall airline industry conditions. In addition, the
announcement of our intention to merge with Northwest established a stock exchange ratio based on
the relative valuation of Delta and Northwest. As a result, we determined goodwill was impaired and
recorded a non-cash charge of $6.9 billion. We also recorded a non-cash charge of $357 million to
reduce the carrying value of certain intangible assets based on their revised estimated fair
values.

Fuel expense

. Fuel expense, including contract carriers, increased $2.2 billion, primarily due
to higher average fuel prices, which were partially offset by fuel hedge gains and reduced
consumption from lower capacity. Fuel prices averaged $3.18 per gallon, including fuel hedge gains
of $134 million, for 2008, compared to $2.24 per gallon, including fuel hedge gains of $51 million,
for 2007.

Salaries and related costs.

Salaries and related costs increased $66 million primarily from a
6% average increase in pilots and flight attendants to staff increased international flying, annual
pay increases for all pilot and non-pilot non-management employees, and increases in group
insurance rates, partially offset by a 3% average decrease in headcount primarily related to two
voluntary workforce reduction programs.

Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs.

Aircraft maintenance materials and outside
repairs increased $73 million primarily due to growth in our third party maintenance and repair
business.

Passenger service.

Passenger service increased $67 million primarily associated with (1) the
increased cost of catering on international flights, (2) product upgrades in our Business Elite
cabins and (3) unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.

Profit sharing.

In 2007, we recorded a $158 million charge related to our broad-based employee
profit sharing plan. We did not record any profit sharing expense in 2008. This plan provides that,
for each year in which we have an annual pre-tax profit (as defined), we will pay at least 15% of
that profit to eligible employees.

Other (Expense) Income

Other expense, net for 2008 was $727 million, compared to $492 million for 2007. This change
is attributable to (1) a $53 million, or 8%, increase in interest expense primarily due to a higher
level of debt outstanding, including Northwest debt for the period from October 30 to December 31,
2008 and the borrowing of the entire amount of our $1.0 billion exit revolving credit facility,
partially offset by the repayment of our debtor-in-possession financing facilities (the “DIP
Facility”) and other higher floating rate debt in connection with our emergence from Chapter 11,
(2) a $36 million decrease in interest income primarily from lower cash balances prior to the
Merger and lower interest rates compared to 2007 and (3) a $146 million unfavorable change in
miscellaneous, net due to the following:

Reorganization Items, Net

Reorganization items, net totaled a $1.2 billion gain for 2007, primarily consisting of the
following:

Income Taxes

We recorded an income tax benefit of $119 million for 2008 due to the impairment of our
indefinite-lived intangible assets. The impairment of goodwill did not result in an income tax
benefit as goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. We did not record an income tax
benefit as a result of our loss for 2008. The deferred tax asset resulting from such a net
operating loss is fully reserved by a valuation allowance.

For 2007, we recorded an income tax provision totaling $207 million. We recorded a full
valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets, excluding the effect of the deferred tax
liabilities that are unable to be used as a source of income against these deferred tax assets,
based on our belief that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized in the
future. Under accounting guidance applicable in 2007, any reduction in the valuation allowance as a
result of the recognition of deferred tax assets was adjusted through goodwill, followed by other
indefinite-lived intangible assets until the net carrying cost of these assets was zero.
Accordingly, during 2007, we reduced goodwill by $211 million with respect to the realization of
pre-emergence deferred tax assets.



Financial Condition and Liquidity

We expect to meet our cash needs for 2010 from cash flows from operations, cash and cash
equivalents, short-term investments and financing arrangements. Our cash and cash equivalents and
short-term investments were $4.7 billion at December 31, 2009. We also have $685 million of
additional cash available from undrawn credit facilities. As of December 31, 2009, we have
financing commitments from third parties, or definitive agreements to sell, all aircraft subject to
purchase commitments, except for nine previously owned MD-90 aircraft. Under these financing
commitments third parties have agreed to finance on a long-term basis a substantial portion of the
purchase price of the covered aircraft. For additional information regarding our aircraft purchase
commitments, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The global economic recession weakened demand for air travel, decreasing our revenue and
negatively impacting our liquidity. In an effort to lessen the impact of the global recession, we
implemented initiatives to reduce costs, increase revenues and preserve liquidity, primarily
through reducing capacity to align with demand, workforce reduction programs and the acceleration
of Merger synergy benefits.

Our ability to obtain additional financing, if needed, on acceptable terms could be affected
by the fact that substantially all of our assets are subject to liens.

Significant Liquidity Events

Significant liquidity events during 2009 were as follows:

•

In September 2009, we borrowed a total of $2.1 billion under three new financings,
consisting of: (1) $750 million of senior secured credit facilities, which include a $500
million first-lien revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility”) and a $250
million first-lien term loan facility; (2) $750 million of senior secured notes; and (3)
$600 million of senior second lien notes. A portion of the net proceeds was used to repay
in full the Bank Credit Facility due in 2010 with the remainder of the proceeds available
for general corporate purposes.

•

In November 2009, we issued $689 million of Pass Through Certificates, Series
2009-1 through two separate trusts (the “2009-1 EETC”). We used $342 million of the net
proceeds of the 2009-1 EETC offering to prepay existing mortgage financings for five
aircraft that were delivered and financed earlier in 2009 and for
general corporate purposes. We intend to use the remaining
$347 million of the net proceeds of the 2009-1 EETC, which are currently held in escrow,
to repay a portion of the refinancing of 22 aircraft that currently secure our 2000-1
EETC.

•

In 2009, we entered into two revolving credit facilities for a total of $250
million. We also received the proceeds from the issuance of $150 million in unsecured tax
exempt bonds. In addition, a $300 million revolving credit facility terminated on its
maturity date.

For additional information regarding these matters and other liquidity events, see Note 6 of
the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Sources and Uses of Cash

In this section, we review the sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2009
and 2008 under GAAP. For 2007, we added Delta’s sources and uses of cash for the four months ended
April 30, 2007 of the Predecessor with the eight months ended December 31, 2007 of the Successor.
We believe the 2007 Predecessor plus Successor sources and uses of cash provides a more meaningful
perspective on Delta’s cash flows for 2007 than if we did not present this information in this
manner.

Cash flows from operating activities

Cash provided by operating activities totaled $1.4 billion for 2009, primarily reflecting (1)
the return from counterparties of $1.1 billion of hedge margin primarily used to settle hedge
losses recognized during
the period and (2) $690 million in net income after adjusting for non-cash items such as
depreciation and amortization.



Cash used in operating activities totaled $1.7 billion for 2008, primarily reflecting (1) an
increase in aircraft fuel payments due to record high fuel prices for most of the year, (2) the
posting of $680 million in margin with counterparties primarily from our estimated fair value loss
position on our fuel hedge contracts at December 31, 2008, (3) the payment of $438 million in
premiums for fuel hedge derivatives entered into during 2008,
(4) a $374 million decrease in
advance ticket sales due to the slowing economy and (5) the payment of $158 million in 2008 under
our broad-based employee profit sharing plan related to 2007. Cash used in operating activities was
partially offset by cash flows driven by a $3.5 billion increase in operating revenue, $2.0 billion
of which is directly attributable to Northwest’s operations since the Closing Date.

Cash provided by operating activities totaled $1.4 billion for 2007, primarily reflecting $875
million in cash used under Delta’s Plan of Reorganization to satisfy bankruptcy-related obligations
under our comprehensive agreement with ALPA and settlement agreement with the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation. Cash flows from operating activities during 2007 also reflect (1) the release
of $804 million from restricted cash pursuant to an amendment to our Visa/Mastercard credit card
processing agreement, (2) revenue and network productivity improvements, including right-sizing
capacity to better meet customer demand and the continued restructuring of our route network to
reduce less productive short haul domestic flights and reallocate widebody aircraft to
international routes and (3) a $476 million decrease in short-term investments primarily from sales
of auction rate securities.

Cash flows from investing activities

Cash used in investing activities totaled $1.0 billion for 2009, primarily reflecting net
investments of $951 million for flight equipment and $251 million for ground property and
equipment. Cash used in investing activities was partially offset by (1) a $142 million
distribution of our investment in The Reserve Primary Fund and (2) $100 million of proceeds from
the sale of flight equipment.

Cash provided by investing activities totaled $1.6 billion for 2008, primarily reflecting (1)
the inclusion of $2.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents from Northwest in the Merger and (2)
$609 million in restricted cash and cash equivalents, primarily related to $500 million of cash
from a Northwest borrowing that was released from escrow. These inflows were partially offset by
investments of $1.3 billion for flight equipment and $241 million for ground property and
equipment.

Cash used in investing activities totaled $625 million for 2007, primarily reflecting
investments of $810 million for flight equipment and advanced payments for aircraft commitments and
$226 million for ground property and equipment. During 2007, restricted cash decreased by $185
million. In addition, we received $34 million and $83 million from the sale of our investments in
priceline.com Incorporated and ARINC Incorporated, respectively.

Cash flows from financing activities

Cash used in financing activities totaled $19 million for 2009, primarily reflecting $3.0
billion in proceeds from long-term debt and aircraft financing, largely associated with the
issuance of (1) $2.1 billion under three new financings (as discussed above), (2) $342 million from
the 2009-1 EETC offering (with the remaining proceeds held in escrow) and (3) $150 million of tax
exempt bonds, mostly offset by the repayment of $2.9 billion in long-term debt and capital lease
obligations, including the Bank Credit Facility and the Revolving Facility.

Cash provided by financing activities totaled $1.7 billion for 2008, primarily reflecting (1)
$1.0 billion in borrowings under a revolving credit facility, (2) $1.0 billion received under the
American Express Agreement for an advance purchase of SkyMiles, and (3) $1.0 billion from aircraft
financing. Cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by the repayment of $1.6
billion of long-term debt and capital lease obligations.



Cash used in financing activities totaled $120 million for 2007, primarily reflecting (1) the
repayment of the DIP Facility with a portion of the proceeds available under the senior secured
exit financing facility and existing cash, (2) the prepayment of $863 million of secured debt with
a portion of the proceeds from the sale of enhanced equipment trust certificates and (3) scheduled
principal payments on long-term debt and capital lease obligations. During 2007, we also received
$181 million in proceeds from an amendment to certain financing arrangements in which the
outstanding principal amount was increased.

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009. The table
does not include commitments that are contingent on events or other factors that are uncertain or
unknown at this time, some of which are discussed in footnotes to this table and in the text
immediately following the footnotes. Results that vary significantly from our assumptions could
have a material impact on our contractual obligations.

Includes the principal amount of our long-term debt, which is also included
in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The table also includes interest payments related to
long-term debt, but excludes the impact of our interest rate hedges. Estimated amounts for
future interest and related payments in connection with our long-term debt obligations are
based on the fixed and variable interest rates specified in the associated debt agreements.
Estimates on variable rate interest were calculated using implied short-term LIBOR based on
LIBOR at December 31, 2009.

The table also includes (a) payments for credit enhancements required in conjunction with certain financing
agreements and (b) debt recorded in connection with the American Express Agreement. As part of
the American Express Agreement, we received $1.0 billion from American Express for an advance
purchase of SkyMiles. Our obligation to American Express will be satisfied through use of
SkyMiles by American Express over an expected two year period that begins in December 2010.

(2)

Represents our minimum fixed obligations under our contract carrier agreements
(excluding contract carrier aircraft lease payments accounted for as operating leases).

(3)

Represents minimum funding requirements under government
regulations for all of our qualified defined benefit pension plans based on actuarially determined estimates and
projected future benefit payments from all of our unfunded other postretirement and other
postemployment plans. For additional information regarding our qualified defined benefit
pension plans, see “Pension Obligations” below.

(4)

Includes our noncancelable operating leases and our lease payments related to
aircraft under our contract carrier agreements.

(5)

Approximately $800 million of this amount is associated with our orders to purchase
20 B-737-800 aircraft for which we have entered into definitive agreements to sell to
third parties immediately following delivery of these aircraft to us by the manufacturer. We
have not received any notice that these parties have defaulted on their purchase obligations.

The table excludes our order of 18 B-787-8 aircraft. The Boeing Company (“Boeing”) has informed
us that Boeing will be unable to meet the contractual delivery schedule for these aircraft. We
are in discussions with Boeing regarding this situation. The table also excludes our order for
five A319-100 aircraft and two A320-200 aircraft since we have the right to cancel these
orders.

(6)

Includes interest payments related to capital lease obligations. The present value
of these obligations, excluding interest, is included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

(7)

Primarily includes purchase obligations pursuant to which we are required to make
minimum payments for goods and services, including but not limited to insurance, outsourced
human resource services, marketing, maintenance, technology, sponsorships and other third
party services and products.



(8)

In addition to the contractual obligations included in the table, we have
significant cash obligations that are not included in the table. For example, we will pay
wages required under collective bargaining agreements, purchase capacity under contract
carrier arrangements (as discussed below), settle tax contingency reserves (as discussed
below), pay credit card processing fees and pay fees for other goods and services, including
those related to fuel, maintenance and commissions. While we are parties to legally binding
contracts regarding these goods and services, the actual commitment is contingent on certain
factors such as volume and/or variable rates that are uncertain or unknown at this time.
Therefore, these items are not included in the table. In addition, purchase orders made in the
ordinary course of business are excluded from the table and any amounts which we are liable
for under the purchase orders are included in current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets. Payments under our profit-sharing plan or pursuant to our 2007 Performance
Compensation Plan are contingent on factors unknown at this time and, therefore, are not
included in this table.

Pension Obligations.

We sponsor a defined benefit pension plan for eligible non-pilot
Delta employees and retirees (the “Delta Non-Pilot Plan”) and defined benefit pension plans for
eligible Northwest employees and retirees (the “Northwest Pension Plans”), all of which have been
frozen for future benefit accruals. Our funding obligations for these plans are governed by the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act.

The Pension Protection Act of 2006 allows commercial airlines to elect alternative funding
rules (“Alternative Funding Rules”) for defined benefit plans that are frozen. Under the
Alternative Funding Rules, the unfunded liability for a frozen defined benefit plan may be funded
over a fixed 17-year period. The unfunded liability is defined as the actuarial liability and is
calculated using an 8.85% interest rate. Delta elected the Alternative Funding Rules for the Delta
Non-Pilot Plan, effective April 1, 2007; and Northwest elected the Alternative Funding Rules for
the Northwest Pension Plans, effective October 1, 2006. We estimate that the funding requirements
under these plans will be approximately $720 million in 2010.

While this legislation makes our funding obligations for these plans more predictable, factors
outside our control continue to have an impact on the funding requirements. Estimates of future
funding requirements are based on various assumptions and can vary materially from actual funding
requirements. Assumptions include, among other things, the actual and projected market performance
of assets; statutory requirements; and demographic data for participants.

The following items are not included in the table above:

. During the year ended December 31, 2009, six regional air
carriers (“Contract Carriers”) operated for us (in addition to our wholly-owned subsidiaries,
Comair, Compass Airlines, Inc. (“Compass”) and Mesaba Aviation, Inc. (“Mesaba”)) pursuant to
capacity purchase agreements. Under these agreements, the regional air carriers operate some or all
of their aircraft using our flight designator codes, and we control the scheduling, pricing,
reservations, ticketing and seat inventories of those aircraft and retain the revenues associated
with those flights. We pay those airlines an amount, as defined in the applicable agreement, which
is based on a determination of their cost of operating those flights and other factors intended to
approximate market rates for those services.

The above table shows our minimum fixed obligations under these capacity purchase agreements
(excluding Comair, Compass and Mesaba). The obligations set forth in the table contemplate minimum
levels of flying by the Contract Carriers under the respective agreements and also reflect
assumptions regarding certain costs associated with the minimum levels of flying such as for fuel,
labor, maintenance, insurance, catering, property tax and landing fees. Accordingly, our actual
payments under these agreements could differ materially from the minimum fixed obligations set
forth in the table above.

For information regarding payments we may be required to make in connection with certain
terminations of our capacity purchase agreements with Chautauqua Airlines, Inc. and Shuttle America
Corporation, see “Contingencies Related to Termination of Contract Carrier Agreements” in Note 8 of
the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Uncertain Tax Positions.

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet at December 31, 2009 is $66 million. We are currently under audit by the Internal
Revenue Service (the “IRS”) for the 2008 and 2009 tax years.



Legal Contingencies

. We are involved in various legal proceedings relating to employment
practices, environmental issues, bankruptcy matters, antitrust matters and other matters concerning
our business. We cannot reasonably estimate the potential loss for certain legal proceedings
because, for example, the litigation is in its early stages or the plaintiff does not specify the
damages being sought.

Other Contingent Obligations under Contracts

. In addition to the contractual obligations
discussed above, we have certain contracts for goods and services that require us to pay a penalty,
acquire inventory specific to us or purchase contract specific equipment, as defined by each
respective contract, if we terminate the contract without cause prior to its expiration date.
Because these obligations are contingent on our termination of the contract without cause prior to
its expiration date, no obligation would exist unless such a termination occurs.

For additional information about other contingencies not discussed above, as well as
information related to general indemnifications, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Application of Critical Accounting Policies

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
certain estimates and assumptions. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions, which
are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that
management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially
from these estimates.

Frequent Flyer Programs.

We have a frequent flyer program (the “SkyMiles Program”) offering
incentives to increase travel on Delta. This program allows participants to earn mileage credits by
flying on Delta, Contract Carriers and participating airlines, as well as through participating
companies such as credit card companies, hotels and car rental agencies. We also sell mileage
credits to other airlines and to non-airline businesses. Mileage credits can be redeemed for free
or upgraded air travel on Delta and participating airlines, for membership in our Sky Club and for
other program awards.

In the Merger, we assumed Northwest’s frequent flyer program (the “WorldPerks Program”). In
October 2009, we completed the consolidation of the SkyMiles and WorldPerks Programs, which
combined miles from each program at a one-to-one ratio. The WorldPerks Program was accounted for
under the same methodology as the SkyMiles Program.

We use the residual method for revenue recognition of mileage credits. The fair value of the
mileage credit component is determined based on prices at which we sell mileage credits to other
airlines, currently $0.0054 per mile, and is re-evaluated at least annually. Under the residual
method, the portion of the revenue from the sale of mileage credits
and the mileage component of passenger ticket sales that approximates fair value is
deferred and recognized as passenger revenue when miles are redeemed and services are provided
based on the weighted- average price of all miles that have been deferred. The portion of the
revenue received in excess of the fair value of mileage credits sold is recognized in income when the related marketing
services are provided and classified as other, net revenue.

For mileage credits which we estimate are not likely to be redeemed (“Breakage”), we recognize
the associated value proportionally during the period in which the remaining mileage credits are
expected to be redeemed. The estimate of Breakage is based on historical redemption patterns. A
change in assumptions as to the period over which mileage credits are expected to be redeemed, the
actual redemption activity for mileage credits or the estimated fair value of mileage credits
expected to be redeemed could have a material impact on our revenue in the year in which the change
occurs and in future years. At December 31, 2009, the aggregate deferred revenue balance associated
with the SkyMiles Program was $4.8 billion. A hypothetical 1% change in our outstanding number of
miles estimated to be redeemed would result in a $33 million impact on our deferred revenue
liability at December 31, 2009.



Purchase Accounting Measurements.

On the Closing Date, Northwest revalued its assets and
liabilities at fair value. This revaluation did not impact earnings; it did impact the calculation
of goodwill related to the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and
identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Northwest in the Merger.
Additional changes in the fair values of these assets and liabilities from the current estimated
values, as well as changes in other assumptions, could significantly impact earnings.

The fair value of Northwest’s debt and capital lease obligations was determined by estimating
the present value of amounts to be paid at appropriate interest rates as of the Closing Date. These
rates were determined with swap rates, LIBOR rates and market spreads as of the Closing Date. The
market spreads, which were determined with the assistance of third party financial institutions,
considered the credit risk and the structure of the debt and capital lease obligations as well as
the underlying collateral supporting the obligations.

Fair value measurements for goodwill and other intangible assets included significant
unobservable inputs, which generally include a five-year business plan, 12 months of historical
revenues and expenses by city pair, projections of available seat miles, revenue passenger miles,
load factors, operating costs per available seat mile and a discount rate.

One of the significant unobservable inputs underlying the intangible fair value measurements
performed on the Closing Date is the discount rate. We determined the discount rate using the
weighted average cost of capital of the airline industry, which was measured using a Capital Asset
Pricing Model (“CAPM”). The CAPM in the valuation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles
utilized a 50% debt and 50% equity structure. The historical average debt-to-equity structure of
the major airlines since 1990 is also approximately 50% debt and 50% equity, which was similar to
Northwest’s debt-to-equity structure at emergence from Chapter 11. The return on debt was measured
using a bid-to-yield analysis of major airline corporate bonds. The expected market rate of return
for equity was measured based on the risk free rate, the airline industry beta and risk premiums
based on the Federal Reserve Statistical Release H. 15 or Ibbotson

®

Stocks,
Bonds, Bills, and Inflation

®

Valuation Yearbook, Edition 2008. These factors
resulted in a 13% discount rate.

The fair value of Northwest’s pension and postretirement plans was determined by measuring the
plans’ funded status as of the Closing Date. Any excess projected benefit obligation over the fair
value of plan assets was recognized as a liability. One of the significant assumptions in
determining our projected benefit obligation is the discount rate. We determined the discount rate
primarily by reference to annualized rates earned on high quality fixed income investments and
yield-to-maturity analysis specific to estimated future benefit payments, which resulted in a
weighted average discount rate of 7.8%. Other significant assumptions include the healthcare cost
trend rate, retirement age, and mortality assumptions.

Derivative Instruments.

Our results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in
aircraft fuel prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. In an effort to manage
our exposure to these risks, we periodically enter into derivative instruments, including fuel,
interest rate and foreign currency hedges. These derivative instruments are comprised of contracts
that are privately negotiated with counterparties without going through a public exchange.
Accordingly, our fair value assessments give consideration to the risk of counterparty default (as
well as our own credit risk).

•

Aircraft Fuel Derivatives.

Our fuel derivative instruments consist of crude oil,
heating oil and jet fuel swap, collar and call option contracts. Swap contracts are
valued under the income approach using a discounted cash flow model based on data either
readily observable or derived from public markets. Option contracts are valued under the
income approach using option pricing models. We have based our valuation assessments for
our option contracts on data either readily observable in public markets, derived from
public markets or provided by counterparties who regularly trade in public markets.

•

Interest Rate Derivatives.

Our interest rate derivative instruments consist of swap
and call option contracts and are valued based on data readily observable in public
markets.



•

Foreign Currency Derivatives.

Our foreign currency derivative instruments consist of
Japanese yen and Canadian dollar forward and collar contracts and are valued based on
data readily observable in public markets.

We perform, at least quarterly, both a prospective and retrospective assessment of the
effectiveness of our derivative instruments designated as hedges, including assessing the
possibility of counterparty default. If we determine that a derivative is no longer expected to be
highly effective, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively and recognize subsequent changes in
the fair value of the hedge in earnings. As a result of our effectiveness assessment at December
31, 2009, we believe our derivative instruments designated as hedges will continue to be highly
effective in offsetting changes in cash flow attributable to the hedged risk.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

Goodwill reflects (1) the excess of the reorganization
value of the Successor over the fair values of tangible and identifiable intangible assets, net of
liabilities, from the adoption of fresh start reporting, adjusted for impairment and (2) the excess
of purchase price over the fair values of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed from Northwest in the Merger. The following table reflects the changes in the
carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009:

During 2008, we experienced a significant decline in market capitalization primarily from
record high fuel prices and overall airline industry conditions. In addition, the announcement of
our intention to merge with Northwest established a stock exchange ratio based on the relative
valuation of Delta and Northwest (see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements). We determined that these factors combined with further increases in fuel prices were
an indicator that a goodwill impairment test was required. As a result, we estimated fair value
based on a discounted projection of future cash flows, supported with a market-based valuation. We
determined that goodwill was impaired and recorded a non-cash charge of $6.9 billion for the year
ended December 31, 2008. In estimating fair value, we based our estimates and assumptions on the
same valuation techniques employed and levels of inputs used to estimate the fair value of goodwill
upon adoption of fresh start reporting.

Identifiable intangible assets reflect intangible assets (1) recorded as a result of our
adoption of fresh start reporting upon emergence from bankruptcy and (2) acquired in the Merger.
Indefinite-lived assets are not amortized. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a
straight-line basis or under the undiscounted cash flows method over the estimated economic life of
the respective agreements and contracts.



In addition to the goodwill impairment charge discussed above, we recorded a non-cash charge
of $357 million ($238 million after tax) for the year ended December 31, 2008 to reduce the
carrying value of certain intangible assets based on their revised estimated fair values.

We apply a fair value-based impairment test to the net book value of goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis and, if certain events or circumstances
indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on an interim basis. The annual impairment
test date for our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets is October 1.

In evaluating our goodwill for impairment, we first compare our one reporting unit’s fair
value to its carrying value. We estimate the fair value of our reporting unit by considering (1)
our market capitalization, (2) any premium to our market capitalization an investor would pay for a
controlling interest, (3) the potential value of synergies and other benefits that could result
from such interest, (4) market multiple and recent transaction values of peer companies and (5)
projected discounted future cash flows, if reasonably estimable. If the reporting unit’s fair value
exceeds its carrying value, no further testing is required. If, however, the reporting unit’s
carrying value exceeds its fair value, we then determine the amount of the impairment charge, if
any. We recognize an impairment charge if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill
exceeds its implied fair value.

We perform the impairment test for our indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the
asset’s fair value to its carrying value. Fair value is estimated based on (1) recent market
transactions where available, (2) the lease savings method for airport slots (which reflects
potential lease savings from owning the slots rather than leasing them from another airline at
market rates), (3) the royalty method for the Delta tradename (which assumes hypothetical royalties
generated from using our tradename) or (4) projected discounted future cash flows. We recognize an
impairment charge if the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value.

Changes in assumptions or circumstances could result in an additional impairment in the
period in which the change occurs and in future years. Factors which could cause impairment
include, but are not limited to, (1) negative trends in our market capitalization, (2) volatile
fuel prices, (3) declining passenger mile yields, (4) lower passenger demand as a result of the
weakened U.S. and global economy, (5) interruption to our operations due to an employee strike,
terrorist attack, or other reasons, (6) changes to the regulatory environment and (7) consolidation
of competitors in the industry.

Long-Lived Assets

. Our flight equipment and other long-lived assets have a recorded value of
$20.4 billion on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2009. This value is based on
various factors, including the assets’ estimated useful lives and their estimated salvage values.
We record impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances
indicate the assets may be impaired and the estimated future cash flows generated by those assets
are less than their carrying amounts. If we decide to permanently remove flight equipment or other
long-lived assets from operations, we will evaluate those assets for impairment. For long-lived
assets held for sale, we record impairment losses when the carrying amount is greater than the fair
value less the cost to sell. We discontinue depreciation of long-lived assets when these assets are
classified as held for sale.

To determine impairments for aircraft used in operations, we group assets at the fleet-type
level (the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows) and then estimate future cash
flows based on projections of capacity, passenger mile yield, fuel costs, labor costs and other
relevant factors. If impairment occurs, the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the
aircraft’s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value. We estimate aircraft fair values using
published sources, appraisals and bids received from third parties, as available. For additional
information about our accounting policy for the impairment of long-lived assets, see Note 1 of the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



Income Tax Valuation Allowance and Contingencies

. We periodically assess whether it is more
likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax
assets, and we establish valuation allowances if recovery is deemed not likely. In making this
determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain
assumptions. We consider, among other things, our deferred tax liabilities, the overall business
environment, our historical earnings and losses, our industry’s historically cyclical periods of
earnings and losses and potential, current and future tax planning strategies. We cannot presently
determine when we will be able to generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax
assets. Accordingly, we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax
assets.

Our income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to
examination by the IRS and other taxing authorities. Although we believe that the positions taken
on previously filed tax returns are reasonable, we have established tax and interest reserves in
recognition that taxing authorities may challenge the positions we have taken, which could result
in additional liabilities for taxes and interest. We review the reserves as circumstances warrant
and adjust the reserves as events occur that affect our potential liability, such as lapsing of
applicable statutes of limitations, conclusion of tax audits, a change in exposure based on current
calculations, identification of new issues, release of administrative guidance or the rendering of
a court decision affecting a particular issue. We would adjust the income tax provision in the
period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.

Prior to January 1, 2009, in the event that an adjustment to the income tax provision related
to a pre-emergence tax position or Northwest Merger-related tax position, we adjusted
goodwill followed by other indefinite-lived intangible assets until the net carrying value of those
assets was zero. Beginning January 1, 2009, any adjustments to the income tax provision in regard
to pre-emergence tax positions are made through the income tax provision.

For additional information about income taxes, see Notes 1 and 9 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Pension Plans

. We sponsor defined benefit pension plans (“DB Plans”) for our eligible
employees and retirees. We currently estimate that expense for our DB Plans in 2010 will be
approximately $400 million. The effect of our DB Plans on our Consolidated Financial Statements is
subject to many assumptions. We believe the most critical assumptions are (1) the weighted average
discount rate and (2) the expected long-term rate of return on the assets of our DB Plans.

We determine our weighted average discount rate on our measurement date primarily by reference
to annualized rates earned on high quality fixed income investments and yield-to-maturity analysis
specific to our estimated future benefit payments. We used a weighted average discount rate of
5.93% and 6.49% at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Additionally, our weighted average
discount rate for net periodic benefit cost in each of the past three years has varied from the
rate selected on our measurement date, ranging from 5.99% to 7.19% between 2007 and 2009, due to
remeasurements throughout the year. The impact of a 0.50% change in our weighted average discount
rate is shown in the table below.



The expected long-term rate of return on the assets of our DB Plans is based primarily on
plan-specific investment studies using historical market returns and volatility data with forward
looking estimates based on existing financial market conditions and forecasts. Modest excess return
expectations versus some market indices are incorporated into the return projections based on the
actively managed structure of the investment programs and their records of achieving such returns
historically. We review our rate of return on plan asset assumptions annually. These assumptions
are largely based on the asset category rate-of-return assumptions developed annually with our
pension investment advisors; however, our annual investment performance for one particular year
does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. The investment strategy for DB Plan
assets is to utilize a diversified mix of global public and private equity portfolios, public and
private fixed income portfolios, and private real estate and natural resource investments to earn a
long-term investment return that meets or exceeds a 9% annualized return target. The impact of a
0.50% change in our expected long-term rate of return is shown in the table below.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued “Revenue
Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.” The standard revises guidance on (1) the determination of
when individual deliverables may be treated as separate units of accounting and (2) the allocation
of transaction consideration among separately identified deliverables. It also expands disclosure
requirements regarding an entity’s multiple element revenue arrangements. The standard is effective
for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with early adoption permitted. We are
currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our Consolidated
Financial Statements.

In April 2009, the FASB issued “Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
Instruments.” The standard amends required disclosures about the fair value of financial
instruments in interim and annual financial statements. We adopted this standard on April 1, 2009.

In December 2008, the FASB issued “Employers’ Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan
Assets.” It requires additional annual disclosures about assets held in an employer’s defined
benefit pension or other postretirement plan, primarily related to categories and fair value
measurements of plan assets. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2009. For additional
information regarding this standard, see Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

In March 2008, the FASB issued “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities.” The standard requires enhanced disclosures about
(1) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (2) how derivative instruments and related
hedged items are accounted for and (3) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect
an entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This standard is effective
for interim and annual periods. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2009.



In December 2007, the FASB issued “Business Combinations (revised 2007).” The standard
provides guidance for recognizing and measuring goodwill acquired in a business combination and
requires disclosure of information regarding the nature and financial effects of a business
combination. It also revises the treatment of valuation allowance adjustments related to income tax
benefits in existence prior to a business combination or prior to the adoption of fresh start
reporting. Under the original standard, any reduction in the valuation allowance from the
recognition of deferred tax assets is adjusted through goodwill, followed by other indefinite-lived
intangible assets until the net carrying costs of these assets is zero. In contrast, this revised
standard requires that any reduction in this valuation allowance be reflected through the income
tax provision. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning on January 1, 2009.

Supplemental Information

Under GAAP, we do not include in our Consolidated Financial Statements the results of
Northwest on or before the Closing Date. Accordingly, our financial results under GAAP for the year
ended December 31, 2008, include the results of Northwest only for the period from October 30 to
December 31, 2008. This impacts the comparability of our financial statements under GAAP for the
years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Financial results on a combined basis for the year ended
December 31, 2008 include the financial results for both Delta and Northwest beginning January 1,
2008. We believe presenting the 2008 financial information on a combined basis provides useful
information for comparing our financial performance in 2009 and 2008.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We have significant market risk exposure related to aircraft fuel prices, interest rates and
foreign currency exchange rates. Market risk is the potential negative impact of adverse changes in
these prices or rates on our Consolidated Financial Statements. To manage the volatility relating
to these exposures, we periodically enter into derivative transactions pursuant to stated policies.
We expect adjustments to the fair value of financial instruments to result in ongoing volatility in
earnings and stockholders’ equity.

The following sensitivity analyses do not consider the effects of a change in demand for air
travel, the economy as a whole or actions we may take to seek to mitigate our exposure to a
particular risk. For these and other reasons, the actual results of changes in these prices or
rates may differ materially from the following hypothetical results.

Aircraft Fuel Price Risk

Our results of operations are materially impacted by changes in aircraft fuel prices. In an
effort to manage our exposure to this risk, we periodically enter into derivative instruments
designated as cash flow hedges, which are comprised of crude oil, heating oil and jet fuel swap,
collar and call option contracts, to hedge a portion of our projected aircraft fuel requirements,
including those of our Contract Carriers under capacity purchase agreements.

As of January 31, 2010, our open fuel hedge position for the year ending December 31, 2010 is

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to market risk from adverse changes in interest rates is primarily associated
with our long-term debt obligations. Market risk associated with our fixed and variable rate
long-term debt relates to the potential reduction in fair value and negative impact to future
earnings, respectively, from an increase in interest rates. We had $9.6 billion of
fixed-rate long-term debt and $8.5 billion of variable-rate long-term debt at
December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2009, an increase of 100 basis points in
average annual interest rates would have decreased the estimated fair value of our fixed-rate
long-term debt by $297 million and increased interest expense on our variable-rate long-term debt
by $82 million.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

Our results of operations may be impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the U.S.
dollar value of foreign currency-denominated operating revenue and expense. Our largest exposures
come from the Japanese yen and Canadian dollar. In general, a weakening yen or Canadian dollar
relative to the U.S. dollar results in (1) our operating income being unfavorably impacted to the
extent net yen or Canadian dollar-denominated revenues exceed expenses and (2) recognition of a
non-operating foreign currency gain due to the remeasurement of net yen or Canadian
dollar-denominated liabilities. To manage exchange rate risk, we attempt to execute both our
international revenue and expense transactions in the same foreign currency to the extent
practicable. We believe changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our results
of operations.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements




REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Delta Air Lines, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Delta Air Lines, Inc. (the Company)
as of December 31, 2009 (Successor) and 2008 (Successor), and the related consolidated statements
of operations, stockholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2009
(Successor) and 2008 (Successor), the eight-month period ended December 31, 2007 (Successor) and
the four-month period ended April 30, 2007 (Predecessor). These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Delta Air Lines, Inc. at December 31, 2009
(Successor) and 2008 (Successor), and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows
for the years ended December 31, 2009 (Successor) and 2008 (Successor), the eight-month period
ended December 31, 2007 (Successor) and the four-month period ended April 30, 2007 (Predecessor),
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, Delta Air Lines, Inc. and its
subsidiaries which had filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code emerged from bankruptcy on April 30, 2007. Accordingly, the accompanying
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with Accounting Standards
Codification (“ASC”) 852, “Reorganizations,” for the Successor Company as a new entity with assets,
liabilities and a capital structure having carrying values not comparable with prior periods as
described in Note 1.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), Delta Air Lines, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2009 (Successor), based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report dated February 24, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Background

Delta
Air Lines, Inc., a Delaware corporation, provides
scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo throughout the United States (“U.S.”) and
around the world.

On October 29, 2008 (the “Closing Date”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Delta merged (the
“Merger”) with and into Northwest Airlines Corporation. On the Closing Date, (1) Northwest Airlines
Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Northwest Airlines, Inc. (collectively,
“Northwest”), became wholly-owned subsidiaries of Delta and (2) each share of Northwest common
stock outstanding on the Closing Date or issuable under Northwest’s Plan of Reorganization (as
defined below) was converted into the right to receive 1.25 shares of Delta common stock.

On December 31, 2009, Northwest Airlines, Inc. merged with and into Delta. As a result of this
merger, Northwest Airlines, Inc. ceased to exist as a separate entity.

Unless otherwise indicated, Delta Air Lines, Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiaries are
collectively referred to as “Delta,” “we,” “us,” and “our.” Prior to October 30, 2008, these
references do not include Northwest.

In September 2005, we and substantially all of our subsidiaries (the “Delta Debtors”) filed
voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (the
“Bankruptcy Code”). On April 30, 2007 (the “Effective Date”), the Delta Debtors emerged from
bankruptcy. Upon emergence from Chapter 11, we adopted fresh start reporting, which resulted in our
becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, the Consolidated Financial
Statements on or after May 1, 2007 are not comparable to the Consolidated Financial Statements
prior to that date.

Fresh start reporting requires resetting the historical net book value of assets and
liabilities to fair value by allocating the entity’s reorganization value to its assets and
liabilities. The excess reorganization value over the fair value of tangible and identifiable
intangible assets was recorded as goodwill on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. For additional
information regarding the impact of fresh start reporting on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
the Effective Date, see Note 11.

References in this Form 10-K to “Successor” refer to Delta on or after May 1, 2007, after
giving effect to (1) the cancellation of Delta common stock issued prior to the Effective Date, (2)
the issuance of new Delta common stock and certain debt securities in accordance with the Delta
Debtors’ Joint Plan of Reorganization (“Delta’s Plan of Reorganization”), and (3) the application
of fresh start reporting. References to “Predecessor” refer to Delta prior to May 1, 2007.

In September 2005, Northwest and substantially all of its subsidiaries (the “Northwest
Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. On
May 31, 2007, the Northwest Debtors emerged from bankruptcy pursuant to the Northwest Debtors’
First Amended Joint and Consolidated Plan of Reorganization (“Northwest’s Plan of Reorganization”).

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). Our Consolidated Financial
Statements include the accounts of Delta Air Lines, Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. As a
result of the Merger, the accounts of Northwest are included for all periods subsequent to the
Closing Date.

In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Predecessor, we distinguished
transactions and events that were directly associated with the reorganization from the ongoing
operations of the business. Accordingly, certain revenues, expenses, realized gains and losses and
provisions for losses that were realized or incurred in the bankruptcy proceedings were recorded in
reorganization items, net on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

We eliminate all material intercompany transactions in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
We do not consolidate the financial statements of any company in which we have an ownership
interest of 50% or less unless we control that company or it is a variable interest entity for
which we are the primary beneficiary. We did not have the power to direct the activities of any
company in which we had an ownership interest of 50% or less, or have any material variable
interest entity, for any period presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements.



We have marketing alliances with other airlines to enhance our access to domestic and
international markets. These arrangements can include codesharing, reciprocal frequent flyer
program benefits, shared or reciprocal access to passenger lounges, joint promotions, common use of
airport gates and ticket counters, ticket office co-location and other marketing agreements. We
have received antitrust immunity for certain of our marketing arrangements, which enables us to
offer a more integrated route network and develop common sales, marketing and discount programs for
customers. Some of our marketing arrangements provide for the sharing of revenues and expenses.
Revenues and expenses associated with collaborative arrangements are presented on a gross basis in
the applicable line items on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

We evaluated the financial statements for subsequent events through the date of the filing of
this Form 10-K, which is the date the financial statements were issued.

Use of Estimates

We are required to make estimates and assumptions when preparing our Consolidated Financial
Statements in accordance with GAAP. These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in
our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
materially from those estimates.

New Accounting Standards

In September 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued “Revenue
Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.” The standard revises guidance on (1) the determination of
when individual deliverables may be treated as separate units of accounting and (2) the allocation
of transaction consideration among separately identified deliverables. It also expands disclosure
requirements regarding an entity’s multiple element revenue arrangements. The standard is effective
for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, with early adoption permitted. We are
currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our Consolidated
Financial Statements.

In April 2009, the FASB issued “Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
Instruments.” The standard amends required disclosures about the fair value of financial
instruments in interim and annual financial statements. We adopted this standard on April 1, 2009.

In December 2008, the FASB issued “Employers’ Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan
Assets.” It requires additional annual disclosures about assets held in an employer’s defined
benefit pension or other postretirement plan, primarily related to categories and fair value
measurements of plan assets. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2009. For additional
information regarding this standard, see

Note 3.

In March 2008, the FASB issued “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities.” The standard requires enhanced disclosures
about (1) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (2) how derivative instruments and
related hedged items are accounted for and (3) how derivative instruments and related hedged items
affect an entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This standard is
effective for interim and annual periods. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2009.

In December 2007, the FASB issued “Business Combinations (revised 2007).” The standard
provides guidance for recognizing and measuring goodwill acquired in a business combination and
requires disclosure of information regarding the nature and financial effects of a business
combination. It also revises the treatment of valuation allowance adjustments related to income tax
benefits in existence prior to a business combination or prior to the adoption of fresh start
reporting. Under the original standard, any reduction in the valuation allowance from the
recognition of deferred tax assets is adjusted through goodwill, followed by other indefinite-lived
intangible assets until the net carrying costs of these assets is zero. In contrast, this revised
standard requires that any reduction in this valuation allowance be reflected through the income
tax provision. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning on January 1, 2009.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Short-term, highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased,
which primarily consist of money market funds and treasury bills, are classified as cash and cash
equivalents. These investments are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value.



Short-Term Investments

Investments with maturities of less than one year when purchased are classified as short-term
investments. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, our short-term investments were comprised of an
investment in The Reserve Primary Fund (the “Primary Fund”), a money market fund that is undergoing
an orderly liquidation. We record these investments as available-for-sale securities at fair value
on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For additional information regarding the Primary Fund, see Note
3.

Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents

Restricted cash and cash equivalents, which primarily consist of money market funds and time
deposits, included in current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets totaled $423 million and
$429 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Restricted cash recorded in other
noncurrent assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets totaled $16 million and $24 million at
December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Restricted cash and cash equivalents are recorded at
cost, which approximates fair value.

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, our restricted cash and cash equivalents primarily related to
cash held to meet certain projected self-insurance obligations.

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable primarily consist of amounts due from credit card companies, customers of
our aircraft maintenance and cargo transportation services and other airlines associated with
frequent flyer programs. We provide an allowance for uncollectible accounts equal to the estimated
losses expected to be incurred based on historical chargebacks, write-offs, bankruptcies and other
specific analyses. Bad debt expense and write-offs were not material for the years ended December
31, 2009 and 2008, the eight months ended December 31, 2007 and the four months ended April 30,
2007.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Our results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in aircraft fuel prices,
interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. In an effort to manage our exposure to these
risks, we periodically enter into derivative instruments, including fuel, interest rate and foreign
currency hedges. We recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair
value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognize certain changes in the fair value of
derivative instruments on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

We perform, at least quarterly, both a prospective and retrospective assessment of the
effectiveness of our derivative instruments designated as hedges, including assessing the
possibility of counterparty default. If we determine that a derivative is no longer expected to be
highly effective, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively and recognize subsequent changes in
the fair value of the hedge in earnings. As a result of our effectiveness assessment at December
31, 2009, we believe our derivative instruments designated as hedges will continue to be highly
effective in offsetting changes in cash flow or fair value attributable to the hedged risk.



Cash flow hedges

For derivative instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of
the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
loss and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects
earnings. The effective portion of the derivative represents the change in fair value of the hedge
that offsets the change in fair value of the hedged item. To the extent the change in the fair
value of the hedge does not perfectly offset the change in the fair value of the hedged item, the
ineffective portion of the hedge is immediately recognized in other (expense) income on our
Consolidated Statements of Operations. The following table summarizes the accounting treatment and
classification of our cash flow hedges on our Consolidated Financial Statements:

In the Merger, we assumed Northwest’s outstanding hedge contracts, which
included fuel, interest rate and foreign currency cash flow hedges. On the Closing Date, we
designated certain of these contracts as hedges. The remaining Northwest derivative contracts
did not qualify for hedge accounting and settled as of June 30, 2009.

(2)

Ineffectiveness on our fuel hedge option contracts is calculated using a “perfectly
effective” hypothetical derivative, which acts as a proxy for the fair value of the change in
expected cash flows from the purchase of aircraft fuel.

Fair value hedges

For derivative instruments that are designated as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the
derivative and the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are
recognized in current earnings. We include the gain or loss on the hedged item in the same account
as the offsetting loss or gain on the related derivative instrument, resulting in no impact to our
Consolidated Statements of Operations. The following table summarizes the accounting treatment and
classification of our fair value hedges on our Consolidated Financial Statements:

Hedge Margin

In accordance with our fuel and interest rate hedge agreements, (1) we may require
counterparties to fund the margin associated with our gain position on hedge contracts and/or (2)
counterparties may require us to fund the margin associated with our loss position on these
contracts. The amount of the margin, if any, is periodically adjusted based on the fair value of
the hedge contracts. The margin requirements are intended to mitigate a party’s exposure to market
volatility and the associated contracting party risk. We do not offset margin funded to
counterparties or margin funded to us by counterparties against fair value amounts recorded for our
hedge contracts.

The hedge margin we receive from counterparties is recorded, as appropriate, in cash and cash
equivalents or restricted cash, with the offsetting obligation in accounts payable on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets. The hedge margin we provide to counterparties is recorded in hedge
margin receivable or restricted cash on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. All cash flows associated
with purchasing and settling fuel hedge contracts are classified as operating cash flows on our
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow.

Our foreign currency hedge agreements do not require the counterparties or us to fund margin
associated with our gain or loss position under those contracts.

Revenue Recognition

Passenger Revenue

Passenger Tickets.

We record sales of passenger tickets in air traffic liability on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Passenger revenue is recognized when we provide transportation or when
the ticket expires unused, reducing the related air traffic liability. We periodically evaluate the
estimated air traffic liability and record any resulting adjustments in our Consolidated Statements
of Operations in the period in which the evaluations are completed. These adjustments relate
primarily to refunds, exchanges, transactions with other airlines and other items for which final
settlement occurs in periods subsequent to the sale of the related tickets at amounts other than
the original sales price.

Taxes and Fees.

We are required to charge certain taxes and fees on our passenger
tickets, including U.S. federal transportation taxes, federal security charges, airport passenger
facility charges and foreign arrival and departure taxes. These taxes and fees are legal
assessments on the customer for which we have an obligation to act as a collection agent. Because
we are not entitled to retain these taxes and fees, we do not include such amounts in passenger
revenue. We record a liability when the amounts are collected and reduce the liability when
payments are made to the applicable government agency or operating carrier.

Frequent Flyer Programs.

We have a frequent flyer program (the “SkyMiles Program”) offering
incentives to increase travel on Delta. This program allows participants to earn mileage credits by
flying on Delta, regional air carriers with which we have contract carrier agreements (“Contract
Carriers”) and participating airlines, as well as through participating companies such as credit
card companies, hotels and car rental agencies. We also sell mileage credits to other airlines and
to non-airline businesses. Mileage credits can be redeemed for free or upgraded air travel on Delta
and participating airlines, for membership in our Sky Club and for other program awards.

In the Merger, we assumed Northwest’s frequent flyer program (the “WorldPerks Program”). In
October 2009, we completed the consolidation of the SkyMiles and WorldPerks Programs, which
combined miles from each program at a one-to-one ratio. The WorldPerks Program was accounted for
under the same methodology as the SkyMiles Program.

Upon emergence from bankruptcy, we changed our accounting policy to a deferred revenue model
for all frequent flyer miles. We account for all miles earned and sold as separate deliverables in
a multiple element revenue arrangement.

We use the residual method for revenue recognition of mileage credits. The fair value of the
mileage credit component is determined based on prices at which we sell mileage credits to other
airlines, currently $0.0054 per mile, and is re-evaluated at least annually. Under the residual
method, the portion of the revenue from the sale of mileage credits
and the mileage component of passenger ticket sales that approximates fair value is
deferred and recognized as passenger revenue when miles are redeemed and services are provided
based on the weighted-average price of all miles that have been deferred. The portion of the
revenue received in excess of the fair value of mileage credits sold (the “Marketing Premium”) is recognized in income when
the related marketing services are provided and classified as other, net revenue.



For mileage credits which we estimate are not likely to be redeemed (“Breakage”), we recognize
the associated value proportionally during the period in which the remaining mileage credits are
expected to be redeemed. The estimate of Breakage is based on historical redemption patterns. A
change in assumptions as to the period over which mileage credits are expected to be redeemed, the
actual redemption activity for mileage credits or the estimated fair value of mileage credits
expected to be redeemed could have a material impact on our revenue in the year in which the change
occurs and in future years.

Prior to the adoption of fresh start reporting, we accounted for frequent flyer miles earned
on Delta flights on an incremental cost basis as an accrued liability and as operating expense,
while miles sold to airline and non-airline businesses were accounted for on a deferred revenue
basis. For SkyMiles accounts with sufficient mileage credits to qualify for a free travel award, we
recorded a liability for the estimated incremental cost of flight awards that were earned and
expected to be redeemed for travel on Delta or other airlines. Our incremental costs included (1)
our system average cost per passenger for fuel, food and other direct passenger costs for awards to
be redeemed on Delta and (2) contractual costs for awards to be redeemed on other airlines. We
periodically recorded adjustments to this liability in other operating expense on our Consolidated
Statements of Operations and other accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets based on
awards earned, awards redeemed, changes in our estimated incremental costs and changes to the
SkyMiles Program.

Regional Carriers Revenue.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we had contract
carrier agreements with 10 Contract Carriers, including our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Comair, Inc.
(“Comair”), Compass Airlines, Inc. (“Compass”) and Mesaba Aviation, Inc. (“Mesaba”). Compass and
Mesaba began operating as Contract Carriers on the Closing Date. Our Contract Carrier agreements
are structured as either (1) capacity purchase agreements where we purchase all or a portion of the
Contract Carrier’s capacity and are responsible for selling the seat inventory we purchase or (2)
revenue proration agreements, which are based on a fixed dollar or percentage division of revenues
for tickets sold to passengers traveling on connecting flight itineraries. We record revenue
related to all of our Contract Carrier agreements as regional carriers passenger revenue. We record
expenses related to our Contract Carrier agreements, excluding Comair, Compass and Mesaba, as
contract carrier arrangements expense.

Cargo Revenue

Cargo revenue is recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations when we provide the
transportation.

Other, net Revenue

Other, net revenue includes revenue from (1) the Marketing Premium component of the sale of
mileage credits in the SkyMiles and WorldPerks Programs discussed above, (2) our sale of seats on
other airlines’ flights under our alliance agreements and (3) other miscellaneous service revenue,
including administrative service charges, baggage handling fees and revenue from ancillary
businesses, including our aircraft maintenance and repair and staffing services. Our revenue from
other airlines’ sale of seats on our flights under our alliance agreements is recorded in passenger
revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we sold 16 aircraft, including 10 B-757-200
aircraft, four ATR-72 aircraft, one DC-9 aircraft and one EMB-120 aircraft. We received $78 million
in proceeds from these aircraft sales.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, we sold 20 aircraft, including seven CRJ-100
aircraft, five B-757-200 aircraft, four A320-200 aircraft and four DC-9-30 aircraft. In addition,
we sold two B-747-200F airframes and one EMB-120 airframe. As a result of these sales, we received
$123 million in proceeds and recorded a $21 million gain.

We record property and equipment at cost and depreciate or amortize these assets on a
straight-line basis to their estimated residual values over their respective estimated useful
lives. Residual values for owned spare parts and simulators are generally 5% of cost except when
guaranteed by a third party for a different amount. In connection with our adoption of fresh start
reporting, we increased our residual values for flight equipment from 5% to 10% of cost.
Additionally, we adjusted the net book values of property and equipment to their estimated fair
values and adjusted the estimated useful lives of flight equipment. The estimated useful lives for
major asset classifications are as follows:

We capitalize certain internal and external costs incurred to develop and
implement internal-use software. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the eight
months ended December 31, 2007 and the four months ended April 30, 2007, we recorded $95
million, $99 million, $67 million and $34 million, respectively, for amortization of
internal-use software. The net book value of these assets totaled $126 million and $229
million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

(2)

For leasehold improvements at certain airport facilities, we apply estimated useful
lives which extend beyond the contractual lease terms.

We record impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations when events and
circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired and the estimated future cash flows generated by
those assets are less than their carrying amounts. If we decide to permanently remove flight
equipment or other long-lived assets from operations, we will evaluate those assets for impairment.
For long-lived assets held for sale, we record impairment losses when the carrying amount is
greater than the fair value less the cost to sell. We discontinue depreciation of long-lived assets
when these assets are classified as held for sale.

To determine impairments for aircraft used in operations, we group assets at the fleet-type
level (the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows) and then estimate future cash
flows based on projections of capacity, passenger mile yield, fuel costs, labor costs and other
relevant factors. If impairment occurs, the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the
aircraft’s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value. We estimate aircraft fair values using
published sources, appraisals and bids received from third parties, as available.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill reflects (1) the excess of the reorganization value of the Successor over the fair
values of tangible and identifiable intangible assets, net of liabilities, from the adoption of
fresh start reporting, adjusted for impairment and (2) the
excess of purchase price over the fair
values of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from
Northwest in the Merger.

Identifiable intangible assets reflect intangible assets (1) recorded as a result of our
adoption of fresh start reporting upon emergence from bankruptcy and (2) acquired in the Merger.
Indefinite-lived assets are not amortized. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a
straight-line basis or under the undiscounted cash flows method over the estimated economic life of
the respective agreements and contracts. Costs incurred to renew or extend the term of an
intangible asset are expensed as incurred.

We apply a fair value-based impairment test to the net book value of goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis and, if certain events or circumstances
indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on an interim basis. The annual impairment
test date for our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets is October 1.



In evaluating our goodwill for impairment, we first compare our one reporting unit’s fair
value to its carrying value. We estimate the fair value of our reporting unit by considering (1)
our market capitalization, (2) any premium to our market capitalization an investor would pay for a
controlling interest, (3) the potential value of synergies and other benefits that could result
from such interest, (4) market multiple and recent transaction values of peer companies and (5)
projected discounted future cash flows, if reasonably estimable. If the reporting unit’s fair value
exceeds its carrying value, no further testing is required. If, however, the reporting unit’s
carrying value exceeds its fair value, we then determine the amount of the impairment charge, if
any. We recognize an impairment charge if the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill
exceeds its implied fair value.

We perform the impairment test for our indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the
asset’s fair value to its carrying value. Fair value is estimated based on (1) recent market
transactions, where available, (2) the lease savings method for airport slots (which reflects
potential lease savings from owning the slots rather than leasing them from another airline at
market rates), (3) the royalty method for the Delta tradename (which assumes hypothetical royalties
generated from using our tradename) or (4) projected discounted future cash flows. We recognize an
impairment charge if the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value.

Changes in assumptions or circumstances could result in an additional impairment in the period
in which the change occurs and in future years. Factors which could cause impairment include, but
are not limited to, (1) negative trends in our market capitalization, (2) volatile fuel prices, (3)
declining passenger mile yields, (4) lower passenger demand as a result of the weakened U.S. and
global economy, (5) interruption to our operations due to an employee strike, terrorist attack, or
other reasons, (6) changes to the regulatory environment and (7) consolidation of competitors in the industry.

Interest Expense

Interest expense recorded on our Consolidated Statements of Operations totaled $1.3 billion
and $705 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, $390 million for the
eight months ended December 31, 2007 and $262 million for the four months ended April 30, 2007.
Contractual interest expense (including interest expense that was associated with obligations
classified as liabilities subject to compromise) totaled $366 million for the four months ended
April 30, 2007. While operating as a debtor-in-possession under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code,
we recorded interest expense only to the extent (1) interest would be paid during our Chapter 11
proceedings or (2) it was probable interest would be an allowed priority, secured or unsecured
claim.

Income Taxes

We account for deferred income taxes under the liability method. Under this method, we
recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the tax effects of temporary differences
between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as measured by current
enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when necessary.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded net as current and noncurrent deferred income
taxes on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Our income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to
examination by the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and other taxing authorities. Although we
believe that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable, we have
established tax and interest reserves in recognition that taxing authorities may challenge the
positions we have taken, which could result in additional liabilities for taxes and interest. We
review the reserves as circumstances warrant and adjust the reserves as events occur that affect
our potential liability, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, conclusion of tax
audits, a change in exposure based on current calculations, identification of new issues, release
of administrative guidance or the rendering of a court decision affecting a particular issue. We
would adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the facts that give rise to the
revision become known.

Long-Term Investments

Investments with maturities of greater than one year when purchased are recorded at fair value
in other noncurrent assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our long-term investments are
comprised of student loan backed auction rate securities classified as available-for-sale and
insured auction rate securities classified as trading securities. Any change in the fair value of
these securities is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss or earnings, as appropriate.
For additional information regarding our auction rate securities, see Note 3.

Deferred Gains on Sale and Leaseback Transactions

We amortize deferred gains on the sale and leaseback of property and equipment under operating
leases over the lives of these leases. The amortization of these gains is recorded as a reduction
to rent expense. Gains on the sale and leaseback of property and equipment under capital leases
reduce the carrying value of the related assets.



Manufacturers’ Credits

We periodically receive credits in connection with the acquisition of aircraft and engines.
These credits are deferred until the aircraft and engines are delivered, and then applied on a pro
rata basis as a reduction to the cost of the related equipment.

Maintenance Costs

We record maintenance costs to aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs on our
Consolidated Statements of Operations. Maintenance costs are expensed as incurred, except for costs
incurred under power-by-the-hour contracts, which are expensed based on actual hours flown.
Power-by-the-hour contracts transfer certain risk to third party service providers and fix the
amount we pay per flight hour to the service provider in exchange for maintenance and repairs under
a predefined maintenance program. Modifications that enhance the operating performance or extend
the useful lives of airframes or engines are capitalized and amortized over the remaining estimated
useful life of the asset or the remaining lease term, whichever is shorter.

Inventories

Inventories of expendable parts related to flight equipment are carried at moving average cost
and charged to operations as consumed. An allowance for obsolescence is provided over the remaining
useful life of the related fleet for spare parts expected to be available at the date aircraft are
retired from service. We also provide allowances for parts identified as excess or obsolete to
reduce the carrying costs to the lower of cost or net realizable value. These parts are assumed to
have an estimated residual value of 5% of the original cost. In connection with our adoption of
fresh start reporting upon emergence from bankruptcy, we recorded our expendable parts inventories
at fair value.

Advertising Costs

We expense advertising costs as other selling expenses in the year incurred. Advertising
expense was $176 million and $114 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively, $121 million for the eight months ended December 31, 2007 and $51 million for the
four months ended April 30, 2007.

Commissions

We record passenger commissions in prepaid expenses and other on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets when the related passenger tickets are sold. Passenger commissions are recognized in
operating expense on our Consolidated Statements of Operations when the related revenue is
recognized.

Stock-Based Compensation

We measure the cost of employee services in exchange for an award of equity instruments based
on the grant-date fair value of the award. The fair value of our stock options is estimated using
an option pricing model. The cost of equity awards granted to employees is recognized over the
period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (usually
the vesting period of the award).

Reclassifications

We reclassified certain prior period amounts, none of which were material, to conform to our
current period presentation. The reclassifications to the
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow were within cash flows from
operating activities and do not impact total net cash provided by or
used in operating activities for any period. The adjustments to the Consolidated Statements of Operations
do not impact total operating expense or net income for any period.

We reclassified travel and incidental expenses, primarily crew meals and lodging expenses,
from salaries and related costs to other operating expense. These expenses amount to $308 million
for the year ended December 31, 2008, $173 million for the eight months ended December 31, 2007 and
$82 million for the four months ended April 30, 2007. We also adjusted our Consolidated Statements
of Operations for certain costs incurred to provide services to our Contract Carriers, excluding
Comair, Compass and Mesaba; these costs are recorded as a reduction to salaries and related costs
and contracted services, as appropriate, rather than as a reduction to other operating expense.
These costs amount to $256 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, $181 million for the eight
months ended December 31, 2007 and $80 million for the four months ended April 30, 2007.



NOTE 2. NORTHWEST MERGER

On the Closing Date, Northwest became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Delta. Northwest was a
major air carrier that provided scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo throughout
the U.S. and around the world.

We believe the Merger better positions us to manage through economic cycles and volatile fuel
prices, invest in our fleet, improve services for customers and achieve our strategic objectives.
We also believe the Merger will generate significant annual revenue and cost synergies from more
effective aircraft utilization, a more comprehensive and diversified route system and reduced
overhead and improved operational efficiency.

As a result of the Merger, each share of Northwest common stock outstanding on the Closing
Date or issuable under Northwest’s Plan of Reorganization was converted into the right to receive
1.25 shares of Delta common stock. We issued, or expect to issue, a total of 339 million shares of
Delta common stock for these purposes, or approximately 41% of the sum of the shares of Delta
common stock (1) outstanding on the Closing Date (including shares issued to Northwest stockholders
in the Merger), (2) issuable in exchange for shares of Northwest common stock reserved for issuance
under Northwest’s Plan of Reorganization, (3) reserved for issuance under Delta’s Plan of
Reorganization and (4) issuable to our employees in connection with the Merger.

The purchase price paid to effect the Merger was allocated to the tangible and identifiable
intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Northwest based on their estimated fair
values as of the Closing Date. The Merger was valued at $3.4 billion. This amount was derived from
(1) the 339 million shares of Delta common stock we issued or expect to issue, as discussed above,
at a price of $9.60 per share, the average closing price of our common stock on the New York Stock
Exchange for the five consecutive trading days that include the two trading days before, the day of
and the two trading days after the public announcement on April 14, 2008 of the then planned Merger
and (2) capitalized Merger-related transaction costs. The purchase price also included the fair
value of Delta stock options and other equity awards issued on the Closing Date in exchange for
similar securities of Northwest. Northwest stock options and other equity awards vested on the
Closing Date and were assumed by Delta and modified to provide for the purchase of Delta common
stock. The number of shares and, if applicable, the price per share were adjusted for the 1.25
exchange ratio. Vested stock options held by employees of Northwest were considered part of the
purchase price.

The purchase price was calculated as follows:

The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the tangible and identifiable
intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Northwest in the Merger was allocated to
goodwill. We believe that the portion of the purchase price attributable to goodwill represents the
benefits expected to be realized from the Merger, as discussed above. This goodwill is not
deductible or amortizable for tax purposes.

The following unaudited pro forma combined results of operations give effect to the
Merger as if it had occurred at the beginning of the periods presented. The unaudited pro forma
combined results of operations do not purport to represent Delta’s consolidated results of
operations had the Merger occurred on the dates assumed, nor are these results necessarily
indicative of Delta’s future consolidated results of operations. We expect to realize significant
benefits from integrating the operations of Delta and Northwest, as discussed above, and to incur
certain one-time cash costs. The unaudited pro forma combined results of operations do not reflect
these benefits or costs. Additionally, to improve the comparability of the information presented,
the unaudited pro forma combined results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 include
pro forma historical results of operations of Delta and Northwest adjusted to reflect (1) the
impact of fresh start reporting as if both companies had emerged from bankruptcy on January 1, 2007
and (2) changes in accounting principles as if adoption had occurred on January 1, 2007.

NOTE 3. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell
an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
Fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on assumptions that market
participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. A three-tier fair value hierarchy is used
to prioritize the inputs in measuring fair value as follows:

•

Level 1.

Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;

•

Level 2

. Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable
either directly or indirectly; and

•

Level 3

. Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which
require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are based on one or more of three valuation
techniques identified in the tables below. Where more than one technique is noted, individual
assets or liabilities were valued using one or more of the noted techniques. The valuation
techniques are as follows:

(a)

Market approach

. Prices and other relevant information generated by market
transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities;

(b)

Cost approach.

Amount that would be required to replace the service capacity of an
asset (replacement cost); and

(c)

Income approach.

Techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount
based on market expectations (including present value techniques, option-pricing and
excess earnings models).

Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash Equivalents.

Short-term, highly liquid investments with
maturities of three months or less when purchased, which primarily consist of money market funds,
treasury bills and time deposits, are classified as cash equivalents. These investments are
recorded at cost, which approximates fair value.

Short-Term Investments.

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, our short-term investments were
comprised of an investment in the Primary Fund, a money market fund that is undergoing an orderly
liquidation. We record these investments as available-for-sale securities at fair value.

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the fair value of our investment in the Primary Fund was $71
million and $212 million, respectively. At December 31, 2009, the cost of our remaining investment
was $84 million. In mid-September 2008, the net asset value of the Primary Fund decreased below $1
per share because the Primary Fund valued at zero its holdings of debt securities issued by Lehman
Brothers Holdings, Inc. (“Lehman Brothers”), which filed for bankruptcy on September 15, 2008.
Accordingly, we recorded an other than temporary impairment of $13 million as an unrealized loss to
the cost basis of our pro rata share of the estimated loss in this investment.

During 2008, due to uncertainty regarding the timing of the distribution of our holdings in
the Primary Fund and the amount expected to be received from the distribution, we changed our
valuation technique for the Primary Fund to an income approach using a discounted cash flow model.
Accordingly, our short-term investments at December 31, 2008, comprised of these securities,
changed from Level 1 to Level 3 since initial valuation upon acquisition.

On January 29, 2010, we received $73 million in principal from the Primary Fund under a court
approved plan of distribution. Combined with previous distributions from the Primary Fund, we have
now received 99% of our original investment.

Long-Term Investments.

We record our investments in student loan backed auction rate
securities as available-for-sale securities at fair value. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the fair
value of our student loan backed auction rate securities was $45 million and $38 million,
respectively. The cost of these investments was $45 million.

We record our investments in insured auction rate securities as trading securities at fair
value. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the fair value of our insured auction rate securities was $83
million. The cost of these investments was $110 million.

Due to the protracted failure in the auction process and contractual maturities averaging 31
years for our student loan backed auction rate securities and 26 years for our insured auction rate
securities, we have classified our auction rate securities as long-term within other noncurrent
assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Because auction rate securities are not actively traded, fair values were estimated by
discounting the cash flows expected to be received over the remaining maturities of the underlying
securities. We based the valuations on our assessment of observable yields on instruments bearing
comparable risks and consider the creditworthiness of the underlying debt issuer. Changes in market
conditions could result in further adjustments to the fair value of these securities.

Hedge Derivatives.

Our results of operations are significantly impacted by changes in aircraft
fuel prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. In an effort to manage our
exposure to these risks, we periodically enter into derivative instruments, including fuel,
interest rate and foreign currency hedges. These derivative instruments are comprised of contracts
that are privately negotiated with counterparties without going through a public exchange.
Accordingly, our fair value assessments give consideration to the risk of counterparty default (as
well as our own credit risk).

•

Aircraft Fuel Derivatives.

Our aircraft fuel derivative instruments consist
of crude oil, heating oil and jet fuel swap, collar, and call option contracts. Swap
contracts are valued under the income approach using a discounted cash flow model based
on data either readily observable or derived from public markets. Accordingly, we have
classified these contracts in Level 2.

Option contracts are valued under the income approach using option pricing models.
Historically, we have based our valuation assessments for our option contracts on data
either readily observable in public markets, derived from public markets or provided by
counterparties who regularly trade in public markets. During 2008, we reevaluated
certain valuation inputs used for our option contracts. As a result, we reclassified
these contracts from Level 2 to Level 3 since valuation at December 31, 2007. During
2009, we implemented systems that better provide for the evaluation of these inputs
against market data and we no longer rely on data provided by counterparties as a source
for our valuation assessments. Accordingly, we believe a reclassification of our option
contracts to Level 2 is appropriate.

•

Interest Rate Derivatives.

Our interest rate derivative instruments consist
of swap and call option contracts and are valued primarily based on data readily
observable in public markets.



•

Foreign Currency Derivatives.

Our foreign currency derivative instruments
consist of Japanese yen and Canadian dollar forward and collar contracts and are valued
based on data readily observable in public markets.

Common Stock.

Common stock is valued at the closing price reported on the active market on
which the individual securities are traded.

Mutual and Commingled Funds.

These funds are valued using the net asset value, which is based
on quoted market prices of the underlying assets owned by the fund minus its liabilities and then
divided by the number of shares outstanding.

Alternative Investments.

The valuation of alternative investments requires significant
judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the
long-term nature of such assets; therefore these assets are generally classified in Level 3.
Alternative investments include limited partnerships, real estate, oil and gas and timberland.
Investments are valued based upon recommendations of our investment managers. The investment
managers’ values are from valuation models where one or more of the significant inputs into the
model cannot be observed and which require the development of relevant assumptions. We also assess
the potential for adjustment to the fair value of these investments due to the lag in the
availability of data. In these cases, we solicit preliminary valuation updates at year-end from the
investment managers and use that information and corroborating data from public markets to
determine any needed adjustments to fair value.

Fixed Income.

Investments include corporate bonds, government
bonds, collateralized mortgage obligations, and other asset backed securities. These investments
are generally valued at the bid price or the average of the bid and asked price. Prices are
obtained from independent pricing services and are based on pricing models, quoted prices of
securities with similar characteristics, or broker quotes.

Cash Equivalents and Other.

These investments primarily consist of short term investment
funds, which are valued using the net asset value based on the value of the underlying assets minus
the liabilities and then divided by the number of shares outstanding.
Cash is not included in the table above.

(1)

In evaluating our goodwill for impairment, we first compare our one reporting
unit’s fair value to its carrying value. We estimate the fair value of our reporting unit by
considering (1) our market capitalization, (2) any premium to our market capitalization an
investor would pay for a controlling interest, (3) the potential value of synergies and other
benefits that could result from such interest, (4) market multiple and recent transaction
values of peer companies and (5) projected discounted future cash flows, if reasonably
estimable.

(2)

We perform the impairment test for our indefinite-lived intangible assets by
comparing the asset’s fair value to its carrying value. Fair value is estimated based on (1)
recent market transactions, where available, (2) the lease savings method for airport slots
(which reflects potential lease savings from owning slots rather than leasing them from
another airline at market rates), (3) the royalty method for the Delta tradename (which
assumes hypothetical royalties generated from using our tradename) or (4) projected discounted
future cash flows.

(3)

We valued our identified intangible assets upon emergence from bankruptcy primarily
using the income approach valuation technique. Key assumptions used in this valuation include:
(1) management’s projections of Delta’s revenues, expenses and cash flows for future years;
(2) an estimated weighted average cost of capital of 10%; (3) assumed discount
rates ranging from 12% to 15%, depending on the nature of the asset; and (4) a tax rate of
39.2%. Accordingly, the fair values are estimates, which are inherently subject to significant
uncertainties, and actual results could vary significantly from these estimates.

These valuations were based on the present value of future cash flows for
specific assets derived from our projections of future revenue, expense and airline market
conditions. These cash flows were discounted to their present value using a rate of return
that considers the relative risk of not realizing the estimated annual cash flows and time
value of money.

(2)

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible
and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Northwest in the
Merger. Indefinite-lived and definite-lived intangible assets are identified by type in Note
5. Fair value measurements for goodwill and other intangible assets included significant
unobservable inputs, which generally include a five-year business plan, 12 months of
historical revenues and expenses by city pair, projections of available seat miles, revenue
passenger miles, load factors, operating costs per available seat mile and a discount rate.

One of the significant unobservable inputs underlying the intangible fair value measurements
performed on the Closing Date is the discount rate. We determined the discount rate using the
weighted average cost of capital of the airline industry, which was measured using a Capital
Asset Pricing Model (“CAPM”). The CAPM in the valuation of goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangibles utilized a 50% debt and 50% equity structure. The historical average debt-to-equity
structure of the major airlines since 1990 is also approximately 50% debt and 50% equity, which
was similar to Northwest’s debt-to-equity structure at emergence from Chapter 11. The return on
debt was measured using a bid-to-yield analysis of major airline corporate bonds. The expected
market rate of return for equity was measured based on the risk free rate, the airline industry
beta and risk premiums based on the Federal Reserve Statistical Release H. 15 or
Ibbotson

®

Stocks, Bonds, Bills, and Inflation

®

Valuation Yearbook,
Edition 2008. These factors resulted in a 13% discount rate.

(3)

The fair value of Northwest’s WorldPerks Program liability was determined based on
the estimated price that third parties would require us to pay for them to assume the
obligation for miles expected to be redeemed under the WorldPerks Program. This estimated
price was determined based on the weighted-average equivalent ticket value of a WorldPerks
award, which is redeemed for travel on Northwest, Delta or a participating airline. The
weighted-average equivalent ticket value contemplates differing classes of service, domestic
and international itineraries and the carrier providing the award travel.

Fair Value of Debt

Market risk associated with our fixed and variable rate long-term debt relates to the
potential reduction in fair value and negative impact to future earnings, respectively, from an
increase in interest rates. The following table presents information about our debt:

Aircraft Fuel Price Risk

Hedge
Position

Our results of operations are materially impacted by changes in aircraft fuel prices. In an
effort to manage our exposure to this risk, we periodically enter into derivative instruments
comprised of crude oil, heating oil and jet fuel swap, collar and call option contracts to hedge a
portion of our projected aircraft fuel requirements, including those of our Contract Carriers under
capacity purchase agreements. As of December 31, 2009, our open fuel hedge contracts had an
estimated fair value asset position of $179 million, which is recorded in prepaid expenses and
other on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of December 31, 2009, we have hedged approximately 20%
of our projected fuel consumption for 2010.

In the Merger, we assumed all of Northwest’s outstanding fuel hedge contracts. On the Closing
Date, we designated certain of Northwest’s derivative instruments, comprised of crude oil collar
and swap contracts, as hedges. All Northwest fuel hedge contracts settled as of June 30, 2009.

Ineffectiveness gains (losses) recognized on our fuel hedge contracts in other (expense)
income on our Consolidated Statements of Operations was $57 million and $(20) million for the years
ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, $(13) million for the eight months ended December
31, 2007 and $14 million for the four months ended April 30, 2007.

We recorded a loss of $15 million to aircraft fuel and related taxes on our Consolidated
Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 related to Northwest derivative
contracts that were not designated as hedges. As of December 31, 2009, we recorded in other
comprehensive loss on our Consolidated Balance Sheet $15 million of net gains on our hedge
contracts scheduled to settle in the next 12 months.



In September 2008, one of our fuel hedge contract counterparties, Lehman Brothers, filed for
bankruptcy. As a result, we terminated our fuel hedge contracts with Lehman Brothers prior to their
scheduled settlement dates. Additionally, during the December 2008 quarter, we terminated certain
fuel hedge contracts with other counterparties to reduce our exposure to projected fuel hedge
losses due to the decrease in crude oil prices. We recorded an unrealized loss of $324 million,
which represents the effective portion of these terminated contracts at the date of settlement, in
accumulated other comprehensive loss on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. These losses were
reclassified in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in accordance with their original
contract settlement dates through December 2009. The ineffective portion of these contracts at the
date of settlement resulted in an $11 million charge, which we recorded to other (expense) income
on our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2008.

Prior to the adoption of fresh start reporting, we recorded as a component of stockholders’
deficit a $46 million unrealized gain related to our fuel hedging program. This gain would have
been recognized as an offset to aircraft fuel expense and related taxes as the underlying fuel
hedge contracts were settled. However, as required by fresh start reporting, our accumulated
stockholders’ deficit and accumulated other comprehensive loss were reset to zero. Accordingly,
fresh start reporting adjustments eliminated the unrealized gain and increased aircraft fuel
expense and related taxes by $46 million for the eight months ended December 31, 2007.

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to market risk from adverse changes in interest rates is associated with our
long-term debt obligations, cash portfolio, workers’ compensation obligations and pension,
postemployment and postretirement benefits. Market risk associated with our fixed and variable rate
long-term debt relates to the potential reduction in fair value and negative impact to future
earnings, respectively, from an increase in interest rates.

Cash Flow Hedges.

In the Merger, we assumed Northwest’s outstanding interest rate swap and
call option agreements. On the Closing Date, we designated these derivative instruments as cash
flow hedges for purposes of converting our interest rate exposure on a portion of our debt
portfolio from a floating rate to a fixed rate. The floating rates are based on three month LIBOR
plus a margin. These interest rate swap and call option agreements had a net fair value loss of $45
million at December 31, 2009.

Fair Value Hedges.

During the June 2008 quarter, we entered into interest rate swap agreements
designated as fair value hedges with an aggregate notional amount of $1.0 billion to convert our
interest rate exposure on a portion of our debt portfolio from a fixed rate to a floating rate.
These interest rate swap agreements had a fair value gain of $74 million and a corresponding
interest receivable of $17 million, which were recorded in other noncurrent assets and accounts
receivable, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2008. In accordance
with fair value accounting, the carrying value of our long-term debt at December 31, 2008 included
$74 million of fair value adjustments.

During the June 2009 quarter, we terminated our interest rate swaps designated as fair value
hedges, resulting in $65 million in cash proceeds from counterparties. Due to the fair value gain
position of these swaps at the date of termination, we recorded a deferred gain of $44 million.
This gain will be amortized through 2012, the remaining life of the debt, using an
effective-interest method and recorded to interest expense. As of December 31, 2009, $35 million of
this gain had yet to be amortized.

Other Matters.

Market risk associated with our cash portfolio relates to the potential decline
in interest income from a decrease in interest rates. Workers’ compensation obligation risk relates
to the potential increase in our future obligations and expenses from a decrease in interest rates
used to discount these obligations. Pension, postemployment and postretirement benefits risk
relates to the potential increase in our benefit obligations, funding and expenses from a decrease
in interest rates.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk because we have revenue and expense
denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Japanese yen and the Canadian dollar. To manage
exchange rate risk, we attempt to execute both our international revenue and expense transactions
in the same foreign currency to the extent practicable. From time to time, we may also enter into
foreign currency options and forward contracts.

In the Merger, we assumed Northwest’s outstanding foreign currency derivative instruments. On
the Closing Date, we designated certain of these derivative instruments, comprised of Japanese yen
forward and collar contracts, as cash flow hedges. All Northwest foreign currency derivative
instruments settled as of December 31, 2009.



As of December 31, 2009, we have hedged approximately 29%, 21% and 5% of Japanese
yen-denominated, and 24%, 15% and 4% of anticipated Canadian dollar-denominated, cash flows from
sales in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. These foreign currency derivative instruments had a net
fair value loss of $23 million at December 31, 2009.

Credit Risk

To manage credit risk associated with our aircraft fuel price, interest rate and foreign
currency hedging programs, we select counterparties based on their credit ratings and limit our
exposure to any one counterparty. We also monitor the market position of these programs and our
relative market position with each counterparty.

Due to the estimated fair value position of our fuel hedge contracts, we received $17 million
in fuel hedge margin from counterparties and provided $7 million in fuel hedge margin to
counterparties as of December 31, 2009.

Our accounts receivable are generated largely from the sale of passenger airline tickets and
cargo transportation services. The majority of these sales are processed through major credit card
companies, resulting in accounts receivable that may be subject to certain holdbacks by the credit
card processors.

We also have receivables from the sale of mileage credits under our SkyMiles Program to
participating airlines and non-airline businesses such as credit card companies, hotels and car
rental agencies. We believe the credit risk associated with these receivables is minimal and that
the allowance for uncollectible accounts that we have provided is appropriate.

Self-Insurance Risk

We self-insure a portion of our losses from claims related to workers’ compensation,
environmental issues, property damage, medical insurance for employees and general liability.
Losses are accrued based on an estimate of the ultimate aggregate liability for claims incurred,
using independent actuarial reviews based on standard industry practices and our historical
experience. A portion of our projected workers’ compensation liability is secured with restricted
cash collateral.

During 2008, we experienced a significant decline in market capitalization primarily from
record high fuel prices and overall airline industry conditions. In addition, the announcement of
our intention to merge with Northwest established a stock exchange ratio based on the relative
valuation of Delta and Northwest (see Note 2). We determined that these factors combined with
further increases in fuel prices were an indicator that a goodwill impairment test was required. As
a result, we estimated fair value based on a discounted projection of future cash flows, supported
with a market-based valuation. We determined that goodwill was impaired and recorded a non-cash
charge of $6.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. In estimating fair value, we based our
estimates and assumptions on the same valuation techniques employed and levels of inputs used to
estimate the fair value of goodwill upon adoption of fresh start reporting.



We also recorded a non-cash charge of $357 million ($238 million after tax) for the year ended
December 31, 2008 to reduce the carrying value of certain intangible assets based on their revised
estimated fair values. This charge was included in impairment of goodwill and other intangible
assets on our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2008.

NOTE 6. DEBT

In 2009, we entered into the following financing transactions:

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities due 2013, the Senior Secured Notes due 2014 and the
Senior Second Lien Notes due 2015 are guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries
and are secured by our Pacific route authorities and certain related assets. A portion of the net
proceeds from these transactions was used to repay in full the Bank Credit Facility due 2010 with
the remainder of the proceeds used for general corporate purposes. The Bank Revolving Credit
Facilities due 2010 and 2012 are also guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries
and secured by certain aircraft, engines and related assets.

The 2009-1 EETC was used to prepay $342 million of existing mortgage financings with respect
to two B-737-700 aircraft and three B-777-200LR aircraft that were delivered and financed in 2009
(the “2009 Aircraft”) and for general corporate purposes. The remaining $347 million will be used to repay a portion of the refinancing of 10 B-737-800
aircraft, nine B-757-200 aircraft and three 767-300ER aircraft that currently secure our 2000-1
EETC (the “2001 Aircraft”) after the maturity of the 2000-1 EETC in November 2010. Accordingly, we
reclassified $347 million of the 2000-1 EETC principal from current maturities to long-term.

Our obligations in connection with the Clayton County Bonds, Series 2009 are not secured. The
proceeds from this transaction are available to be used for general corporate purposes.

connection with a multi-year extension of our co-brand credit card relationship with American
Express (the “American Express Agreement”). This item also includes fair value adjustments to
our long-term debt in connection with our adoption of fresh start reporting upon emergence
from bankruptcy. These adjustments will be amortized to interest expense over the remaining
maturities of the respective debt.



Senior Secured Exit Financing Facilities due 2012 and 2014

In connection with Delta’s emergence from bankruptcy in April 2007, we entered into a senior
secured exit financing facility (the “Senior Secured Exit Financing Facilities”) to borrow up to
$2.5 billion. The Senior Secured Exit Financing Facilities consist of a $1.0 billion first-lien
revolving credit facility (the “Exit Revolving Facility”), a $600 million first-lien synthetic
revolving facility (the “Synthetic Facility”) (together with the Exit Revolving Facility, the
“First-Lien Facilities”), and a $900 million second-lien term loan facility (the “Term Loan” or the
“Second-Lien Facility”). During 2008, we borrowed the entire amount of the Exit Revolving Facility.
Borrowings under the First-Lien Facilities are due in April 2012 and borrowings under the
Second-Lien Facility are due in April 2014. As of December 31, 2009, the Senior Secured Exit
Financing Facilities had interest rates ranging from 2.3% to 3.5% per annum.

Our obligations under the Senior Secured Exit Financing Facilities are guaranteed by
substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries (the “Guarantors”). The Senior Secured Exit
Financing Facilities and the related guarantees are secured by liens on substantially all of our
and the Guarantors’ present and future assets that do not secure other financings (the
“Collateral”). The First-Lien Facilities are secured by a first priority security interest in the
Collateral. The Second-Lien Facility is secured by a second priority security interest in the
Collateral.

The Senior Secured Exit Financing Facilities include affirmative, negative and financial
covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things, incur additional secured indebtedness,
make investments, sell or otherwise dispose of assets if not in compliance with the collateral
coverage ratio tests, pay dividends or repurchase stock. These covenants may have a material
adverse impact on our operations. The Senior Secured Exit Financing Facilities contain financial
covenants that require us to:

•

maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (defined as the ratio of (1) earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and aircraft rent, and subject to other
adjustments to net income (“EBITDAR”) to (2) the sum of gross cash interest expense, cash
aircraft rent expense and the interest portion of our capitalized lease obligations, for
successive trailing 12-month periods ending at each quarter-end date through the maturity
date of the respective Senior Secured Exit Financing Facilities), which minimum ratio is
1.20:1 in the case of the First-Lien Facilities and 1.02:1 in the case of the Second-Lien
Facility;

•

maintain unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and permitted investments of not less
than $750 million in the case of the First-Lien Facilities and $650 million in the case of
the Second-Lien Facility;

•

maintain a minimum total collateral coverage ratio (defined as the ratio of (1)
certain of the Collateral that meets specified eligibility standards (“Eligible
Collateral”) to (2) the sum of the aggregate outstanding exposure under the First-Lien
Facilities and the Second-Lien Facility and the aggregate termination value of certain
hedging agreements) of 125% at all times; and

•

in the case of the First-Lien Facilities, also maintain a minimum first-lien
collateral coverage ratio (together with the total collateral coverage ratio described
above, the “collateral coverage ratios”) (defined as the ratio of (1) Eligible Collateral
to (2) the sum of the aggregate outstanding exposure under the First Lien Facilities and
the aggregate termination value of certain hedging agreements) of 175% at all times.

If the collateral coverage ratios are not maintained, we must either provide additional
collateral to secure our obligations, or we must repay the loans under the Senior Secured Exit
Financing Facilities by an amount necessary to maintain compliance with the collateral coverage
ratios.

The Senior Secured Exit Financing Facilities contain events of default customary for senior
secured exit financings, including cross-defaults to other material indebtedness and certain change
of control events. The Senior Secured Exit Financing Facilities also include events of default
specific to our business, including the suspension of all or substantially all of our flights and
other operations for more than two consecutive days (other than as a result of a Federal Aviation
Administration suspension due to extraordinary events similarly affecting other major U.S. air
carriers). Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the outstanding obligations under the Senior
Secured Exit Financing Facilities may be accelerated and become due and payable immediately and our
cash may become restricted.

Senior Secured Credit Facilities due 2013

In 2009, we entered into a first-lien revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal
amount of $500 million (the “Revolving Facility”) and a first-lien term loan facility in the
aggregate principal amount of $250 million (the “Term Facility” and collectively with the Revolving
Facility, the “Senior Secured Credit Facilities”). The Senior Secured Credit Facilities are
guaranteed by the Guarantors and are secured by a first lien on our Pacific route authorities and
certain related assets (the “Pacific Collateral”). Lenders under the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities and holders of the Senior Secured Notes (as described below) have equal rights to
payment and collateral.



Borrowings under the Term Facility must be repaid in an amount equal to 1% of the original
principal amount of the term loans annually (to be paid in equal quarterly installments), with the
balance of the term loans due and payable in September 2013. Borrowings under the Term Facility
bear interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR or another index rate, in each case plus a
specified margin. As of December 31, 2009, the Term Facility had an interest rate of 8.8% per
annum.

In 2009, we borrowed and subsequently repaid the entire amount of the Revolving Facility,
which matures in March 2013. Borrowings under the Revolving Facility can be prepaid without penalty
and amounts prepaid can be reborrowed. Borrowings under the Revolving Facility bear interest at a
variable rate equal to LIBOR or another index rate, in each case plus a specified margin. As of
December 31, 2009, the Revolving Facility was undrawn.

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants and default
provisions that are substantially similar to the ones described under “Senior Secured Exit
Financing Facilities” above. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities also contain financial covenants
that require us to:

•

maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (defined as the ratio of (1) EBITDAR
(excluding gains and losses arising under fuel hedging arrangements incurred prior to the
closing date of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities) to (2) the sum of cash interest
expense plus cash aircraft rent expense plus the interest portion of Delta’s capitalized
lease obligations) in each case for the 12-month period ending as of the last day of each
fiscal quarter of not less than 1.20 to 1;

•

maintain a minimum collateral coverage ratio (defined as the ratio of aggregate
current fair market value of the collateral to the sum of the aggregate outstanding
exposure under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and certain obligations with equal
rights to payment and collateral and the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Senior Secured Notes) of 1.60:1; and

•

maintain unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of not less
than $2 billion.

The Senior Secured Credit Facilities also contain mandatory prepayment provisions that require
us in certain instances to prepay obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities in
connection with dispositions of collateral. In addition, if the collateral coverage ratio is less
than 1.60:1, we must either provide additional collateral in the form of cash or additional routes
and slots to secure our obligations, or we must repay the loans under the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities by an amount necessary to comply with the collateral coverage ratio.

Senior Secured Notes due 2014

Also in 2009, we issued $750 million of Senior Secured Notes (the “Senior Secured Notes”). The
Senior Secured Notes mature in September 2014 and have a fixed interest rate of 9.5% per annum. We
may redeem some or all of the Senior Secured Notes at any time on or after September 15, 2011 at
specified redemption prices. If we sell certain of our assets or if we experience specific kinds of
changes in control, we must offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes.

Our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes are guaranteed by the Guarantors. The Senior
Secured Notes and related guarantees are secured on a senior basis equally and ratably with the
indebtedness incurred under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities by security interests in the
Pacific Collateral.

The Senior Secured Notes include covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to
sell assets, incur additional indebtedness, issue preferred stock, make investments or pay
dividends. In addition, in the event the collateral coverage ratio, which has the same definition
as the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, is less than 1.60:1, we must pay additional interest on
the Senior Secured Notes at the rate of 2% per annum until the collateral coverage ratio equals at
least 1.60:1.

The Senior Secured Notes contain events of default customary for similar financings, including
cross-defaults to other material indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the
outstanding obligations under the Senior Secured Notes may be accelerated and become due and
payable immediately.

Senior Second Lien Notes due 2015

In conjunction with the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes, we issued $600 million of Senior
Second Lien Notes (the “Senior Second Lien Notes”). The Senior Second Lien Notes mature in March
2015 and have a fixed interest rate of 12.25% per annum. We may redeem some or all of the Senior
Second Lien Notes at any time on or after March 15, 2012 at specified redemption prices. If we sell
certain of our assets or if we experience specific kinds of changes in control, we must offer to
repurchase the Senior Second Lien Notes.

Our obligations under the Senior Second Lien Notes are guaranteed by the Guarantors. The
Senior Second Lien Notes and related guarantees are secured on a junior basis by security interests
in the Pacific Collateral.



The Senior Second Lien Notes include covenants and default provisions that are substantially
similar to the ones described under “Senior Secured Notes due 2014” above. In addition, in the
event (1) the collateral coverage ratio (defined as the ratio of aggregate current market value of
the collateral to the sum of the aggregate outstanding exposure under the Senior Secured Credit
Facilities and certain obligations with equal rights to payment and collateral, the aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes, and the aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Senior Second Lien Notes and any other permitted junior indebtedness that is secured by
the collateral) is less than 1.00:1 or (2) we are required to pay additional interest on the Senior
Secured Notes, we must pay additional interest on the Senior Second Lien Notes at the rate of 2%
per annum until the later of (a) the collateral coverage ratio equals at least 1.00:1 or (b)
special interest on the Senior Secured Notes ceases to accrue.

Bank Revolving Credit Facilities due 2010 and 2012

In December 2009, we entered into a $100 million first-lien revolving credit facility, which
is guaranteed by the Guarantors and is secured by a first lien on certain aircraft, engines and
related assets owned by Mesaba and us. Borrowings under this facility are due in December 2012, can
be repaid and reborrowed without penalty and bear interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR or
another index rate, in each case plus a specified margin. As of December 31, 2009, the facility was
undrawn.

In December 2009, we also entered into a $150 million first-lien revolving credit facility,
which is guaranteed by the Guarantors and is secured by a first lien on certain aircraft, engines
and related assets owned by Delta and Comair. Borrowings under the facility are due in December
2010; however, we may request additional one-year renewals of the facility thereafter. Borrowings
can be repaid and reborrowed without penalty and bear interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR or
another index rate, in each case plus a specified margin. As of December 31, 2009, the facility was
undrawn.

Under both of these facilities, we must maintain a minimum balance of cash, permitted
investments and available borrowing capacity under committed facilities at a specified level. We
are also required to maintain a minimum collateral coverage ratio under both facilities. If the
collateral coverage ratio is not maintained, we must either provide additional collateral to secure
our obligations or repay the relevant facility by an amount necessary to maintain compliance with
the collateral coverage ratio. Both facilities contain other covenants and events of default,
including cross-defaults to other material indebtedness, that are substantially similar to the ones
described under “Senior Secured Exit Financing Facilities due 2012 and 2014” above.

Other Financing Agreements

Certificates.

Pass-Through Trust Certificates and Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates
(collectively, the “Certificates”) are secured by 242 aircraft. As of December 31, 2009, the
Certificates had interest rates ranging from 0.8% to 9.8%. We issued $689 million of Class A and
Class B Pass Through Certificates, Series 2009-1 in November 2009 through two separate pass through
trusts (the “2009-1 EETC”). The trusts hold equipment notes for, and are secured by, the 2009
Aircraft and are expected, after the maturity of our 2000-1 EETC in November 2010, to hold
equipment notes for, and be secured by, the 2000-1 Aircraft. The equipment notes have a weighted
average fixed interest rate of 8.1%.

Aircraft Financing.

We have $6.0 billion of loans secured by 300 aircraft, not including
aircraft securing the Certificates. These loans had interest rates ranging from 0.7% to 7.2% at
December 31, 2009. During 2008, we entered into agreements to borrow up to $1.6 billion to finance
the purchase of 35 aircraft. In 2009, we took delivery of and financed 20 aircraft, five of which
were the 2009 Aircraft which were refinanced in connection with the 2009-1 EETC.

Other Secured Financings.

Other secured financings primarily include (1) manufacturer term
loans, secured by spare parts, spare engines and aircraft and (2) real estate loans.
The financings had annual interest rates ranging from 1.5% to 8.5% at
December 31, 2009.

American Express Agreement

. In December 2008, we announced a multi-year extension of the
American Express Agreement. As part of the American Express Agreement, we received $1.0 billion
from American Express for an advance purchase of SkyMiles, which amount is classified as long-term
debt. This obligation will not be satisfied by cash payments, but through the use of SkyMiles by
American Express over an expected two year period beginning in December 2010.



Clayton County Bonds, Series 2009

. In December 2009, the Development Authority of Clayton
County (the “Development Authority”) issued bonds with principal of $150 million, in two series,
maturing in 2029 and 2035 (the “Clayton Bonds”). The Clayton Bonds have a weighted average fixed
interest rate of 8.9% and are subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption requirements. The
proceeds of this sale were loaned to us to refund bonds that previously had been issued to
refinance certain of our facilities at Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. The
bonds are secured solely by the Development Authority’s pledge of the revenues payable to it under
loan agreements between Delta and the Development Authority. Our obligations under the loan
agreements are not secured.

Northwest Revolving Credit Facility due 2009

. In 2009, we amended the Northwest Revolving
Credit Facility to, among other things, reduce its borrowing limit from $500 million to $300
million and change its maturity date to December 30, 2009. Borrowings under the Northwest Revolving
Credit Facility were guaranteed by Northwest Airlines Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries.
The Northwest Revolving Credit Facility and related guarantees were secured by substantially all of
Northwest’s unencumbered assets as of October 29, 2008. The Northwest Revolving Credit Facility
terminated in December 2009 on its maturity date.

Covenants

We were in compliance with all covenants in our financing agreements at December 31, 2009.

NOTE 7. LEASE OBLIGATIONS

We lease aircraft, airport terminals and maintenance facilities, ticket offices and other
property and equipment from third parties. Rental expense for operating leases, which is recorded
on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease term, totaled $1.3 billion and $798 million for
the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, $470 million for the eight months ended
December 31, 2007 and $261 million for the four months ended April 30, 2007. Amounts due under
capital leases are recorded as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Assets acquired
under capital leases are recorded as property and equipment on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Amortization of assets recorded under capital leases is included in depreciation and amortization
expense on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Many of our facility, aircraft and equipment
leases include rental escalation clauses and/or renewal options. Our leases do not include residual value
guarantees.



The following tables summarize, as of December 31, 2009, our minimum rental commitments under
capital leases and noncancelable operating leases (including certain aircraft under Contract
Carrier agreements) with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year:

Shuttle America Corporation (“Shuttle America”) and SkyWest Airlines, Inc. (“SkyWest
Airlines”).

At December 31, 2009, we operated 213 aircraft under operating leases and 93 aircraft
under capital leases. Our Contract Carriers under capacity purchase agreements operated 450
aircraft under operating leases. Leases for aircraft operated by us and our Contract Carriers have
expiration dates ranging from 2010 to 2025. During the four months ended April 30, 2007, we
recorded estimated claims relating to the restructuring of the financing arrangements for many of
our aircraft and the rejection of certain of our leases in connection with our bankruptcy
proceedings.



NOTE 8. PURCHASE COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Aircraft Commitments

Future purchase commitments for aircraft as of December 31, 2009 are estimated to total
approximately $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010. Approximately $800 million of the
$1.1 billion is associated with the purchase of 20 B-737-800 aircraft for which we have entered
into definitive agreements to sell to third parties immediately following delivery of those
aircraft to us by the manufacturer. We have not received any notice that these parties have
defaulted on their purchase obligations. The remaining commitments relate to the purchase of two
B-777-200LR aircraft, two B-737-800 aircraft and 11 previously owned MD-90 aircraft. We have no
aircraft purchase commitments after December 31, 2010.

As of December 31, 2009, we have financing commitments from third parties or, with respect to
20 of the 22 B-737-800 aircraft referred to above, definitive agreements to sell all aircraft
subject to purchase commitments, except for nine of the 11 previously owned MD-90 aircraft. Under
these financing commitments, third parties have agreed to finance on a long-term basis a
substantial portion of the purchase price of the covered aircraft.

Our aircraft purchase commitments described above do not include our orders for:

•

18 B-787-8 aircraft. The Boeing Company (“Boeing”) has informed us that Boeing will be
unable to meet the contractual delivery schedule for these aircraft. We are in discussions
with Boeing regarding this situation.

•

five A319-100 aircraft and two A320-200 aircraft. We have the right to cancel these
orders.

Contract Carrier Agreements

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we had Contract Carrier agreements with 10 Contract
Carriers, including our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Comair, Compass and Mesaba.

Capacity Purchase Agreements

. During the year ended December 31, 2009, six Contract
Carriers operated for us (in addition to Comair, Compass and Mesaba) pursuant to capacity purchase
agreements. Under these agreements, the Contract Carriers operate some or all of their aircraft
using our flight designator codes, and we control the scheduling, pricing, reservations, ticketing
and seat inventories of those aircraft and retain the revenues associated with those flights. We
pay those airlines an amount, as defined in the applicable agreement, which is based on a
determination of their cost of operating those flights and other factors intended to approximate
market rates for those services.

The following table shows our minimum fixed obligations under these capacity purchase
agreements (excluding Comair, Compass and Mesaba). The obligations set forth in the table
contemplate minimum levels of flying by the Contract Carriers under the respective agreements and
also reflect assumptions regarding certain costs associated with the minimum levels of flying such
as for fuel, labor, maintenance, insurance, catering, property tax and landing fees. Accordingly,
our actual payments under these agreements could differ materially from the minimum fixed
obligations set forth in the table below.

Revenue Proration Agreements

. As of December 31, 2009, we had a revenue proration agreement
with American Eagle Airlines, Inc. In addition, a portion of our contract carrier agreement with
SkyWest Airlines is structured as a revenue proration agreement. These agreements establish a fixed
dollar or percentage division of revenues for tickets sold to passengers traveling on connecting
flight itineraries.



Contingencies Related to Termination of Contract Carrier Agreements

We may terminate the Chautauqua and Shuttle America agreements without cause at any time after
May 2010 and January 2016, respectively, by providing certain advance notice. If we terminate
either the Chautauqua or Shuttle America agreements without cause, Chautauqua or Shuttle America,
respectively, has the right to (1) assign to us leased aircraft that the airline operates for us,
provided we are able to continue the leases on the same terms the airline had prior to the
assignment and (2) require us to purchase or lease any of the aircraft that the airline owns and
operates for us at the time of the termination. If we are required to purchase aircraft owned by
Chautauqua or Shuttle America, the purchase price would be equal to the amount necessary to (1)
reimburse Chautauqua or Shuttle America for the equity it provided to purchase the aircraft and (2)
repay in full any debt outstanding at such time that is not being assumed in connection with such
purchase. If we are required to lease aircraft owned by Chautauqua or Shuttle America, the lease
would have (1) a rate equal to the debt payments of Chautauqua or Shuttle America for the debt
financing of the aircraft calculated as if 90% of the aircraft was debt financed by Chautauqua or
Shuttle America and (2) other specified terms and conditions.

We estimate that the total fair values, determined as of December 31, 2009, of the aircraft
that Chautauqua or Shuttle America could assign to us or require that we purchase if we terminate
without cause our contract carrier agreements with those airlines (the “Put Right”) are
approximately $200 million and $440 million, respectively. The actual amount that we may be
required to pay in these circumstances may be materially different from these estimates. If the
Chautauqua or Shuttle America Put Right is exercised, we must also pay the exercising carrier 10%
interest (compounded monthly) on the equity the carrier provided when it purchased the put
aircraft. These equity amounts for Chautauqua and Shuttle America total $25 million and $52
million, respectively.

Legal Contingencies

We are involved in various legal proceedings relating to employment practices, environmental
issues, bankruptcy matters, antitrust matters and other matters concerning our business. We cannot
reasonably estimate the potential loss for certain legal proceedings because, for example, the
litigation is in its early stages or the plaintiff does not specify the damages being sought.

Credit Card Processing Agreements

Visa/MasterCard Processing Agreement

Our Visa/MasterCard credit card processing agreement provides that no cash reserve (“Reserve”)
is required except in certain circumstances, including when we do not maintain a required level of
unrestricted cash. In circumstances in which the processor can establish a Reserve, the amount of
the Reserve would be equal to the potential liability of the credit card processor for tickets
purchased with Visa or MasterCard that had not yet been used for travel. There was no Reserve as of
December 31, 2009 and 2008.

American Express

Our American Express credit card processing agreement provides that no withholding of our
receivables will occur except in certain circumstances, including when we do not maintain a
required level of unrestricted cash. In circumstances in which American Express is permitted to
withhold our receivables, the amount that can be withheld is an amount up to American Express’
potential liability for tickets purchased with the American Express credit card that had not yet
been used for travel. No amounts were withheld as of December 31, 2009 and 2008

.

Other Contingencies

General Indemnifications

We are the lessee under many commercial real estate leases. It is common in these transactions
for us, as the lessee, to agree to indemnify the lessor and the lessor’s related parties for tort,
environmental and other liabilities that arise out of or relate to our use or occupancy of the
leased premises. This type of indemnity would typically make us responsible to indemnified parties
for liabilities arising out of the conduct of, among others, contractors, licensees and invitees
at, or in connection with, the use or occupancy of the leased premises. This indemnity often
extends to related liabilities arising from the negligence of the indemnified parties, but usually
excludes any liabilities caused by either their sole or gross negligence and their willful
misconduct.

Our aircraft and other equipment lease and financing agreements typically contain provisions
requiring us, as the lessee or obligor, to indemnify the other parties to those agreements,
including certain of those parties’ related persons, against virtually any liabilities that might
arise from the condition, use or operation of the aircraft or such other equipment.



We believe that our insurance would cover most of our exposure to such liabilities and related
indemnities associated with the types of lease and financing agreements described above, including
real estate leases. However, our insurance does not typically cover environmental liabilities,
although we have certain policies in place to meet the requirements of applicable environmental
laws.

Certain of our aircraft and other financing transactions include provisions which require us
to make payments to preserve an expected economic return to the lenders if that economic return is
diminished due to certain changes in law or regulations. In certain of these financing
transactions, we also bear the risk of certain changes in tax laws that would subject payments to
non-U.S. lenders to withholding taxes.

We cannot reasonably estimate our potential future payments under the indemnities and related
provisions described above because we cannot predict (1) when and under what circumstances these
provisions may be triggered and (2) the amount that would be payable if the provisions were
triggered because the amounts would be based on facts and circumstances existing at such time.

Employees Under Collective Bargaining Agreements

At December 31, 2009, we had 81,106 full-time equivalent employees. Approximately 39% of these
employees were represented by unions, including the following domestic employee groups.

War-Risk Insurance Contingency

As a result of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, aviation insurers significantly
reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for liability
to persons (other than employees or passengers) for claims resulting from acts of terrorism, war or
similar events. At the same time, aviation insurers significantly increased the premiums for such
coverage and for aviation insurance in general. Since September 24, 2001, the U.S. government has
been providing U.S. airlines with war-risk insurance to cover losses, including those resulting
from terrorism, to passengers, third parties (ground damage) and the aircraft hull. The U.S.
Secretary of Transportation has extended coverage through August 31, 2010. The withdrawal of
government support of airline war-risk insurance would require us to obtain war-risk insurance
coverage commercially, if available. Such commercial insurance could have substantially less
desirable coverage than currently provided by the U.S. government, may not be adequate to protect
our risk of loss from future acts of terrorism, may result in a material increase to our operating
expense or may not be obtainable at all, resulting in an interruption to our operations.



Other

We have certain contracts for goods and services that require us to pay a penalty, acquire
inventory specific to us or purchase contract specific equipment, as defined by each respective
contract, if we terminate the contract without cause prior to its expiration date. Because these
obligations are contingent on our termination of the contract without cause prior to its expiration
date, no obligation would exist unless such a termination occurs.

NOTE 9. INCOME TAXES

Income Tax (Benefit) Provision

We consider all income sources, including other comprehensive income, in determining the
amount of tax benefit allocated to continuing operations (the “Income Tax Allocation”).
Accordingly, for the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded an income tax benefit of $344
million, including a non-cash income tax benefit of $321 million on the loss from continuing
operations, with an offsetting non-cash income tax expense of $321 million on other comprehensive
income. Our overall tax provision is not impacted by this tax allocation.

Our income tax benefit (provision) for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the eight
months ended December 31, 2007 and the four months ended April 30, 2007 consisted of:

Deferred Taxes

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes. The following
table shows significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2009
and 2008:

The current and noncurrent components of our deferred tax balances are generally based on
the balance sheet classification of the asset or liability creating the temporary difference. If
the deferred tax asset or liability is not based on a component of our balance sheet, such as our
net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards, the classification is presented based on the expected
reversal date of the temporary difference. Our valuation allowance has been classified as current
or noncurrent based on the percentages of current and noncurrent deferred tax assets to total
deferred tax assets.

At December 31, 2009, we had (1) $452 million of federal alternative minimum tax (“AMT”)
credit carryforwards, which do not expire and (2) $17.3 billion of federal and state pretax NOL
carryforwards, substantially all of which will not begin to expire until 2022.

Both Delta and Northwest experienced an ownership change in 2007 as a result of their
respective plans of reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As a result of the
Merger, Northwest experienced a subsequent ownership change. Delta also experienced a subsequent
ownership change on December 17, 2008 as a result of the Merger, the issuance of equity to
employees in connection with the Merger and other transactions involving the sale of common stock
within the testing period. We currently expect these ownership changes will not significantly limit our
ability to utilize our AMT credit or NOLs in the carryforward period.

Uncertain Tax Positions

Unrecognized
tax benefits totaled $66 million and $29 million on our Consolidated
Balance Sheets at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. This includes $47 million of tax
benefits as of December 31, 2009 and $10 million of tax benefits as of December 31, 2008, that will
affect the effective tax rate when recognized.



We accrue interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and
operating expense, respectively. The impact related to interest and penalties on our Consolidated
Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was not material.

We are currently under audit by the IRS for the 2008 and 2009 tax years.

The following table summarizes the changes to the amount of unrecognized tax benefits for
the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009:

Valuation Allowance

We periodically assess whether it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient
taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets, and we establish valuation allowances if
recovery is deemed not likely. In making this determination, we consider all available positive and
negative evidence and make certain assumptions. We consider, among other things, our deferred tax
liabilities, the overall business environment, our historical earnings and losses, our industry’s
historically cyclical periods of earnings and losses and potential, current and future tax planning
strategies. We cannot presently determine when we will be able to generate sufficient taxable
income to realize our deferred tax assets. Accordingly, we have recorded a full valuation allowance
against our net deferred tax assets.

Prior to January 1, 2009, any reduction in the valuation allowance as a result of the
recognition of deferred tax assets was adjusted first through goodwill followed by other
indefinite-lived intangible assets until the net carrying value of those assets was zero. Beginning
January 1, 2009, any reduction in the valuation allowance is reflected through the income tax
provision.

NOTE 10. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

We sponsor defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, healthcare plans, and
disability and survivorship plans for eligible employees and retirees, and their eligible family
members.

Defined Benefit Pension, Other Postretirement and Postemployment Benefit Plans

Defined Benefit Pension Plans.

We sponsor a defined benefit pension plan for eligible
non-pilot Delta employees and retirees (the “Delta Non-Pilot Plan”) and defined benefit pension
plans for eligible Northwest employees and retirees (the “Northwest Pension Plans”). These plans
have been closed to new entrants and frozen for future benefit accruals.

The Pension Protection Act of 2006 allows commercial airlines to elect alternative funding
rules (“Alternative Funding Rules”) for defined benefit plans that are frozen. Under the
Alternative Funding Rules, the unfunded liability for a frozen defined benefit plan may be
amortized over a fixed 17-year period and is calculated using an 8.85% interest rate. Delta elected
the Alternative Funding Rules for the Delta Non-Pilot Plan, effective April 1, 2007, and Northwest
elected the Alternative Funding Rules for the Northwest Pension Plans, effective October 1, 2006.
We estimate that the funding requirements under these plans will be approximately $720 million in
2010.

Defined Contribution Pension Plans.

We sponsor several defined contribution plans. These plans
generally cover different employee groups and employer contributions vary by plan. The cost
associated with our defined contribution pension plans is reflected in the tables below.



Postretirement Healthcare Plans.

We sponsor healthcare plans that provide benefits to
eligible retirees and their dependents who are under age 65. During bankruptcy, we generally
eliminated company-paid post age 65 healthcare coverage, except for (1) subsidies available to a
limited group of retirees and their dependents and (2) a group of retirees who retired prior to
1987. Benefits under these plans are
funded from current assets and are subject to co-payments, deductibles and other limits as
described in the plans.

Postemployment Plans.

We provide certain other welfare benefits to eligible former or inactive
employees after employment, but before retirement, primarily as part of the disability and
survivorship plans. Substantially all employees are eligible for benefits under these disability and survivorship plans in the event of a participant’s death or disability.

Estimated amounts that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into
net periodic benefit cost in 2010 are $48 million and $14 million in pension benefits and other
postemployment benefits, respectively, and an actuarial gain of $22 million relating to other
postretirement benefits. Amounts are generally amortized into accumulated other comprehensive
income over the expected future lifetime of plan participants.

Net periodic cost (benefit) for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the eight months

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based primarily on plan-specific
investment studies using historical market returns and volatility data with forward looking
estimates based on existing financial market conditions and forecasts. Modest excess return
expectations versus some market indices are incorporated into the return projections based on the
actively managed structure of the investment programs and their records of achieving such returns
historically. We review our rate of return on plan asset assumptions annually. These assumptions
are largely based on the asset category rate-of-return assumptions developed annually with our
pension investment advisors. The advisors’ asset category return assumptions are based in part on a
review of historical asset returns, but also emphasize current market conditions to develop
estimates of future risk and return.



Plan Assets

We have adopted and implemented investment policies for our defined benefit pension plans and
disability and survivorship plan for pilots that incorporate strategic asset allocation mixes
intended to best meet their long-term obligations. This asset allocation policy mix is reviewed
every two to five years or earlier as deemed necessary. We regularly rebalance asset allocations
toward the prevailing targets. The weighted-average target and actual asset allocations for the
plans at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 are as follows:

The plan assets investment strategies utilize a diversified mix of global public and
private equity portfolios, public and private fixed income portfolios, and private real estate and
natural resource investments. The overall asset mix of the portfolios is more heavily weighted in
equity-like investments, including portions of the bond portfolio, which consist of convertible and
high yield securities. Active management strategies are utilized where feasible in an effort to
realize investment returns in excess of market indices. Currency overlay strategy is also used in
an effort to generate modest amounts of additional income. A bond duration extension program
utilizing fixed income derivatives is employed in an effort to better align the market value
movements of a portion of the plan assets to the related plan liabilities. For additional
information regarding the fair value of pension assets, see Note 3.

Benefit Payments

Benefit payments in the table below are based on the same assumptions used to measure the
related benefit obligations and are paid from both funded benefit plan trusts and current assets.
Actual benefit payments may vary significantly from these estimates. Benefits earned under our
pension plans and certain postemployment benefit plans are expected to be paid from funded benefit
plan trusts, while our other postretirement benefits are funded from current assets.

The following table summarizes, as of December 31, 2009, the benefit payments that are
scheduled to be paid in the following years ending December 31:

We also sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees in certain foreign

any period presented.



Profit Sharing Program

Our broad based employee profit sharing program provides that, for each year in which we have
an annual pre-tax profit, as defined, we will pay at least 15% of that profit to employees. If the
annual pre-tax profit is greater than $2.5 billion, we will pay 20% of the amount that exceeds $2.5
billion. We did not record an accrual under the profit sharing program in 2009 or 2008.

NOTE 11. CHAPTER 11 PROCEEDINGS

Bankruptcy Claims Resolution

Under Delta’s Plan of Reorganization, most holders of allowed general, unsecured claims
against the Delta Debtors received or will receive Delta common stock in satisfaction of their
claims. Delta’s Plan of Reorganization contemplates the distribution of 400 million shares of
common stock, consisting of 386 million shares to holders of allowed, general, unsecured claims and
14 million shares to eligible non-contract, non-management employees. As of February 12, 2010,
under Delta’s Plan of Reorganization, we have (1) distributed 333 million shares of common stock to
holders of $14.0 billion of allowed general, unsecured claims, (2) issued 14 million shares of
common stock to eligible non-contract, non-management employees and (3) reserved 53 million shares
of common stock for issuance to holders of allowed general, unsecured claims.

Northwest’s Plan of Reorganization generally provides for the distribution of Northwest common
stock to the Northwest Debtors’ creditors, employees and others in satisfaction of allowed general,
unsecured claims. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and as discussed in Note 2, each outstanding
share of Northwest common stock (including shares issuable pursuant to Northwest’s Plan of
Reorganization) was converted into the right to receive 1.25 shares of Delta common stock. As of
February 12, 2010, five million shares of Delta common stock were reserved for issuance in exchange
for shares of Northwest common stock that, but for the Merger, would have been issued under
Northwest’s Plan of Reorganization.

The Delta Debtors and the Northwest Debtors will continue to settle claims and file objections
with the bankruptcy courts regarding claims. In light of the substantial number and amount of
claims filed, we expect the claims resolution process will take additional time to complete. We
believe there will be no further material impact to the Consolidated Statements of Operations from
the settlement of claims because the holders of such claims will receive under Delta’s and
Northwest’s Plan of Reorganization, as the case may be, only their pro rata share of the
distributions of common stock contemplated by the applicable Plan of Reorganization.

The discharge of claims and liabilities primarily relates to allowed general,
unsecured claims in our Chapter 11 proceedings, such as (a) the Air Line Pilots Association,
International’s (“ALPA”) claim under our comprehensive agreement reducing pilot labor costs;
(b) the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation’s (the “PBGC”) claim relating to the termination
of the Delta Pilot Plan; (c) claims relating to changes in postretirement healthcare benefits
and the rejection of our non-qualified retirement plans; (d) claims associated with debt and
certain municipal bond obligations based upon their rejection; (e) claims relating to the
restructuring of financing arrangements or the rejection of leases for aircraft; and (f) other
claims due to the rejection or modification of certain executory contracts, unexpired leases
and contract carrier agreements.

In accordance with Delta’s Plan of Reorganization, we discharged our obligations to holders of
allowed general, unsecured claims in exchange for the distribution of 386 million newly issued
shares of common stock and the issuance of certain debt securities and obligations. Accordingly,
in discharging our liabilities subject to compromise, we recognized a reorganization gain of
$4.4 billion as follows:

We revalued our assets and liabilities at estimated fair value as a result of fresh
start reporting. This resulted in a $238 million gain, primarily reflecting the fair value of
newly recognized intangible assets, which was partially offset by reductions in the fair value
of tangible property and equipment.

(4)

Estimated claims for the four months ended April 30, 2007 relate to the
restructuring of the financing arrangements for 143 aircraft, the rejection of two aircraft
leases and adjustments to prior claims estimates.

(5)

In connection with amendments to our Contract Carrier agreements with Chautauqua and
Shuttle America, both subsidiaries of Republic Airways Holdings, Inc. (“Republic Holdings”),
which, among other things, reduced the rates we pay those carriers, we recorded (a) a $91
million allowed general, unsecured claim and (b) a $37 million net charge related to our
surrender of warrants to purchase up to 3.5 million shares of Republic Holdings common stock.
Additionally, in connection with an amendment to our Contract Carrier agreement with Freedom,
a subsidiary of Mesa, which, among other things, reduced the rates we pay that carrier, we
recorded a $35 million allowed general, unsecured claim.

(6)

In accordance with Delta’s Plan of Reorganization, we made $130 million in lump-sum
cash payments to approximately 39,000 eligible non-contract, non-management employees. We also
recorded an additional charge of $32 million related to our portion of payroll related taxes
associated with the issuance, as contemplated by Delta’s Plan of Reorganization, of
approximately 14 million shares of common stock to these employees.

(9)

For the four months ended April 30, 2007, we recorded a net $43 million gain,
primarily reflecting a $126 million net gain in connection with our settlement agreement with
the Massachusetts Port Authority, which was partially offset by a net $80 million charge from
an allowed general, unsecured claim in connection with our settlement agreement with the
Kenton County Airport Board (the “Cincinnati Airport Settlement Agreement”).

(10)

Allowed general, unsecured claims in connection with agreements reached with
committees representing pilot and non-pilot retired employees reducing their postretirement
healthcare benefits.

Fresh Start Consolidated Balance Sheet

Upon emergence from Chapter 11, we adopted fresh start reporting, which required us to revalue
our assets and liabilities to fair value. Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the
amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants. Accordingly, fair value is a market-based measurement that
is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or
liability.

To facilitate the calculation of the reorganization value of the Successor, management
developed financial projections for the Successor using a number of estimates and assumptions. The
reorganization value of the Successor was primarily based on financial projections using various
valuation methods, including (1) a comparison of our projected performance to the market values of
comparable companies and (2) a calculation of the present value of future cash flows based on our
projections. Utilizing these methodologies, the reorganization value of the Successor was estimated
to be in the range of $9.4 billion and $12.0 billion. The reorganization value was dependent upon
achieving the future financial results set forth in our projections, as well as the realization of
certain other assumptions. There can be no assurance the projections will be achieved or the
assumptions will be realized. The excess reorganization value (using the low end of the range) over
the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets, net of liabilities, was reflected as
goodwill in the Fresh Start Consolidated Balance Sheet. The financial projections and estimates of
reorganization value are not incorporated in this Form 10-K.

The methodologies used to calculate reorganization value primarily include (1) a 60% weighting
towards a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) analysis, which measures the projected multi-year, free cash
flows of the Successor to arrive at a reorganization value and (2) a 40% weighting towards a
comparable company analysis based on financial ratios and multiples of comparable companies, which
were then applied to our financial projections to arrive at a reorganization value.

DCF Analysis.

The DCF calculations were performed for the period beginning May 1, 2007 through
December 31, 2010 (“Projection Period”) discounted to April 30, 2007, the date Delta emerged from
bankruptcy. The cash flow estimates include projected changes associated with our reorganization
initiatives, anticipated changes in general market conditions and other factors. The DCF analysis
includes assumptions for (1) the weighted average cost of capital, which is used to calculate the
present value of future cash flows and (2) the terminal EBITDAR multiple, used to determine the
value after the Projection Period. A range of discount rates from 12% to 14% was used, reflecting a
number of company and market specific factors, as well as the cost of capital for comparable
companies. The terminal EBITDAR multiple of 5.50x — 6.25x is consistent with the ranges used in
the comparable company analysis.

Variations in the valuation assumptions could significantly affect the cash flow estimates.
The assumptions for which there is a reasonable possibility of variation include, but are not
limited to, assumptions regarding (1) revenues, (2) fuel costs, (3) achievement of cost reductions,
(4) discount rates, (5) international expansion and (6) the overall condition of the U.S. and
global airline industries.

Comparable Company Analysis.

The comparable company analysis identified a group of companies
with similar lines of business, business risk, growth prospects, maturity, market presence, size
and scale of operations. Revenue and EBITDAR multiples were deemed to be the most relevant when
analyzing the peer group. A range of valuation multiples was then identified and applied to our
projections to determine an estimate of reorganization values. The multiple ranges used were 0.93x
- - 1.02x times 2007 estimated revenue of $18.5 billion and 5.50x - 6.25x times 2007 estimated
EBITDAR of $2.9 billion.

All estimates, assumptions and financial projections, including the fair value adjustments,
the financial projections and the reorganization value projections, are subject to significant
uncertainties and the resolution of contingencies beyond our control. Accordingly, there can be no
assurance the estimates, assumptions and financial projections will be realized, and actual results
could vary materially.

The adjustments set forth in the following Fresh Start Consolidated Balance Sheet in the
columns captioned “Debt Discharge, Reclassifications and Distribution to Creditors,” “Repayment of
Debtor-in-Possession (“DIP”) Facility and New Exit Financing” and “Revaluation of Assets and
Liabilities” reflect the effect of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by Delta’s
Plan of Reorganization, including the settlement of various liabilities, securities issuances,
incurrence of new indebtedness and cash payments.

Debt Discharge, Reclassifications and Distribution to Creditors

. Adjustments reflect the
elimination of liabilities subject to compromise totaling $19.3 billion on our
Consolidated Balance Sheet immediately prior to the Effective Date. Excluding certain
liabilities assumed by the Successor, liabilities subject to compromise of $13.8 billion
were discharged in the Chapter 11 cases. Adjustments include:

(a)

The recognition or reinstatement of $561 million to accounts payable,
accrued salaries and related benefits comprised of (1) a $225 million obligation to
the PBGC relating to the termination of the Delta Pilot Plan (which is reflected on
the Consolidated Balance Sheet net of a $3 million discount) and (2) $339 million to
reinstate or accrue certain liabilities related to the current portion of our
pension and postretirement benefit plans and for certain administrative claims and
cure costs.

(b)

The recognition of $697 million in other notes payable comprised of (1) a
$650 million obligation relating to our comprehensive agreement with ALPA reducing
pilot labor costs (which is reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet net of a $19
million discount) and (2) $66 million principal amount of senior unsecured notes
(following the reduction of the $85 million face value of the notes for the
application of certain payments made by us in 2006 and 2007) under the Cincinnati
Airport Settlement Agreement.

(c)

The reinstatement of $4.2 billion to pension, postretirement and related
benefits comprised of (1) $3.2 billion associated with the Delta Non-Pilot Plan and
other long-term accrued benefits and (2) $1.0 billion associated with postretirement
benefits.

•

Repayment of DIP Facility and New Exit Financing

. Adjustments reflect the repayment
of the DIP Facility and borrowing under the Exit Facilities. Financing fees related to (1)
the DIP Facility were written off at the Effective Date and (2) fees related to the Exit
Facilities were capitalized and will be amortized over the term of the facility.

•

Revaluation of Assets and Liabilities

. Significant adjustments reflected in the Fresh
Start Consolidated Balance Sheet based on the revaluation of assets and liabilities are
summarized as follows:



(f)

Noncurrent liabilities—other

. An adjustment of $1.2 billion primarily
related to the tax effect of fresh start valuation adjustments.

(g)

Total stockholders’ deficit

. The adoption of fresh start reporting
resulted in a new reporting entity with no beginning retained earnings or
accumulated deficit. All common stock of the Predecessor was eliminated and replaced
by the new equity structure of the Successor based on Delta’s Plan of
Reorganization. The Fresh Start Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects initial
stockholders’ equity value of $9.4 billion, representing the low end in the range of
$9.4 billion to $12.0 billion estimated in our financial projections developed in
connection with Delta’s Plan of Reorganization. The low end of the range is
estimated to reflect market conditions as of the Effective Date and therefore was
used to establish initial stockholders’ equity value.

NOTE 12. EQUITY AND EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION

Equity

Common Stock.

On the Effective Date, all common stock issued by the Predecessor was cancelled.
We began issuing shares of new common stock at emergence from bankruptcy pursuant to Delta’s Plan
of Reorganization. The new common stock is subject to the terms of our Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation (the “New Certificate”), which supersedes the Certificate of
Incorporation in effect prior to the Effective Date.

The New Certificate authorizes us to issue a total of 2.0 billion shares of capital stock, of
which 1.5 billion may be shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and 500 million may
be shares of preferred stock. Delta’s Plan of Reorganization contemplates the issuance of 400
million shares of common stock, consisting of 386 million shares to holders of allowed general,
unsecured claims and up to 14 million shares to approximately 39,000 non-contract, non-management
employees under the Delta Air Lines, Inc. 2007 Performance Compensation Plan (the “2007 Plan”). Our
Plan of Reorganization also contemplates the issuance of common stock under the 2007 Plan for
management employees.

In connection with the Merger, we issued, or expect to issue, a total of 339 million shares of
Delta common stock in exchange for the Northwest common stock outstanding on the Closing Date or
issuable under Northwest’s Plan of Reorganization. Additionally, in connection with the Merger, we
(1) issued 50 million shares of common stock to eligible Delta and Northwest pilots; (2) granted 34
million shares of common stock to substantially all U.S. based non-pilot employees of Delta and
Northwest; and (3) granted 17 million shares of restricted stock and non-qualified stock options to
purchase 12 million shares of common stock to management personnel. The awards to management
personnel will fully vest over approximately three years, subject to the participant’s continued
employment.

Preferred Stock.

The New Certificate permits us to issue preferred stock in one or more
series. It authorizes the Board of Directors (1) to fix the descriptions, powers (including voting
powers), preferences, rights, qualifications, limitations and restrictions with respect to any
series of preferred stock and (2) to specify the number of shares of any series of preferred stock.
As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, no preferred stock had been issued.

Treasury Stock.

We generally withhold shares of Delta common stock to cover
employees’ portion of required tax withholdings when employee equity awards are issued or vest.
These shares are valued at cost, which equals the market price of the common stock on the date of
issuance or vesting. There were approximately 11 million shares of common stock held in treasury at
a weighted average cost of $15.89 per share at December 31, 2009. In December 2008, we sold from
treasury approximately 18 million shares of our common stock that were previously withheld as the
employee portion of tax withholdings on the issuance and vesting of employee equity awards in
connection with the Merger. The $192 million of net proceeds from the offering was available for
general corporate purposes. There were approximately eight million shares of common stock held in
treasury at a weighted average cost of $20.11 per share at December 31, 2008. Substantially all of
these shares were withheld to cover the employees’ portion of required tax withholdings on equity
awards.



Equity-Based Compensation

Successor

Upon emergence from Chapter 11, we adopted with Bankruptcy Court approval the 2007 Plan, a
broad based equity and cash compensation plan. The 2007 Plan provides for grants of restricted
stock, stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, performance awards,
including cash incentive awards, and other stock based awards. Shares of common stock issued under
the 2007 Plan may be made available from authorized but unissued common stock or common stock we
acquire. If any shares of our common stock are covered by an award that is cancelled, forfeited or
otherwise terminates without delivery of shares (including shares surrendered or withheld for
payment of the exercise price of an award or taxes related to an award), then such shares will
again be available for issuance under the 2007 Plan.

In connection with the Merger, we amended the 2007 Plan with stockholder approval to increase
the number of shares of Delta common stock issuable under the plan from 30 million to 157 million.
The purpose of this amendment was to permit Delta to grant equity to substantially all employees of
the combined company in connection with the Merger. There were 35 million shares available for
future grants under the 2007 Plan as of December 31, 2009.

Non-cash compensation expense for equity awards is recognized over the employee’s requisite
service period (generally, the vesting period of the award). We use straight-line recognition for
awards with installment vesting. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we recognized
expense associated with restricted stock, stock option, and
performance share grants of $108 million and $66 million in salaries and related costs, respectively. The closing of the Merger
constituted a change in control under the 2007 Plan, which caused the vesting of substantially all
previously unvested equity awards and resulted in the recording of an additional $75 million in
2008 in expense to restructuring and merger-related items. These expenses do not represent cash
payments actually made to employees; rather it represents non-cash compensation expense
recognition. The actual value of these awards to the recipients depends on the price of Delta
common stock when the awards vest.

As of December 31, 2009, approximately $109 million of total unrecognized costs related to
unvested shares and options are expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average
period of 0.9 years. Approximately $69 million is expected to be recognized in 2010.

Stock Grants.

In connection with the Merger, we granted equity to substantially all employees
of Delta and Northwest. U.S. based non-pilot, non-management employees received 34 million shares
of common stock. Pilot employees received 50 million shares of common stock. The fair value of
these grants was based on the closing price of the common stock on the date of grant and resulted
in a $791 million charge in restructuring and merger-related items. In 2007, upon emergence from
Chapter 11, we issued 14 million shares of common stock to non-contract, non-management employees.
Employees may hold or sell these shares without restriction.

Merger Awards.

In connection with the Merger, we made grants of restricted stock and stock
options to approximately 700 management level employees under the 2007 Plan. As discussed below,
these grants vest over three years, subject to the employee’s continued employment.

Restricted Stock

. Restricted stock is common stock that may not be sold or otherwise
transferred for a period of time and that is subject to forfeiture in certain circumstances. The
fair value of the restricted stock awards is based on the closing price of the common stock on the
date of grant. In connection with the Merger, we granted 17 million shares of restricted stock,
which, subject to the employee’s continued employment, vest over three years in four installments
(20% on May 1, 2009, 20% on November 1, 2009, 20% on May 1, 2010, and 40% on November 1, 2011).
Upon emergence from Chapter 11, we granted eight million shares of restricted stock to eligible
employees. Substantially all of these awards, to the extent not previously vested, vested upon the
closing of the Merger. We expect substantially all unvested restricted stock awards at December 31,
2009 to vest during the vesting period.

The following table summarizes restricted stock activity for the year ended December 31, 2009:

The total fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008
was $68 million and $107 million, respectively.

Stock Options.

Stock option awards are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing
price of Delta common stock on the date of grant. Generally, outstanding employee options vest over
several years and have a 10-year term, subject to the employee’s continued employment.

The fair value of stock options is determined at the grant date using an option pricing model
based on several assumptions. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect for
the expected term of the options at the time of grant. The dividend yield on our common stock is
assumed to be zero since we do not pay dividends and have no current plans to do so. The expected
life of the options was developed assuming that the options will be exercised evenly from the time
they become exercisable to expiration due to the lack of exercise history. We base our volatility
assumptions on historical volatilities of the stock of comparable publicly-traded airlines, using
daily stock price returns equal to our expected option lives. We have used this volatility
assumption due to the lack of trading history of Delta common stock since emergence from Chapter
11.

We granted stock options to purchase 12 million shares of common stock in connection with the
Merger. These options become exercisable in four installments (20% on May 1, 2009, 20% on November
1, 2009, 20% on May 1, 2010, and 40% on November 1, 2011), subject to the employee’s continued
employment. We granted options to purchase four million shares of common stock to eligible
employees upon emergence from Chapter 11. Substantially all of these awards, to the extent not
previously exercisable, became exercisable upon the closing of the Merger. Pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, outstanding stock options under the Northwest 2007 Stock Incentive Plan were assumed by
Delta and modified to provide for the purchase of Delta common stock. Accordingly, the number of
shares and the exercise price were adjusted for the 1.25 exchange ratio. We have not granted any
stock options subsequent to those granted in 2008 in connection with the Merger.

The weighted average fair value of options granted in 2008 was determined based on the
following assumptions:

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during the year ended
December 31, 2008 was $4.86.

Performance Shares.

Performance shares are long-term incentive opportunities which are payable
in common stock and are generally contingent upon our achieving certain financial goals. During
2008, we granted performance shares with an aggregate target payout opportunity covering
approximately two million shares of common stock. The closing of the Merger caused the vesting at
target of substantially all previously unvested performance shares.

Other.

There was no corresponding tax benefit in 2009, 2008 or 2007 related to the stock-based
compensation, as we record a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets due to the
uncertainty regarding the ultimate realization of those assets. For additional information, see
Note 9.

NOTE 14. GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise with separate financial
information, which are evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker and are used in
resource allocation and performance assessments.

We are managed as a single business unit that provides air transportation for passengers and
cargo. This allows us to benefit from an integrated revenue pricing and route network. Our flight
equipment forms one fleet, which is deployed through a single route scheduling system. When making
resource allocation decisions, our chief operating decision maker evaluates flight profitability
data, which considers aircraft type and route economics, but gives no weight to the financial
impact of the resource allocation decision on an individual carrier basis. Our objective in making
resource allocation decisions is to optimize our consolidated financial results.



Operating revenue is assigned to a specific geographic region based on the origin, flight path
and destination of each flight segment. Our operating revenue by geographic region for the years
ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the eight months ended December 31, 2007 and the four months
ended April 30, 2007 are summarized in the following table:

Severance and related costs primarily relate to voluntary workforce reduction programs for U.S.
employees. In 2009, we recorded $119 million associated with workforce reduction programs,
including $6 million of special termination benefits related to retiree healthcare. We expect any
additional charges incurred under these programs will not be material. In 2008, we recorded $114
million associated with workforce reduction programs.

Contract Carrier restructuring costs relate primarily to the early termination of certain
capacity purchase agreements with our Contract Carriers.

Facilities and other costs primarily relate to the closing operations in airports. In 2008,
the costs primarily relate to the closing of operations in Concourse
C at the Cincinnati/Northern
Kentucky International Airport. Upon our exit from Concourse C, we recorded a one-time charge of
$18 million based on the estimated present value of future rents.

Merger-related items relate to costs associated with integrating the operations of Northwest
into Delta, including costs related to information technology, employee relocation and training,
and re-branding of aircraft and stations.

We did not have any restructuring and merger-related items in 2007.

We acquired a B-747-200F dedicated cargo freighter fleet in our Merger with Northwest and
recorded the fair value of the fleet at the Closing Date. We grounded the entire fleet by December
31, 2009 due to its age and inefficiency. We reviewed the fleet and related spare engines for
impairment during the year ended December 31, 2009 and concluded that no material impairment
existed.

NOTE 16. (LOSS) EARNINGS PER SHARE

We calculate basic (loss) earnings per share by dividing the net (loss) income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Shares issuable
upon the satisfaction of certain conditions are considered outstanding and included in the
computation of basic (loss) earnings per share. Accordingly, the calculation of basic (loss)
earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 and the eight months ended
December 31, 2007 assumes there was outstanding at the beginning of each of these periods all 386
million shares contemplated by Delta’s Plan of Reorganization to be distributed to holders of
allowed general, unsecured claims. Similarly, the calculation of basic loss per share for the years
ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 assumes there was outstanding at January 1, 2009 and the Closing
Date, respectively, the following shares in connection with the Merger: (1) 50 million shares of
Delta common stock we agreed to issue on behalf of Delta and Northwest pilots and (2) nine million
shares of Delta common stock reserved for issuance in exchange for shares of Northwest common stock
that, but for the Merger, would have been issued under Northwest’s Plan of Reorganization.

The following table shows the reconciliation of actual shares issued and outstanding to
those considered outstanding for purposes of the calculation of basic loss per share as of December
31, 2009:

common stock were assumed issued for purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share.

During the December 2009 quarter, as a result of the Income Tax Allocation, we
recorded a non-cash income tax benefit of $321 million on the loss from continuing operations,
with an offsetting non-cash income tax expense of $321 million on other comprehensive income.



ITEM 9.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

None.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed
an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, which have been designed to permit us to
effectively identify and timely disclose important information. Our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the controls and procedures were
effective as of December 31, 2009 to ensure that material information was accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Changes in Internal Control

Except as set forth below, during the three months ended December 31, 2009, we did not make
any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

On October 29, 2008, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours merged with and into Northwest.
On December 31, 2009, NWA merged with and into Delta, ending NWA’s separate existence. We are currently integrating
policies, processes, people, technology and operations for the combined company. Management will
continue to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting as we execute Merger integration
activities.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies may deteriorate.

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2009 using the criteria issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework. Based on
that evaluation, management believes that our internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December 31, 2009.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 has
been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, which also
audited our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2009. Ernst & Young
LLP’s report on our internal control over financial reporting is set forth below.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Delta Air Lines, Inc.

We have audited Delta Air Lines, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Delta
Air Lines, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Delta Air Lines, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Delta Air Lines, Inc. as of
December 31, 2009 (Successor) and 2008 (Successor), and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2009
(Successor) and 2008 (Successor), the eight-month period ended December 31, 2007 (Successor) and
the four-month period ended April 30, 2007 (Predecessor) of Delta Air Lines, Inc. and our report
dated February 24, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
