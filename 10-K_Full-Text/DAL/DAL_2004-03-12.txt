PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

General Description

We are a major air carrier that provides scheduled air transportation for
passengers and cargo throughout the United States and around the world. As of
March 1, 2004, we (including our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Atlantic Southeast
Airlines, Inc. (“ASA”) and Comair, Inc. (“Comair”)) served 206 domestic cities
in 47 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin
Islands, as well as 48 cities in 32 countries. With our domestic and
international codeshare partners, our route network covers 264 domestic cities
in 47 states, and 230 cities in 84 countries. We are managed as a single
business unit.

Based on calendar year 2003 data, we are the second-largest airline in
terms of passengers carried, and the third-largest airline measured by
operating revenues and revenue passenger miles flown. We are a leading U.S.
transatlantic airline, serving the largest number of nonstop markets and
offering the second-most daily flight departures. Among U.S. airlines, we have
the second-most transatlantic passengers.

For the year ended December 31, 2003, passenger revenues accounted for 93%
of our consolidated operating revenues, and cargo revenues and other sources
accounted for 7% of our consolidated operating revenues. In 2003, our
operations in North America, the Atlantic, Latin America and the Pacific
accounted for 82%, 13%, 4% and 1%, respectively, of our consolidated operating
revenues.


We are incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. Our
principal executive offices are located at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta
International Airport in Atlanta, Georgia (the “Atlanta Airport”). Our
telephone number is (404) 715-2600, and our Internet address is www.delta.com.

General information about us, including our Corporate Governance
Principles and the charters for the committees of our Board of Directors, can
be found at www.delta.com/inside/investors/corp_info/corp_governance/index.jsp.
Our Board of Directors has adopted a code of ethics entitled “Code of Ethics
and Business Conduct,” which applies to all of our employees. Our Board of
Directors has also adopted a separate “Code of Ethics and Business Conduct for
the Board of Directors.” We will disclose amendments to and any waivers
granted to officers or members of the Board of Directors under these codes
promptly on our website. Copies of these codes can also be found at
www.delta.com/inside/investors/corp_info/corp_governance/index.jsp. We will

See Item 1. “Business—Risk Factors Relating to the Airline Industry and
Delta” and Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations—Business Environment” for a discussion of trends and
factors affecting us and our industry.

Airline Operations

An important characteristic of our route network is our hub airports in
Atlanta, Cincinnati, Dallas/Fort Worth and Salt Lake City. Each of these hub
operations includes Delta flights that gather and distribute traffic from
markets in the geographic region surrounding the hub to other major cities and
to other Delta hubs. Our hub and spoke system also provides passengers with
access to our principal international gateways in Atlanta and New York — John
F. Kennedy International Airport (“JFK”). As briefly discussed below, other
key characteristics of our route network include our alliances with foreign
airlines; the Delta Connection Program; the Delta Shuttle; Song™, our low-fare
service; and our marketing alliance with Continental Airlines, Inc.
(“Continental”) and Northwest Airlines, Inc. (“Northwest”).

International Alliances. We have formed bilateral and multilateral
marketing alliances with foreign airlines to improve our access to
international markets. These arrangements can include codesharing, frequent
flyer benefits, shared or reciprocal access to passenger lounges, joint
promotions and other marketing agreements.



Our international codesharing agreements enable us to market and sell
seats to an expanded number of international destinations. Under codesharing
arrangements, we and the foreign carriers publish our respective airline
designator codes on a single flight operation, thereby allowing us and the
foreign carrier to offer joint service with one aircraft rather than operating
separate services with two aircraft. These arrangements typically allow us to
sell seats on the foreign carrier’s aircraft that are marketed under our “DL”
designator code and permit the foreign airline to sell seats on our aircraft
that are marketed under the foreign carrier’s two-letter designator code. As
of March 1, 2004, we have codeshare arrangements in effect with Aerolitoral,
Aeromexico, Air France (and certain of Air France’s affiliated carriers
operating flights beyond Paris), Air Jamaica, Alitalia, Avianca, British
European, China Airlines, China Southern, CSA Czech Airlines, El Al Israel
Airlines, Korean Air, Royal Air Maroc and South African Airways.

Delta, Aeromexico, Air France, Alitalia, CSA Czech Airlines and Korean Air
are members of the SkyTeam international airline alliance. SkyTeam links the
route networks of the member airlines, providing opportunities for increased
connecting traffic while offering enhanced customer service through mutual
codesharing arrangements, reciprocal frequent flyer and lounge programs and
coordinated cargo operations. In 2002, we, our European SkyTeam partners and
Korean Air received limited antitrust immunity from the U.S. Department of
Transportation (“DOT”). The grant of antitrust immunity enables us and our
immunized partners to offer a more integrated route network, and develop common
sales, marketing and discount programs for customers.

Delta Connection Program. The Delta Connection program is our regional
carrier service, which feeds traffic to our route system through contracts with
regional air carriers that operate flights serving passengers primarily in
small and medium-sized cities. The program enables us to increase the number
of flights in certain locations, to better match capacity with demand and to
preserve our presence in smaller markets. Our Delta Connection
network operates the largest number of regional jets in the United States.

We have contractual arrangements with six regional carriers to operate
regional jet and turboprop aircraft using our “DL” code. ASA and Comair are
our wholly-owned subsidiaries, which operate all of their flights under our
code. We also have agreements with Atlantic Coast Airlines
(“ACA”), SkyWest Airlines, Inc. (“SkyWest”),
Chautauqua Airlines, Inc. (“Chautauqua”) and American Eagle
Airlines, Inc. (“Eagle”), which operate some of their flights using our code.
For information regarding our agreements with ACA, SkyWest and Chautauqua, see
Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our contract with Eagle, which is limited to certain flights operated to
and from the Los Angeles International Airport, as well as a portion of our
SkyWest agreement, are structured as revenue proration agreements. These
prorate arrangements establish a fixed dollar or percentage division of
revenues for tickets sold to passengers traveling on connecting flight
itineraries.

Delta Shuttle. The Delta Shuttle is our high frequency service targeted
to Northeast business travelers. It provides nonstop, hourly service between
New York - LaGuardia Airport



(“LaGuardia”) (Marine Air Terminal) and both Boston — Logan International
Airport (“Logan”) and Washington, D.C. — Ronald Reagan National Airport
(“National”).

Song. On April 15, 2003, we introduced a new low-fare operation, Song,
that primarily offers flights between cities in the Northeastern United States,
Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Florida leisure destinations. As of March 1, 2004,
Song offered 144 daily flights using a fleet of 36 Boeing 757 aircraft. Song
is intended to assist us in competing more effectively with low-cost carriers
in leisure markets through a combination of larger aircraft, high frequency
flights, advanced in-flight entertainment technology and innovative product
offerings.

Delta-Continental-Northwest Marketing Alliance. We have entered into a
marketing alliance with Continental and Northwest which includes mutual
codesharing and reciprocal frequent flyer and airport lounge access
arrangements. Our marketing relationship with Continental and Northwest is
designed to permit the carriers to retain their separate identities and route
networks while increasing the number of domestic and international connecting
passengers using the three carriers’ route networks.

Regulatory Matters

The DOT and the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) exercise
regulatory authority over air transportation in the United States. The DOT has
authority to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity required
for airlines to provide domestic air transportation. An air carrier that the
DOT finds “fit” to operate is given unrestricted authority to operate domestic
air transportation (including the carriage of passengers and cargo). Except
for constraints imposed by Essential Air Service regulations, which are
applicable to certain small communities, airlines may terminate service to a
city without restriction.

The DOT has jurisdiction over certain economic and consumer protection
matters such as unfair or deceptive practices or methods of competition,
advertising, denied boarding compensation, baggage liability and disabled
passenger transportation. The DOT also has authority to review certain joint
venture agreements between major carriers. The FAA has primary responsibility
for matters relating to air carrier flight operations, including airline
operating certificates, control of navigable air space, flight personnel,
aircraft certification and maintenance, and other matters affecting air safety.

Authority to operate international routes and international codesharing
arrangements are regulated by the DOT and by the foreign governments involved.
International route awards are also subject to the approval of the President of
the United States for conformance with national defense and foreign policy
objectives.

The Transportation Security Administration, which became a division of the
Department of Homeland Security on March 1, 2003, is responsible for certain
civil aviation security matters, including passenger and baggage screening at
U.S. airports.

We are also subject to various other federal, state, local and foreign
laws and regulations. The Department of Justice (“DOJ”) has jurisdiction over
airline competition matters. The U.S.



Postal Service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of
mail. Labor relations in the airline industry are generally governed by the
Railway Labor Act. Environmental matters are regulated by various federal,
state, local and foreign governmental entities. Privacy of passenger and
employee data is regulated by domestic and foreign laws that are not consistent
in all countries in which we operate.

Fares and Rates

Airlines are permitted to set ticket prices in most domestic and
international city pairs without governmental regulation, and the industry is
characterized by significant price competition. Certain international fares
and rates are subject to the jurisdiction of the DOT and the governments of the
foreign countries involved. Most of our tickets are sold by travel agents, and
fares are subject to commissions, overrides and discounts paid to travel
agents, brokers and wholesalers.

Route Authority

Our flight operations are authorized by certificates of public convenience
and necessity and, to a limited extent, by exemptions issued by the DOT. The
requisite approvals of other governments for international operations are
provided by bilateral agreements with, or permits or approvals issued by,
foreign countries. Because international air transportation is governed by
bilateral or other agreements between the United States and the foreign country
or countries involved, changes in United States or foreign government aviation
policies could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements,
diminish the value of our international route authorities or otherwise affect
our international operations. Bilateral agreements between the United States
and various foreign countries served by us are subject to renegotiation from
time to time.

Certain of our international route and codesharing authorities are subject
to periodic renewal requirements. We request extension of these authorities
when and as appropriate. While the DOT usually renews temporary authorities on
routes where the authorized carrier is providing a reasonable level of service,
there is no assurance of this result. Dormant route authority may not be
renewed in some cases, especially where another U.S. carrier indicates a
willingness to provide service.

Competition

We face significant competition with respect to routes, services and
fares. Our domestic routes are subject to competition from both new and
existing carriers, some of which have substantially lower costs than we do and
provide service at lower fares to destinations served by us. We also compete
with all-cargo carriers, charter airlines, regional jet operators and,
particularly on our shorter routes, surface transportation.

The continuing growth of low-cost carriers, including Southwest Airlines
Co. (“Southwest”), AirTran Airways, Inc. (“AirTran”) and JetBlue Airways
Corporation (“JetBlue”), in the United States places significant competitive
pressures on us and other network carriers.



Our ability to compete effectively with low-cost carriers and other airlines
depends, in part, on our ability to achieve operating costs per available seat
mile (“unit costs”) that are competitive with those carriers. Our unit costs
are significantly higher than those of Southwest, AirTran and JetBlue and have
gone from being among the lowest of the hub-and-spoke carriers to among the
highest for the full year 2003. If we are not able to realign our cost
structure to compete with that of other carriers, or if fare reductions
are not offset by higher yields, our business, financial condition and
operating results may be materially adversely affected.

International marketing alliances formed by domestic and foreign carriers,
including the Star Alliance (among United Airlines, Inc. (“United”), Lufthansa
German Airlines and others) and the oneworld alliance (among AMR Corporation
(“American”), British Airways and others), have significantly increased
competition in international markets. Through marketing and codesharing
arrangements with U.S. carriers, foreign carriers have obtained access to
interior U.S. passenger traffic. Similarly, U.S. carriers have increased their
ability to sell international transportation such as transatlantic services to
and beyond European cities through alliances with international carriers.

We regularly monitor competitive developments in the airline industry and
evaluate our strategic alternatives. These strategic alternatives include,
among other things, internal growth, codesharing arrangements, marketing
alliances, joint ventures, and mergers and acquisitions. Our evaluations
involve internal analysis and, where appropriate, discussions with third
parties.

Airport Access

Operations at three major U.S. airports and certain foreign airports
served by us are regulated by governmental entities through “slot” allocations.
Each slot represents the authorization to land at, or take off from, the
particular airport during a specified time period.

In the United States, the FAA currently regulates slot allocations at JFK
and LaGuardia in New York and National in Washington, D.C. Our operations at
those three airports generally require slot allocations. Under legislation
enacted by Congress, slot rules will be phased out at JFK and LaGuardia by 2007.

We currently have sufficient slot authorizations to operate our existing
flights, and have generally been able to obtain slots to expand our operations
and to change our schedules. There is no assurance, however, that we will be
able to obtain slots for these purposes in the future because, among other
reasons, slot allocations are subject to changes in governmental policies.



Possible Legislation or DOT Regulation

A number of Congressional bills and proposed DOT regulations have been
considered in recent years to address airline competition issues. Some of
these proposals would require large airlines with major operations at certain
airports to divest or make available to other airlines slots, gates, facilities
and other assets at those airports. Other measures would limit the service or
pricing responses of major carriers that appear to target new entrant airlines.
In addition, concerns about airport congestion issues have caused the DOT and
FAA to consider various proposals for access to certain airports, including
“congestion-based” landing fees and programs that would withdraw slots from
existing carriers and reallocate those slots (either by lottery or auction) to
the highest bidder or to carriers with little or no current presence at such
airports. These proposals, if enacted, could negatively impact our existing
services and our ability to respond to competitive actions by other airlines.

Worldspan

In June 2003,
we sold our equity interest in WORLDSPAN, L.P., which
operates and markets a computer reservation system for the travel industry.
For additional information concerning this sale, see Note 17 of the Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Orbitz

Orbitz, Inc.
(“Orbitz”) operates an online travel agency that offers
travel services to consumers and business customers via the Internet. During
December 2003, Orbitz completed its initial public offering and the founding
airlines of Orbitz, including us, sold a portion of their Orbitz shares. As of
March 1, 2004, we owned approximately 13% of Orbitz. American, Continental,
Northwest and United also hold ownership interests in Orbitz. For additional
information concerning our sale of a portion of our interest in Orbitz, see
Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Consumers use online travel agents for making reservations and purchasing
airline tickets, hotel rooms, rental cars and travel-related products. The
three largest online travel agents in the United States are Expedia,
Travelocity and Orbitz. Online travel agents compete with one another, with
airline websites, with traditional travel agents and with other travel service
providers for travel-related reservations and bookings.



Fuel

Our results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the
price and availability of aircraft fuel. The following table shows our
aircraft fuel consumption and costs for 2001-2003.

Net of fuel hedge gains under our fuel hedging program.

Aircraft fuel
expense increased 15% in 2003 compared to 2002. Total
gallons consumed decreased 6% mainly due to capacity reductions. The average
fuel price per gallon rose 22% to 81.78¢ as compared to 2002. Our fuel cost is
shown net of fuel hedge gains of $152 million for 2003, $136 million for 2002
and $299 million for 2001. Approximately 65%, 56% and 58% of our aircraft fuel
requirements were hedged during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In February
2004, we settled all of our fuel hedge contracts prior to their scheduled
settlement dates. For more information concerning the settlement of our fuel
hedge contracts, see Note 22 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Our aircraft
fuel purchase contracts do not provide material protection
against price increases or assure the availability of our fuel supplies. We
purchase most of our aircraft fuel from petroleum refiners under contracts that
establish the price based on various market indices. We also purchase aircraft
fuel on the spot market, from off-shore sources and under contracts that permit
the refiners to set the price.

To attempt
to reduce our exposure to changes in fuel prices, we
periodically enter into heating and crude oil derivative contracts.
Information regarding our fuel hedging program is set forth under Item 7.
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Market Risks Associated with Financial Instruments—Aircraft Fuel
Price Risk” and in Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Although we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft
fuel, it is impossible to predict the future availability or price of aircraft
fuel. Political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries, changes
in government policy concerning aircraft fuel production, transportation or
marketing, changes in aircraft fuel production capacity, environmental concerns
and other unpredictable events may result in fuel supply shortages and fuel
price increases in the future.



Employee Matters

Railway Labor Act. Our relations with labor unions in the United States
are governed by the Railway Labor Act. Under the Railway Labor Act, a labor
union seeking to represent an unrepresented craft or class of employees is
required to file with the National Mediation Board (“NMB”) an application
alleging a representation dispute, along with authorization cards signed by at
least 35% of the employees in that craft or class. The NMB then investigates
the dispute and, if it finds the labor union has obtained a sufficient number
of authorization cards, conducts an election to determine whether to certify
the labor union as the collective bargaining representative of that craft or
class. Under the NMB’s usual rules, a labor union will be certified as the
representative of the employees in a craft or class only if more than 50% of
those employees vote for union representation.

Under the Railway Labor Act, a collective bargaining agreement between an
airline and a labor union does not expire, but instead becomes amendable as of
a stated date. Either party may request the NMB to appoint a federal mediator
to participate in the negotiations for a new or amended agreement. If no
agreement is reached in mediation, the NMB may determine, at any time, that an
impasse exists and offer binding arbitration. If either party rejects binding
arbitration, a 30-day “cooling off” period begins. At the end of this 30-day
period, the parties may engage in “self help,” unless the President of the
United States appoints a Presidential Emergency Board (“PEB”) to investigate
and report on the dispute. The appointment of a PEB maintains the “status quo”
for an additional 60 days. If the parties do not reach agreement during this
period, the parties may then engage in “self help.” “Self help” includes,
among other things, a strike by the union or the imposition of proposed changes
to the collective bargaining agreement by the airline. Congress and the
President have the authority to prevent “self help” by enacting legislation
which, among other things, imposes a settlement on the parties.

Collective Bargaining. At December 31, 2003, we had a total of
approximately 70,600 full-time equivalent employees. Approximately 18% of
these employees are represented by unions. The following table presents
certain information concerning the union representation of our domestic
employees.

ASA is in collective

Association, International (“ALPA”), which represents ASA’s approximately 1,450
pilots and with the Association of Flight Attendants (“AFA”), which represents
ASA’s approximately 800 flight attendants. The outcome of these collective
bargaining negotiations cannot presently be determined.

Labor unions are engaged in organizing efforts to represent various groups
of employees of us, ASA and Comair who are not represented for collective
bargaining purposes. The outcome of these organizing efforts cannot presently
be determined.

Pilot Furloughs.
The collective bargaining agreement with ALPA, the union representing
Delta’s pilots, generally provides that no pilot on the
seniority list as of July 1, 2001 will be furloughed unless the furlough is
caused by a circumstance beyond our control, as defined in that agreement. In
April 2002, an arbitrator upheld our right to furlough up to 1,400 pilots on
the basis that the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the resulting
reduction in passenger traffic constituted a circumstance beyond our control as
set out in the collective bargaining agreement. The arbitrator retained
jurisdiction over this matter to consider any issues that might arise regarding
our plans to continue the furloughs, or our obligation to implement reasonable
mechanisms for recalling furloughed pilots, if the conditions existing as of
September 11, 2001 were ameliorated to an extent that exceeded our original
expectations. On February 13, 2003, the arbitrator issued a supplemental
opinion, ruling (1) that furloughs will be capped at 1,060, the number of
pilots currently furloughed; (2) that we will not have to begin recalling any
of the existing furloughed pilots until system traffic exceeds pre-September
11, 2001 levels; and (3) that the recall schedule will be subject to our
training capacity. While this ruling will result in the retention of some
pilots in excess of our needs, we believe the ruling will not have a material
adverse effect on us.



Environmental Matters

The Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 (the “ANCA”) recognizes the
rights of operators of airports with noise problems to implement local noise
abatement programs so long as such programs do not interfere unreasonably with
interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system. It
generally provides that local noise restrictions on Stage 3 aircraft first
effective after October 1, 1990, require FAA approval. While we have had
sufficient scheduling flexibility to accommodate local noise restrictions in
the past, our operations could be adversely impacted if locally-imposed
regulations become more restrictive or widespread.

On December 1, 2003, the FAA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
(“NPRM”) to adopt the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (“ICAO”)
Chapter 4 noise standard, which is known as the Stage 4 standard in the United
States. This standard would require that all new commercial jet aircraft
designs certified on or after January 1, 2006 be at least ten decibels quieter
than the existing Stage 3 noise standard requires. This new standard would not
apply to existing aircraft or to the continued production of aircraft types
already certified. Comments on the NPRM are due on March 1, 2004. All new
aircraft that we have on order will meet the proposed Stage 4 standard.
Accordingly, the proposed rule is not expected to have any significant impact
on us, and we and the U.S. airline industry are likely to support the adoption
of the NPRM.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) is
authorized to regulate aircraft emissions. Our aircraft comply with the
applicable EPA standards. The EPA has issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to
adopt the emissions control standards for aircraft engines previously adopted
by the ICAO. These standards would apply to newly designed engines certified
after December 31, 2003 and would align the U.S. aircraft engine emission
standards with existing international standards. The rule, as proposed, is not
expected to have a material impact on us.

Air carriers, the EPA, the FAA and local and state regulators are
evaluating potential options for emission reductions from airport activities,
including aircraft engine emissions reductions and alternative-fueled ground
service equipment, but no conclusion or agreement has been reached.
Additionally, we have agreed to reduce emissions at certain airports by
utilizing alternative-fueled ground service equipment.

In April 2001, Miami-Dade County filed a lawsuit, which is titled
Miami-Dade County, Florida v. Advance Cargo Services, Inc., et al., in Florida
Circuit Court against 17 defendants, including us, alleging responsibility for
past and future environmental cleanup costs and civil penalties for
environmental conditions at Miami International Airport. The County also
provided notice to over 200 other potentially responsible parties seeking to
recover past and future cleanup costs. The County is continuing to investigate
and remediate various environmental conditions at the airport. At this time,
it is not possible to reasonably estimate our potential exposure in this matter
due to a number of issues, including uncertainties regarding the contamination
at the airport, the extent of remediation required and the County’s potential
recovery from responsible parties. We are vigorously defending the lawsuit.



We have been identified by the EPA as a potentially responsible party (a
“PRP”) with respect to certain Superfund Sites, and have entered into consent
decrees regarding some of these sites. Our alleged disposal volume at each of
these sites is small when compared to the total contributions of all PRPs at
each site. We are aware of soil and/or ground water contamination present on
our current or former leaseholds at several domestic airports. To address this
contamination, we have a program in place to investigate and, if appropriate,
remediate these sites. Although the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot
be predicted with certainty, management believes that the resolution of these
matters will not have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Frequent Flyer Program

We have a frequent flyer program, the SkyMiles® program, offering
incentives to increase travel on Delta. This program allows participants to
earn mileage for travel awards by flying on Delta, Delta Connection carriers
and participating airlines. Mileage credit may also be earned by using certain
services offered by program partners such as credit card companies, hotels, car
rental agencies, telecommunication services and internet services. In
addition, we have programs under which individuals and companies may purchase
mileage credits. We reserve the right to terminate the program with six months
advance notice, and to change the program’s terms and conditions at any time
without notice.

Mileage credits can be redeemed for free or upgraded air travel on Delta
and participating airline partners, for membership in our Crown Room Club and
for other program partner awards. Travel awards are subject to certain
transfer restrictions and capacity-controlled seating. In some cases, blackout
dates may apply. Miles earned prior to May 1, 1995 do not expire so long as we
have a frequent flyer program. Miles earned or purchased on or after May 1,
1995 will not expire as long as, at least once every three years, the
participant (1) takes a qualifying flight on Delta or a Delta Connection
carrier; (2) earns miles through one of our program partners; or (3) redeems
miles for any program award.

We account for our frequent flyer program obligations by recording a
liability for the estimated incremental cost of travel awards we expect to be
redeemed. The estimated incremental cost associated with a travel award does
not include any contribution to overhead or profit. Such incremental cost is
based on our system average cost per passenger for fuel, food and other direct
passenger costs. We do not record a liability for mileage earned by
participants who have not reached the level to become eligible for a free
travel award. We believe this is appropriate because the large majority of
these participants are not expected to earn a travel award. We do not record a
liability for the expected redemption of miles for non-travel awards since the
cost of these awards to us is negligible.

We estimated the potential number of round-trip travel awards outstanding
under our frequent flyer program to be 14.3 million, 13.7 million and 13.1
million at December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Of these travel
awards, we expected that approximately 10.4 million, 10.0 million and 9.6
million, respectively, would be redeemed. At December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
we had recorded a liability for these awards of $229 million, $228 million and
$226 million, respectively. The difference between the round-trip awards
outstanding and the



awards expected to be redeemed is the estimate, based on historical data, of
awards which will (1) never be redeemed; or (2) be redeemed for something other
than award travel.

Frequent flyer program participants flew 2.8 million, 2.8 million and 2.4
million award round-trips on Delta in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. These
round-trips accounted for approximately 9%, 9% and 8% of the total passenger
miles flown for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. We believe that the
relatively low percentage of passenger miles flown by SkyMiles members
traveling on program awards and the restrictions applied to travel awards
minimize the displacement of revenue passengers.

Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program

We participate in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (“CRAF”) program, which
permits the U.S. military to use the aircraft and crew resources of
participating U.S. airlines during airlift emergencies, national emergencies or
times of war. We have agreed to make available under the CRAF program, during
the period October 1, 2003 through September 30, 2004, up to 100% of our
international range aircraft. As of March 1, 2004, the following numbers of

Risk Factors Relating to the Airline Industry and Delta

The airline industry has changed fundamentally since the terrorist attacks on
September 11, 2001, and our business, financial condition and operating
results have been materially adversely affected.

Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the airline industry
has experienced fundamental and lasting changes, including substantial revenue
declines and cost increases, which have resulted in industry-wide liquidity
issues. The terrorist attacks significantly reduced the demand for air travel,
and additional terrorist activity involving the airline industry could have an
equal or greater impact. Additionally, during 2003, the industry’s financial
results were negatively impacted by the military action in Iraq and the Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (“SARS”) outbreak. Although global economic
conditions have improved from their depressed levels after September 11, 2001,
the airline industry has continued to experience a reduction in high-yield
business travel and increased price sensitivity in customers’ purchasing
behavior. The airline industry has continued to add or restore capacity despite
these conditions. We expect all of these events will continue to have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating
results.

Bankruptcies and other restructuring efforts by our competitors have put us
at a competitive disadvantage.

Since September 11,
2001, several air carriers have sought to reorganize
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, including United, the
second-largest
U.S. air carrier, U.S. Airways Group, Inc. (“U.S. Airways”), the
seventh-largest U.S. air carrier, and several smaller competitors. Since filing for
Chapter 11 on August 11, 2002, U.S. Airways has emerged from bankruptcy, but
has recently announced that it is seeking additional cost concessions from its
unions. Additionally, American has recently restructured certain labor costs
and lowered its operating cost base. These reorganizations or restructurings
have enabled these competitors to significantly lower their operating costs.
Our unit costs have gone from being among the lowest of the hub and spoke
carriers to among the highest for the full year 2003.



The airline industry is highly competitive, and if we cannot successfully
compete in the marketplace, our business, financial condition and operating
results may be materially adversely affected.

We face significant competition with respect to routes, services and
fares. Our domestic routes are subject to competition from both new and
established carriers, some of which have substantially lower costs than we do
and provide service at lower fares to destinations served by us. Our revenues
continue to be adversely impacted by the growth of the low-cost carriers with
which we compete in most of our markets. Significant expansion by low-cost
carriers to our hub airports could have an adverse impact on our business. We
also face increasing competition in smaller to medium-sized markets from
rapidly expanding regional jet operators. In addition, we compete with foreign
carriers, both on interior U.S. routes, due to marketing and codesharing
arrangements, and in international markets. If we are not able to realign our
cost structure to compete with that of other carriers, or if fare
reductions are not offset by higher yields, our business, financial condition
and operating results may be materially adversely affected.

If we continue to experience significant losses without successfully reducing
our operating expenses, we may be unable to maintain sufficient liquidity to
provide for our operating needs.

We reported a net loss of $773 million for the year ended December 31,
2003, or $6.40 basic and diluted loss per common share, compared to a net loss
of $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002, or $10.44 basic and
diluted loss per common share. We have recorded a substantial net loss for
three consecutive years. Our revenue and cost challenges are expected to
continue for the immediate term, and we expect to report a net loss of
approximately $400 million for the March 2004 quarter. We do not expect
significant improvement in the revenue environment in 2004 and expect
significant cost pressures related to aircraft fuel, pension and interest
expenses to continue.

Although we are pursuing profit improvement initiatives aimed at lowering
our costs and enhancing our revenues, these initiatives may not be sufficient.
Furthermore, our pilot labor costs are substantially higher than our
competitors’ pilot labor costs. Although we are currently in discussions with
ALPA in an attempt to reduce our pilot labor costs, we cannot predict the
outcome of those discussions. To the extent that we deplete our cash reserves
and are unable to access the capital markets for long-term capital spending
requirements or short-term liquidity needs, we will be unable to fund our
obligations and sustain our operations.

Our ability to access the capital markets is partially dependent on our
credit ratings. A further decline in our ratings would increase our borrowing
costs and could hinder our ability to operate our business.

Our business is highly dependent on our ability to access the capital
markets. Our access to, and our costs of borrowing in, these markets depend on
our credit ratings. Since September 11, 2001, our issuer credit ratings have
been lowered to B3 by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”), to B+ by
Standard & Poor’s Rating Services (“S&P”) and to B by Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”).
Our senior unsecured long-term debt is rated Caa2 by Moody’s, B- by S&P and B
by Fitch. S&P and Fitch have each stated that their ratings outlook for our
senior unsecured debt is negative, while Moody’s has stated that its ratings
outlook is stable. Our credit ratings may be lowered further or withdrawn.
While we do not have debt obligations that accelerate as a result of



a credit ratings downgrade, our credit ratings have negatively impacted
our ability to issue unsecured debt, renew outstanding letters of credit that
back certain of our obligations and obtain certain financial instruments that
we use in our fuel hedging program. Our credit ratings have also increased the
cost of our financing transactions and the amount of collateral required for
certain financial instruments, insurance coverage and vendor agreements. To the
extent we are unable to access the capital markets, or our financing costs
continue to increase, including as a result of further credit ratings
downgrades, our business, financial condition and operating results would be
materially adversely impacted.

Our pension plan funding obligations are significant and are affected by
factors beyond our control.

We sponsor qualified defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees
and retirees. Our funding obligations under these plans are governed by the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”). We have met our
required funding obligations in 2003 for these plans, which currently satisfy
minimum funding requirements under ERISA.

Estimates of the amount and timing of our future funding obligations for
the pension plans are based on various assumptions. These include assumptions
concerning, among other things, the actual and projected market performance of
the pension plan assets; 30-year U.S. treasury bond yields; statutory
requirements; and demographic data for pension plan participants. The amount
and timing of our future funding obligations also depend on whether we elect to
make contributions to the pension plans in excess of those required under
ERISA; such voluntary contributions may reduce or defer the funding obligations
we would have absent those contributions.

Our
estimated pension funding of approximately $440 million for 2004
includes (1) a voluntary contribution of $325 million to our non-pilot pension
plan, the majority of which we made in February 2004; and (2) required contributions totaling
approximately $115 million which we will make to our pilot pension plan during
the year. Our anticipated funding obligations under our pension plans for 2005
and thereafter cannot be reasonably estimated at this time because these
estimates vary materially depending on the assumptions used to determine them
and whether we make contributions in excess of those required. Nevertheless, we
presently expect that our funding obligations under our pension plans in each
of the years from 2005 through 2008 will be significant and could have a
material adverse impact on our liquidity.

Our indebtedness and other obligations are substantial and could materially
adversely affect our business and our ability to incur additional debt to
fund future needs.

We have now and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness
and other obligations. As of December 31, 2003, we had approximately $12.6
billion of total consolidated indebtedness, including capital leases. We also
have minimum rental commitments with a present value of approximately $8
billion under noncancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms in
excess of one year. Our substantial indebtedness and other obligations could
negatively impact our operations in the future. For example, it could:



•

limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working
capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate
purposes;

•

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow
from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our
indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available to us for other
purposes;

•

make us more vulnerable to economic downturns, adverse industry
conditions or catastrophic external events, limit our ability to
withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in planning
for, or responding to, changing business and economic conditions; and

•

place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that
have relatively less debt than we have.

We have significant debt obligations maturing in the near term
(approximately $1.0 billion in 2004 and $1.2 billion in 2005, as adjusted for
certain refinancings of regional jet aircraft subsequent to December 31, 2003),
as well as substantial pension funding obligations. We expect to meet our
obligations as they come due through available cash and cash equivalents,
investments, internally generated funds and borrowings. We do not have any
existing undrawn lines of credit. However, we have available to us long-term
secured financing commitments that we may use only to finance a substantial
portion of regional jet aircraft delivered to us through 2004. While we believe
that new financing will be available to us, access to such financing cannot be
assured given the existing business environment and the composition of our
currently available unencumbered assets. Most of our owned aircraft are
encumbered and those that are not are less attractive to lenders because they
are not eligible for mortgage financing under Section 1110 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code, are older aircraft types and/or are aircraft types which are
no longer manufactured. Failure to obtain new financing could have a material
adverse effect on our liquidity.

Interruptions or disruptions in service at one of our hub airports could have
a material adverse impact on our operations.

Our business is heavily dependent on our operations at the Atlanta Airport
and at our other hub airports in Cincinnati, Dallas/Fort Worth and Salt Lake
City. Each of these hub operations includes flights that gather and distribute
traffic from markets in the geographic region surrounding the hub to other
major cities and to other Delta hubs. A significant interruption or disruption
in service at the Atlanta Airport or at one of our other hubs could have a
serious impact on our business, financial condition and operating results.

We are increasingly dependent on technology in our operations, and if our
technology fails or we are unable to continue to invest in new technology,
our business may be adversely affected.

We are increasingly dependent on technology initiatives to reduce costs
and to enhance customer service in order to compete in the current business
environment. For example, we have



made significant investments in check-in
kiosks, Delta Direct phone banks and related initiatives across the system. The
performance and reliability of our technology is critical to our ability to
attract and retain customers and our ability to compete effectively. In this
challenging business environment, we may not be able to continue to make
sufficient capital investments in our technology infrastructure to deliver
these expected benefits.

In addition, any internal technology error or failure, or large scale
external interruption in technology infrastructure we depend on, such as power,
telecommunications or internet, may disrupt our technology network. Any
individual, sustained or repeated failure of our technology could impact our
customer service and result in increased costs. Like all companies, our
technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of sources of interruption
due to events beyond our control, including natural disasters, terrorist
attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers and other
security issues. While we have in place, and continue to invest in, technology
security initiatives and disaster recovery plans, these measures may not be
adequate or implemented properly.

The airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation, and new
regulations may increase our operating costs.

Airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance
requirements that result in significant costs. For instance, the FAA from time
to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and
operation of aircraft that necessitate significant expenditures. We expect to
continue incurring expenses to comply with the FAA’s regulations.

Other laws, regulations, taxes and airport rates and charges have also
been imposed from time to time that significantly increase the cost of airline
operations or reduce revenues. For example, the Aviation and Transportation
Security Act, which became law in November 2001, mandates the federalization of
certain airport security procedures and imposes additional security
requirements on airports and airlines, most of which are funded by a per-ticket
tax on passengers and a tax on airlines. Due to the weak demand and revenue
environment, this action has negatively impacted our revenues because we have
not been able to increase our fares to pass these fees on to our customers.

Furthermore, we and other U.S. carriers are subject to domestic and
foreign laws regarding privacy of passenger and employee data that are not
consistent in all countries in which we operate. In addition to the heightened
level of concern regarding privacy of passenger data in the United States,
certain European government agencies are initiating inquiries into airline
privacy practices. Compliance with these regulatory regimes is expected to
result in additional operating costs and could impact our operations and any
future expansion.

Our insurance costs have increased substantially as a result of the September
11 terrorist attacks, and further increases in insurance costs or reductions
in coverage could have a material adverse impact on our business and
operating results.

As a result of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, aviation
insurers significantly reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage
available to commercial air carriers for



liability to persons (other than
employees or passengers) for claims resulting from acts of terrorism, war or
similar events. At the same time, aviation insurers significantly increased the
premiums for such coverage and for aviation insurance in general. The U.S.
government is providing U.S. airlines with war-risk insurance to cover losses
to passengers, third parties (ground damage) and the aircraft hull. This
coverage extends through August 2004 (with a possible extension to December 31,
2004 at the discretion of the Secretary of Transportation), but the coverage
may not be extended beyond that time. We expect that if the U.S. government
fails to renew the war-risk insurance that it provides, we will be required to
replace such coverage commercially or consider other alternatives. There can be
no assurance that such commercially provided war-risk insurance coverage will
be adequate to protect our risk of loss from future acts of terrorism or will
be provided on terms that will not have a material adverse impact on our
financial condition and operating results.

Our business is dependent on the availability and price of aircraft fuel.
Significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel or periods of high
fuel costs would materially adversely affect our operating results.

Our operating results can be significantly impacted by changes in the
availability or price of aircraft fuel. Fuel prices increased substantially in
2003, when our average fuel price per gallon rose 22% to approximately 81.78¢
as compared to 2002. Our fuel costs represented 14%, 12% and 12% of our
operating expenses in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Due to the competitive
nature of the airline industry, we may not be able to pass on any increases in
fuel prices to our customers by increasing our fares. Furthermore, the impact
of lower aircraft fuel prices could be offset by increased price competition,
and a resulting decrease in revenues, for all air carriers.

Our aircraft fuel purchase contracts do not provide material protection
against price increases or assure the availability of our fuel supplies. We
purchase most of our aircraft fuel from petroleum refiners under contracts that
establish the price based on various market indices. We also purchase aircraft
fuel on the spot market, from off-shore sources and under contracts that permit
the refiners to set the price. To attempt to reduce our exposure to changes in
fuel prices, we periodically enter into heating and crude oil derivatives
contracts, though we may not successfully manage this exposure. Depending on
the type of hedging instrument used, our ability to benefit from declines in
fuel prices may be limited.

Although we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft
fuel, it is impossible to predict the future availability or price of aircraft
fuel. Political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries, changes
in government policy concerning aircraft fuel production, transportation or
marketing, changes in aircraft fuel production capacity, environmental concerns
and other unpredictable events may result in fuel supply shortages and fuel
price increases in the future.



If we experience a significant loss of our senior management and other key
employees, our operating results could be adversely affected, and we may not
be able to attract and retain additional qualified management personnel.

We have
approximately 55 officers, and we are dependent on their
experience and industry knowledge, and that of other key employees, to execute
our business plans. If we were to experience a substantial turnover in our
leadership, our performance could be materially adversely impacted.
Additionally, we may be unable to attract and retain additional qualified
executives as needed in the future.

Employee
strikes and other labor-related disruptions may adversely affect our operations.

Our business is
labor intensive, requiring large numbers of pilots, flight
attendants, mechanics and other personnel. Approximately 18% of our workforce
is unionized. Strikes or labor disputes with our and our affiliates’ unionized
employees may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. Relations
between air carriers and labor unions in the United States are governed by the
Railway Labor Act, which provides that a collective bargaining agreement
between an airline and a labor union does not expire, but instead becomes
amendable as of a stated date. Our collective bargaining agreement with ALPA,
which represents our pilots, becomes amendable on May 1, 2005.
Our wholly-owned
subsidiary, ASA, is in collective bargaining negotiations with ALPA, which
represents ASA’s pilots, and with AFA, which represents ASA’s flight
attendants. The outcome of these collective bargaining negotiations cannot
presently be determined. In addition to the ASA negotiations, if we or our
affiliates are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups
on future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining
agreements, or if additional segments of our workforce become unionized, we may
be subject to work interruptions or stoppages.

We are facing significant litigation, including litigation arising from the
terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, and if any such significant
litigation is concluded in a manner adverse to us, our financial condition
and operating results could be materially adversely affected.

We are involved in legal proceedings relating to antitrust matters,
employment practices, environmental issues and other matters concerning our
business. We are also a defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the
terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. It appears that the plaintiffs in
these September 11 actions are alleging that we and many other air carriers are
jointly liable for damages resulting from the terrorist attacks based on a
theory of shared responsibility for passenger security screening at Logan,
Washington Dulles International Airport (“Dulles”) and Newark Liberty
International Airport (“Newark”). These lawsuits, which are in preliminary
stages, generally seek unspecified damages, including punitive damages.
Although federal law limits the financial liability of any air carrier for
compensatory and punitive damages arising out of the September 11 terrorist
attacks to no more than the limits of liability insurance coverage maintained
by the air carrier, it is possible that we may be required to pay damages in
the event of our insurer’s insolvency or otherwise. While we cannot reasonably
estimate the potential loss for certain of our legal proceedings because, for
example, the litigation is in its early stages or the plaintiff does not
specify damages being sought, if the outcome of any significant litigation is
adverse to us, our financial condition and operating results could be
materially adversely impacted.



The SARS outbreak significantly impacted the airline industry, and future
disease outbreaks could materially adversely impact our business and
operating results.

During the first six months of 2003, the SARS outbreak, primarily centered
in China and other Southeast Asian countries, with a number of cases in
Toronto, Canada, significantly impacted airline industry revenues. Due to our
small Pacific presence, the SARS outbreak has had only a minimal impact on us.
However, if SARS were to spread more widely or if concerns regarding some other
disease were to significantly impact customers’ willingness to travel, our
financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely
impacted.

We are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from any accident
involving our aircraft.

If one of our aircraft were to crash or be involved in an accident, we
could be exposed to significant tort liability. The insurance we carry to cover
damages arising from any future accidents may be inadequate. In the event that
our insurance is not adequate, we may be forced to bear substantial losses from
an accident. In addition, any accident involving an aircraft that we operate or
an airline that is one of our codeshare partners could create a public
perception that our aircraft are not safe or reliable, which could harm our
reputation, result in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft and
harm our business.

Seasonality and other factors impact demand for air travel, and our prior
performance is not necessarily indicative of our future results.

In general, demand for air travel is typically higher in the June and
September quarters, particularly in international markets, because there is
more vacation travel during these periods than during the remainder of the
year. Demand for air travel is also affected by factors such as economic
conditions, war or the threat of war, fare levels and weather conditions. In
addition, demand for air travel at particular airlines may be impacted from
time to time by, among other things, actual or threatened disruptions to
operations due to labor issues. Due to these and other factors, operating
results for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating
results for an entire year, and operating results for a historical period are
not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period.

In October 2003, we entered into a definitive agreement with a third party
to sell 11 B-737-800 aircraft immediately
after those aircraft are delivered to us by the manufacturer in 2005. These 11
B-737-800 aircraft are included in the above table because we continue to have
a contractual obligation to purchase these aircraft from the manufacturer. For
additional information about our sale agreement, see Note 9 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

On October 16, 2003, Boeing announced that it will discontinue production
of 757 model aircraft at the end of 2004. We are discussing with Boeing the
implications of this announcement on our options and rolling options for 757
aircraft after 2004.

(3)

While our agreement
with the manufacturer enables us to exercise the options indicated in this table, our
collective bargaining agreement with ALPA limits the number of jet aircraft certificated for operation with
between 51 and 70 seats that may be operated by other U.S. Carriers (including ASA and Comair)
using the Delta flight code. This limit is currently 58 aircraft but potentially could increase in
the future depending on certain factors related to the extent
of flying performed by Delta pilots. Based on our current fleet
and block hour plans, we will reach the current limit by the end of 2004 and we are unable to predict when or if
that limit will increase.

Our long-term agreement with The Boeing Company (“Boeing”) covers firm
orders, options and rolling options for certain aircraft through calendar year
2017. This agreement supports our plan for disciplined growth, aircraft
rationalization and fleet replacement. It also gives us certain flexibility to
adjust scheduled aircraft deliveries and to substitute between aircraft models
and aircraft types. The majority of the aircraft under firm order from Boeing
will be used to replace older aircraft.

In October 2003, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell 11
B-737-800 aircraft to a third party immediately after those aircraft are
delivered to us by the manufacturer in 2005. As of December 31, 2003, we had
deferred delivery of one B-737-800 aircraft, and plan to exercise our right to
defer delivery of an additional seven B-737-800 aircraft scheduled for delivery
in 2005, until 2008. In February 2004, we announced our intention to seek to
sell two B-777-200 aircraft scheduled for delivery in 2005. In conjunction
with this announcement, we also disclosed our intention to either acquire other
Boeing aircraft in place of the three B-777-200 aircraft scheduled for delivery
in 2006 or to attempt to sell these three aircraft. We have no scheduled
mainline aircraft deliveries in 2004.

Our long-term plan is to reduce our mainline aircraft fleet to three
family types. We believe fleet standardization will improve reliability and
produce long-term cost savings. Consistent with this plan, we retired our last
B-727 aircraft in April 2003. Due to weak traffic, we temporarily grounded the
entire MD-11 fleet by the end of January 2004. As a result of these actions,
beginning in 2004, we will operate a mainline fleet composed entirely of
two-pilot, two-engine aircraft.

Our fleet at December 31, 2003 includes the following 23 aircraft which
have been temporarily grounded: 13 MD-11, five B-767-200, four B-737-200 and
one B-767-300ER (included in our fleet table). Other fleet activity included
the conversion of 36 B-757-200 aircraft from mainline to Song configuration,
and the sublease of two MD-11 aircraft to World Airways (these two aircraft are
excluded from our fleet table).



Our regional jet operations offer service to small and medium-sized cities
and enable us to supplement mainline frequencies and service to larger cities.
In 2000, our wholly-owned subsidiaries, ASA and Comair, entered into agreements
with Bombardier, Inc. to purchase a total of 94 Canadair Regional Jet (“CRJ”)
aircraft, including 69 CRJ-200 aircraft with a mix of 40 and 50 seats, and 25
CRJ-700 aircraft with 70 seats. ASA and Comair also received options to
purchase 406 CRJ aircraft through 2010. At December 31 2003, all 69 CRJ-200
aircraft have been delivered. During 2004, all remaining firm CRJ-700 aircraft
are scheduled for delivery.

On February 27,
2004, we entered into an agreement to purchase 32 CRJ-200 aircraft
to be delivered in 2005. In conjunction with this agreement, we entered into a
facility with a third party to finance, on a secured basis at the time of
acquisition, the future deliveries of these regional jet aircraft. Borrowings
under this facility (1) will be due in installments for 15 years after the date
of borrowing and (2) bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin.

ASA retired its last EMB-120 turbo prop aircraft in August 2003. ASA
continues to operate ATR-72 turbo prop aircraft, while Comair operates an
all-jet fleet.

Ground Facilities

We lease most of the land and buildings that we occupy. Our largest
aircraft maintenance base; various computer, cargo, flight kitchen and training
facilities; and most of our principal offices are located at or near the
Atlanta Airport, on land leased from the City of Atlanta generally under
long-term leases. We own a portion of our principal offices, our Atlanta
reservations center and other real property in Atlanta, as well as a limited
number of radio transmitting and receiving sites and certain other facilities.

We lease ticket counter and other terminal space, operating areas and air
cargo facilities in most of the airports that we serve. These leases generally
run for periods of less than one year to thirty years or more, and often
contain provisions for periodic adjustments of lease rates. At most airports
that we serve, we have entered into use agreements which provide for the
non-exclusive use of runways, taxiways, and other facilities; landing fees
under these agreements normally are based on the number of landings and weight
of aircraft. We also lease aircraft maintenance facilities at certain
airports; these leases generally require us to pay the cost of providing,
operating and maintaining such facilities. In addition to our Atlanta
maintenance base, our other major aircraft maintenance facilities are located
at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, Dallas/Fort Worth
International Airport and Salt Lake City International Airport. We lease
marketing, ticket and reservations offices in certain major cities that we
serve; these leases are generally for shorter terms than the airport leases.
Additional information relating to our ground facilities is set forth in Note 7
of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In recent years, some airports have increased or sought to increase the
rates charged to airlines to levels that we believe are unreasonable. The
extent to which such charges are limited by statute or regulation and the
ability of airlines to contest such charges has been subject to litigation and
to administrative proceedings before the DOT. If the limitations on such
charges



are relaxed, or the ability of airlines to challenge such charges is
restricted, the rates charged by airports to airlines may increase
substantially.

The City of Atlanta,
with the support of us and other airlines, has begun
a ten year capital improvement program (the “CIP”) at the Atlanta Airport.
Implementation of the CIP should increase the number of flights that may
operate at the airport and reduce flight delays. The CIP includes, among other
things, a new approximately 9,000 foot full-service runway (targeted for
completion in May 2006), related airfield improvements, additional terminal and
gate capacity, new cargo and other support facilities and roadway and other
infrastructure improvements. If fully implemented, the CIP is currently
estimated by the City of Atlanta to cost approximately $6.8 billion, which
exceeds the $5.4 billion CIP approved by the airlines in 1999. The CIP runs
through 2010, with individual projects scheduled to be constructed at different
times. A combination of federal grants, passenger facility charge revenues,
increased user rentals and fees, and other airport funds are expected to be
used to pay CIP costs directly and through the payment of debt service on
bonds. Certain elements of the CIP have been delayed, and there is no
assurance that the CIP will be fully implemented. Failure to implement certain
portions of the CIP in a timely manner could adversely impact our operations at
the Atlanta Airport.

During 2001, we
entered into lease and financing agreements with the
Massachusetts Port Authority (“Massport”) for the redevelopment and expansion
of Terminal A at Logan. The completion of this project will enable us to
consolidate all of our domestic operations at that airport into one location.
Construction began in the June 2002 quarter and is scheduled to be completed
during 2005. Project costs will be funded with $498 million in proceeds from
Special Facilities Revenue Bonds issued by Massport on August 16, 2001. We
agreed to pay the debt service on the bonds under a long-term lease agreement
with Massport and issued a guarantee to the bond trustee covering the payment
of the debt service on the bonds. Additional information about these bonds is
set forth in Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

In Re Northwest Airlines, et al. Antitrust Litigation. In June 1999, two
purported class action antitrust lawsuits were filed in the U.S. District Court
for the Eastern District of Michigan against us, U.S. Airways, Northwest and
the Airlines Reporting Corporation, an airline-owned company that operates a
centralized clearinghouse for travel agents to report and account for airline
ticket sales.

In the first case, the plaintiffs allege, among other things: (1) that the
defendants and certain other airlines conspired with us in violation of Section
1 of the Sherman Act to restrain competition and assist us in fixing and
maintaining anticompetitive prices for air passenger service to and from our
Atlanta and Cincinnati hubs; and (2) that we violated Section 2 of the Sherman
Act by exercising monopoly power to establish such prices in an anticompetitive
or exclusionary manner. The complaint asserts that, for purposes of
plaintiffs’ damages claims, the purported plaintiff class consists of all
persons who purchased a Delta full-fare ticket between June 11, 1995 and the
present on routes (1) that start or end at our hubs in Atlanta or Cincinnati;



(2)  on which we have over a 50% market share; (3) that are longer than 150
miles; and (4) that have total annual traffic of over 30,000 passengers.

In the second case, the plaintiffs assert similar allegations and claims
under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act with respect to U.S. Airways’ pricing
practices at its Pittsburgh and Charlotte hubs (“U.S. Airways Hubs”). The
complaint asserts, among other things, that we, the other defendants and
certain other airlines conspired with U.S. Airways to restrain competition and
assist U.S. Airways in fixing and maintaining prices for air passenger service
to and from the U.S. Airways Hubs.

In both cases, plaintiffs have requested a jury trial, and are seeking in
their complaints injunctive relief; costs and attorneys’ fees; and unspecified
damages, to be trebled under the antitrust laws. In May 2002, the District
Court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for class action certification and denied
the airlines’ motions for summary judgment. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Sixth Circuit refused to hear the airlines’ interlocutory appeal of the
District Court’s order granting class action certification. The trial for this
lawsuit has not yet been scheduled.

Hall, et al. v. United Airlines, et al. In January 2002, a travel agent
in North Carolina filed a class action lawsuit against numerous airlines,
including us, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North
Carolina on behalf of all travel agents in the United States which sold tickets
from September 1, 1997 to the present on any of the defendant airlines. The
lawsuit alleges that we and the other airline defendants conspired to fix
travel agent commissions in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. The
plaintiff, who has requested a jury trial, is seeking in its complaint
injunctive relief; costs and attorneys’ fees; and unspecified damages, to be
trebled under the antitrust laws.

In September 2002, the District Court granted the plaintiff’s motion for
class action certification, certifying a class consisting of all travel agents
in the United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands which sold
tickets on the defendant airlines between 1997 and 2002.

On October 30, 2003, the District Court granted summary judgment against
the plaintiff class, dismissing all claims asserted against us and most other
defendants. Plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth
Circuit. Similar litigation alleging violations under Canadian competition law
is pending against us and other airlines in Canada.

All Direct Travel, Inc., et al. v. Delta Air Lines, et al. Two travel
agencies have filed a purported class action lawsuit against us in the U.S.
District Court for the Central District of California on behalf of all travel
agencies from which we have demanded payment for breach of the agencies’
contractual and fiduciary duties to us in connection with Delta ticket sale
transactions during the period from September 20, 1997 to the present. The
lawsuit alleges that our conduct (1) violates the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970; and (2) creates liability for unjust
enrichment. The plaintiffs, who have requested a jury trial, are seeking in
their complaint injunctive and declaratory relief; costs and attorneys’ fees;
and unspecified treble damages.



In January 2003, the District Court denied the plaintiffs’ motion for
class action certification and in April 2003 granted our motion for summary
judgment on all claims. Plaintiffs have appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit.

Power Travel International, Inc., et al. v. American Airlines, et al. In
August 2002, a travel agency filed a purported class action lawsuit in New York
state court against us, American, Continental, Northwest, United and JetBlue,
on behalf of an alleged nationwide class of U.S. travel agents. JetBlue has
been dismissed from the case, and the remaining defendants removed the action
to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The lawsuit
alleges that the defendants breached their contracts with and their duties of
good faith and fair dealing to U.S. travel agencies when these airlines
discontinued the payment of published base commissions to U.S. travel agencies
at various times beginning in March 2002. The plaintiffs’ amended complaint
seeks unspecified damages, as well as declaratory and injunctive relief.
Similar litigation involving contract claims alleged under the agency
agreements applicable to Canadian travel agents is pending against us and other
airlines in Canada.

Multidistrict Pilot Retirement Plan Litigation. During the June 2001
quarter, the Delta Pilots Retirement Plan (“Retirement Plan”) and related
non-qualified pilot retirement plans sponsored and funded by us were named as
defendants in five purported class action lawsuits filed in federal district
courts in California, Massachusetts, Ohio, New Mexico and New York. The
complaints (1) seek to assert claims on behalf of a class consisting of certain
groups of retired and active Delta pilots; (2) allege that the calculation of
the retirement benefits of the plaintiffs and the class violated the Retirement
Plan and the Internal Revenue Code; and (3) seek
unspecified damages. In October 2001, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict
Litigation granted our motion to transfer these cases to the U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of Georgia for coordinated pretrial
proceedings. Plaintiffs have filed a motion for class action certification.

Litigation Re September 11 Terrorist Attacks. We are a defendant in
numerous lawsuits arising out of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.
It appears that the plaintiffs in these actions are alleging that we and many
other air carriers are jointly liable for damages resulting from the terrorist
attacks based on a theory of shared responsibility for passenger security
screening at Logan, Dulles and Newark. These lawsuits, which are in
preliminary stages, generally seek unspecified damages, including punitive
damages. Although federal law limits the financial liability of any air
carrier for compensatory and punitive damages arising out of the September 11
terrorist attacks to no more than the limits of liability insurance coverage
maintained by the air carrier, it is possible that we may be required to pay
damages in the event of our insurers’ insolvency or otherwise.

In each of the foregoing cases, we believe the plaintiffs’ claims are
without merit, and we are vigorously defending the lawsuits. An adverse
decision in any of these cases could result in substantial damages against us.
Although the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with
certainty, management believes that the resolution of these actions will not
have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Business Environment

Our net loss was $773 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, the
third consecutive year we recorded a substantial net loss. These financial
results reflect the unprecedented challenges confronting us and other airlines.
Since the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the airline industry has
experienced a severely depressed revenue environment and significant cost
pressures. These factors have resulted in industry-wide liquidity issues,
including the restructuring of certain hub and spoke airlines due to bankruptcy
or near bankruptcy.

The continuing impact of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and
other events have resulted in fundamental, and what we believe will be
long-term, changes in the airline industry. The revenue environment continues
to be severely impacted by the following factors:

•

a sharp decline in high yield business travel;

•

the continuing growth of low-cost carriers with which we compete in most
of our domestic markets;

•

industry capacity exceeding demand, which has resulted in
significant fare discounting to stimulate demand; and

•

increased price sensitivity by our customers, reflecting in
part the availability of airline fare information on the Internet.

Our revenues have also been negatively affected by a passenger security
fee, imposed by the U.S. government after September 11, 2001, which airlines
are required to collect from customers and remit to the government. Due to the
depressed revenue environment, we have not been able to increase our fares to
pass these fees on to our customers. Although suspended for tickets sold
between June 1, 2003 and September 30, 2003, the passenger security fee was
re-imposed on October 1, 2003.



Due to the changes that have occurred in the airline industry, we must
significantly reduce our costs in order to be competitive in the current
environment and over the long-term. Our cost structure is materially higher
than that of the low-cost airlines with which we compete. Moreover, as
mentioned above, other hub and spoke airlines, such as American Airlines,
United Airlines and US Airways, have significantly reduced their costs through
bankruptcy or the threat of bankruptcy. Our unit costs have gone from being
among the lowest of the hub and spoke airlines to among the highest for 2003, a
result which places us at a serious competitive disadvantage.

Revenues. Our operating revenues were $13.3 billion in 2003, which was
unchanged from our operating revenues in 2002 and 4% lower than our operating
revenues in 2001. Our operating revenue performance in 2003 reflects the
depressed revenue environment discussed above. During 2003, our and other
airlines’ revenues were also negatively impacted by the military action in
Iraq.

International traffic, particularly in our Atlantic region, experienced
the greatest impact related to the situation in Iraq, declining 12% for 2003 as
compared to the prior year. Year-over-year increases in our military charter
revenues in 2003 partially offset the negative effect of these events.

In April 2003, we implemented a 12% reduction in mainline capacity due to
the military action in Iraq. Because there has been some improvement in
passenger demand since the end of major military combat in Iraq in May 2003, we
have now restored most of this capacity.

Costs. Our cost pressures for 2003 compared to 2002 included increases in
pension, aircraft fuel and interest expense. Pension and related expense
increased approximately $290 million, primarily due to declining interest
rates, a decrease in the fair value of our pension plan assets and scheduled
pilot salary increases under the pilots’ collective bargaining agreement.
Aircraft fuel expense rose $255 million, mainly due to the rise in fuel prices
to historically high levels in the period leading up to the military action in
Iraq and again during the December 2003 quarter. Our interest expense
increased $86 million, largely due to higher levels of debt outstanding based
on our substantial increase in borrowings as discussed below.

We expect these cost pressures to continue during 2004. We estimate that
the total annual increase for 2004 compared to 2003 related to aircraft fuel,
pension and related, and interest expense will be approximately $180 million,
$130 million
and $75 million, respectively. Our estimated increase in aircraft fuel expense
assumes an average fuel price per gallon in 2004 of approximately 84¢, a 3%
increase over 2003, on our projected aircraft fuel consumption of approximately
2.5 billion gallons.

Salaries and related costs represented 45% and 42% of our total operating
expenses for 2003 and 2002, respectively. We have taken actions, such as
workforce reductions and changes in our non-pilot employee benefits, to reduce
employee-related costs. Our pilot cost structure is, however, significantly
higher than our competitors. It is critical to reduce our costs in
order to be competitive with other airlines. We are currently in discussions with ALPA, to
move toward a



competitive pilot cost structure, but we cannot predict the
outcome of these discussions. Our collective bargaining agreement with ALPA
becomes amendable on May 1, 2005.

The U.S. government is providing U.S. airlines with war-risk insurance.
This coverage extends through August 2004, with a possible extension to
December 31, 2004, at the discretion of the Secretary of Transportation. If
the U.S. government fails to renew this insurance, there can be no assurance
that commercially provided war-risk insurance coverage will be adequate to
protect our risk of loss from future acts of terrorism or will be provided on
terms that will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Initiatives. We implemented a profit improvement initiative program aimed
at lowering our costs and increasing our revenues to compete in the current
business environment and over the long term. Our actions under this program
have included, among other things, (1) the transformation of the passenger
check-in process to utilize more self-service options such as automated
ticketing kiosks, DeltaDirect phones and check-in via delta.com; (2) selling
food on flights and changing catering processes; (3) new crew scheduling
technology for pilots and flight attendants; (4) the restructuring of
operations at our Salt Lake City and Dallas/Fort Worth hubs; and (5) our
marketing alliance with Continental Airlines and Northwest Airlines. While we
believe we have made progress under this program, we must continue to reduce
our costs to compete in the existing business environment.

At the
end of 2003, we began a reassessment of our operating and
business strategy. The purposes of this review include assessing our
competitive effectiveness, determining the best use of our available resources
and identifying strategic initiatives that we might pursue to improve our
performance. We expect to complete this review by July 2004.

Liquidity. Due to the depressed revenue environment and significant cost
pressures, we borrowed $2.2 billion of debt in 2003. The net proceeds of these
transactions were primarily used to finance aircraft, repay certain debt
obligations and increase our liquidity. All of these borrowings were secured
by aircraft or other assets, except for our issuance of $350 million principal
amount of 8.00% Convertible Senior Notes. In 2002 and 2001, we borrowed $2.6
billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, of debt, all of which was secured by
aircraft.

At December 31, 2003, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $2.7
billion. On February 6, 2004, we issued $325 million principal amount of
2-7/8% Convertible Senior Notes. We do not have any undrawn lines of credit.
However, we have available to us long-term secured financing commitments that
we may use only to finance a substantial portion of regional jet aircraft
delivered to us through 2004 (“RJ Commitments”). Most of our owned aircraft
are encumbered and those that are not are less attractive to lenders because
they are not eligible for mortgage financing under Section 1110 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code, are older aircraft types and/or are aircraft types which are
no longer manufactured. Substantially all of our spare mainline aircraft
engines, and a substantial portion of our mainline aircraft spare parts, are
also encumbered.

Absent factors outside our control, we believe that our annual 2004 cash
flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our daily operations,
including (1) approximately



$1.3 billion of operating lease payments; (2)
approximately $750 million in interest payments, which may vary as interest
rates change on our $4.2 billion principal amount of variable rate debt; and
(3) estimated pension funding of approximately $440 million. We also believe
that our annual 2004 cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our
non-fleet capital expenditures for 2004, but will not be sufficient
to pay our aircraft capital expenditures and debt maturities for that
year.

Our estimated pension funding of approximately $440 million for 2004
includes (1) a voluntary contribution of $325 million to our non-pilot pension
plan, the majority of which we made in February 2004, and (2) required contributions totaling
approximately $115 million which we will make to our pilot pension plan during
the year. The voluntary contribution to the non-pilot pension plan will reduce
our near term funding obligation for that plan and increase the benefit
security for plan participants. As a result of the 2004 contributions to our
pension plans, the non-pilot and pilot pension plans will each have a funded
ratio, for current liability purposes under ERISA, of at least 80% as of July
1, 2003, our most recent ERISA funding measurement date.

During 2004, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $1.2
billion, covering $600 million for aircraft expenditures, which includes
approximately $500 million for the acquisition of regional jet aircraft; $300
million for aircraft parts and modifications; and $300 million for non-fleet
capital expenditures. We may use the RJ Commitments to fund a substantial
portion of our obligations for the acquisition of regional jet aircraft. As
discussed above, we believe our non-fleet capital expenditures will be funded
through cash flows from operations. We currently expect to fund the remaining
capital expenditures in 2004 through cash and cash equivalents.

We have approximately $1.0 billion of debt maturities due during 2004,
including $430 million in the March 2004 quarter, $160 million in the June 2004
quarter, $290 million in the September 2004 quarter and $120 million in the
December 2004 quarter. These maturities include approximately $300 million due
under short-term financing arrangements associated with our acquisition of
regional jet aircraft, which will be largely refinanced through the RJ
Commitments. We currently expect to pay the remaining debt maturities in 2004
through cash and cash equivalents.

We have significant obligations due in 2005 and thereafter. For
additional information, see the Contractual Obligations section of Management’s
Discussion and Analysis in this Form 10-K.

We expect to meet our obligations as they come due through available cash
and cash equivalents, investments, internally generated funds and borrowings.
While new financing may be available to us, access to such
financing cannot be assured given the existing business environment and the
composition of our currently available unencumbered assets. Failure to obtain
new financing could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.

Outlook. Based on the continuing weak revenue environment and cost
pressures, including higher fuel costs, we estimate we will record a net loss of approximately
$400 million
in the March 2004 quarter.



Results of Operations—2003 Compared to 2002

Net Loss per Share. We recorded a consolidated net loss of $773 million
($6.40 diluted loss per share) in 2003, compared to a consolidated net loss of
$1.3 billion ($10.44 diluted loss per share) in 2002.

Operating Revenues. Operating and passenger revenues remained unchanged
at $13.3 billion and $12.3 billion, respectively, in 2003 compared to 2002.
Revenue Passenger Miles (“RPM“s) decreased 3% on a capacity decline of 5%,
while passenger mile yield increased 3% to 12.49¢. For information about the
factors negatively impacting the revenue environment, see the Business
Environment section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis in this Form 10-K.

North American Passenger Revenues

. North American passenger revenues
remained unchanged at $10.0 billion in 2003. RPMs decreased 1% on a capacity
decrease of 3%, while passenger mile yield increased 1%. Load factors increased
by 1.6 points.

International Passenger Revenues

. International passenger revenues
decreased 5% to $2.2 billion in 2003. RPMs fell 12% on a capacity decline of
14%, while passenger mile yield increased 9%. The decline in international
revenue passenger miles, particularly in the Atlantic region, is due to the
reduction in traffic in the period leading up to and during the military action
in Iraq. The increase in passenger mile yield primarily relates to the
reduction of capacity in certain markets and favorable foreign currency
exchange rates.

Cargo and Other Revenues.

Cargo revenues increased 1% to $464 million in
2003. Cargo ton miles decreased 6% due to reductions in capacity, while cargo
ton mile yield increased 8%. Other revenues decreased 2% to $516 million,
primarily reflecting decreases due to lower revenue from certain mileage
partnership arrangements as well as a decline in codeshare revenue. These
decreases were partially offset by an increase in various miscellaneous
revenues and growth under our contract carrier arrangements.

Operating Expenses. Operating expenses totaled $14.1 billion for 2003,
decreasing 4% from 2002. Operating capacity decreased 5% to 134 billion
Available Seat Miles (“ASM”s) primarily due to capacity reductions implemented
as a result of the military action in Iraq. Because there has been some
improvement in passenger demand since the end of major military combat in Iraq
in May 2003, we have
now restored most of this capacity. Operating Cost per Available Seat Mile
(“CASM”) rose 2% to 10.48¢. Operating expenses and CASM reflect (1)
Appropriations Act reimbursements received during 2003; (2) restructuring,
asset writedowns, pension settlements and related items, net recorded during
2003 and 2002; and (3) Stabilization Act compensation recorded in 2002. These
items are discussed below.

Salaries and related costs totaled $6.3 billion in 2003, a 3% increase
from 2002. This 3% increase primarily reflects (1) a 5% increase from higher
pension and related expense of approximately $290 million; (2) a 2% increase
due to salary rate increases primarily for pilots in the June 2003
and 2002 quarters under their collective bargaining agreement, and for
mechanics in the June 2002 quarter; and (3) a 2% increase due to growth in our
wholly-owned subsidiaries’ regional jet operations. These increases were
partially offset by a 6% decrease due



to our 2002 workforce reduction programs.
The increase in pension expense mainly reflects the impact of declining
interest rates, a decrease in the fair value of pension plan assets and
scheduled pilot salary increases, partially offset by approximately $120
million in expense reductions from the transition of our non-pilot defined
benefit pension plan to a cash balance plan. For additional information
related to this transition, see Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Aircraft fuel expense totaled $1.9 billion during 2003, a 15% increase
from 2002. This increase is primarily due to higher fuel prices, partially
offset by capacity reductions. The average fuel price per gallon rose 22% to
81.78¢, while total gallons consumed decreased 6%. Our fuel cost is shown net
of fuel hedge gains of $152 million for 2003 and $136 million for 2002.
Approximately 65% and 56% of our aircraft fuel requirements were hedged during
2003 and 2002, respectively. For additional information about our fuel hedge
contracts, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Depreciation and amortization expense rose 5% in 2003, primarily due to
the acquisition of regional jet aircraft and an increase in software
amortization associated with completed technology projects.

Contracted services expense declined 12% primarily due to reduced traffic
and capacity, the suspension of the air carrier security fees under the
Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act (“Appropriations Act”)
between June 1, 2003 and September 30, 2003, and a decrease in contracted
services across certain workgroups. For additional information about the
Appropriations Act, see Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Landing fees and other rents rose 3%, primarily due to higher landing
fees, adopted by airports seeking to recover lost revenue due to decreased
traffic, and increased facility rates. Aircraft maintenance materials and
outside repairs expense fell 11%, primarily from reduced maintenance volume and
materials consumption as a result of process improvement initiatives, lower
capacity and our fleet simplification program. Aircraft rent expense increased
3% mainly due to our decision in the December 2002 quarter to return our
B-737-300 leased aircraft to service during 2003. For additional information
related to this decision, see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Other selling expenses fell 11%. This increase primarily reflects a 9%
decrease related to lower booking fees resulting from decreased traffic and a
3% decline from higher sales of mileage credits under our SkyMiles program
because a portion of this revenue is recorded as an offset to other selling
expenses. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in advertising
expenses due to the launch of Song, our new low-fare service. Passenger
commission expense declined 34%, primarily reflecting a 22% decrease from the
change in our commission rate structure in 2002, which resulted in the
elimination of travel agent base commissions for tickets sold in the U.S. and
Canada. The decrease in passenger commissions also reflects the cancellation
or renegotiation of certain travel agent contracts and a lower volume of base
and incentive commissions. Passenger service expense decreased 13%, primarily
reflecting a 10% decline from decreased traffic and capacity and a 7% decrease
due to certain meal service-related cost savings initiatives.



Restructuring, asset writedowns, pension settlements and related items,
net totaled $268 million in 2003 compared to $439 million in 2002. Our 2003
charge consists of (1) $212 million related to settlements under the pilots’
defined benefit pension plans; (2) $43 million related to a net curtailment loss
for the cost of pension and postretirement obligations for participants under
our 2002 workforce reduction programs; and (3) $41 million associated with the
planned sale of 11 B-737-800 aircraft. This charge was partially offset by a
$28 million reduction to operating expenses from revised estimates of remaining
costs associated with our restructuring activities. Our 2002 charge consists
of (1) $251 million in asset writedowns; (2) $127 million related to our 2002
workforce reduction programs; (3) $93 million for the temporary carrying cost
of surplus pilots and grounded aircraft; (4) $30 million due to the deferred
delivery of certain Boeing aircraft; (5) $14 million for the closure of certain
leased facilities; and (6) $3 million related to other items. This charge was
partially offset by (1) the reversal of a $56 million reserve for future lease
payments related to nine B-737-300 leased aircraft as a result of a decision in
2002 to return these aircraft to service and (2) a $23 million adjustment of
certain prior year restructuring reserves based on revised estimates of
remaining costs. For additional information on these restructuring, asset
writedowns, pension settlements and related items, net, see Note 15 of the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Appropriations Act reimbursements totaled $398 million in 2003,
representing reimbursements from the U.S. government to air carriers for
certain passenger and air carrier security fees paid to the Transportation
Security Administration (“TSA”). We recorded these amounts as a reduction to
operating expenses in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. For additional
information about the Appropriations Act, see Note 19 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Stabilization Act compensation totaled $34 million in 2002, representing
amounts we recognized as compensation in the applicable period under the Air
Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act (“Stabilization Act”). We
recorded these amounts as a reduction to operating expenses in our Consolidated
Statement of Operations. For additional information about the Stabilization
Act, see Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other operating expenses fell 14%, primarily reflecting a 9% decrease due
to lower insurance rates under U.S. government-provided insurance policies and
lower volume-related insurance premiums
due to decreased capacity and traffic, as well as a 3% decline due to lower
communication and supplies expenses.

Operating Loss and Operating Margin. We incurred an operating loss of
$786 million in 2003, compared to an operating loss of $1.3 billion in 2002.
Operating margin was (6%) and (10%) for 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Other Income (Expense). Other expense, net totaled $403 million during
2003, compared to other expense, net of $693 million in 2002. Included in these
results are the following:

•

An $86 million increase in interest expense in 2003 compared to 2002
primarily due to higher levels of outstanding debt in 2003.



•

A $321 million gain in 2003 from the sale of certain investments. This
primarily relates to a $279 million gain from the sale of our equity
investment in Worldspan and a $28 million gain from the sale of a
portion of our Orbitz shares. For additional information about these
investments, see Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

•

Gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt, net was zero for 2003 compared
to a $42 million loss in 2002. During 2003, we recorded a $15 million
loss resulting from our repurchase of a portion of outstanding
Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”) Notes, offset by a $15 million
gain related to our debt exchange offer. For additional information
about our repurchase of ESOP Notes in 2003 and 2002 and our debt
exchange offer in 2003, see Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

•

A $9 million charge in 2003 compared to a $39 million charge in 2002
for fair value adjustments of financial instruments accounted for
under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS
133”). This relates to derivative instruments we use in our fuel
hedging program and to our equity warrants and other similar rights in
certain companies.

•

Miscellaneous expense, net was $19 million in 2003 compared to
miscellaneous income, net of $1 million in 2002 due primarily to a
decrease in earnings from our equity investment in Worldspan, which we
sold in June 2003.

Results of Operations—2002 Compared to 2001

Net Loss and Loss per Share. We recorded a consolidated net loss of $1.3
billion ($10.44 diluted loss per share) in 2002, compared to a consolidated net
loss of $1.2 billion ($9.99 diluted loss per share) in 2001.

Operating Revenues. Operating revenues were $13.3 billion in 2002,
decreasing 4% from 2001. Passenger revenues fell 5% to $12.3 billion. RPMs were
unchanged on a capacity decline of 4%, while passenger mile yield decreased 5%
to 12.08¢. The decreases in operating revenues, passenger revenues and
passenger mile yield from the depressed 2001 levels reflect the continuing
effects of the September 11 terrorist attacks on our business, the challenging
revenue environment discussed above and the weakness of the U.S. and world
economies.

North
American Passenger Revenues.

North American passenger revenues fell
6% to $10.0 billion in 2002. RPMs increased 1% on a capacity decrease of 3%,
while passenger mile yield decreased 7%. The decline in passenger mile yield
reflects the challenging revenue environment, including significant fare
discounting as well as a substantial reduction in high-yield business traffic
reflecting the continuing effects of the September 11 terrorist attacks on our
business.

International Passenger Revenues

. International passenger revenues
decreased 2% to $2.3 billion in 2002. RPMs fell 2% on a capacity decline of 7%,
while passenger mile yield increased 1%. The decline in our international
capacity was primarily driven by reductions in our Pacific operations due to
weak passenger demand.

Cargo and Other Revenues

. Cargo revenues decreased 9% to $458 million in
2002. This reflects a 7% decline due to Federal Aviation Administration
security measures,



adopted after the September 11 terrorist attacks, that
prohibit passenger airlines from transporting mail weighing more than 16
ounces; such mail had represented approximately 50% of our mail business. The
decline in cargo revenues also reflects a 2% decrease due to lower domestic
freight volumes and yields. Cargo ton miles decreased 6% and cargo ton mile
yield decreased 4%. Other revenues increased 29% to $526 million, primarily
reflecting a 12% increase due to higher administrative service fees and a 12%
increase due to higher codeshare revenues.

Operating Expenses. Operating expenses totaled $14.6 billion for 2002,
decreasing 6% from 2001. Operating capacity decreased 4% to 142 billion ASMs.
CASM fell 2% to 10.31¢. Operating expenses and CASM reflect in 2002 and 2001
(1) restructuring, asset writedowns, pension settlements and related items, net
and (2) Stabilization Act compensation. These items are discussed below.

Salaries and related costs totaled $6.2 billion in 2002, a 1% increase
from 2001. This reflects a 6% increase from higher pension expense and a 5%
increase due to salary and benefit rate increases for pilots and mechanics in
the June 2002 quarter. These increases were largely offset by decreases due to
workforce reductions implemented after we reduced capacity following September
11, 2001.

Aircraft fuel expense totaled $1.7 billion during 2002, a 7% decrease from
2001. Total gallons consumed decreased 5% mainly due to capacity reductions.
The average fuel price per gallon fell 2% to 66.94¢. Our fuel cost is shown net
of fuel hedge gains of $136 million for 2002 and $299 million for 2001.
Approximately 56% and 58% of our aircraft fuel requirements were hedged during
2002 and 2001, respectively. For additional information about our fuel hedge
contracts, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Depreciation and amortization expense fell 11% in 2002, reflecting a 6%
decrease due to a change in our asset base and a 5% decrease due to our
adoption on January 1, 2002, of SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets” (“SFAS 142”). SFAS 142 requires that goodwill and certain other
intangible assets no longer be amortized (see Note 5 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements).

Contracted services expense declined 1% primarily due to a 4% decrease
from fewer contract workers, partially offset by a 3% increase due to higher
security costs. Landing fees and other rents rose 7%, of which 3% was related
to an increase in landing fee rates and 2% was due to lower costs in 2001
resulting from reduced operations by Comair. Due to a strike by its pilots,
Comair suspended operations between March 26, 2001 and July 1, 2001, and
gradually returned to service after the strike.

Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs expense fell 11%,
primarily reflecting a reduction in maintenance volume and materials
consumption due to the timing of maintenance events. Aircraft rent expense
decreased 4%, primarily due to a reduction in the number of leased aircraft
during 2002 from our fleet simplification efforts. Other selling expenses fell
13%, of which 6% was due to lower costs associated with our mileage partnership
programs and 4% was due to reduced advertising and promotion spending.



Passenger commission expense declined 40%, primarily due to a change in
our commission rate structure. On March 14, 2002, we eliminated travel agent
base commissions for tickets sold in the U.S. and Canada. Passenger service
expense decreased 20%, primarily due to meal service reductions.

Restructuring, asset writedowns, pension settlements and related items,
net totaled $439 million in 2002 compared to $1.1 billion in 2001. Our 2002
charge is discussed above. Our 2001 charge consists of (1) $566 million
related to our 2001 workforce reduction programs; (2) $363 million from a
decrease in value of certain aircraft and other fleet related charges; (3) $160
million related primarily to discontinued contracts, facilities and information
technology projects; and (4) $30 million for the temporary carrying cost of
surplus pilots and grounded aircraft. For additional information on
restructuring, asset writedowns, pension settlements and related items, net,
see Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Stabilization Act compensation totaled $34 million in 2002 compared to
$634 million in 2001, representing amounts we recognized as compensation in the
applicable period under the Stabilization Act. For additional information
about the Stabilization Act, see Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Other operating expenses decreased 11%, primarily due to declines in
miscellaneous expenses such as supplies, utilities, interrupted operations
expenses and professional fees, which were partially offset by a 19% increase
in expenses due to a rise in war-risk insurance rates.

Operating Loss and Operating Margin. We incurred an operating loss of
$1.3 billion in 2002, compared to an operating loss of $1.6 billion in 2001.
Operating margin was (10%) and (12%) for 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Other Income (Expense). Other expense totaled $693 million during 2002,
compared to other expense of $262 million in 2001. Included in these results
are the following:



•

Miscellaneous income, net was $1 million in 2002 compared to a $47
million miscellaneous expense, net in 2001 due primarily to increased
earnings from our equity investment in Worldspan in 2002.

Financial Condition and Liquidity

Sources and Uses of Cash—2003. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $2.7
billion at December 31, 2003, compared to $2.0 billion at December 31, 2002.
For 2003, net cash provided by operating activities totaled $453 million, which
includes the following items:

•

Net tax refunds totaling $402 million.

•

Our net loss of $773 million.

•

Our $76 million payment to fund a defined benefit pension plan.

•

A $102 million increase in total restricted cash, primarily to support
certain projected insurance obligations. For additional information
about our restricted cash, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

During 2003, capital expenditures were $1.5 billion, which included the
acquisition of 31 CRJ-200 and 20 CRJ-700 aircraft. Of these regional jet
aircraft, 43 were acquired through seller financing arrangements for $718
million.

On June 30, 2003, we sold our 40% equity investment in Worldspan. In
consideration for this sale, we received (1) $285 million in cash and (2) a $45
million subordinated promissory note, which bears interest at 10% per annum and
matures in 2012. We will also receive credits totaling approximately $125
million, which will be recognized ratably as a reduction of costs through 2012,
for future Worldspan-provided services. At December 31, 2003, the carrying and
fair value of the subordinated promissory note was $38 million. For additional
information about the sale of our equity investment in Worldspan, see Note 17
of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Debt and capital lease obligations, including current maturities and
short-term obligations, totaled $12.6 billion at December 31, 2003, compared to
$10.9 billion at December 31, 2002. During
2003, we engaged in the following financing transactions (for additional
information about these transactions, see Note 6 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements):

•

We issued $1.9 billion principal amount of debt under secured financing arrangements, due in installments through 2021.

•

We issued $350 million principal amount of 8% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023.

•

General Electric Capital Corporation (“GECC”) issued $404 million of irrevocable, direct-pay letters of credit to support
our obligations related to $397 million principal amount of outstanding municipal bonds. This transaction replaced letters
of credit issued by a third party that were due to expire in June 2003.

•

We completed a debt exchange offer in which $262 million principal amount of previously outstanding unsecured notes due in
2004 and 2005 were exchanged for a total of $47 million



in cash and $211 million principal amount of unsecured new notes,
net of a discount, due in 2008.

In February 2004, we issued $325 million principal amount of 2-7/8%
Convertible Senior Notes due 2024. For additional information on this
transaction, see Note 22 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Future Aircraft Order Commitments. To preserve liquidity, we have taken
the following actions regarding our orders for mainline aircraft:

•

In 2002, we deferred the delivery of 31 mainline aircraft. As a
result of these deferrals, we had no mainline aircraft deliveries in
2003, and we have no such deliveries scheduled for 2004.

•

In October 2003, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell 11
B-737-800 aircraft to a third party immediately after those aircraft
are delivered to us by the manufacturer in 2005. We also granted the
third party an option to purchase up to 10 additional B-737-800
aircraft scheduled for delivery to us in 2006.

•

As of December 31, 2003, we had deferred delivery of one B-737-800
aircraft, and plan to exercise our right to defer delivery of an
additional seven B-737-800 aircraft, until 2008. These aircraft were
originally scheduled for delivery in 2005.

•

In February 2004, we announced our intention to seek to sell two
B-777-200 aircraft scheduled for delivery in 2005. Additionally, we
have agreed with the manufacturer to defer the delivery of these
aircraft from the first half of 2005 until the second half of 2005. We
also disclosed our intention either to acquire other Boeing aircraft
in place of three B-777-200 aircraft scheduled for delivery in 2006 or
to attempt to sell these three aircraft.

On
February 27, 2004, we entered into an agreement to purchase 32 CRJ-200 aircraft
to be delivered in 2005. In conjunction with this agreement, we entered into a
facility with a third party to finance, on a secured basis at the time of
acquisition, the future deliveries of these regional jet aircraft. Borrowings
under this facility (1) will be due in installments for 15 years after the date
of borrowing and (2) bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin.

For additional information about our aircraft order commitments, see Note
9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Shareowners’
(Deficit) Equity. Shareowners’ (deficit) equity was $(659)
million at December 31, 2003 and $893 million at December 31, 2002. The
decrease in our shareowners’ (deficit) equity is primarily due to our $773
million net loss in 2003 and the $786 million, net of tax, non-cash adjustment
to our additional minimum pension liability recorded during 2003. For further
information about our additional minimum pension liability, see Note 11 of the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



ESOP Preferred Stock. Delaware General Corporation Law (“Delaware law”)
provides that a company may pay dividends on its stock only (1) out of its
“surplus,” which is generally defined as the excess of a company’s net assets
over the aggregate par value of its issued stock, or (2) from its net profits
for the fiscal year in which the dividend is paid or from its net profits for
the preceding fiscal year. Delaware law also prohibits a company from
redeeming or purchasing its stock for cash or other property, unless the
company has sufficient “surplus.”

Because we expected to have, and did in fact have, a negative “surplus” at
December 31, 2003, our Board of Directors took the following actions, effective
in December 2003, related to our ESOP Preferred Stock to comply with Delaware
law:

•

Suspended indefinitely the payment of dividends on our ESOP Preferred
Stock. Unpaid dividends on the ESOP Preferred Stock will accrue
without interest, until paid, at a rate of $4.32 per share per year.
The ESOP Preferred Stock is held by Fidelity Management Trust Company
in its capacity as trustee for the Delta Family-Care Savings Plan, a
broad-based employee benefit plan (“Savings Plan”).

•

Changed the form of payment we use to redeem shares of ESOP Preferred
Stock when redemptions are required under the Savings Plan. For the
indefinite future, we will pay the redemption price of the ESOP
Preferred Stock in shares of our common stock rather than in cash.

At December 31, 2003, approximately 5.8 million shares of ESOP Preferred
Stock were held by the Savings Plan. About 3.8 million shares of ESOP
Preferred Stock are currently allocated to the accounts of Savings Plan
participants; the remainder of the shares is available for allocation in the
future.

We are generally required to redeem shares of ESOP Preferred Stock (1) to
provide for distributions of the accounts of Savings Plan participants who
terminate employment with us and request a distribution and (2) to implement annual diversification
elections by Savings Plan participants who are at least age 55 and have
participated in the Savings Plan for at least ten years. In these
circumstances, shares of ESOP Preferred Stock are redeemable at a price equal
to the greater of (1) $72.00 per share or (2) the fair value of the shares of
our common stock issuable upon conversion of the ESOP Preferred Stock to be
redeemed, plus, in either case, accrued but unpaid dividends on such shares of
ESOP Preferred Stock. Under the terms of the ESOP Preferred Stock, we may pay
the redemption price in cash, shares of our common stock (valued at fair
value), or in a combination thereof. Each share of ESOP Convertible
Preferred Stock is convertible into 1.7155 shares of our common stock, subject
to adjustment in certain circumstances.

During 2003, an average of approximately 20,000 shares of ESOP Preferred
Stock was redeemed each month under the Savings Plan, resulting in an average
aggregate monthly redemption price of $1.4 million plus accrued and unpaid
dividends. At this rate, and assuming a Delta common stock price of $12.00 per
share, we estimate that we will issue approximately 3.5 million shares of our
common stock during 2004 and 2005 to redeem ESOP Preferred Stock. The actual
number of shares of our common stock issued may differ materially from this
estimate because the actual number of shares will depend on various factors,
including the duration of the period during which we may not redeem ESOP
Preferred Stock for cash under Delaware Law;



the fair value of Delta common
stock when ESOP Preferred Stock is redeemed; and the number of shares of ESOP
Preferred Stock redeemed by Savings Plan participants who terminate their
employment with us or elect to diversify their Savings Plan accounts.

For additional information about our ESOP Preferred Stock, see Notes 11
and 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Working Capital Position. As of December 31, 2003, we had negative
working capital of $1.7 billion, compared to negative working capital of $2.6
billion at December 31, 2002. This change in our negative working capital
balance is primarily due to the increase in our cash and cash equivalents,
which is discussed above in the Sources and Uses of Cash section of
Management’s Discussion and Analysis in this Form 10-K. A negative working
capital position is normal for us, typically due to our air traffic liability
and the fact that we primarily generate revenue by providing air transportation
through the utilization of property and equipment, which are classified as
long-term assets.

Credit Ratings and Covenants. Since September 11, 2001, our issuer credit
ratings have been lowered to B3 by Moody’s, to B+ by S&P and to B by Fitch. Our
senior unsecured long-term debt is rated Caa2 by Moody’s, B- by S&P and B by
Fitch. S&P and Fitch have each stated that their ratings outlook for our
senior unsecured debt is negative, while Moody’s has stated that its outlook is
stable. Our credit ratings may be lowered further. While we do not have debt
obligations that accelerate as a result of a credit ratings downgrade, our
credit ratings have negatively impacted our ability to issue unsecured debt,
renew outstanding letters of credit that back certain of our obligations and
obtain certain financial instruments that we use in our fuel hedging program.
Our credit ratings have also increased the cost of our financing transactions
and the amount of collateral required for certain financial instruments,
insurance coverage and vendor agreements. To the extent we are unable to access
the capital markets, or our financing costs continue to increase, including as
a result of further credit ratings downgrades, our business, financial position
and results of operations would be materially adversely impacted.

Our credit facilities do not contain any negative financial covenants.
Our Reimbursement Agreement with GECC includes a Collateral Value Test. For
additional information about this test, see Note 6 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

As is customary in the airline industry, our aircraft lease and financing
agreements require that we maintain certain levels of insurance coverage,
including war-risk insurance. We were in compliance with these requirements at
December 31, 2003 and 2002. For additional information about our war-risk
insurance currently provided by the U.S. government under the Stabilization
Act, see Note 19 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

For additional information on our liquidity, see the Business Environment
section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis in this Form 10-K.

Prior Years

2002.

Cash and cash equivalents totaled $2.0 billion at December 31,
2002. Net cash provided by operations totaled $285 million during 2002,
including receipt of (1) a $472



million tax refund due to a new tax law and (2)
a $112 million in compensation under the Stabilization Act. Capital
expenditures, including aircraft acquisitions made under seller financing
arrangements, were $2.0 billion during 2002; this included the acquisition of
four B-737-800, three B-767-400, one B-777-200, 34 CRJ-200 and 15 CRJ-700
aircraft. Debt and capital lease obligations, including current maturities and
short-term obligations, totaled $10.9 billion at December 31, 2002. We issued
$2.6 billion of secured long-term debt during 2002.


. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $2.2 billion at December 31,
2001. Net cash provided by operations totaled $236 million during 2001,
including $556 million of compensation received under the Stabilization Act.
Capital expenditures, including aircraft acquisitions made under seller
financing arrangements, were $2.9 billion during 2001; this included the
acquisition of 27 B-737-800, three B-757-200, two B-767-300ER, six B-767-400,
23 CRJ-200 and four CRJ-100 aircraft. Debt and capital lease obligations,
including current maturities and short-term obligations, totaled $9.4 billion
at December 31, 2001. We issued $2.3 billion of secured long-term debt during
2001.

Financial Position

December 31, 2003 Compared to December 31, 2002. This section discusses
certain changes in our Consolidated Balance Sheets which are not otherwise
discussed in this Form 10-K.

Prepaid
expenses and other current assets increased by 34%, or $120
million, primarily due to an increase in prepaid aircraft fuel as well as an
increase in the fair value of our fuel hedge derivative contracts. Restricted
investments for our Boston airport terminal project decreased 31%, or $131
million, due to the capitalization of project expenditures and interest paid.
Other noncurrent assets increased 42%, or $634 million, due to an increase in
our deferred tax assets which was partially offset by a decrease in the
intangible asset recorded in conjunction with our additional minimum pension
liability.

Accounts payable, deferred credits and other accrued liabilities decreased
8%, or $162 million, primarily due to payments related to our restructuring
reserves and to the Delta Employees Credit Union (see Note 16 and Note 20,
respectively, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Pension
and related benefits increased 51%, or $1.6 billion, primarily due to our
non-cash adjustments
to our additional minimum pension liability recorded during 2003. For
additional information on our employee benefit plans, see Note 11 of the Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Contractual Obligations. The following table provides a summary of our
contractual obligations as of December 31, 2003 related to debt; operating leases; aircraft order
commitments; capital leases; interest and related payments; other material,
noncancelable purchase obligations; and other liabilities. The table excludes
commitments that are contingent based on certain events or other factors that
are uncertain or unknown at this time.

The table above does not include amounts related to our future funding
obligations under our defined benefit pension plans. Estimates of the amount
and timing of these future funding obligations are based on various
assumptions. These include assumptions concerning, among other things, the
actual and projected market performance of the plan assets, 30-year U.S.
Treasury bond yields, statutory requirements and demographic data for pension
plan participants. The amount and timing of our future funding obligations also
depend on whether we elect to make contributions to the pension plans in excess
of those required under ERISA; such voluntary contributions may reduce or defer
the funding obligations we would have absent those contributions.



We estimate that our pension plan funding will be approximately $440
million for 2004. As discussed in the Business Environment section of
Management’s Discussion and Analysis in this Form 10-K, this includes a
voluntary contribution of $325 million to our non-pilot pension plan in
January and February 2004. Our anticipated funding obligations under our pension plans for
2005 and thereafter cannot be reasonably estimated at this time because these
estimates vary materially depending on the assumptions used to determine them
and whether we make contributions in excess of those required. Nevertheless, we
presently expect that our funding obligations under our pension plans in each
of the years from 2005 through 2008 will be significant and could have a
material adverse impact on our liquidity.

In addition to the contractual obligations discussed above, we have
certain contracts for goods and services that require us to pay a penalty,
acquire inventory specific to us or purchase contract specific equipment, as
defined by each respective contract, if we terminate the contract without cause
prior to its expiration date. These obligations are contingent upon whether we
terminate the contract without cause prior to its expiration date; therefore,
no obligation would exist unless such a termination were to occur.

We are party to a collective bargaining agreement with ALPA representing
Delta pilots. The agreement generally provides that no pilot on the seniority
list as of July 1, 2001 may be furloughed unless the furlough is caused by a
circumstance beyond our control, as defined in that agreement. Therefore, if
we reduce the number of flights in our schedule for reasons other than a
circumstance beyond our control, as defined in the agreement, we may be
required to pay unutilized pilots their full salary and benefits. If we
furlough pilots due to a circumstance beyond our control, we are only obligated
to remit furlough pay and to provide or pay for certain other benefits for a
limited period until the pilots are recalled. We have been involved in
arbitration regarding whether the agreement permits furloughs in particular
circumstances, as described in Item 1. “Business—Employee Matters—Pilot
Furloughs” of this Form 10-K. Our agreement with ALPA becomes amendable on May
1, 2005.

We have long-term contract carrier agreements with three regional air
carriers, ACA, SkyWest and Chautanqua. Under these agreements, ACA, SkyWest
and Chautauqua operate certain of their aircraft using our flight code; we
schedule those aircraft and sell the seats on those flights; and we keep the
related revenues. We pay those airlines an amount, as defined in the
applicable agreement, which is based on an annual
redetermination of their cost of operating those flights and other factors
intended to approximate market rates for those services.

We expect to incur expenses of approximately $890 million in 2004 related
to our contract carrier agreements with ACA, SkyWest and Chautauqua. These
expenses are not included in the table above because they are contingent based
on the costs associated with the operation of contract carrier flights by those
air carriers. We cannot reasonably estimate at this time our expenses under
the contract carrier agreements in 2005 and thereafter. For additional
information regarding our contract carrier agreements, including the
possibility that we may be required to assume certain of ACA’s regional jet
leases, see Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



As discussed above, we changed the form of payment we will use to redeem
shares of ESOP Preferred Stock when redemptions are required under the Savings
Plan. For the indefinite future, we will pay the redemption price of the ESOP
Preferred Stock in shares of our common stock rather than in cash. For
additional information about our ESOP Preferred Stock, see Notes 11 and 12 of
the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

For additional information about other contingencies, see Note 9 of the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.

S

ale of Receivables

. We were party to an agreement, as amended, under
which we sold a defined pool of our accounts receivable, on a revolving basis,
through a special-purpose, wholly-owned subsidiary to a third party. In
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (“GAAP”), we did not consolidate this subsidiary in our Consolidated
Financial Statements. This agreement terminated on its scheduled expiration
date of March 31, 2003. As a result, on April 2, 2003, we paid $250 million,
which represented the total amount owed to the third party by the subsidiary,
and subsequently collected the related receivables. For additional information
about this agreement, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Other.

Legal Contingencies.

We are involved in legal proceedings relating to
antitrust matters, employment practices, environmental issues and other matters
concerning our business. We are also a defendant in numerous lawsuits arising
out of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. We cannot reasonably
estimate the potential loss for certain legal proceedings because, for example,
the litigation is in its early stages or the plaintiff does not specify the
damages being sought. Although the ultimate outcome of our legal proceedings
cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the resolution of these
actions will not have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Application of Critical Accounting Policies.

Critical Accounting Estimates.

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and
assumptions. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions, which
are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and
other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the
circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.

Rules proposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission would require
disclosures related to accounting estimates management makes in applying
accounting policies and the initial adoption of an accounting policy that has a
material impact on its financial statements. These Rules define critical
accounting estimates as those accounting estimates which (1) require management
to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the
estimate is made and (2) would have resulted in material changes to our
Consolidated Financial



Statements if different estimates, which we reasonably
could have used, were made. Our critical accounting estimates are briefly
described below.

Goodwill

. SFAS 142 addresses financial accounting and reporting for
goodwill and other intangible assets, including when and how to perform
impairment tests of recorded balances. We have three reporting units that have
assigned goodwill: Delta-Mainline, Atlantic Southeast Airlines, Inc. and
Comair. Quoted stock market prices are not available for these individual
reporting units. Accordingly, consistent with SFAS 142, our methodology for
estimating the fair value of each reporting unit primarily considers discounted
future cash flows. In applying this methodology, we (1) make assumptions about
each reporting unit’s future cash flows based on capacity, yield, traffic,
operating costs and other relevant factors and (2) discount those cash flows
based on each reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital. Changes in
these assumptions may have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial
Statements. For additional information about our accounting policy related to
goodwill and other intangibles, see Notes 1 and 5 in the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Income Tax Valuation Allowance

. In accordance with SFAS No. 109,
“Accounting for Income Taxes” (“SFAS 109”), deferred tax assets should be
reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some
portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The future
realization of our net deferred tax assets depends on the availability of
sufficient future taxable income. In making this determination, we consider
all available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions. We
consider, among other things, the overall business environment; our historical
earnings, including our significant pretax losses incurred during the last
three years; our industry’s historically cyclical periods of earnings and
losses; and our outlook for future years.

We performed this analysis as of December 31, 2003 and determined that
there was sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than
not that our net deferred tax assets will be realized. The positive evidence
included (1) our expectation that we will report pre-tax book and taxable
income in future years; (2) our federal net operating losses (“NOL“s) have
never expired unused; (3) our alternative minimum tax (“AMT”) credit
carryforwards do not expire; (4) substantially all of our cumulative NOL
carryforward at December 31, 2003 will not begin to expire until 2022; and (5)
given the long economic cycles of this industry, our belief that we are not in
a cumulative loss position for purposes of assessing recoverability of our net
deferred tax assets. Additionally, a
significant portion of our deferred tax assets is associated with our
additional minimum pension liability. Over time, this liability is required to
be funded, which will eliminate the related deferred tax asset. We will assess
the need for a deferred tax asset valuation allowance on an ongoing basis
considering factors such as those mentioned above as well as other relevant
criteria. Changes in the assumptions discussed above may have a material
impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information
about income taxes, see Notes 1 and 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Pension Plans

. We sponsor defined benefit pension plans (“Plans”) for
eligible employees and retirees. The impact of the Plans on our Consolidated
Financial Statements as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 and for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 is presented in Note 11 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. We currently



estimate that our defined
benefit pension expense in 2004 will be approximately $525 million. The effect
of our Plans on our Consolidated Financial Statements is subject to many
assumptions. We believe the most critical assumptions are (1) the weighted
average discount rate; (2) the rate of increase in future compensation levels;
and (3) the expected long-term rate of return on Plan assets.

We determine our weighted average discount rate on our measurement date
primarily by reference to annualized rates earned on high quality fixed income
investments and yield-to-maturity analysis specific to our estimated future
benefit payments. Adjusting our discount rate (6.125% at September 30, 2003)
by 0.5% would change our accrued pension cost by approximately $780 million at
December 31, 2003 and change our estimated pension expense in 2004 by
approximately $60 million.

Our rate of increase in future compensation levels is based primarily on
labor contracts currently in effect with our employees under collective
bargaining agreements and expected future pay rate increases for other
employees. Adjusting our estimated rate of increase in future compensation
levels (1.89% at September 30, 2003) by 0.5% would change our estimated pension
expense in 2004 by approximately $20 million.

The expected long-term rate of return on our Plan assets is based
primarily on Plan-specific asset/liability investment studies performed by
outside consultants and recent and historical returns on our Plans’ assets.
Adjusting our expected long-term rate of return (9.00% at September 30, 2003) by
0.5% would change our estimated pension expense in 2004 by approximately $40
million. For additional information about our pension plans, see Note 11 of
the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

. We record impairment losses on
long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate the
assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be
generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts. The amount of
impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amounts of the
assets exceed the estimated fair values.

In order to evaluate potential impairment as required by SFAS No. 144,
“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“SFAS 144”),
we group assets at the fleet type level (the lowest level for which there are
identifiable cash flows) and then estimate future cash flows based on
assumptions involving projections of passenger yield, fuel costs, labor costs
and other relevant factors in the markets in which these aircraft operate.
Aircraft fair values are estimated by management using published sources,
appraisals and bids received from third parties, as available. Changes in these
assumptions may have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial
Statements. For additional information about our accounting policy for the
impairment of long-lived assets, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements.

On December 8, 2003, President
Bush signed into law the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act (“Medicare Act”). The Medicare Act introduced a prescription
drug benefit under Medicare and a



federal subsidy to sponsors of health care
benefit plans in certain circumstances. The impact of the Medicare Act is not
reflected in our 2003 Consolidated Financial Statements due to our September 30
measurement date for our postretirement plans, which was prior to the enactment
of this law.

The FASB issued FASB Staff Position SFAS No. 106-1, “Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement
and Modernization Act of 2003” (“FSP 106-1”) in January 2004. FSP 106-1 permits
a sponsor of a postretirement health care plan that provides a prescription
drug benefit to make a one-time election to defer accounting for the Medicare
Act. It also requires certain disclosures regarding the Medicare Act and is
effective for financial statements issued after December 7, 2003. In compliance
with FSP 106-1, in 2004, we will make a one-time election to reflect the
estimated impact of the Medicare Act immediately or to defer recognition until
specific authoritative guidance on accounting for the federal subsidy portion
of the Medicare Act is issued. In either case, when specific guidance is
issued, we could be required to change previously reported financial
information. We are still evaluating the impact of the Medicare Act on our
2004 Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information about our
employee benefit plans, see Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Market Risks Associated with Financial Instruments. We have significant
market risk exposure related to aircraft fuel prices and interest rates. Market
risk is the potential negative impact of adverse changes in these prices or
rates on our Consolidated Financial Statements. To manage the volatility
relating to these exposures, we periodically enter into derivative transactions
pursuant to stated policies (see Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements). Management expects adjustments to the fair value of
financial instruments accounted for under SFAS 133 to result in ongoing
volatility in earnings and shareowners’ (deficit) equity.

The following sensitivity analyses do not consider the effects of a change
in demand for air travel, the economy as a whole or additional actions by
management to mitigate our exposure to a particular risk. For these and other
reasons, the actual results of changes in these prices or rates may differ
materially from the following hypothetical results.

Aircraft Fuel Price Risk.

Our results of operations may be significantly
impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel. To manage this risk, we
periodically enter into heating and crude oil derivative contracts to hedge a
portion of our projected annual aircraft fuel requirements. Heating and crude
oil prices have a highly correlated relationship to fuel prices, making these
derivatives effective in offsetting changes in the cost of aircraft fuel. We do
not enter into fuel hedge contracts for speculative purposes.

At December 31, 2003, we had hedged 32% of our projected aircraft fuel
requirements for 2004 at an average hedge price per gallon of 76.46¢, and none
of our projected aircraft fuel requirements for 2005 or thereafter. The fair
values of our heating and crude oil derivative instruments were $97 million at
December 31, 2003 and $73 million at December 31, 2002. A 10% decrease in the
average annual price of heating and crude oil would have decreased the fair
values of these instruments by $65 million at December 31, 2003.



In February 2004, we settled all of our fuel hedge contracts prior to
their scheduled settlement dates. As a result of these transactions, we received
$83 million in cash, which represented the fair value of these
contracts at the date of settlement. In accordance with SFAS 133, effective gains of
$82 million will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the
related fuel purchases, which were being hedged, are consumed and recognized in
expense during 2004. These gains will then be recorded as a reduction in fuel
expense on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The ineffective portion
of the hedges and the time value component of these contracts totaling $17 million will be recognized in the
March 2004 quarter as a fair
value adjustment of SFAS 133 derivatives in other income (expense) on our
Consolidated Statements of Operations. We may
enter into fuel hedge contracts in the future depending on certain conditions.

During 2003, aircraft fuel accounted for 14% of our total operating
expenses. Based on our projected aircraft fuel consumption of approximately 2.5
billion gallons for 2004, a 10% rise in our jet fuel prices would increase our
aircraft fuel expense by approximately $150 million in 2004. This analysis
includes the effects of fuel hedging instruments in place at December 31, 2003.

For additional information regarding our aircraft fuel price risk
management program, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Interest Rate Risk.

Our exposure to market risk due to changes in
interest rates primarily relates to our long-term debt obligations.

Market risk associated with our long-term debt is the potential change in
fair value resulting from a change in interest rates. A 10% decrease in average
annual interest rates would have increased the estimated fair value of our
long-term debt by $682 million at December 31, 2003 and $395 million at
December 31, 2002. A 10% increase in average annual interest rates
would not have had a material impact on our interest expense in 2003. For additional
information on our long-term debt agreements, see Notes 4 and 6 of the Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

To the Board of Directors and Shareowners’ of Delta Air Lines, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Delta Air
Lines, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2003 and 2002,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and
shareowners’ (deficit) equity for the years then ended. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. The
consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended December
31, 2001, before the revisions discussed below to Notes 5, 9, 16 and 21 to the
consolidated financial statements, were audited by other auditors who have
ceased operations. Those auditors expressed an unqualified opinion on those
financial statements in their report dated January 23, 2002. Their report
contained an explanatory paragraph related to the Company’s change in its
method of accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities
effective July 1, 2000 as discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial
statements.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such 2003 and 2002 consolidated financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company
as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, effective
January 1, 2002, the Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill and
other intangible assets to conform to Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 142 (“SFAS 142”).

As discussed above, the consolidated financial statements of the Company
for the year ended December 31, 2001, were audited by other auditors who have
ceased operations. These consolidated financial statements have been revised
as follows:

•

As described in Note 5, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS
142 as of January 1, 2002. These consolidated financial statements
have been revised to include the disclosures required by SFAS 142.

F-2


•

In Note 9, the Company has disclosed the amount of expenses
incurred related to contract carrier agreements. These consolidated
financial statements have been revised to include such disclosures for
2001.

•

In Note 16, the Company has disclosed the amounts of the additional
costs and expenses and payments related to restructuring and other
reserves for leased aircraft and facilities and other items. These
consolidated financial statements have been revised to include such
disclosures for 2001.

•

In Note 21, the Company has disclosed the amounts of additional
costs and expenses and deductions related to the allowance for
obsolescence of expendable parts and supplies inventories. These
consolidated financial statements have been revised to include such
disclosures for 2001.

We audited the disclosures in Notes 5, 9, 16 and 21 that were included to
revise the 2001 consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, such
disclosures are appropriate. However, we were not engaged to audit, review, or
apply any procedures to the 2001 consolidated financial statements of the
Company other than with respect to such disclosures and, accordingly, we do not
express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2001 consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole.

The following is a copy of the audit report previously issued by Arthur
Anderson LLP in connection with Delta’s Annual Report for the year ended
December 31, 2001. This audit report has not been reissued by Arthur Andersen
LLP.

To Delta Air Lines, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Delta Air
Lines, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001
and 2000, and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and
shareowners’ equity for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2001. These financial statements are the responsibility of the company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Delta Air
Lines, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

As discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, effective
July 1, 2000, Delta Air Lines, Inc. changed its method of accounting for
derivative instruments and hedging activities.

Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

Delta Air Lines, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) is a major air carrier that
provides air transportation for passengers and cargo throughout the U.S. and
around the world. Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of
Delta Air Lines, Inc. and our wholly owned subsidiaries, including ASA
Holdings, Inc. (ASA Holdings) and Comair Holdings, Inc. (Comair Holdings),
collectively referred to as Delta. ASA Holdings is the parent company of
Atlantic Southeast Airlines, Inc. (ASA), and Comair Holdings is the parent
company of Comair, Inc. (Comair). We have eliminated all material intercompany
transactions in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

These Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(GAAP). We have reclassified certain prior period amounts in our Consolidated
Financial Statements to be consistent with our current period presentation. The
effect of these reclassifications is not material.

We do not consolidate the financial statements of any company in which we have
an ownership interest of 50% or less unless we control that company. During
2003, 2002 and 2001, we did not control any company in which we had an
ownership interest of 50% or less.

Business Environment

Our net loss was $773 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, the third
consecutive year we recorded a substantial net loss. These financial results
reflect the unprecedented challenges confronting us and other airlines. Since
the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the airline industry has
experienced a severely depressed revenue environment and significant cost
pressures. These factors have resulted in industry-wide liquidity issues,
including the restructuring of certain hub and spoke airlines due to bankruptcy
or near bankruptcy.

The events of the past few years have resulted in fundamental, and what we
believe will be long-term, changes in the airline industry. These include: (1)
a sharp decline in high yield business travel; (2) the
continuing growth of low-cost
carriers with which we compete in most of our domestic markets; (3) industry
capacity exceeding demand which has led to significant fare discounting; and
(4) increased price sensitivity by our customers, reflecting in part the
availability of airline fare information on the Internet.

Due to the changes that have occurred in the airline industry, we must
significantly reduce our costs in order to be competitive in the current
environment and over the long term. Our cost structure is materially higher
than that of the low-cost carriers with which we compete. Certain other
hub-and-spoke airlines have significantly reduced their costs through
bankruptcy or the threat of bankruptcy. Our unit costs have gone from being
among the lowest of the hub-and-spoke carriers to among the highest for 2003, a
result which places us at a serious competitive disadvantage.

We have implemented a profit improvement initiative program aimed at lowering
our costs and increasing our revenues to compete in the current business
environment and over the long-term.

F-10


While we believe we have made progress under this program, we must continue to reduce our costs to compete in the
existing business environment. We have also taken steps to preserve our
liquidity through the deferral or reduction of capital expenditures related to
our mainline aircraft deliveries in future years. At the end of 2003, we began a
reassessment of our operating and business strategy in order to assess our
competitive effectiveness, determine the best use of our available resources
and identify strategic initiatives that we might pursue to improve our
performance. We expect to complete this review by July 2004.

We expect to meet our obligations as they come due through available cash and
cash equivalents, investments, internally generated funds and borrowings.
While new financing may be available to us, access to such
financing cannot be assured given the existing business environment and the
composition of our currently available unencumbered assets. Failure to improve our operational performance and obtain new financing could
have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Use of Estimates

We are required to make estimates and assumptions when preparing our
Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP. These estimates and
assumptions affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those
estimates.

New Accounting Standards

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 132 (revised 2003), “Employers’ Disclosures
about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, an amendment of FASB
Statements No. 87, 88, and 106” (SFAS 132R) in December 2003. SFAS 132R revises
employers’ disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit
plans by requiring additional disclosures about assets, obligations, cash flows
and net periodic benefit costs. SFAS 132R is effective for financial statements
issued after December 15, 2003 and for interim periods thereafter. See Note 11
for our disclosures required under SFAS 132R.

We adopted SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” (SFAS
143) on January 1, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 143 had no impact on our
Consolidated Financial Statements.

The FASB issued SFAS No. 149, “Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities” (SFAS 149) in April 2003. This statement
amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (SFAS 133). SFAS 149 is
effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, except in
certain circumstances. The adoption of SFAS 149 had no impact on our
Consolidated Financial Statements.

The FASB issued SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments
with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity” (SFAS 150) in May 2003.
This statement

F-11


establishes standards for classifying and measuring certain
financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity.
SFAS 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after
May 31, 2003; otherwise, this statement, as it applies to our financial
statements, is effective July 1, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 150 had no impact
on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

The FASB issued FASB Staff Position SFAS No. 106-1, “Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003” (FSP 106-1) in January 2004. The Medicare
Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Act)
introduced a prescription drug benefit under Medicare and a federal subsidy to
sponsors of health care benefit plans in certain circumstances. FSP 106-1
permits a sponsor of a postretirement health care plan that provides a
prescription drug benefit to make a one-time election to defer accounting for
the Medicare Act. It also requires certain disclosures regarding the Medicare
Act and is effective for financial statements issued after December 7, 2003.
Our 2003 Consolidated Financial Statements were not impacted by the Medicare
Act because our September 30 measurement date for our postretirement plans was
prior to the enactment of the Medicare Act. We are evaluating the impact of the
Medicare Act on our 2004 Consolidated Financial Statements (see Note 11 for
additional information).

The FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 46, “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities” (FIN 46) in February 2003. FIN 46 addresses how to identify
variable interest entities (VIEs) and the criteria that require a company to
consolidate such entities in its financial statements. FIN 46, as revised by
FIN 46R, was effective on February 1, 2003 for new transactions and is
effective for reporting periods ending after March 15, 2004 for transactions
entered into prior to February 1, 2003. We have not entered into any new
transactions subject to FIN 46 since February 1, 2003.

We completed an evaluation of our transactions entered into prior to February
1, 2003 that may be impacted by FIN 46, including (1) contract carrier
arrangements; (2) aircraft operating leases; and (3) fuel consortiums. While we
determined that some of these arrangements are VIEs, we neither hold a
significant variable interest in, nor are the primary beneficiary of, any of
these arrangements. The adoption of FIN 46 will not have a material impact on
our Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on EITF Issue 01-08,
“Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease” (EITF 01-08) in May 2003.
This EITF provides guidance on how to determine whether an arrangement
contains a lease that is within the scope of SFAS No. 13, “Accounting for
Leases” (SFAS 13). The guidance should be applied to arrangements agreed to or
modified after June 30, 2003. If our contract carrier arrangements are modified
in the future, we will likely have to account for these arrangements as
operating or capital leases in accordance with SFAS 13. See our accounting
policy for our contract carrier arrangements in this Note.

F-12


During 2002, we adopted the following accounting standards:

•

SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (SFAS 142) (see
our goodwill and other intangible assets policy and related
information in this Note and in Note 5, respectively);

•

SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets” (SFAS 144) (see our long-lived assets policy in this Note);

•

SFAS No. 145, “Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64,
Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13 and Technical Corrections” (SFAS

)

. In accordance with SFAS 145, we recorded losses of $15 million
and $42 million on the extinguishment of Employee Stock Ownership Plan
(ESOP) Notes in other income (expense) on our 2003 and 2002
Consolidated Statements of Operations, respectively. In addition,
during 2003, we recorded a $15 million gain on the extinguishment of
debt as a result of our debt exchange offer in other income (expense)
on our Consolidated Statement of Operations (see Note 6 for additional
information);

•

SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities” (SFAS 146). The adoption of SFAS 146 will impact the
timing of the recognition of liabilities related to future exit or
disposal activities;

•

SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation - Transition
and Disclosure - an Amendment to FASB Statement No. 123” (SFAS 148)
(see our stock-based compensation policy in this Note); and

•

FIN 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others”
(FIN 45) (see Note 9 for our disclosures required under FIN 45).

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We classify short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of
three months or less as cash and cash equivalents. These investments are
recorded at cost, which we believe approximates fair value.

Under our cash management system, we utilize controlled disbursement accounts
that are funded daily. Payments issued by us, which have not been presented for
payment, are recorded in accounts payable, deferred credits and other accrued
liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These amounts totaled $129
million and $154 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Restricted Assets

We have restricted cash which primarily relates to cash held as collateral to
support certain projected insurance obligations. Restricted cash included in
current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets totaled $207 million and $134
million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We also have $28 million
of restricted cash recorded in other noncurrent assets on our Consolidated
Balance Sheet at December 31, 2003 related to the planned sale of 11 B-737-800
aircraft in 2005. See Note 9 for additional information about this planned
sale.

We have restricted investments for the redevelopment and expansion of Terminal
A at Boston’s Logan International Airport (see Note 6 for additional
information about this project). Our restricted investments included in other
assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets totaled $286 million and $417 million
at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

F-13


Derivative Financial Instruments

We account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with SFAS 133.
These derivative instruments include fuel hedge contracts, interest rate swap
agreements and equity warrants and other similar rights in certain companies
(see Note 4).

Fuel Hedge Contracts

Our fuel hedge contracts qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133. We
record the fair value of our fuel hedge contracts on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets and regularly adjust the balances to reflect changes in the fair values
of those contracts.

Effective gains or losses related to the fair value adjustments of the fuel
hedge contracts are recorded in shareowners’ (deficit) equity as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). These gains or losses are
recognized in aircraft fuel expense in the period in which the related aircraft
fuel purchases being hedged are consumed and when the fuel hedge contract is
settled. However, to the extent that the change in fair value of a fuel hedge
contract does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the aircraft fuel
being hedged, the ineffective portion of the hedge is immediately recognized as
a fair value adjustment of SFAS 133 derivatives in other income (expense) on
our Consolidated Statements of Operations. In calculating the ineffective
portion of our hedges under SFAS 133, we include all changes in the fair value
attributable to the time value component and recognize the amount in other
income (expense) during the life of the contract.

Interest Rate Swap Agreements

We record interest rate swap agreements that qualify as fair value hedges under
SFAS 133 at their fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and adjust
these amounts and the related debt to reflect changes in their fair values. We
record net periodic interest rate swap settlements as adjustments to interest
expense in other income (expense) on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Equity Warrants and Other Similar Rights

We record our equity warrants and other similar rights in certain companies at
fair value at the date of acquisition in investments in debt and equity
securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In accordance with SFAS 133, we
regularly adjust our Consolidated Balance Sheets to reflect the changes in the
fair values of the equity warrants and other similar rights, and recognize the
related gains or losses as fair value adjustments of SFAS 133 derivatives in
other income (expense) on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Revenue Recognition

Passenger Revenues

We record sales of passenger tickets as air traffic liability on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Passenger revenues are recognized when we provide
the transportation, reducing the related air traffic liability. We periodically
evaluate the estimated air traffic liability and record any resulting
adjustments in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period that the
evaluations are completed.

F-14


We sell mileage credits in the SkyMiles® frequent flyer program to
participating partners such as credit card companies, hotels and car rental
agencies. A portion of the revenue from the sale of mileage credits is
deferred until the credits are redeemed for travel. We amortize the deferred
revenue on a straight-line basis over a 30-month period. The majority of the
revenue from the sale of mileage credits, including the amortization of
deferred revenue, is recorded in passenger revenue on our Consolidated
Statements of Operations; the remaining portion is recorded as an offset to
other selling expenses.

Cargo Revenues

Cargo revenues are recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations when
we provide the transportation.

Other, net

We are party to codeshare agreements with certain airlines. Under these
agreements, we sell seats on these airlines’ flights and they sell seats on our
flights, with each airline separately marketing its respective seats. The
revenue from our sale of codeshare seats flown by other airlines, and the
direct costs incurred in marketing the codeshare flights, are recorded in
other, net in operating revenues on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Our revenue from other airlines’ sale of codeshare seats flown by us is
recorded in passenger revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

We record revenues from our contract carrier agreements, reduced by related
expenses, in other, net in operating revenues on our Consolidated Statements of
Operations (see Note 9).

Long-Lived Assets

We record our property and equipment at cost and depreciate or amortize these
assets on a straight-line basis to their estimated residual values over their
respective estimated useful lives. Residual values for flight equipment range
from 5%-40% of cost. We also capitalize certain internal and external costs
incurred to develop internal-use software; these assets are included in ground
property and equipment, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The estimated
useful lives for major asset classifications are as follows:

Estimated

Asset Classification

Useful Life

Owned flight equipment

15-25 years

Flight and ground equipment under capital lease

Lease Term

Ground property and equipment

3-30 years

In accordance with SFAS 144, we record impairment losses on long-lived assets
used in operations when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be
impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those
assets are less than their carrying amounts. For long-lived assets held for
sale, we record impairment losses when the carrying amount is greater than the
fair value less the cost to sell. We discontinue depreciation of long-lived
assets once they are classified as held for sale.

F-15


To determine impairments for aircraft used in operations, we group assets at
the fleet type level (the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash
flows) and then estimate future cash flows based on projections of passenger
yield, fuel costs, labor costs and other relevant factors in the markets in
which these aircraft operate. If an impairment occurs, the amount of the
impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the
aircraft exceeds the estimated fair value. Aircraft fair values are estimated
by management using published sources, appraisals and bids received from third
parties, as available.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Prior to our adoption of SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002, goodwill and other
intangible assets were amortized over their estimated useful lives (not to
exceed 40 years in the case of goodwill). Upon adoption of SFAS 142, we
discontinued the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives. Instead, in accordance with SFAS 142, we now apply a
fair value-based impairment test to the net book value of goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis and, if certain events or
circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on an
interim basis. Intangible assets that have determinable useful lives continue
to be amortized on a straight-line basis over their remaining estimated useful
lives. Our leasehold and operating rights have definite useful lives and we
amortize these assets over their respective lease terms, which range from nine
to 19 years.

SFAS 142 requires a two step process in evaluating goodwill for impairment. The
first step requires the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to
its carrying value. We have three reporting units which have assigned
goodwill: Delta-Mainline, ASA and Comair. Our methodology for estimating the
fair value of each reporting unit primarily considers discounted future cash
flows. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, then
no further testing is required. If the carrying value of a reporting unit
exceeds its fair value, however, a second step is required to determine the
amount of the impairment charge, if any. An impairment charge is recognized if
the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair
value.

We perform our impairment test for our indefinite-lived intangible assets by
comparing the fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset unit to its
carrying value. The fair value of the asset unit is estimated based on its
discounted future cash flows. We recognize an impairment charge if the
carrying value of the asset unit exceeds its estimated fair value.

The annual impairment test date for our goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangible assets is December 31 (see Note 5).

Interest Capitalized

We capitalize interest on advance payments for the acquisition of new aircraft
and on construction of ground facilities as an additional cost of the related
assets. Interest is capitalized at our weighted average interest rate on
long-term debt or, if applicable, the interest rate related to specific asset
financings. Interest capitalization ends when the equipment or facility is
ready for service or its intended use. Capitalized interest totaled $12
million, $15 million and $32 million for the years ended December 31, 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively.

F-16


Equity Method Investments

We use the equity method to account for our investments in companies when we
have significant influence but not control over the operations of the company.
Under the equity method, we initially record our investment at cost and then
adjust the carrying value of the investment to recognize our proportional share
of the company’s net income (loss). In addition, dividends received from the
company reduce the carrying value of our investment.

In accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin
(SAB) 51, “Accounting for Sales of Stock by a Subsidiary” (SAB 51), we record
SAB 51 gains (losses) as a component of shareowners’ (deficit) equity on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets (see Note 17).

Income Taxes

We account for deferred income taxes under the liability method in accordance
with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (SFAS 109). Under this
method, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the tax
effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases
of assets and liabilities, as measured by current enacted tax rates. A
valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when determined
necessary in accordance with SFAS 109. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recorded net as current and noncurrent deferred income taxes on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets (see Note 10).

Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

In accordance with SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities” (SFAS 115), we record our investments classified as
available-for-sale securities under SFAS 115 at fair value in other noncurrent
assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Any changes in the fair value of
these securities are recorded, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss), unless such changes are deemed to be other than temporary (see
Note 2).

We record our investments classified as trading securities under SFAS 115 at
fair value in prepaid expenses and other on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and
recognize changes in the fair value of these securities in other income
(expense) on our Consolidated Statements of Operations (see Note 17).

Frequent Flyer
Program

We record an estimated liability for the incremental cost associated with
providing free transportation under our SkyMiles frequent flyer program when a
free travel award is earned. The liability is recorded in accounts payable,
deferred credits and other accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets. We periodically record adjustments to this liability in other operating
expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations based on awards earned,
awards redeemed, changes in the SkyMiles program and changes in estimated
incremental costs.

Deferred Gains on Sale and Leaseback Transactions

We amortize deferred gains on the sale and leaseback of property and equipment
under operating leases over the lives of these leases. The amortization of
these gains is recorded as a reduction in

F-17


rent expense. Gains on the sale and leaseback of property and equipment under
capital leases reduce the carrying value of the related assets.

Manufacturers’ Credits

We periodically receive credits in connection with the acquisition of aircraft
and engines. These credits are deferred until the aircraft and engines are
delivered, then applied on a pro rata basis as a reduction to the cost of the
related equipment.

Maintenance Costs

We record maintenance costs in operating expenses as they are incurred.

Inventories

Inventories of expendable parts related to flight equipment are carried at
moving average cost and charged to operations as consumed. An allowance for
obsolescence for the cost of these parts is provided over the remaining useful
life of the related fleet.

Advertising Costs

We expense advertising costs as other selling expenses in the year incurred.
Advertising expense was $135 million, $130 million and $153 million for the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Commissions

We record passenger commissions in prepaid expenses and other on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets when the related passenger tickets are sold.
Passenger commissions are recognized in operating expenses on our Consolidated
Statements of Operations when the transportation is provided and the related
revenue is recognized.

Foreign Currency Remeasurement

We remeasure assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies using
exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. Fixed assets and the
related depreciation or amortization charges are recorded at the exchange rates
in effect on the date we acquired the assets. Revenues and expenses denominated
in foreign currencies are remeasured using average exchange rates for each of
the periods presented. We recognize the resulting foreign exchange gains
(losses) as a component of miscellaneous income (expense) on our Consolidated
Statements of Operations. These gains (losses) are immaterial for all periods
presented.

Stock-Based Compensation

We account for our stock-based compensation plans under the intrinsic value
method in accordance with Accounting Principles Bulletin (APB) Opinion 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related interpretations (see
Note 12 for additional information related to our stock-based compensation
plans). No stock option compensation expense is recognized in our Consolidated
Statements of Operations because all stock options granted had an exercise
price equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock on the grant date.

F-18


The estimated fair values of stock options granted during the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 were derived using the Black-Scholes model.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

We record our cash equivalents and short-term investments at cost, which we
believe approximates their fair values. The estimated fair values of other
financial instruments, including debt and derivative instruments, have been
determined using available market information and valuation methodologies,
primarily discounted cash flow analyses and the Black-Scholes model.

Note 2. Marketable and Other Equity Securities

priceline.com Incorporated (priceline)

We are party to an agreement with priceline under which we (1) provide ticket
inventory that may be sold through priceline’s Internet-based e-commerce system
and (2) received certain equity interests in priceline. We are required to
provide priceline access to unpublished fares.


At January 1, 2001, our equity interests in priceline included (1) a warrant,
as amended, which is exercisable until November 17, 2004, to purchase up to 4.7
million shares of priceline common stock for $4.72 per share (1999 Warrant) and
(2) six million shares of priceline Series A

F-19


Convertible Preferred Stock (Series A Preferred Stock). We recognized $61
million in income ratably from November 1999 through November 2002 related to
the original 1999 Warrant.

On February 6, 2001, we and priceline agreed to restructure our investment in
priceline. We exchanged our six million shares of Series A Preferred Stock for
(1) 80,000 shares of priceline Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock (Series B
Preferred Stock) and (2) a warrant to purchase up to 26.9 million shares of
priceline common stock for $2.97 per share (2001 Warrant).

The Series B Preferred Stock (1) bears an annual per share dividend of
approximately 36 shares of priceline common stock; (2) has a liquidation
preference of $1,000 per share plus any dividends accrued or accumulated but
not yet paid (Liquidation Preference); (3) is subject to mandatory redemption
on February 6, 2007, at a price per share equal to the Liquidation Preference;
and (4) is subject to redemption in whole, at the option of us or priceline, if
priceline completes any of certain business combination transactions (Optional
Redemption).

We may exercise the 2001 Warrant, in whole or in part, at any time prior to the
close of business on February 6, 2007, unless all of the shares of Series B
Preferred Stock owned by us are redeemed in an Optional Redemption, in which
case we may not exercise the 2001 Warrant after the date of the Optional
Redemption. The exercise price may be paid by us only by the surrender of
shares of Series B Preferred Stock, valued at $1,000 per share.

The 2001 Warrant also provides that it will automatically be deemed exercised
if the closing sales price of priceline common stock exceeds $8.91 for 20
consecutive trading days. In that event, our rights in the shares of Series B
Preferred Stock necessary to pay the exercise price of the 2001 Warrant would
automatically be converted into the right to receive shares of priceline common
stock pursuant to the 2001 Warrant.

Based on an independent third-party appraisal, at February 6, 2001, the fair
value of (1) the Series B Preferred Stock was estimated to be $80 million and
(2) the 2001 Warrant was estimated to be $46 million. The total fair value of
these securities equaled the carrying amount of the Series A Preferred Stock,
including its conversion feature and accumulated dividends on the date the
Series A Preferred Stock was exchanged for the Series B Preferred Stock and the
2001 Warrant. Accordingly, we did not recognize a gain or loss on this
transaction.

During 2001, we (1) exercised the 2001 Warrant in part to purchase 18.4 million
shares of priceline common stock, paying the exercise price by surrendering to
priceline 54,656 shares of Series B Preferred Stock; (2) sold 18.7 million
shares of priceline common stock; and (3) received 986,491 shares of priceline
common stock as a dividend on the Series B Preferred Stock. In our 2001
Consolidated Statement of Operations, we recognized (1) other income of $9
million, pretax, from the dividend and (2) a pretax gain of $4 million from the
exercise of the 2001 Warrant and the sale of priceline common stock.


During 2002, we (1) exercised the 2001 Warrant in part to purchase 4.0 million
shares of priceline common stock, paying the exercise price by surrendering to
priceline 11,875 shares of

F-20


Series B Preferred Stock; (2) sold 3.9 million shares of priceline common
stock; and (3) received 695,749 shares of priceline common stock as dividends
on the Series B Preferred Stock. In our 2002 Consolidated Statement of
Operations, we recognized (1) a pretax loss of $3 million from the exercise of
the 2001 Warrant and the sale of priceline common stock and (2) other income of
$2 million, pretax, from the dividends.


On June 16, 2003, priceline effected a 1-for-6 reverse common stock split. As a
result of the stock split:

•

The 1999 Warrant, as amended, was adjusted to (1) reduce from 4.7
million to approximately 779,000 the maximum number of shares we may
purchase by exercising that warrant and (2) increase from $4.72 to
$28.31 the per share purchase price of those shares.

•

The 2001 Warrant was adjusted to (1) reduce from 4.5 million to
approximately 756,000 the maximum number of remaining shares we may
purchase by exercising that warrant; (2) increase from $2.97 to $17.81
the per share purchase price of those shares; and (3) increase from
$8.91 to $53.46 the closing sales price which priceline common stock
must exceed for 20 consecutive days for the 2001 Warrant to
automatically be deemed exercised.

•

The Series B Preferred Stock was adjusted to reduce its annual per
share dividend from approximately 36 shares to six shares of priceline
common stock.

The reverse stock split did not impact the carrying value of our equity
interests in priceline.

During 2003, as adjusted for priceline’s 1-for-6 reverse common stock split, we
(1) sold 423,640 shares of priceline common stock and (2) received 80,480
shares of priceline common stock. In our 2003 Consolidated Statements of
Operations, we recognized (1) a pretax gain of $5 million from the sale of
priceline common stock; (2) other income of $1 million, pretax, from the
dividends; and (3) an $8 million writedown related to our priceline common
stock due to an other than temporary decline in the fair value of that stock.

The following table represents our equity interests in priceline and their
respective carrying values at December 31, 2003 and 2002, as adjusted for the
1-for-6 reverse common stock split discussed above:

The Series B Preferred Stock and priceline common stock are classified as
available-for-sale securities under SFAS 115 and are recorded in other
noncurrent assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We did not own any shares
of priceline common stock at December 31, 2003. The Series B Preferred Stock is
recorded at face value, which we believe approximates fair value. The 1999 and
2001 Warrants are recorded at fair value in other noncurrent assets on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets and any changes in fair value are recorded in other
income (expense) on our Consolidated Statements of Operations in accordance
with SFAS 133. See Note 1 for information about our accounting policy for
investments in debt and equity securities.

Republic Airways Holdings, Inc. (Republic)

On June 7, 2002, we entered into a contract carrier agreement with Chautauqua
Airlines, Inc. (Chautauqua), a regional air carrier that is a subsidiary of
Republic (see Note 9). In conjunction with this agreement, we received from
Republic (1) a warrant to purchase up to 1.5 million shares of Republic common
stock for $12.50 per share (2002 Warrant); (2) a warrant to purchase up to 1.5
million shares of Republic common stock at a price per share equal to 95% of
the public offering price per share in Republic’s initial public offering (IPO)
of common stock (IPO Warrant); (3) the right to purchase up to 5% of the shares
of common stock that Republic offers for sale in its IPO at a price per share
equal to the IPO price; and (4) the right to receive a warrant to purchase up
to an additional 60,000 shares of Republic common stock for each additional
aircraft Chautauqua operates for us above the 22 aircraft under the original
contract carrier agreement.

The 2002 Warrant is exercisable in whole or in part at any time until June 7,
2012. The fair value of the 2002 Warrant on the date received was $11 million,
and is being recognized on a straight-line basis over a five-year period in
other, net in operating revenues on our Consolidated Statement of Operations.

The IPO Warrant is exercisable in whole or in part at any time (1) beginning on
the closing date of Republic’s IPO of common stock and (2) subject to earlier
cancellation if the contract carrier agreement is terminated in certain
circumstances, ending on the tenth anniversary of that closing date. We will
record the fair value of the IPO Warrant on the closing date of Republic’s IPO
of common stock.

In February and October 2003, we amended our contract carrier agreement with
Chautauqua to increase from 22 to 34, and then from 34 to 39, respectively, the
number of aircraft Chautauqua will operate for us by the end of 2004 under that
agreement. As a result of these amendments, we received two new warrants, as
follows (2003 Warrants):

•

A warrant to purchase up to 720,000 shares of Republic common stock
for (1) $12.50 per share, if the warrant is exercised prior to the
completion of Republic’s IPO of common stock or (2) the price per share
at which Republic common stock is sold in the IPO, if the warrant is
exercised in connection with or after the IPO; and

•

A warrant to purchase up to 300,000 shares of Republic common stock
for (1) $18.00 per share, if the warrant is exercised prior to the
completion of Republic’s IPO or (2) 95% of

F-22


the price per share at which Republic common stock is sold in the IPO, if
the warrant is exercised in connection with or after the IPO.

The 2003 Warrants are exercisable in whole or in part at any time until ten
years from their date of issue. The fair values of the 2003 Warrants on the
dates received were not material.

The carrying value of the 2002 and 2003 Warrants was $18 million at December
31, 2003. The carrying value of the 2002 Warrant was $10 million at December
31, 2002. The 2002 and 2003 Warrants are accounted for in the same manner as
the priceline warrants described above and are included in other noncurrent
assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The 2002 Warrant, the IPO Warrant,
the 2003 Warrants and the shares of Republic common stock underlying these
securities are not registered under the Securities Act of 1933; however, we
have certain demand and piggyback registration rights relating to the
underlying shares of Republic common stock.

Other

During 2001, we sold our equity interests in SkyWest, Inc., the parent company
of SkyWest Airlines, Inc. (SkyWest), and Equant, N.V., an international data
services company. We recognized pretax gains of $111 million and $11 million,
respectively, on these transactions. These gains are recorded in our 2001
Consolidated Statement of Operations in gain (loss) from sale of investments,
net.

Note 3. Risk Management

Aircraft Fuel Price Risk

Our results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the price
of aircraft fuel. To manage this risk, we periodically purchase options and
other similar derivative instruments and enter into forward contracts for the
purchase of fuel. These contracts may have maturities of up to 36 months. We
may hedge up to 80% of our expected fuel requirements on a 12-month rolling
basis. See Note 4 for additional information about our fuel hedge contracts. We
do not enter into fuel hedge contracts for speculative purposes.

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates primarily relates
to our long-term debt obligations, cash portfolio, and pension, postemployment
and postretirement benefits. Market risk associated with our long-term debt
relates to the potential change in fair value resulting from a change in
interest rates as well as the potential increase in interest we would pay on
variable rate debt. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, approximately 34% and 26%,
respectively, of our total debt was variable rate debt. Market risk associated
with our cash portfolio relates to the potential change in our earnings
resulting from a decrease in interest rates. Pension, postemployment and
postretirement benefits risk relates to the potential changes in our benefit
obligations, funding and expenses from a change in interest rates (see Note
11).

From time to time, we may enter into interest rate swap agreements, provided
that the notional amount of these transactions does not exceed 50% of our
long-term debt. See Note 4 for additional information about our interest rate
swap agreements. We do not enter into interest rate swap agreements for
speculative purposes.

F-23


Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

We are subject to foreign currency exchange risk because we have revenues and
expenses denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the euro, the British
pound and the Canadian dollar. To manage exchange rate risk, we attempt to
execute both our international revenue and expense transactions in the same
foreign currency, to the extent practicable. From time to time, we may also
enter into foreign currency options and forward contracts with maturities of up
to 12 months. We did not have any foreign currency hedge contracts at December
31, 2003 or 2002. We do not enter into foreign currency hedge contracts for
speculative purposes.

Credit Risk

To manage credit risk associated with our aircraft fuel price, interest rate
and foreign currency exchange risk management programs, we select
counterparties based on their credit ratings and limit our exposure to any one
counterparty under defined guidelines. We also monitor the market position of
these programs and our relative market position with each counterparty. The
credit exposure related to these programs was not significant at December 31,
2003 and 2002.

Our accounts receivable are generated largely from the sale of passenger
airline tickets and cargo transportation services. The majority of these sales
are processed through major credit card companies, resulting in accounts
receivable which are generally short-term in duration. We also have receivables
from the sale of mileage credits to partners, such as credit card companies,
hotels and car rental agencies, that participate in our SkyMiles program. We
believe that the credit risk associated with these receivables is minimal and
that the allowance for uncollectible accounts that we have provided is
appropriate.

Self-Insurance Risk

We self-insure a portion of our losses from claims related to workers’
compensation, environmental issues, property damage, medical insurance for
employees and general liability. Losses are accrued based on an estimate of the
ultimate aggregate liability for claims incurred, using independent actuarial
reviews based on standard industry practices and our actual experience. A
portion of our projected workers’ compensation liability is secured with
restricted cash collateral (see Note 1).

Note 4. Derivative Instruments

On July 1, 2000, we adopted SFAS 133, as amended, which requires us to record
all derivative instruments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and
to recognize certain changes in these fair values in our Consolidated
Statements of Operations. SFAS 133 impacts the accounting for our fuel hedging
program, our interest rate hedging program and our holdings of equity warrants
and other similar rights in certain companies.

Fuel Hedging Program

Because there is not a readily available market for derivatives in aircraft
fuel, we use heating and crude oil derivative contracts to manage our exposure
to changes in aircraft fuel prices. Changes in the fair value of these
contracts (fuel hedge contracts) are highly effective at offsetting changes in
aircraft fuel prices.

At December 31, 2003, our fuel hedge contracts had a fair value of $97 million,
which was recorded in prepaid expenses and other, with unrealized effective
gains of $34 million, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
loss on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2002, our fuel hedge
contracts had a fair value of $73 million, $68 million of which was recorded in
prepaid expenses and other and $5 million of which was recorded in noncurrent
assets, with unrealized effective gains of $29 million, net of tax, recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive loss on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. See
Note 1 for information about our accounting policy for fuel hedge contracts.
See Note 22 for information regarding the early settlement of our fuel hedge
contracts.

Interest Rate Hedging Program

To manage our interest rate exposure, in July 2002, we entered into two
interest rate swap agreements relating to our (1) $300 million principal amount
of unsecured Series C Medium-Term Notes due March 15, 2004, which pay interest
at a fixed rate of 6.65% per year and (2) $500 million principal amount of
unsecured Notes due December 15, 2005, which pay interest at a fixed rate of
7.70% per year. Under the first interest rate swap agreement, we paid the
London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin per year in exchange for
the right to receive 6.65% per year on a notional amount of $300 million until
March 15, 2004. Under the second agreement, we paid LIBOR plus a margin per
year in exchange for the right to receive 7.70% per year on a notional amount
of $500 million until December 15, 2005.

On May 9, 2003, we settled these interest rate swap agreements prior to their
expiration. As a result, we received $27 million, including $7 million
previously recognized as adjustments to interest expense under the terms of the
swap agreements. These swaps were accounted for as fair value hedges of debt in
accordance with SFAS 133. At the date of settlement, the fair value
adjustments to the previously underlying debt related to the interest rate
swaps totaled $20 million. These adjustments are being recognized in accordance
with SFAS 133 as an adjustment to interest expense over the remaining term of
the previously underlying debt. A portion of these fair value adjustments were
recognized as a part of the gain on extinguishment of a portion of the
previously hedged debt (see Note 6).

At December 31, 2002, our interest rate swap agreements had a fair value of $21
million, which was recorded in other noncurrent assets on our Consolidated
Balance Sheet. In accordance with

F-25


fair value hedge accounting, the carrying
value of our long-term debt at December 31, 2003 and 2002 included $8 million
and $21 million, respectively, of fair value adjustments. See Note 1 for
information about our accounting policy for interest rate swap agreements.

Equity Warrants and Other Similar Rights

We own equity warrants and other similar rights in certain companies, primarily
priceline and Republic. The total fair value of these rights was $30 million
and $14 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. See Notes 1 and 2
for information about our accounting policy for and ownership of these rights,
respectively.

Note 5. Goodwill and Intangible Assets

On January 1, 2002, we adopted SFAS 142, which requires that we discontinue the
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful
lives. Accordingly, we now apply a fair value-based impairment test to the net
book value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. See Note 1 for
information about our accounting policy for the impairment tests of goodwill
and other intangible assets.

The adoption of SFAS 142 decreased our operating expenses on our Consolidated
Statements of Operations by approximately $60 million, net of tax, for each of
the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, due to the discontinuance of
amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. During the
June 2002 quarter, we completed our transitional goodwill impairment test,
which indicated no impairment at the date of adoption of SFAS 142.

The following table reconciles our reported net loss and loss per share to
adjusted net loss and loss per share as if the non-amortization provisions of
SFAS 142 had been applied to the year ended December 31, 2001:

During the March 2002 quarter, we completed the required initial test of
potential impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than
goodwill; that test indicated no impairment at the date of adoption of SFAS
142. The following table presents information about our intangible assets,
other than goodwill, at December 31, 2003 and 2002:

The fair value of our total secured
and unsecured debt was $11.9 billion and

Future Maturities

The following table summarizes the scheduled maturities of our debt, including
current maturities, at December 31, 2003, as adjusted for certain refinancings
of regional jet aircraft subsequent to December 31, 2003 (see Note 22):

We have available to us long-term, secured financing commitments from a third
party that we may elect to use for a substantial portion of the regional jet
aircraft delivered to ASA and Comair through 2004. Borrowings under these
commitments would bear interest at a rate determined by reference to ten-year
U.S. Treasury Notes plus a margin, and would have various repayment dates. Our
election to use these commitments would result in the refinancing of
approximately $300 million of our 2004 maturities included in the table above.
Other than these commitments, we do not have any undrawn lines of credit.

Boston Airport Terminal Project

During 2001, we entered into lease and financing agreements with the
Massachusetts Port Authority (Massport) for the redevelopment and expansion of
Terminal A at Boston’s Logan International Airport. The completion of this
project will enable us to consolidate all of our domestic operations at that
airport into one location. Construction began in the June 2002 quarter
and is expected to be completed during 2005. Project costs will be funded with
$498 million in proceeds from Special Facilities Revenue Bonds issued by
Massport on August 16, 2001. We agreed to pay the debt service on the bonds
under a long-term lease agreement with Massport and issued a guarantee to the
bond trustee covering the payment of the debt service on the bonds. For
additional information about these bonds, see the debt table above. Because we
have issued a guarantee of the debt service on the bonds, we have included the
bonds, as well as the related bond proceeds, on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets. The bonds are reflected in noncurrent

F-29


liabilities and the related
remaining proceeds, which are held in trust, are reflected as restricted
investments in other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Letter Of Credit Enhanced Municipal Bonds

At December 31, 2003, there were outstanding $397 million aggregate principal
amount of tax-exempt municipal bonds (Bonds) enhanced by letters of credit,
including:

•

$295 million principal amount of bonds issued by the Development
Authority of Clayton County (Clayton Authority) to refinance the
construction cost of certain facilities leased to us at
Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. We pay debt service
on these bonds pursuant to loan agreements between us and the Clayton
Authority; and

•

$102 million principal amount of bonds issued by other
municipalities to refinance the construction cost of certain facilities
leased to us at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport,
Salt Lake City International Airport and Tampa International Airport.
We pay debt service on these bonds pursuant to long-term lease
agreements (see Note 7).

The Bonds (1) have scheduled maturities between 2029 and 2035; (2) currently
bear interest at a variable rate that is determined weekly; and (3) may be
tendered for purchase by their holders on seven days’ notice. Tendered Bonds
are remarketed at prevailing interest rates.

Principal and interest on the Bonds are currently paid through drawings on
irrevocable, direct-pay letters of credit totaling $404 million issued by GECC.
In addition, the purchase price of tendered Bonds that cannot be remarketed are
paid by drawings on these letters of credit. The GECC letters of credit, which
replaced similar letters of credit issued by a third party, expire on May 20,
2008.

Pursuant to an agreement between us and GECC (Reimbursement Agreement), we are
required to reimburse GECC for drawings on the letters of credit. Our
reimbursement obligation to GECC is secured by nine B-767-400 and three
B-777-200 aircraft (LOC Aircraft Collateral) and 96 spare mainline engines
owned by us. This collateral also secures other obligations we have to GECC, as
discussed in the table above.

If a drawing under a letter of credit is made to pay the purchase price of
Bonds tendered for purchase and not remarketed, our resulting reimbursement
obligation to GECC will bear interest at a base rate or three-month LIBOR plus
a margin. The principal amount of the reimbursement obligation will be repaid
quarterly through May 20, 2008.

GECC has the right to cause a mandatory tender for purchase of all Bonds and
terminate the letters of credit if an event of default occurs or if a minimum
collateral value test (Collateral Value Test) is not satisfied on May 19, 2006.
We will not satisfy the Collateral Value Test if (1) the appraised market
value of the LOC Aircraft Collateral on March 20, 2006 is less than two times
the aggregate amount of the outstanding letters of credit plus any other
amounts payable by us under the Reimbursement Agreement (Aggregate Obligations)
and (2) within 60 days

F-30


thereafter, we have not either provided additional
collateral to GECC in the form of cash or aircraft or caused a reduction in the
Aggregate Obligations such that the Collateral Value Test is satisfied.

Unless the GECC letters of credit are extended in a timely manner, we will be
required to purchase the Bonds on May 15, 2008, five days prior to the
expiration of the letters of credit. In this circumstance, we could seek, but
there is no assurance that we would be able, to (1) sell the Bonds without
credit enhancement at then-prevailing fixed interest rates or (2) replace the
expiring letters of credit with new letters of credit from an alternate credit
provider and remarket the Bonds.

We may terminate the GECC letters of credit, and repay any outstanding
obligations under the Reimbursement Agreement, at our election prior to
maturity, subject to certain prepayment fees if such action occurs before May
20, 2005.

Convertible Senior Notes (8.00% Notes)

In June 2003, we issued $350 million principal amount of 8.00% Notes due 2023.
Holders may convert their 8.00% Notes into shares of our common stock at a
conversion rate of 35.7143 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount
of 8.00% Notes, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, which is
equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $28.00 per share of common
stock, if:

•

during any calendar quarter after June 30, 2003, the last reported
sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days during the
period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of
the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to
130% of the conversion price per share of our common stock;

•

the trading price of the 8.00% Notes falls below a specified threshold;

•

we call the 8.00% Notes for redemption; or

•

specified corporate transactions occur.

We may redeem all or some of the 8.00% Notes for cash at any time after June 5,
2008, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the 8.00% Notes to
be redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid interest.

Holders may require us to repurchase their 8.00% Notes for cash on June 3,
2008, 2013 and 2018, or in other specified circumstances involving the
exchange, conversion or acquisition of all or substantially all of our common
stock, at a purchase price equal to the principal amount of the 8.00% Notes to
be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest. At December 31, 2003,
12,500,005 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance for the conversion
of the 8.00% Notes.

ESOP Notes

We guarantee the ESOP Notes issued by the Delta Family-Care Savings Plan.
During 2002, we terminated the letter of credit used to make required payments
of principal, interest and make-whole premium on the ESOP Notes. As a result of
this action, each holder of ESOP Notes had

F-31


two opportunities to require us to
purchase their ESOP Notes. During 2002, we purchased ESOP Notes for $215
million, covering $169 million principal amount of ESOP Notes, $4 million of
accrued interest and $42 million of make-whole premium. During 2003, we
purchased additional ESOP Notes for $91 million, covering $72 million principal
amount of ESOP Notes, $4 million of accrued interest and $15 million of
make-whole premium. As of December 31, 2003, $18 million principal amount of
ESOP Notes was held by third parties.

We recognized losses of $15 million and $42 million for the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, for the make-whole premiums related
to these extinguishments of debt. These losses were recorded in other income
(expense) on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Debt Exchange Offer

In September 2003, we completed a debt exchange offer relating to $300 million
principal amount of our 6.65% Series C Medium-Term Notes due 2004 (2004 Notes),
and $500 million principal amount of our 7.70% Senior Notes due 2005 (2005
Notes). Under the exchange offer, qualified institutional buyers could elect
to exchange (1) for each $1,000 principal amount of 2004 Notes tendered, $650
cash and $409.50 principal amount of new 10% Senior Notes due August 15, 2008
(2008 Notes), and (2) for each $1,000 principal amount of 2005 Notes tendered,
$1,120 principal amount of new 2008 Notes.

Eligible holders elected to exchange $64 million principal amount of the 2004
Notes and $198 million principal amount of the 2005 Notes. We paid a total of
$47 million in cash (including $5 million in accrued interest) and issued an
aggregate of $248 million principal amount of 2008 Notes.

The exchange offer qualified as a debt extinguishment and, accordingly, we
recorded the issuance of the 2008 Notes at a fair value of $211 million, which
reflects a $37 million original issue discount. This discount will be amortized
to interest expense through August 15, 2008. Of the $47 million payment, we
recorded $42 million as a payment on long-term debt and capital lease
obligations and $5 million as a change in certain assets and liabilities, net
on our 2003 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. As a result of this
transaction, we also recorded a $15 million gain ($9 million net of tax) on
extinguishment of debt in other income (expense) on our 2003 Consolidated
Statement of Operations.

Other Financing Arrangements

On January 31, 2002, we entered into a facility to finance, on a secured basis
at the time of acquisition, certain future deliveries of regional jet aircraft.
At December 31, 2003, the total borrowings outstanding under this facility, as
amended, were $449 million. Borrowings under this
facility (1) are due between 366 days and 18 months after the date of borrowing
(subject to earlier repayment if certain longer-term financing is obtained for
these aircraft) and (2) bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin.

Covenants

Our credit facilities do not contain any negative financial covenants. As
discussed above, our Reimbursement Agreement with GECC includes the Collateral
Value Test.

As is customary in the airline industry, our aircraft lease and financing
agreements require that we maintain certain levels of insurance coverage,
including war-risk insurance. We were in compliance with these requirements at
December 31, 2003 and 2002. See Note 19 for additional information on war-risk
insurance currently provided by the U.S. government under the Air
Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act.

F-32


Note 7. Lease Obligations

We lease aircraft, airport terminal and maintenance facilities, ticket offices
and other property and equipment from third parties. Rental expense for
operating leases, which is recorded on a straight-line basis over the life of
the lease, totaled $1.3 billion for each year ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and
2001. Amounts due under capital leases are recorded as liabilities on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our interest in assets acquired under capital
leases is recorded as property and equipment on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets. Amortization of assets recorded under capital leases is included in
depreciation and amortization expense on our Consolidated Statements of
Operations. Our leases do not include residual value guarantees.

The following table summarizes, as of December 31, 2003, our minimum rental
commitments under capital leases and noncancelable operating leases with
initial or remaining terms in excess of one year:

We expect to receive approximately $130 million under noncancelable sublease
agreements. This expected sublease income is not reflected as a reduction in
the total minimum rental commitments under operating leases in the table above.

At December 31, 2003, we operated 309 aircraft under operating leases and 39
aircraft under capital leases. These leases have remaining terms ranging from
three months to 14 years.

Certain municipalities have issued special facilities revenue bonds to build or
improve airport and maintenance facilities leased to us. The facility lease
agreements require us to make rental payments sufficient to pay principal and
interest on the bonds. The above table includes $1.7 billion of operating lease
rental commitments for such payments.

F-33


Note 8. Sale of Receivables

We were party to an agreement, as amended, under which we sold a defined pool
of our accounts receivable, on a revolving basis, through a special-purpose,
wholly owned subsidiary, which then sold an undivided interest in the
receivables to a third party. In accordance with SFAS 140, “Accounting for
Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities”
(SFAS 140), the subsidiary was not consolidated in our Consolidated Financial
Statements. At December 31, 2002, we had a subordinated promissory note with a
principal amount of $67 million from the subsidiary; this note was included in
accounts receivable on our 2002 Consolidated Balance Sheet. Additionally, our
investment in the subsidiary, which represented our funding of that entity,
totaled $117 million at December 31, 2002, and was recorded in investments in
associated companies on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

This agreement terminated on its scheduled expiration date of March 31, 2003.
As a result, on April 2, 2003, we paid $250 million, which represented the
total amount owed to the third party by the subsidiary, and subsequently
collected the related receivables.

Note 9. Purchase Commitments and Contingencies

Aircraft Order Commitments

Future commitments for aircraft on firm order as of December 31, 2003 are
estimated to be $4.0 billion. The following table shows the timing of these
commitments:

The table above includes our payments to purchase from the manufacturer 11
B-737-800 aircraft, which we have entered into a definitive agreement to sell
to a third party immediately following delivery of these aircraft to us in
2005. This transaction will reduce our commitments by approximately $460
million through 2005. We also granted the third party an option to purchase up
to 10 additional B-737-800 aircraft scheduled for delivery to us in 2006.

Additionally, as of December 31, 2003, we had deferred delivery of one
B-737-800 aircraft, and plan to exercise our right to defer delivery of an
additional seven B-737-800 aircraft from 2005 to 2008. This transaction will
defer approximately $300 million of our commitments through 2005 to later years
in the table above.

Contract Carrier Agreements

We have contract carrier agreements with three regional air carriers, Atlantic
Coast Airlines (ACA), SkyWest and Chautauqua. Under these agreements, ACA,
SkyWest and Chautauqua operate certain of their aircraft using our flight code;
we schedule those aircraft and sell the seats

F-34


on those flights; and we retain the related revenues. We pay those airlines an
amount, as defined in the applicable agreement, which is based on an annual
redetermination of their cost of operating those flights and other factors
intended to approximate market rates for those services. Our contract carrier
agreements with ACA and SkyWest expire in 2010, and our agreement with
Chautauqua expires in 2012.

The following table shows the total number of aircraft and available seat miles
(ASMs) operated for us by ACA, SkyWest and Chautauqua under, and our expenses
related to, the contract carrier agreements, for the years ended December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001:

The 123 aircraft operated for us at December 31, 2003
include 30 aircraft operated by ACA,
59 aircraft operated by SkyWest and 34 aircraft operated by Chautauqua.
Our contract carrier
agreements do not
include any scheduled changes in these numbers during the remaining term of
those agreements,
except that the number of aircraft scheduled to be operated for us by
Chautauqua
increases to 39
by the end of 2004.

(2)

These amounts are unaudited and are not included in our ASMs
disclosed in Item 6 in this Form 10-K.

During 2004, we expect to incur a total of approximately $890 million in
expenses related to our contract carrier agreements with these airlines. See
Note 1 for information about our accounting policy for revenues and expenses
related to our contract carrier agreements.

We may terminate the ACA and SkyWest agreements without cause at any time by
giving the airlines certain advance notice. If we terminate the ACA agreement
without cause, ACA has the right to (1) assign to us leased aircraft that it
operates for us, provided we are able to continue the leases on the same
financial terms ACA had prior to the assignment and (2) require us to purchase,
at fair value, aircraft that ACA operates for us and owns at the time of the
termination. If we terminate the SkyWest agreement without cause, SkyWest has
the right to assign to us leased regional jet aircraft which it operates for
us, provided we are able to continue the leases on the same terms SkyWest had
prior to the assignment.

We may terminate the Chautauqua
agreement, as amended,  without cause at any time after November 2008 by giving the airline certain advance notice. If we terminate the
Chautauqua agreement without cause, Chautauqua has the right to (1) assign to
us leased aircraft that it operates for us, provided we are able to continue
the leases on the same terms Chautauqua had prior to the assignment and (2)
require us to purchase or sublease any of the aircraft that it owns and
operates for us at the time of the termination. If we are required to purchase
aircraft owned by Chautauqua, the purchase price would be equal to the amount
necessary to (1) reimburse Chautauqua for the equity it provided to purchase
the aircraft and (2) repay in full any debt outstanding at such time that is
not being assumed in connection with such purchase. If we are required to
sublease aircraft owned by Chautauqua, the sublease would have (1) a rate equal
to the debt payments of Chautauqua for the debt financing of the aircraft
calculated as if 90% of the aircraft was debt financed by Chautauqua and (2)
specified other terms and conditions.

F-35


ACA has announced plans to begin operating in November 2004 a new low-fare
airline using jet aircraft with more than 70 seats. Our collective bargaining
agreement with the Air Line Pilots Association, International (ALPA) prohibits
contract carrier codeshare arrangements with domestic carriers such as ACA if
the contract carrier operates aircraft with more than 70 seats. As discussed
above, we have the right to terminate the ACA agreement without cause, in which
case ACA has the right to require us to assume the leases on leased aircraft,
or purchase owned aircraft, that ACA operates for us. ACA currently operates 30
leased Fairchild Dornier FRJ-328 regional jet aircraft for us. If we are
required to assume the leases on these aircraft in November 2004, we estimate
that the total remaining operating lease payments would be approximately $300
million. These payments would be made over the remaining terms of the aircraft
leases, which are approximately 13 years.

We estimate that the total fair value, at December 31, 2003, of the aircraft
that SkyWest or Chautauqua could assign to us or require that we purchase if we
terminate without cause our contract carrier agreements with those airlines is
approximately $630 million and $450 million, respectively. The actual amount
that we may be required to pay in these circumstances may be materially
different from these estimates.

Legal Contingencies

We are involved in legal proceedings relating to antitrust matters, employment
practices, environmental issues and other matters concerning our business. We
are also a defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the terrorist attacks
of September 11, 2001. We cannot reasonably estimate the potential loss for
certain legal proceedings because, for example, the litigation is in its early
stages or the plaintiff does not specify the damages being sought. Although the
ultimate outcome of our legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty,
we believe that the resolution of these actions will not have a material
adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other Contingencies

Regional Airports Improvement Corporation (RAIC)

We are obligated under a facilities sublease with the RAIC to pay the bond
trustee rent in an amount sufficient to pay the debt service on $47 million in
Facilities Sublease Revenue Bonds; these bonds were issued in 1985 to finance
the construction of certain airport and terminal facilities we lease at Los
Angeles International Airport. We also provide a guarantee to the bond trustee
covering payment of the debt service.

General Indemnifications

We are the lessee under many real estate leases. It is common in these
commercial lease transactions for us, as the lessee, to agree to indemnify the
lessor and other related third parties for tort, environmental and other
liabilities that arise out of or relate to our use or occupancy of the leased
premises. This type of indemnity would typically make us responsible to
indemnified parties for liabilities arising out of the conduct of, among
others, contractors, licensees and invitees at or in connection with the use or
occupancy of the leased premises. This indemnity often extends to related
liabilities arising from the negligence of the indemnified parties, but

F-36


usually excludes any liabilities caused by either their sole or gross
negligence and their willful misconduct.

Our aircraft and other equipment lease and financing agreements typically
contain provisions requiring us, as the lessee or obligor, to indemnify the
other parties to those agreements, including certain related parties, against
virtually any liabilities that might arise from the condition, use or operation
of the aircraft or such other equipment.

We believe that our insurance would cover most of our exposure to such
liabilities and related indemnities associated with the types of lease and
financing agreements described above, including real estate leases.

Certain of our aircraft and other financing transactions include provisions
which require us to make payments to preserve an expected economic return to
the lenders if that economic return is diminished due to certain changes in law
or regulations. In certain of these financing transactions, we also bear the
risk of certain changes in tax laws that would subject payments to non-U.S.
lenders to withholding taxes.

We cannot reasonably estimate our potential future payments under the
indemnities and related provisions described above because we cannot predict
when and under what circumstances these provisions may be triggered.

Employees Under Collective Bargaining Agreements

At December 31, 2003, we had a total of approximately 70,600 full-time
equivalent employees. Approximately 18% of these employees, including all of
our pilots, are represented by labor unions. ASA is in collective bargaining
negotiations with ALPA and the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA), which
represent ASA’s approximately 1,450 pilots and 800 flight attendants,
respectively. ASA’s collective bargaining agreements with ALPA and AFA became
amendable in September 2002 and September 2003, respectively. The outcome of
these collective bargaining negotiations cannot presently be determined.

Delta’s collective bargaining agreement with ALPA becomes amendable on May 1,
2005. The agreement generally provides that no pilot on the seniority list as
of July 1, 2001 may be furloughed unless the furlough is caused by a
circumstance beyond our control, as defined in the agreement. Therefore, if we
reduce the number of flights in our schedule for reasons other than a
circumstance beyond our control, as defined in the agreement, we may be
required to pay unutilized pilots their full salary and benefits. If we
furlough pilots due to a circumstance beyond our control, we are only obligated
to remit furlough pay and to provide or pay for certain other benefits for a
limited period until the pilots are recalled. We have been involved in
arbitration regarding whether the agreement permits furloughs in particular
circumstances.

Planned Sale of Aircraft

In conjunction with our agreement to sell 11 B-737-800 aircraft to a third
party immediately after those aircraft are delivered to us by the manufacturer
in 2005, we have agreed to pay the third party, for a designated period with
respect to each of the 11 B-737-800 aircraft, an amount equal

F-37


to the excess, if any, of a specified rate over the rate at which the third
party leases the aircraft to another party. The maximum undiscounted amount we
could be required to pay for all 11 aircraft totals approximately $70 million.
While we cannot predict with certainty whether we will be required to make a
payment under this provision, we believe that the possibility of this event is
not likely due to the current and estimated future marketability of these
aircraft.

Other

We have certain contracts for goods and services that require us to pay a
penalty, acquire inventory specific to us or purchase contract specific
equipment, as defined by each respective contract, if we terminate the contract
without cause prior to its expiration date. These obligations are contingent
upon whether we terminate the contract without cause prior to its expiration
date; therefore, no obligation would exist unless such a termination were to
occur.

Note 10. Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and income tax purposes (see Note 1 for information about our
accounting policy for income taxes). The following table shows significant
components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2003 and
2002:

The following table shows the current and noncurrent deferred tax assets, net
recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2003 and 2002:

At December 31, 2003, we had $346 million of federal alternative minimum tax
(AMT) credit carryforward, which does not expire. We also had federal and state
net operating loss

F-38


carryforwards of approximately $4.9 billion, pretax, at December 31, 2003,
substantially all of which will not begin to expire until 2022.

In accordance with SFAS 109, deferred tax assets should be reduced by a
valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The future realization of our net
deferred tax assets depends on the availability of sufficient future taxable
income. In making this determination, we considered all available positive and
negative evidence and made certain assumptions. We considered, among other
things, the overall business environment; our historical earnings, including
our significant pretax losses incurred during the last three years; our
industry’s historically cyclical periods of earnings and losses; and our
outlook for future years.

We performed this analysis as of December 31, 2003 and determined that there
was sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not
that our net deferred tax assets will be realized. We will assess the need for
a deferred tax asset valuation allowance on an ongoing basis considering
factors such as those mentioned above as well as other relevant criteria.
Changes in our assumptions may have a material impact on our Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Note 11. Employee Benefit Plans

We sponsor qualified and non-qualified defined
benefit pension plans, defined
contribution pension plans, healthcare plans, and disability and survivorship
plans for eligible employees and
retirees, and their eligible family members. We reserve the right to modify or
terminate these plans as to all participants and beneficiaries at any time,
except as restricted by the Internal Revenue Code or the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act (ERISA).

Our qualified defined benefit pension plans meet or exceed ERISA’s minimum
funding requirements as of December 31, 2003. Our non-qualified plans are
funded primarily with current assets.

We regularly evaluate ways to better manage employee benefits and control
costs. Any changes to the plans or assumptions used to estimate future benefits
could have a significant effect on the amount of the reported obligation and
future annual expense.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

We sponsor both funded and nonfunded noncontributory defined benefit pension
plans that cover substantially all of our employees. The plans generally
provide benefits based on years of service and final average salary. However,
as announced in the December 2002 quarter and effective July 1, 2003, the
existing plan for employees not covered by a collective bargaining agreement
(Non-contract employees) was converted to a cash balance plan with a seven year
transition period. During the transition period, eligible Non-contract
employees receive the greater of the old final average salary benefit or the
new cash balance benefit. Generally, the new cash balance benefit formula
provides for an annual pay credit of 6% of eligible pay plus accrued interest.
Participants in the plan on July 1, 2003, may be eligible for additional pay
credits of 2% or 2.75%, depending on their age and service as of that date.
Non-contract employees hired on or after July 1, 2003 are covered by the cash
balance plan only. Effective July 1, 2010, all covered employees earn the cash
balance benefit only.

We also sponsor medical plans that provide benefits to substantially all Delta
retirees and their eligible dependents. Benefits are funded from our current
assets. Plan benefits are subject to copayments, deductibles and other limits
as described in the plans. Non-contract employees hired on or after July 1, 2003 are not
eligible for company provided postretirement medical coverage, although they
may purchase coverage at full cost.

We use a September 30 measurement date for all our benefit plans. As discussed
above, during the December 2002 quarter, we announced the implementation of and
migration to a cash balance pension plan, as well as changes to eligibility
requirements for postretirement medical coverage for Non-contract employees. As a
result of these changes and the 2002 workforce reductions (see Note 15), we
remeasured a portion of our benefit obligations on October 31, 2002.

During December 2003, we recorded a $212 million non-cash charge on our Consolidated
Statement of Operations related to our pilots’ defined benefit pension plan due
to a significant increase in pilot retirements. We recorded this charge in
accordance with SFAS No. 88, “Employers’ Accounting for Settlements and
Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits”
(SFAS 88). SFAS 88 requires settlement accounting if the cost of all
settlements, including lump sum retirement benefits paid, in a year exceeds the
total of the service and interest cost components of pension expense for the
same period.

The special termination benefits and
curtailment loss (gain) reflected in the table
above relate to the workforce reduction programs offered to certain of our
employees in 2002. See Note 15 for additional information about our 2002
workforce reduction programs.

At December 31, 2003 and 2002, we recorded a non-cash charge to accumulated
other comprehensive loss to recognize a portion of our additional minimum
pension liability in accordance with SFAS No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for
Pensions” (SFAS 87). SFAS 87 requires that this liability be recognized at
year end in an amount equal to the amount by which the accumulated benefit
obligation (ABO) exceeds the fair value of the defined benefit pension plan
assets. The additional minimum pension liability was recorded by recognizing an
intangible asset to the extent of any unrecognized prior service cost
and transition obligation, which
totaled $227 million and $333 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The additional minimum pension liability adjustments totaling
$786 million and $1.6 billion, net of tax, were recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive loss on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2003 and
2002, respectively (see Note 13).

The accumulated benefit obligation for all our defined benefit pension plans
was $11.9 billion and $10.1 billion at September 30, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The following is information about our pension plans with an
accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets (measured at September

Assumptions

We used the following actuarial assumptions to determine our benefit
obligations at September 30, 2003 and 2002 and our net periodic benefit cost
for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, as measured at September
30:

We have implemented a limit on the amount we will pay for
postretirement medical benefits for employees who retire after November 1,
1993. The assumed healthcare cost trend rate is assumed to decline
gradually to 5.25% by 2007 for health plan
costs not subject to this limit and to zero by 2006 for health
plan costs subject to the limit, and remain level thereafter.

(2)

Our 2003 assumptions reflect our October 31, 2002 remeasurement of a
portion of our obligations and represent the weighted average of the
September 30, 2002 and October 31, 2002 assumptions.

The expected long-term rate of return on our plan assets was based on
plan-specific asset/liability investment studies performed by outside
consultants who used historical market return and volatility data with forward looking
estimates based on existing financial market conditions and forecasts. Modest
excess return expectations versus some market indices were incorporated into
the return projections based on the actively managed structure of our
investment program and its record of achieving such returns historically.

F-43


Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts
reported for the other postretirement benefit plans. A 1% change in the
healthcare cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation (APBO) for these plans at September 30, 2003, would have the
following effects:

On December 8, 2003, President Bush signed into law the Medicare Act. The
impact of this law is not reflected in the tables above due to our September 30
measurement date, which was prior to the enactment of this law. In compliance
with FSP 106-1, in 2004, we will make a one-time election to reflect the
estimated impact of the law immediately or to defer recognition until specific
authoritative guidance on accounting for the federal subsidy portion of the law
is issued. In either case, when specific guidance is issued, we could be
required to change previously reported financial information.

Pension Plan Assets

The weighted-average asset allocation for our pension plans at September 30,
2003 and 2002 is as follows :

The investment strategy for pension plan assets is to utilize a diversified mix
of global public and private equity portfolios, public and private fixed income
portfolios, and private real estate and natural resource investments to earn
a long-term investment return that meets or exceeds a 9% annualized return target.
The overall asset mix of the portfolio is more heavily weighted in equity-like
investments, including portions of the bond portfolio which consist of
convertible and high yield securities. Active management strategies are
utilized throughout the program in an effort to realize investment returns in
excess of market indices. Also, option and currency overlay strategies are
used in an effort to generate modest amounts of additional income, and a bond
duration extension program utilizing fixed income derivatives is employed in an
effort to better align the market value movements of a portion of the pension
plan assets to the related pension plan liabilities.

Cash Flows

We expect to contribute approximately $440 million to our qualified defined
benefit pension plans in 2004. Benefit payments relating to our non-qualified
pension plans are expected to be approximately $60 million in 2004 and funded
primarily from current assets.

Our postretirement benefit plans are funded from current assets. We expect to
make benefit payments of $161 million in relation to our postretirement benefit
plans in 2004.

Benefit Payments

Benefit payments are made from both funded benefit plan trusts and from current
assets. Benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as
appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows for the years ending December
31:

These estimates are based on assumptions about future events. Actual benefit
payments may vary significantly from these estimates.

Defined Contribution Pension Plans

Delta Pilots Money Purchase Pension Plan (MPPP)

We contribute 5% of covered pay to the MPPP for each eligible Delta pilot. The
MPPP is related to the Delta Pilots Retirement Plan. The defined benefit
pension payable to a pilot is reduced by the actuarial equivalent of the
accumulated account balance in the MPPP. During the years ended December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001, we recognized expense of $66 million, $71 million and $69
million, respectively, for this plan.

Delta Family-Care Savings Plan

Our Savings Plan includes an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) feature.
Eligible employees may contribute a portion of their covered pay to the Savings
Plan.

F-45


Prior to July 1, 2001, we matched 50% of employee contributions with a maximum
employer contribution of 2% of a participant’s covered pay for all
participants. Effective July 1, 2001, the Savings Plan was amended to provide
all eligible Delta pilots with an employer contribution of 3% of their covered
pay to replace their former matching contribution. We make our contributions
for non-pilots and pilots by allocating Series B ESOP Convertible Preferred
Stock (ESOP Preferred Stock), common stock or cash to the Savings Plan. Our
contributions, which are recorded as salaries and related costs in our
Consolidated Statements of Operations, totaled $81 million, $85 million and $83
million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

When we adopted the ESOP in 1989, we sold 6,944,450 shares of ESOP Preferred
Stock to the Savings Plan for $500 million. We have recorded unearned
compensation equal to the value of the shares of ESOP Preferred Stock not yet
allocated to participants’ accounts. We reduce the unearned compensation as
shares of ESOP Preferred Stock are allocated to participants’ accounts.
Dividends on unallocated shares of ESOP Preferred Stock are used for debt
service on the Savings Plan’s ESOP Notes and are not considered dividends for
financial reporting purposes. Dividends on allocated shares of ESOP Preferred
Stock are credited to participants’ accounts and are considered dividends for
financial reporting purposes. Only allocated shares of ESOP Preferred Stock are
considered outstanding when we compute diluted earnings per share. At December
31, 2003, 3,817,884 shares of ESOP Preferred Stock were allocated to
participants’ accounts, and 2,021,824 shares were held by the ESOP for future
allocations. See Note 12 for information about changes to our ESOP Preferred
Stock dividend and redemption policies.

Other Plans

ASA, Comair and DAL Global Services, Inc., three of our wholly owned
subsidiaries, sponsor defined contribution retirement plans for eligible
employees. These plans did not have a material impact on our Consolidated
Financial Statements in 2003, 2002 and 2001.

Postemployment Benefits

We provide certain other welfare benefits to eligible former or inactive
employees after employment but before retirement, primarily as part of the
disability and survivorship plans.

Postemployment benefit expense (income) was $131 million, $62 million and $(23)
million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. We
include the amount funded in excess of the liability in other noncurrent assets
on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Future period expenses will vary based on
actual claims experience and the return on plan assets. Gains and losses occur
because actual experience differs from assumed experience. These gains and
losses are amortized over the average future service period of employees. We
also amortize differences in prior service costs resulting from amendments
affecting the benefits of retired and inactive employees.

Note 12. Common and Preferred Stock

Stock Option and Other Stock-Based Award Plans

To more closely align the interests of directors, officers and other employees
with the interests of our shareowners, we maintain certain plans which provide
for the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock
options and for other stock-based awards. Stock options awarded under these
plans (1) have an exercise price equal to the fair value of the common stock on
the grant date; (2) become exercisable one to five years after the grant date;
and (3) expire up to 10 years after the grant date. The following table
includes additional information about these plans as of December 31, 2003:

In 1996, shareowners approved broad-based pilot and non-pilot stock
option plans. Under these two plans, we granted eligible employees non-qualified stock options to purchase a total of 49.4 million shares of
common stock in three approximately equal installments on October 30,
1996, 1997 and 1998.

(2)

On October 25, 2000, shareowners approved this plan, which authorizes
the grant of stock options and a limited number of other stock awards. The
plan amends and restates a prior plan which was also approved by
shareowners. No awards have been, or will be, granted under the prior plan
on or after October 25, 2000. At December 31, 2003, there were 3.6 million
shares of common stock reserved for awards (primarily non-qualified stock
options) that were outstanding under the prior plan. The current plan
provides that shares reserved for awards under the plans that are
forfeited, settled in cash rather than stock or withheld, plus shares
tendered to us in connection with such awards, may be added back to the
shares available for future grants. At December 31, 2003, 14.4 million
shares had been added back pursuant to that provision, including 11.0
million shares canceled under the stock option exchange program discussed
below.

(3)

On October 22, 1998, the Board of Directors approved this plan under
which each non-employee director may receive an annual grant of
non-qualified stock options. This plan provides that shares reserved for
awards that are forfeited may be added back to the shares available for
future grants.

(4)

In 1995, shareowners approved this plan, which provides that a portion of
each non-employee director’s compensation for serving as a director will
be paid in shares of common stock. It also permits non-employee directors
to elect to receive all or a portion of their cash compensation for
service as a director in shares of common stock at current market prices.

On May 28, 2003, we commenced, with shareowner approval, a stock option
exchange program (Exchange Program) for eligible employees in our broad-based
stock option plans and the Delta 2000 Performance Compensation Plan.
Approximately 45,000 eligible employees were offered the opportunity to
exchange their outstanding stock options with an exercise price of $25 per
share or more for a designated fewer number of replacement options with an
exercise price equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the grant
date of the replacement options. In accordance with the terms of the Exchange
Program, we canceled approximately 32 million outstanding stock options on June
25, 2003 and issued, in exchange for the canceled options, approximately 12
million replacement options on December 26, 2003. The exercise price of the
replacement options is $11.60, the closing price of our common stock on the
grant date. Members of our Board of Directors, including our Chief Executive
Officer, were not eligible to participate in the Exchange Program.

Payment of Dividends

The determination to pay cash dividends on our ESOP Preferred Stock and our
common stock is at the discretion of our Board of Directors, and is also
subject to the provisions of Delaware General Corporation Law (Delaware Law).
Delaware law provides that a company may pay dividends on its stock only (1)
out of its “surplus”, which is generally defined as the excess of the company’s
net assets over the aggregate par value of its issued stock, or (2) from its
net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is paid or from its net
profits for the preceding fiscal year.

In July 2003, our Board of Directors discontinued the payment of quarterly cash
dividends on our common stock due to the financial challenges facing Delta. We
had previously paid a quarterly dividend of $0.025 per common share.

Effective December 2003, our Board of Directors suspended indefinitely the
payment of dividends on our ESOP Preferred Stock to comply with Delaware law.
At December 31, 2003, we had a negative “surplus” (as defined above) and we did
not have net profits in either of the years ended December 31, 2003 or 2002.
The terms of the ESOP Preferred Stock discussed

F-48


below provide for cumulative
dividends on that stock and prohibit the payment of dividends on our common
stock until all cumulative dividends on the ESOP Preferred Stock have been paid.
Unpaid dividends on the ESOP Preferred Stock will accrue without interest,
until paid, at a rate of $4.32 per share per year. At December 31, 2003,
accumulated but unpaid dividends on the ESOP Preferred Stock totaled $13
million and are recorded in accounts payable, deferred credits and other
accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

ESOP Preferred Stock

Each outstanding share of ESOP Preferred Stock bears a cumulative cash dividend
of 6% per year of its stated value of $72.00; is convertible into 1.7155 shares
of common stock, which is equivalent to a conversion price of $41.97 per share;
and has a liquidation preference of $72.00, plus accrued and unpaid dividends.
The ESOP Preferred Stock generally votes together as a single class with the
common stock and has two votes per share. The conversion rate, conversion price
and voting rights of the ESOP Preferred Stock are subject to adjustment in
certain circumstances.

All shares of ESOP Preferred Stock are held of record by the trustee of the
Delta Family-Care Savings Plan (see Note 11). At December 31, 2003, 10,018,019
shares of common stock were reserved for issuance for the conversion of the
ESOP Preferred Stock.

We are generally required to redeem shares of ESOP Preferred Stock (1) to
provide for distributions of the accounts of Savings Plan participants who
terminate employment with us and request a distribution and (2) to implement
annual diversification elections by Savings Plan participants who are at least
age 55 and have participated in the Savings Plan for at least 10 years. In
these circumstances, shares of ESOP Preferred Stock are redeemable at a price
equal to the greater of (1) $72.00 per share or (2) the fair value of the
shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the ESOP Preferred Stock to
be redeemed, plus, in either case, accrued and unpaid dividends on such shares
of ESOP Preferred Stock (Redemption Price). Under the terms of the ESOP
Preferred Stock, we may pay the Redemption Price in cash, shares of common
stock (valued at fair market value), or in a combination thereof.

Delaware law, however, prohibits a company from redeeming or purchasing its
stock for cash or other property, unless the company has sufficient “surplus”.
As discussed above, at December 31, 2003, we had a negative “surplus”.
Accordingly, effective December 2003, our Board of Directors changed the form
of payment we use to redeem shares of the ESOP Preferred Stock when redemptions
are required under our Delta Family-Care Savings Plan. For the indefinite
future, we will pay the Redemption Price in shares of our common stock rather
than in cash.

Shareowner Rights Plan

The Shareowner Rights Plan is designed to protect shareowners against attempts
to acquire Delta that do not offer an adequate purchase price to all
shareowners, or are otherwise not in the best interest of Delta and our
shareowners. Under the plan, each outstanding share of common stock is
accompanied by one-half of a preferred stock purchase right. Each whole right
entitles the holder to purchase 1/100 of a share of Series D Junior
Participating Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $300, subject to
adjustment.

F-49


The rights become exercisable only after a person acquires, or makes a tender
or exchange offer that would result in the person acquiring, beneficial
ownership of 15% or more of our common stock. If a person acquires beneficial
ownership of 15% or more of our common stock, each right will entitle its
holder (other than the acquiring person) to exercise his rights to purchase our
common stock having a market value of twice the exercise price.

If a person acquires beneficial interest of 15% or more of our common stock and
(1) we are involved in a merger or other business combination in which we are
not the surviving corporation, or (2) we sell more than 50% of our assets or
earning power, then each right will entitle its holder (other than the
acquiring person) to exercise their rights to purchase common stock of the
acquiring company having a market value of twice the exercise price.

The rights expire on November 4, 2006. We may redeem the rights for $0.01 per
right at any time before a person becomes the beneficial owner of 15% or more
of our common stock. We may amend the rights in any respect so long as the
rights are redeemable. At December 31, 2003, 2,250,000 shares of preferred
stock were reserved for issuance under the Shareowner Rights Plan.

Note 13. Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss) includes (1) reported net income (loss); (2) the
additional minimum pension liability; (3) effective unrealized gains and losses
on fuel derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting; and (4)
unrealized gains and losses on marketable equity securities. The following

The following table shows the components of accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) at December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, and the activity for the
years then ended:

We estimate that effective gains of $34 million, net of tax, will be realized
during 2004 as (1) fuel hedge contracts settle and (2) the related aircraft
fuel purchases being hedged are consumed and recognized in expense. See Note 4
for additional information regarding our fuel hedge contracts. See Note 22 for
information regarding the early settlement of our fuel hedge contracts.

See Note 11 for additional information related to our additional minimum
pension liability.

Note 14. Geographic Information

SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information” (SFAS 131), requires us to disclose certain information about our
operating segments. Operating segments are defined as components of an
enterprise with separate financial information which is

F-51


evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision-maker and is used in
resource allocation and performance assessments.

We are managed as a single business unit that provides air transportation for
passengers and cargo. This allows us to benefit from an integrated revenue
pricing and route network that includes Delta-Mainline (including Song), ASA
and Comair. The flight equipment of all three carriers is combined to form one
fleet which is deployed through a single route scheduling system. When making
resource allocation decisions, our chief operating decision maker evaluates
flight profitability data, which considers aircraft type and route economics,
but gives no weight to the financial impact of the resource allocation decision
on an individual carrier basis. Our objective in making resource allocation
decisions is to maximize our consolidated financial results, not the individual
results of Delta-Mainline (including Song), ASA and Comair.

Operating revenues are assigned to a specific geographic region based on the
origin, flight path and destination of each flight segment. Our operating
revenues by geographic region for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and
2001 are summarized in the following table:

geographic regions.

Note 15. Restructuring, Asset Writedowns, Pension Settlements and Related
Items, Net


In 2003, we recorded net charges totaling $268 million ($169 million net of
tax, or $1.37 diluted earnings per share) in restructuring, asset writedowns,
pension settlements and related items, net on our Consolidated Statement of
Operations, as follows:

F-52


We recorded a $41 million charge as a result of a definitive agreement to
sell 11 B-737-800 aircraft to a third party immediately after those aircraft
are delivered to us by the manufacturer in 2005 (see Note 9).

•

Other

We recorded a $28 million reduction to operating expenses based primarily on
revised estimates of remaining costs associated with prior year
restructuring reserves (see Note 16).


In 2002, we recorded net charges totaling $439 million ($277 million net of
tax, or $2.25 diluted earnings per share) in restructuring, asset writedowns,
pension settlements and related items, net on our Consolidated Statement of
Operations, as follows:

F-53


to our decision to return these aircraft to service, we reversed the
remaining $56 million reserve related to these B-737-300 aircraft.

During the December 2002 quarter, we entered into an agreement with Boeing
to defer 31 mainline aircraft previously scheduled for delivery in 2003 and
2004. As a result of these deferrals, we had no mainline aircraft deliveries
in 2003 and have none scheduled for 2004. We incurred a $30 million charge
related to these deferrals.

During the December 2002 quarter, we decided to accelerate the retirement of
37 owned EMB-120 aircraft to achieve costs savings and operating
efficiencies. We removed these aircraft from service during 2003. The
accelerated retirement of these aircraft as well as a reduction in their
estimated future cash flows and fair values resulted in an impairment
charge.

During 2002, we recorded the following impairment charges for our owned
B-727, MD-11 and EMB-120 aircraft:

items (see Note 16).


In 2001, we recorded charges totaling $1.1 billion ($695 million net of tax, or

Note 16. Restructuring and Other Reserves

The following table shows changes in our restructuring and other reserve
balances as of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, and the associated activity
for the years then ended:

The leased aircraft reserve represented future lease payments under operating
leases for nine B-737-300 aircraft previously removed from service prior to the
lease expiration date, less estimated sublease income. Due to changes in our
fleet plan during the December 2002 quarter, we (1) reversed the remaining $56
million balance of this reserve and (2) returned these aircraft to service in
2003.

At December 31, 2003, the facilities and other reserve represents costs related
primarily to (1) future lease payments for facilities closures and (2) contract
termination fees. During 2003, we recorded a $9 million adjustment to prior
year reserves based on revised estimates of remaining costs primarily due to
changes in certain facility lease terms. During 2002, we recorded a $14 million
adjustment to prior year reserves based on revised estimates of remaining
costs.

The severance and related costs reserve represents future payments associated
with our 2002 and 2001 voluntary and involuntary workforce reduction programs.
At December 31, 2003, the remaining $5 million balance related to the 2002
workforce reduction programs represents severance and medical benefits for
employees who received severance or are participating in certain leave of
absence programs. Approximately half of the remaining balance is for
international employees that will be paid in accordance with local country laws
and regulations. At December 31, 2003, the remaining $1 million balance related to the 2001
workforce reduction

F-57


programs primarily consists of severance for international
employees that will be paid in accordance with local country laws and
regulations. During 2003, we recorded a $21 million adjustment to prior year
reserves based upon revised estimates of remaining costs primarily due to fewer
employee reductions under our 2002 involuntary workforce reduction program than
originally anticipated because of higher than expected reductions from
attrition and retirements.

During 2002, we recorded a $9 million adjustment to the 2001 severance and
related costs reserve based on revised estimates of the remaining costs,
including (1) the adjustment of medical benefits for certain employees
participating in the leave of absence programs who returned to the workforce
earlier than originally scheduled and (2) the change in the number of pilot
furloughs from up to 1,400 to approximately 1,100.

See Note 15 for additional information related to the charges discussed above.

Note 17. Equity Investments

WORLDSPAN, L.P. (Worldspan)

On June 30, 2003, we sold our 40% equity investment in Worldspan, which
operates and markets a computer reservation system for the travel industry. In
exchange for the sale of our equity interest, we received (1) $285 million in
cash and (2) a $45 million subordinated promissory note, which bears interest
at 10% per annum and matures in 2012. As a result of this transaction, we
recorded a gain of $279 million ($176 million net of tax) in other income
(expense) on our 2003 Consolidated Statement of Operations. In addition, we
will receive credits totaling approximately $125 million, which will be
recognized ratably as a reduction of costs through 2012, for future
Worldspan-provided services. At December 31, 2003, the carrying and fair value
of the subordinated promissory note was $38 million, which reflects a writedown
resulting from a decrease in its fair value. This note is classified as a
trading security under SFAS 115 (see Note 1).

Our equity earnings from this investment totaled $18 million, $43 million and
$19 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
We also received cash dividends from Worldspan of $44 million, $40 million and
$70 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001,
respectively. At December 31, 2002, our Worldspan investment of $57 million was
recorded in investments in associated companies on our Consolidated Balance
Sheet.

Worldspan provides computer reservation and related services for us, which
totaled approximately $90 million for the six-months ended June 30, 2003 and
approximately $180 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. As discussed
above, we sold our equity interest in Worldspan on June 30, 2003.

Orbitz, Inc. (Orbitz)

Prior to December 2003, we had an 18% ownership and voting interest in Orbitz,
which we accounted for under the equity method. We used the equity method
because we had the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control,
over the financial and operating policies of Orbitz. This influence was
evidenced by, among other things, our right to appoint two of our senior

F-58


officers to the 11 member Board of Managers of Orbitz, which enabled us to
participate in Orbitz’s financial and operating decisions.

During December 2003, Orbitz completed its initial public offering and the
founding airlines of Orbitz, including us, sold a portion of their Orbitz
shares. We received $33 million in cash from our sale of Orbitz shares.
Additionally, we recorded (1) a SAB 51 gain of $18 million, net of tax, in
additional paid-in capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheet (see Note 1 for
our SAB 51 accounting policy); (2) a $28 million gain ($17 million net of tax)
in other income (expense) on our Consolidated Statement of Operations resulting
from our sale of Orbitz shares; and (3) a $4 million loss ($2 million net of
tax) in other income (expense) on our Consolidated Statement of Operations
resulting from previously unrecognized Orbitz losses since our recorded
investment in Orbitz was zero prior to its initial public offering.

Upon completion of the transactions discussed above, we have a 13% ownership
interest in Orbitz and an 18% voting interest. We continue to account for this
investment under the equity method due to, among other things, our continuing
18% voting interest and our right to appoint one of our senior officers to the
nine member Board of Directors of Orbitz, which enables us to exercise
significant influence over Orbitz’s financial and operating decisions. At
December 31, 2003, our investment in Orbitz was $21 million and is recorded in
investments in associated companies on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. At
December 31, 2002, our investment balance was zero since our equity investment
had been reduced to zero as a result of our share of Orbitz’s net losses.

Note 18. Earnings (Loss) per Share

We calculate basic earnings (loss) per share by dividing the net income (loss)
available to common shareowners by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding. Diluted earnings (loss) per share includes the dilutive effects of
stock options and convertible securities. To the extent stock options and
convertible securities are anti-dilutive, they are excluded from the
calculation of diluted earnings (loss) per share. The following table shows our
computation of basic and diluted loss per share:

Years Ended December 31,

For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, we excluded from the
diluted loss per share computation (1) 37.3 million, 54.5 million and 44.3
million stock options, respectively, because the exercise price of the options
was greater than the average price of our common stock; (2) 7.3 million, 6.9
million and 6.5 million additional shares that may be issued in certain
circumstances, respectively, because their effect on loss per share was
anti-dilutive; and (3) the

F-59


shares issuable upon conversion of our 8.00% Notes due 2023 since the
contingent conditions for conversion have not been met (see Note 6).

Note 19. Government Compensation and Reimbursements

Appropriations Act Reimbursements

On April 16, 2003, President Bush signed into law the Emergency Wartime
Supplemental Appropriations Act (Appropriations Act), which provides for, among
other things:

During 2003, we received payments under the Appropriations Act totaling (1)
$398 million as reimbursement for passenger and air carrier security fees,
which was recorded as a reduction of operating expenses in our 2003
Consolidated Statement of Operations and (2) $13 million related to the
strengthening of flight deck doors, which was recorded as a reduction to
previously capitalized costs.

Stabilization Act Compensation

On September 22, 2001, the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization
Act (Stabilization Act) became effective. The Stabilization Act was intended
to preserve the viability of the U.S. air transportation system following the
terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 by, among other things, (1) providing
for payments from the U.S. Government totaling $5 billion to compensate U.S.
air carriers for losses incurred from September 11, 2001 through December 31,

F-60


2001 as a
result of the September 11 terrorist attacks and (2) permitting the Secretary
of Transportation to sell insurance to U.S. air carriers.

Our allocated portion of compensation under the Stabilization Act was $668
million. Due to uncertainties regarding the U.S. government’s calculation of
compensation, we recognized $634 million of this amount in our 2001
Consolidated Statement of Operations. We recognized the remaining $34 million
of compensation in our 2002 Consolidated Statement of Operations. We received
$112 million and $556 million in cash for the years ended December 31, 2002 and
2001, respectively, under the Stabilization Act.

Subsequent to September 11, 2001, aviation insurers significantly reduced the
maximum amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for
liability to persons (other than employees or passengers) for claims resulting
from acts of terrorism, war or similar events. At the same time, aviation
insurers significantly increased the premiums for such coverage and for
aviation insurance in general. Under the Stabilization Act, the U.S. government
is providing U.S. airlines with war-risk insurance to cover losses to
passengers, third parties (ground damage) and the aircraft hull. This coverage
extends through August 2004, with a possible extension to December 31, 2004 at
the discretion of the Secretary of Transportation, but the coverage may not be
extended beyond that time. We expect that if the U.S. government fails to renew
the war-risk insurance that it provides, we will be required to replace such
coverage commercially or consider other alternatives. There can be no assurance
that such commercially provided war-risk insurance coverage will be adequate to
protect our risk of loss from future acts of terrorism or will be provided on
terms that will not have a material adverse impact on our Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Note 20. Related Party Transaction

The Delta Employees Credit Union (DECU) is an independent entity that is
chartered to provide banking and financial services to our employees, former
employees and certain relatives of these persons. At December 31, 2002, we had
a $71 million liability to DECU recorded in accounts payable, deferred credits
and other accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The liability
resulted from a timing difference in funding a portion of our 2002 year end
payroll and is reflected as a non-cash transaction on our 2002 Consolidated
Statement of Cash Flows. We paid the liability on January 2, 2003.

F-61


Note 21. Valuation and Qualifying Accounts

The following table shows our valuation and qualifying accounts as of December
31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, and the associated activity for the years then ended:

(1)

See Note 16 for additional information related to leased aircraft and
restructuring and other charges.

(2)

The payments and deductions related to the allowance for uncollectible
accounts receivable represent the write-off of
accounts considered to be uncollectible, less recoveries.

(3)

These additional costs and expenses in 2001 and 2002 include the charges
related to the writedown of certain aircraft
spare parts inventory to their net realizable value (see Note 15).

Note 22. Subsequent Events

Convertible Senior Notes (2-7/8% Notes)

In February 2004, we issued $325 million principal amount of 2-7/8% Notes due
2024. Holders may convert their 2-7/8% Notes into shares of our common stock
at a conversion rate of 73.6106 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal
amount of 2-7/8% Notes, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, which
is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $13.59 per share of common
stock, if:

•

during any calendar quarter after March 31, 2004, the last reported
sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days during the
period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of
the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to
130% of the conversion price per share of our common stock;

•

the trading price of the 2-7/8% Notes falls below a specified threshold;

•

we call the 2-7/8% Notes for redemption; or

•

specified corporate transactions occur.

F-62


We may redeem all or some of the 2-7/8% Notes for cash at any time after
February 21, 2009, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the
2-7/8% Notes to be redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid interest.

Holders may require us to repurchase their 2-7/8% Notes for cash on February
18, 2009, 2014 and 2019, or in other specified circumstances involving the
exchange, conversion or acquisition of all or substantially all of our common
stock, at a purchase price equal to the principal amount of the 2-7/8% Notes to
be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest. At February 27, 2003,
23,923,445 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance for the conversion
of the 2-7/8% Notes.

Aircraft Acquisition

On February 27, 2004, we entered
into an agreement to purchase 32 CRJ-200 aircraft to
be delivered in 2005. In conjunction with this agreement, we entered into a
facility with a third party to finance, on a secured basis at the time of
acquisition, the future deliveries of these regional jet aircraft. Borrowings
under this facility (1) will be due in installments for 15 years after the date
of borrowing and (2) bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin.

Other Financing Arrangements

In January 2004, we entered into financing arrangements under which we borrowed
a total of $208 million. These borrowings are due in installments through
February 2020; are secured by six CRJ-200 and seven CRJ-700 aircraft; and bear
interest at LIBOR plus a margin. A portion of the proceeds from these
borrowings was used to repay $151 million of outstanding interim financing for
six CRJ-200 and three CRJ-700 aircraft.

Fuel Contract Settlements

In February 2004, we settled all of our fuel hedge contracts prior to their
scheduled settlement dates. As a result of these transactions, we received $83
million in cash, which represented the fair value of these contracts
at the date of settlement. In accordance with SFAS 133, effective gains of
$82 million
will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the related fuel
purchases, which were being hedged, are consumed and recognized in expense during
2004. These gains will then be recorded as a reduction in fuel expense on our
Consolidated Statements of Operations. The ineffective portion of the hedges
and the time value component of these contracts totaling
$17 million will be recognized in the March 2004 quarter as a fair value adjustment
of SFAS 133 derivatives in other income (expense) on our Consolidated
Statements of Operations. See Note 4 and 13 for additional information about
our fuel hedge contracts.
