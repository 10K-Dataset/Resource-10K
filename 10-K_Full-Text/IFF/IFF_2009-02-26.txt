PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS.

International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., incorporated
    in New York in 1909, and its subsidiaries (the
    “Registrant”, “IFF”, “we”,
    “us”, and “our”), is a leading creator and
    manufacturer of flavor and fragrance products used by other
    manufacturers to impart or improve flavor or fragrance in a wide
    variety of consumer products. Fragrance products are sold
    principally to manufacturers of perfumes, cosmetics, personal
    care products, hair care products, deodorants, soaps,
    detergents, fabric care and air care products; our flavor
    products are sold principally to manufacturers of prepared
    foods, beverages, pharmaceuticals, dairy and confectionery
    products as well as the food service industry.

We currently have 31 manufacturing facilities with the major
    manufacturing facilities located in the United States, Great
    Britain, Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain, Argentina, Brazil,
    Mexico, Australia, China, India, Indonesia, Japan and Singapore.
    The remaining manufacturing facilities are located in 8 other
    countries. We maintain our own sales and distribution facilities
    in 31 countries and are represented by sales agents and
    distributors in other countries. Our principal executive offices
    are located at 521 West 57th Street, New York, New
    York 10019

(212-765-5500).

MARKETS

Our flavor products are sold principally to the food and
    beverage industries for use in consumer products such as soft
    drinks, candies, baked goods, desserts, prepared foods, dietary
    foods, dairy products, drink powders, pharmaceuticals, snack
    foods and alcoholic beverages. Two of our largest customers for
    flavor products are major producers of prepared foods and
    beverages in the United States. In the three years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, sales of flavor products
    accounted for 46%, 44% and 43%, respectively, of our total sales.

Our fragrance products are used by customers in the manufacture
    of various consumer goods in the home and personal care markets.
    The home market consists of laundry detergents, fabric care,
    candles, air fresheners and all-purpose cleaners. The personal
    care market consists of perfumes, colognes, after-shave lotions,
    skin care, lipsticks, deodorants and hair preparations. Most of
    the major global and regional manufacturers in each of these
    categories are our customers. Five of the largest global
    companies are among our principal customers. In the three years
    ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, sales of fragrance
    products accounted for 54%, 56% and 57%, respectively, of our
    total sales.

See Note 12, Segment Information, for information
    concerning the two business segments, Flavors and Fragrances,
    and our geographic regions, which is incorporated by reference.

PRODUCTS

Our principal fragrance and flavor products consist of compounds
    of large numbers of ingredients blended in proprietary formulas
    created by our perfumers and flavorists. Most of these compounds
    contribute the total fragrance or flavor to the consumer
    products in which they are used. This fragrance or flavor
    characteristic is often a major factor in the consumer selection
    and acceptance of the consumer end product. A smaller number of
    compounds are sold to manufacturers who further blend them to
    achieve the finished fragrance or flavor in their products. We
    produce thousands of compounds, and new compounds are constantly
    being created in order to meet the many and changing
    characteristics of our customers’ end products. Most of the
    fragrance and flavor compounds are created and produced for the
    exclusive use of particular customers. Our products are sold in
    powder and liquid forms and in amounts ranging from a few pounds
    to many tons, depending upon the nature of the product.

The ingredients that we use in our compounds are both synthetic
    and natural. We manufacture a substantial portion of the
    synthetic ingredients. While a majority of our synthetic
    ingredients production is used in our compounds, a substantial
    portion is also sold to others. Natural ingredients are derived
    from flowers, fruits and other botanical products as well as
    from animal products. They contain varying numbers of organic
    chemicals, which are responsible for the fragrance or flavor of
    the natural product. The natural products are purchased in
    processed or semi-processed form. Some are used in compounds in
    the state in which they are purchased and others after further
    processing. Natural products, together with various chemicals,
    are also used as raw materials for the manufacture of



synthetic ingredients by chemical processes. Our flavor products
    also include extracts and seasonings derived from various
    fruits, vegetables, nuts, herbs and spices as well as
    microbiologically-derived ingredients.

MARKET
    DEVELOPMENTS

The demand for consumer products utilizing flavors and
    fragrances has been stimulated and broadened by changing social
    habits resulting from various factors such as increases in
    personal income, dual-earner households, teenage population,
    leisure time, urbanization, health and wellness concerns,
    including increased demand for nature based products and by the
    continued growth of emerging markets. In the fragrance field,
    these developments have expanded the market for hair care,
    candles and air care products and deodorant and personal wash
    products with finer fragrance quality, as well as the market for
    colognes, toilet waters, men’s toiletries and other
    products beyond traditional luxury items such as perfumes. In
    the flavor field, similar market characteristics have stimulated
    the demand for products such as convenience foods, soft drinks
    and low-fat and organic food products that must conform to
    expected tastes. New and improved methods of packaging, applying
    and dispensing have been developed for many consumer products
    that utilize some of our flavor or fragrance products. These
    developments have called for the creation of new compounds and
    ingredients compatible with the newly introduced materials and
    methods of application.

PRODUCT
    DEVELOPMENT AND RESEARCH

The development of new flavors and fragrances is a complex
    technical and artistic process calling upon the combined
    knowledge and skill of our creative perfumers and flavorists,
    and our scientists. With extensive experience, the perfumers and
    flavorists continuously advance their skills for creating
    fragrances or flavors best suited to the market requirements of
    the customers’ products.

Scientists from various disciplines work in project teams with
    the perfumers and flavorists to develop flavor and fragrance
    products with consumer preferred performance characteristics.
    Scientific expertise includes: natural products research, plant
    science, organic chemistry, analytical chemistry, biochemistry,
    microbiology, process engineering, food science, material
    science and sensory science. Analytical and sensory science is
    applied to understand the complex interactions of the many
    ingredients in a consumer product in order to optimize the
    flavor or fragrance performance at all points of use. Material
    science technology is applied to create controlled release and
    delivery systems to enhance flavor and fragrance performance in
    consumer products. An important contribution to the creation of
    new flavors and fragrances is the discovery and development of
    new ingredients having improved fragrance or flavor value. The
    ingredients research program discovers molecules found in
    natural substances and creates new molecules that are
    subsequently tested for their fragrance or flavor value. The new
    molecules that meet rigorous requirements for commercial
    development are subsequently transferred to manufacturing
    operations for production.

Creative and technical product development is conducted in 32
    fragrance and flavor laboratories in 24 countries. We maintain a
    research and development center at Union Beach, New Jersey. We
    spent $213 million in 2008, $199 million in 2007 and
    $186 million in 2006 on our research and development
    activities or about 9% of our revenues each year. We expect
    these expenditures to remain at approximately 9% of our revenues
    in 2009. Of the amount expended in 2008 on such activities, 64%
    was for fragrances and the balance was for flavors. We employed
    1,146 persons in 2008 and 1,132 persons in 2007 in
    such activities.

Our business is not materially dependent upon any patents,
    trademarks or licenses.

DISTRIBUTION

Distribution for both the flavors and fragrances business units
    is similar in that most of our sales are through our own sales
    force. The flavors business operates from two sales offices in
    the United States and 37 sales offices in 29 foreign countries,
    while the fragrances business operates from two sales offices in
    the United States and 35 sales offices in 28 foreign countries.
    Sales in additional countries are made through agents and
    distributors. For the year ended December 31, 2008, 38% of
    our sales were to customers in Europe, Africa and Middle East
    (“EAME”), 25% in North America, 23% in Greater Asia
    and 14% in Latin America.



During 2008, our 30 largest customers accounted for 56% of our
    sales. Sales to one customer accounted for 11% of our sales in
    2008 and 2007. These sales were largely in the fragrance
    business unit. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of
    our sales in 2006.

GOVERNMENTAL
    REGULATION

The manufacture and sale of our products are subject to
    regulation in the United States by the Food and Drug
    Administration, the Agriculture Department, the Bureau of
    Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the Environmental Protection
    Agency, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the
    Drug Enforcement Administration and state authorities. Foreign
    subsidiaries are subject to similar regulation in a number of
    countries. In particular, the European Union will require
    extensive chemical registration and testing over the next
    10 years. Compliance with existing governmental
    requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the
    environment has not materially affected our operations, earnings
    or competitive position. In 2009, we expect to spend
    approximately $5 — 7 million on capital projects
    and approximately $20 million in operating expenses and
    governmental charges for the purpose of complying with such
    requirements.

RAW
    MATERIAL PURCHASES

We purchase roughly 10,000 different raw materials from many
    sources all over the world. The principal natural raw materials
    consist of essential oils, extracts and concentrates derived
    from fruits, vegetables, flowers, woods and other botanicals,
    animal products and raw fruits. The principal synthetic raw
    material purchases consist of organic chemicals. We believe that
    alternate materials or alternate sources of materials are
    available to enable us to maintain our competitive position in
    the event of any interruption in the supply of raw materials
    from present sources.

COMPETITION

We have more than 50 competitors in the world markets. IFF is
    one of the top four companies, which together represent 70% of
    the flavors and fragrances industry. While no single factor is
    responsible, our competitive position is based principally on
    the creative skills of our perfumers and flavorists, the
    technological advances resulting from our research and
    development activities, the quality of our customer service, the
    support provided by our marketing and application groups, and
    our understanding of consumers. We believe that we are one of
    the largest companies producing and marketing, on an
    international basis, a wide range of fragrance and flavor
    products for sale to manufacturers of consumer products. In
    particular countries and localities, we face competition from
    numerous companies specializing in certain product lines, among
    which are some companies larger than us and some more important
    in a particular product line or lines. Most of our customers do
    not buy all of their fragrance or flavor products from the same
    supplier, and some customers make their own fragrance or flavor
    compounds with ingredients supplied by us or others.

EMPLOYEE
    RELATIONS

At December 31, 2008, we employed approximately
    5,300 persons, of whom approximately 1,400 were employed in
    the United States. We have not experienced a work stoppage or
    strike and consider our employee relations to be satisfactory.

ITEM 1A.  RISK
    FACTORS.

The following are some important factors that could cause the
    Company’s actual results to differ materially from those
    referred to or implied in any forward-looking statement. These
    are in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed
    elsewhere in this Annual Report of

Form 10-K

and in the Company’s other filings with the Securities and
    Exchange Commission.

The
    current volatility in global economic conditions and the
    financial markets may adversely affect our industry, business
    and results of operations.

The volatility and disruption to the capital and credit markets
    since mid-2008 has rapidly impacted global economic conditions,
    resulting in significant recessionary pressures and declines in
    consumer confidence and economic growth. These conditions have
    led to economic contractions in the developed economies and
    reduced growth rates in the emerging markets. Despite fiscal and
    monetary intervention, it is possible that further declines in
    consumer spending and global growth rates may occur in the
    foreseeable future. Reduced consumer spending may cause changes
    in customer order patterns including order cancellations, and
    changes in the level of inventory at our customers, which may
    adversely affect our industry, business and results of
    operations. The impact of the credit crisis and economic
    slowdown will vary by region and country. The diversity of our
    geographic customer and operating footprint limits our reliance
    and exposure to any single economy.

These conditions have also resulted in a substantial tightening
    of the credit markets, including lending by financial
    institutions and in the commercial paper market, both of which
    are sources of credit for our borrowing and liquidity. This
    tightening of the credit markets has increased the cost of
    capital and reduced the availability of credit. Based on our
    latest discussions, we believe that the financial institutions
    syndicated under our revolving credit facility are able to
    fulfill their commitments as of our filing date. It is difficult
    to predict how long the current economic and capital and credit
    market conditions will continue, whether they will continue to
    deteriorate and which aspects of our products or business could
    be adversely affected. However, if current levels of economic
    and capital and credit market disruption and volatility continue
    or worsen, there can be no assurance that we will not experience
    an adverse impact, which may be material, on our business, the
    cost of and access to capital and credit markets, and our
    results of operations. In addition, we monitor the financial
    condition of our customers on a regular basis based on public
    information or data provided directly to us. If the financial
    condition of one of our major customers was negatively impacted
    by market conditions or liquidity, we could be adversely
    impacted in terms of accounts receivable

and/or

inventory specifically attributable to them.

Failure
    to maintain the integrity of our raw materials, supply chain and
    finished goods may adversely impact sales and our results of
    operations.

The manufacture and sale of our products are subject to various
    regulatory requirements in each of the countries in which our
    products are manufactured and sold. In addition, we are subject
    to product safety and compliance requirements established by the
    industry or similar oversight bodies. We use a variety of
    strategies, methodologies and tools to identify current products
    standards, assess relative risks in our supply chain that can
    impact product integrity, monitor internal and external
    performance, test raw materials and finished goods to minimize
    the likelihood of product non-compliance. If a non-compliance
    event went undetected, we could be subject to customer claims,
    penalties, litigation costs

and/or

settlements, remediation costs or loss of sales.

Competitive
    factors may negatively impact our sales and
    marketability.

The market for flavors and fragrances is fragmented and highly
    competitive. IFF competes with many companies and some of our
    competitors specialize in one or more of our product segments
    while others participate



in many of the same segments. In addition, some of our
    competitors may have greater financial and technical resources.
    Increased competition by existing or future competitors,
    including aggressive price competition, could result in the need
    for us to reduce prices or increase spending and this could have
    an impact on sales and profitability.

We are
    subject to economic and social changes which may impact
    sales.

Demand for consumer products using flavors and fragrances has
    been stimulated and broadened by changing social habits
    resulting from factors such as increases in personal income,
    dual-earner households, teenage population, leisure time, health
    concerns and urbanization and by the continued growth in world
    population. Changes in any number of external economic factors,
    or changes in social or consumer preferences, could adversely
    impact our results of operations. Approximately 60% of our sales
    occur in the developed markets of North America, Western Europe
    and Australasia with the remainder in emerging markets.
    Accordingly, the impact on our operations will depend upon
    consumer spending on products for which we supply the flavor or
    fragrance in these global markets.

Results
    may be negatively impacted by the price, quality and
    availability of raw materials.

Raw materials are purchased from many sources from all over the
    world, including essential oils, extracts and concentrates
    derived from fruits, vegetables, flowers, woods and other
    botanicals, animal products, raw fruits and organic chemicals.
    Disruptions in the supply or quality of ingredients or rising
    prices for ingredients purchased could adversely impact our
    results of operations and profitability. Historically, we have
    experienced the greatest amount of volatility in natural
    products that represent approximately 50% of raw material
    purchases. Availability and pricing of these products can be
    impacted by crop size and quality, demand balance or alternative
    land use. To mitigate our sourcing risk, we maintain strategic
    stock levels covering multiple periods for critical items

and/or

time
    purchases to capitalize on favorable market conditions.

Results
    may be negatively impacted by the inability to implement our
    business strategy, including the achievement of anticipated cost
    savings, profitability or growth targets.

We are committed to those particular business strategies and
    market segments that have been identified as likely to drive
    profitable future growth and improve operations and customer
    service. If we are unable to successfully and timely implement
    these strategies, it would adversely impact our financial
    condition and results of operations.

Results
    may be negatively affected by the impact of currency fluctuation
    or devaluation in principal foreign markets and the
    effectiveness of hedging and risk management
    strategies.

Our operations are conducted in many countries, the results of
    which are reported in the local currency and then translated
    into U.S. dollars at applicable exchange rates. The
    exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. dollar
    have fluctuated and may continue to do so in the future. We
    employ a variety of techniques to reduce the impact of exchange
    rate fluctuations, including sourcing strategies and a limited
    number of foreign currency hedging activities. However,
    volatility in currency exchange rates may adversely impact our
    reported results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.

Results
    may be negatively impacted by the outcome of uncertainties
    related to litigation.

We are involved in a number of legal claims. While we believe
    that related insurance coverage is adequate with respect to such
    claims, we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of such
    litigation. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that future
    events will not require an increase in the amount accrued for
    any such claims, or require accrual for one or more claims that
    has not been previously accrued.



Results
    and cash flows may be negatively impacted by future pension
    funding and other postretirement obligations.

We establish assumptions concerning discount rates and actuarial
    assumptions regarding pension funding and other postretirement
    benefit obligations based on current market conditions, plan
    participants, asset returns, interest rates and other factors.
    Changes in pension and other postretirement benefits, plan
    assets, and associated expenses may occur in the future due to
    changes in capital markets, employee demographics and actuarial
    assumptions. These changes may adversely impact our financial
    condition, results of operations or liquidity.

Results
    may be negatively impacted by the effect of legal and regulatory
    requirements, as well as restrictions imposed on operations by
    foreign and domestic governmental entities.

The manufacture and sale of our products are subject to
    regulation in the United States by the Food and Drug
    Administration, the Agriculture Department, the Bureau of
    Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the Environmental Protection

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS.

We are subject to various claims and legal actions in the
    ordinary course of our business. For purposes of reporting these
    actions, Bush Boake Allen (“BBA”), a wholly-owned
    subsidiary of IFF,

and/or

IFF
    are referred to as the “Company”.

In September 2001, the Company was named as a defendant in a
    purported class action brought against it in the Circuit Court
    of Jasper County, Missouri, on behalf of employees of a plant
    owned and operated by Gilster-Mary Lee Corp. in Jasper, Missouri
    (“

Benavides

case”). The plaintiffs alleged that
    they sustained respiratory injuries in the workplace due to the
    use by Gilster-Mary Lee of a BBA

and/or

IFF
    flavor.

In January 2004, the Court ruled that class action status was
    not warranted. As a result of this decision, each of the 47
    plaintiff cases was to be tried separately. Subsequently, 8
    cases were tried to a verdict, 4 verdicts resulted for the
    plaintiffs and 4 verdicts resulted for the Company, all of which
    were appealed by the losing party. Subsequently all plaintiff
    cases related to the

Benavides

case, including those on
    appeal, were settled.

Eighteen actions based on similar claims of alleged respiratory
    illness due to workplace exposure to flavor ingredients are
    currently pending against the Company and other flavor suppliers
    and related companies.

In May 2004, the Company and another flavor supplier were named
    defendants, and subsequently 14 third and fourth party
    defendants were added, in a lawsuit by 4 former workers and
    their spouses at a Ridgeway, Illinois factory in an action
    brought in the Circuit Court for the Second Judicial Circuit,
    Gallatin County, Illinois (

Barker

case) and another
    concerning 8 other workers and 5 spouses at this same plant was
    filed in July 2004 and is pending in this same Court against the
    same defendants (

Batteese

case). In August 2005, the
    Company and 16 other companies were named defendants in a
    lawsuit by 3 former employees of the Gilster-Mary Lee facility
    in McBride, Missouri in the Missouri Circuit Court,
    32nd Judicial Circuit (

Fults

case). In August 2006,
    the Company and 3 other flavor and chemical suppliers were named
    defendants in a lawsuit by 34 current and former employees

and/or

a
    neighbor of the Gilster-Mary Lee facility in Jasper, Missouri in
    the Missouri Circuit Court of Jasper County (

Arles

case)
    and 5 other current and former employees in the same Court
    (

Bowan

case). In November 2006, the Company, 15 other
    flavor and chemical suppliers, a trade association and a third
    party defendant company were named defendants in a lawsuit filed
    in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois by 1 plaintiff
    allegedly injured by exposure to butter flavor and other
    substances at various facilities in which he worked
    (

Solis

case).

In January 2007, the Company and another flavor supplier were
    named defendants in a lawsuit in Hamilton County, Ohio Court of
    Common Pleas by 103 current and former employees (plus 43
    spousal loss of consortium claims) of two separate Marion, Ohio
    factories (

Aldrich

case). In June 2007, the Company and
    another flavor supplier were named defendants in a lawsuit filed
    in Hamilton County, Ohio Court of Common Pleas by 28 current and
    former employees (plus 7 spousal loss of consortium claims) of a
    Marion, Ohio facility (

Arnold

case). In July 2007, the
    Company and another flavor manufacturer were named defendants in
    a lawsuit filed in Hamilton County, Ohio Court of Common Pleas
    by 55 current and former workers (plus 19 spousal loss of
    consortium claims) of two Marion, Ohio facilities
    (

Adamson

case). In July 2007, the Company was joined as a
    defendant in a case filed in June 2005 against 7 companies
    and a trade association in the 8th Judicial District Court
    of Montana by the widow of the former owner/operator of a
    popcorn business in Montana (

Yatsko

case).

In March 2008, the Company and another flavor supplier were
    named defendants in two lawsuits in the Hamilton County, Ohio
    Court of Common Pleas, one by 12 current and former employees
    and 4 spouses of such employees of a popcorn plant in Marion,
    Ohio (

Ferguson

case) and the other by 14 current and
    former employees and 6 spouses of such employees of the same
    plant (

Brown

case). In April 2008, the Company and 7
    other flavor suppliers, a trade association and a trade
    association management company were named defendants in a
    lawsuit in the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County, Wisconsin by
    one former employee of a Company facility and his spouse
    (

Smead

case). The Company has been dismissed from this
    case. In May 2008, the Company and 8 other companies were named
    defendants in a lawsuit in the District Court of Colorado by a
    consumer of microwave popcorn and his spouse (

Watson

case). In August 2008, the Company and 8 other flavor and
    material suppliers were named defendants in a lawsuit by 27
    plaintiffs (including spouses) in the Hamilton County Court of
    Common Pleas (

Auld

case). In September 2008, the Company,
    two other flavor companies and 4 other companies were named
    defendants in a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the
    Eastern District of Washington by a consumer of microwave
    popcorn



and his spouse (

Newkirk

case). In September 2008, the
    Company, another flavor manufacturer and 2 chemical suppliers
    were named defendants in a lawsuit by 1 plaintiff in the
    Missouri Circuit Court of Jasper County (

Meredith

case).
    In September 2008, the Company, another flavor company and a
    microwave popcorn manufacturer were named defendants in a
    lawsuit by 1 plaintiff and her spouse in the Missouri Circuit
    Court of Jasper County (

McNary

case). In October 2008,
    the Company, 2 other flavor compounders, 2 chemical companies, a
    microwave popcorn manufacturer and a distributor were named
    defendants in a lawsuit by a consumer of microwave popcorn and
    her spouse in the Circuit Court of Jackson County, Missouri
    (

Khouri

case).

The Company believes that all IFF and BBA flavors at issue in
    these matters meet the requirements of the U.S. Food and
    Drug Administration and are safe for handling and use by workers
    in food manufacturing plants when used according to specified
    safety procedures. These procedures are detailed in instructions
    that IFF and BBA provided to all their customers for the safe
    handling and use of their flavors. It is the responsibility of
    IFF’s customers to ensure that these instructions, which
    include the use of appropriate engineering controls, such as
    adequate ventilation, prior handling procedures and respiratory
    protection for workers, are followed in the workplace.

At each balance sheet date, or more frequently as conditions
    warrant, the Company reviews the status of each pending claim,
    as well as its insurance coverage for such claims with due
    consideration given to potentially applicable deductibles,
    retentions and reservation of rights under its insurance
    policies, and the advice of its outside legal counsel with
    respect to all these matters. While the ultimate outcome of any
    litigation cannot be predicted, management believes that
    adequate provision has been made with respect to all known
    claims. Based on information presently available and in light of
    the merits of its defenses and the availability of insurance,
    the Company does not expect the outcome of the above cases,
    singly or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on
    the Company’s financial condition, results of operation or
    liquidity. There can be no assurance that future events will not
    require the Company to increase the amount it has accrued for
    any matter or accrue for a matter that has not been previously
    accrued. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Over the past approximately 20 years, various federal and
    state authorities and private parties have claimed that the
    Company is a Potentially Responsible Party (“PRP”) as
    a generator of waste materials for alleged pollution at a number
    of waste sites operated by third parties located principally in
    New Jersey and have sought to recover costs incurred and to be
    incurred to clean up the sites.

The Company has been identified as a PRP at ten facilities
    operated by third parties at which investigation

and/or

remediation activities may be ongoing. The Company analyzes its
    liability on a regular basis. The Company accrues for
    environmental liabilities when they are probable and estimable.
    The Company estimates its share of the total future cost for
    these sites to be less than $5 million.

While joint and several liability is authorized under federal
    and state environmental laws, the Company believes the amounts
    it has paid and anticipates paying in the future for

clean-up

costs and damages at all sites are not and will not be material
    to the Company’s financial condition, results of operations
    or liquidity. This conclusion is based upon, among other things,
    the involvement of other PRPs at most sites, the status of
    proceedings, including various settlement agreements and consent
    decrees, the extended time period over which payments will
    likely be made and an agreement reached in July 1994 with three
    of the Company’s liability insurers pursuant to which
    defense costs and indemnity amounts payable by the Company in
    respect of the sites will be shared by the insurers up to an
    agreed amount.

Due to the international scope and breadth of our business, we

Executive
    Overview

We are a leading creator and manufacturer of flavor and
    fragrance compounds used to impart or improve the flavor or
    fragrance in a wide variety of consumer products. The precise
    size of the global market for flavors and fragrances is
    difficult to determine because the industry is highly
    fragmented, both geographically and along product lines; there
    are a limited number of publicly traded companies in the
    industry; certain customers maintain in-house capabilities
    fulfilling a portion of their flavor or fragrance needs; and the
    quality and depth of market information in developing regions of
    the world is limited. Analysts generally estimate the global
    market to be $14 billion of which IFF represents 16%; the
    largest competitor in the industry has approximately a 25%
    market share. IFF is one of the top four companies, which
    together represent 70% of the flavors and fragrances industry.

IFF is organized into two units that reflect our flavor and
    fragrance businesses. Approximately 46% of our 2008 net
    sales were flavor compounds. Flavor compounds are sold to the
    food and beverage industries for use in consumer products such
    as prepared foods, beverages, dairy, food and confectionery
    products. The remaining 54% of sales, representing the fragrance
    business unit, were in three fragrance categories: functional
    fragrances, including fragrance compounds for personal care
    (e.g., soaps) and household products (e.g., detergents and
    cleaning agents); fine fragrance and beauty care, including
    perfumes, colognes and toiletries; and ingredients, consisting
    of natural and synthetic ingredients that can be combined with
    other materials to create unique functional and fine fragrance
    compounds. Major fragrance customers include the cosmetics
    industry, including perfume and toiletries manufacturers, and
    the household products industry, including manufacturers of
    soaps, detergents, fabric care, household cleaners and air
    fresheners. Approximately 55% of our ingredient production is
    consumed internally; the balance is sold to third party
    customers.

Changing social habits resulting from such factors as increases
    in personal income, leisure time, health concerns, urbanization
    and population growth stimulate demand for consumer products
    utilizing flavors and fragrances. These developments expand the
    market for products with finer fragrance quality, as well as the
    market for colognes and toiletries. Such developments also
    stimulate demand for convenience foods, soft drinks and low-



fat and organic food products that must conform to expected
    tastes. These developments necessitate the creation and
    development of flavors and fragrances and ingredients that are
    compatible with newly introduced materials and methods of
    application used in consumer products.

Flavors and fragrances are generally:

•

created for the exclusive use by a specific customer;

•

sold in powder or liquid form, in amounts ranging from a few
    pounds to several tons depending on the nature of the end
    product in which they are used;

•

a small percentage of the volume and cost of the end product
    sold to the consumer; and

•

a major factor in consumer selection and acceptance of the
    product.

The flavors and fragrances industry is impacted by macroeconomic
    factors in all product categories and geographic regions. Such
    factors include the impact of currency on the price of raw
    materials and operating costs as well as on translation of
    reported results. In addition, IFF is susceptible to margin
    pressures due to customers’ cost improvement programs and
    input cost increases. However, these pressures can often be
    mitigated through a combination of product reformulation,
    sourcing strategies and material substitution plus internal cost
    containment efforts, and the development of innovative and
    streamlined solutions and processes.

We produce more than 33,000 unique compounds, of which
    approximately 60% are flavors and 40% fragrances. We continually
    create new compounds to meet the changing characteristics and
    needs of our customers’ end products. No single compound
    represents more than 2% of net sales. Development of flavors and
    fragrances is a complex artistic and technical process calling
    upon the combined knowledge and talents of creative perfumers
    and flavorists, and application and research chemists. An
    important element of creation is the development of new
    ingredients. We bear essentially all costs incurred in
    connection with the creation and development of new flavors and
    fragrances and such formulae are generally protected under trade
    secrecy. We are not materially dependent on any patents,
    trademarks or licenses.

IFF’s success in the flavors and fragrances industry is
    driven by our ability to create unique sensory experiences that
    meet evolving consumer needs and expectations. These solutions
    are delivered in a cost-efficient manner in conjunction with
    world-class customer service.

STRATEGIC
    DRIVERS

We are well positioned to increase shareholder value by
    executing the following key drivers: targeting strategically
    important global and regional customers in both developed and
    emerging markets; attracting, developing and retaining top
    talent; and fostering a culture of innovation and continuous
    improvement. Our goal is to deliver differentiated solutions
    that enable our customers’ brands to win in the marketplace.

Customers

We believe there is a great deal of opportunity to grow sales by
    earning a greater share of our customers’ business across
    multiple categories, both in the developed and emerging markets.
    We use our proprietary tools of consumer insight to understand
    the connections between the consumer, the product, and the
    brand. This enables us to create flavors and fragrances that
    resonate with consumers and drive brand loyalty.

People

As a leading creator of flavors and fragrances, our ability to
    succeed is highly dependent on our greatest asset —
    our people. We continue to invest considerable time and
    resources in developing our leaders to build IFF for the
    long-term.

Innovation

IFF continues to focus on creating innovative processes,
    technologies and delivery systems, which includes a significant
    financial commitment to research and development. We see
    potential to gain market share by providing



unique solutions to our customers that enable their brands to
    win in the marketplace. In addition, by streamlining internal
    processes, we are better able to allocate resources to
    appropriate initiatives.

As implementation of our strategy progresses, setting strategic
    initiatives requires regular establishment and reassessment of
    priorities and necessitates choices in order to provide the best
    opportunity for continuous improvement in shareholder value.

Sales
    Commentary

A breakdown of sales by principal product category is depicted
    in the graph below.

    Sales by Category

Our five largest customers comprise 32% of consolidated sales
    and our top 30 customers 56%; these percentages have remained
    fairly constant for several years, although sales to larger
    customers are trending higher. We have one customer that
    accounts for 11% of our sales. A key factor for commercial
    success is inclusion on the strategic customers’ core
    supplier lists, opening opportunities to win new business. We
    are on the core supplier lists of a majority of our strategic
    customers.

    Sales by Destination

We currently manage our operations by business unit but consider
    destination sales a supplemental performance measure. Although
    reported sales and earnings are affected by the weakening or
    strengthening of the U.S. dollar, this has not had a
    long-term effect on the underlying strength of our business.

    in Comparison to 2007

Sales totaled $2,389 million for 2008, up 5% from 2007;
    Flavor and Fragrance sales increased 9% and 2%, respectively.
    2008 sales benefited from the generally weaker U.S. dollar
    and at comparable exchange rates would have increased 2% over
    the prior year.

Flavors
    Business Unit

Flavor sales increased 9% for 2008 based on new wins across all
    regions, particularly in the beverage category, led by a 21%
    increase in Latin America. Excluding the impact of currencies,
    sales growth for the Flavors business was 6%.

Fragrances
    Business Unit

Fragrance sales increased 2%. Excluding the impact of
    currencies, Fragrance sales declined 1% as strong growth in
    emerging markets was offset by weakness in the U.S. market.
    New product introductions of fragrance compounds were offset by
    volume declines primarily in the U.S. and EAME. Ingredient
    sales benefited from price increases, partially offset by volume
    declines as part of a product rationalization initiative and
    weaker economies in the U.S. and EAME.

•

North America flavors new product introductions of
    $22 million and some benefit from price increases were
    largely offset by volume declines. Weak economic conditions and
    significant slowdown in customer order activity led to volume
    declines in fine and functional fragrance compounds and
    ingredients. Fine fragrance sales were also negatively impacted
    by customer inventory corrections in the first half of the year.



•

Flavors sales in EAME were up as new product introductions of
    $22 million were partially offset by volume declines. Fine
    and functional fragrance new product introductions of
    $18 million and $15 million were offset by volume
    declines. Price increases in ingredients were offset by volume
    declines.

•

Latin America flavors sales were strong throughout the region,
    driven mainly by new product introductions of $19 million.
    Fragrance sales growth was driven by new product introductions
    of $10 million offset by volume decreases, primarily in
    functional. Ingredients sales benefited from higher volumes
    coupled with price increases.

•

Greater Asia sales growth in Flavors was driven by new product
    introductions of $16 million plus volume and price
    increases. Fragrance sales benefited from new product
    introductions of $25 million, partially offset by volume
    declines.

    in Comparison to 2006

Sales totaled $2,277 million, up 9% from 2006; flavor and
    fragrance sales increased 12% and 6%, respectively. 2007 sales
    benefited from the generally weaker U.S. dollar and at
    comparable exchange rates would have increased 5% over the prior
    year.

Flavors
    Business Unit

Flavors delivered strong sales performance across all
    regions — most notably in Latin America, Greater Asia
    and Europe — and in virtually all categories,
    particularly beverages and savory.

Fragrance
    Business Unit

Total Fragrance sales increased by 6% for the year and were
    driven by continued growth in Fine and Beauty Care of 8% and
    Ingredients of 9%, despite a decline in Ingredients pricing.
    Foreign exchange accounted for 4% of the sales increase.

•

North America fine fragrance growth was driven by new product
    introductions of $20 million partially offset by volume
    declines. Ingredients volume growth was partially offset by
    pricing declines. The decline in Functional fragrances was
    mainly volume related. Flavors sales growth was driven by new
    product introductions of $20 million mainly in the beverage
    and savory categories.

•

EAME flavor sales growth resulted mainly from new product
    introductions of $25 million. Functional fragrance growth
    was strong primarily due to new product introductions of
    $23 million partially offset by volume declines and to a
    lesser extent lower pricing. The growth in fine fragrance
    related to new product



introductions of $28 million was offset by volume declines.
    Ingredients sales growth was volume related, partially offset by
    lower pricing.

•

Latin America sales growth reflects strong performances in both
    flavors and fine fragrances. Flavors growth was driven by new
    product introductions of $21 million. Fine fragrances sales
    growth is largely attributable to new product introductions of
    $9 million. Functional fragrance performance was primarily
    volume related in the fabric care category; we saw some reversal
    of this trend in the fourth quarter as a result of new product
    introductions. Ingredients sales performance was largely due to
    volume increases partially offset by price declines.

•

Greater Asia sales growth was driven by new product
    introductions of $35 million in flavors. Fragrance sales
    growth was driven by fine fragrances as a result of new product
    introductions of $4 million.

Consolidated
    Operating Results

The percentage relationship of cost of goods sold and other
    operating expenses to reported sales is detailed as follows:




Cost of goods sold

59.4%

58.2%

57.8%

Research and development expenses

8.9%

8.7%

8.9%

Selling and administrative expenses

16.0%

16.5%

16.8%

Cost of goods sold includes the cost of materials and
    manufacturing expenses; raw materials generally constitute 70%
    of the total. Research and development expenses are for the
    development of new and improved products, technical product
    support, compliance with governmental regulations, and help in
    maintaining relationships with customers who are often dependent
    on technological advances. Selling and administrative expenses
    support our sales and operating levels.

    in Comparison to 2007

Cost of goods sold, as a percentage of sales, was 59.4% compared
    with 58.2% in 2007. This increase was mainly the result of
    higher input costs and lower absorption of manufacturing
    expenses, most notably in North America fragrance compounds.
    These factors were partially offset by internal efficiencies,
    reformulation and material substitution efforts. Product mix,
    notably lower sales of fine and beauty care compounds, also
    impacted cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales.

Research and development expense, as a percentage of sales, was
    8.9%. This increase over the prior year period reflects
    increasing investments in customer applications and basic
    research.

Selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales,
    was 16.0% in the current period compared to 16.5% in the prior
    year period. The 2008 results included the benefit of a
    $3 million insurance recovery related to a 2005 product
    contamination matter offset by $3 million of employee
    separation costs. The 2007 results included $4 million of
    business transformation costs that enabled us to better leverage
    our global SAP software platforms. The decline in selling and
    administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, is mainly
    attributable to lower incentive compensation. This was partially
    offset by $2 million related to the implementation of our
    global shared service center.

Interest
    Expense

Interest expense totaled $74 million compared to
    $42 million in 2007, due to higher borrowings incurred in
    connection with the 2007 share repurchase activities as
    well as a wider spread between the LIBOR (London InterBank Offer
    Rate) and EURIBOR (European InterBank Offer Rate) interest rates
    applicable to our interest rate swaps. Average cost of debt was
    6.1% for 2008 compared to 4.5% in 2007.



Other
    (Income) Expense, Net

Other income was $3 million in 2008 as compared to
    $11 million in 2007. Other income in 2007 included
    $11 million related to gains on asset sales.

Income
    Taxes

The effective tax rate was 18.1% in 2008 as compared to a rate
    of 24.8% in the prior year. The lower tax rate in the current
    year primarily reflects the benefit of higher tax settlements
    related to prior years and a higher proportion of earnings in
    lower tax jurisdictions. The 2008 rate includes a
    $23 million benefit, primarily tax settlements related to
    prior years; the 2007 rate includes $10 million of similar
    benefits.

Operating
    Results by Business Unit

We evaluate the performance of business units based on operating
    profit before gains/losses on the disposition of assets,
    interest expense, other income (expense), net and income taxes.
    See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for
    the reconciliation to Income before taxes.

Flavors
    Business Unit

In 2008, Flavors operating profit totaled $198 million, or
    18.1% as a percentage of sales, compared to $187 million or
    18.6% in 2007. The 2008 amount includes $3.5 million of
    restructuring expenses. Excluding the restructuring charge,
    profitability was comparable year over year as strong sales
    growth augmented by lower incentive compensation expense was
    partially offset by unfavorable product mix.

Fragrance
    Business Unit

In 2008, Fragrance operating profit of $199 million, or
    15.3% as a percentage of sales, declined from the
    $210 million or 16.5% reported in 2007. The 2008 amount
    includes $4.4 million of restructuring expenses. The
    decline in profit was driven by unfavorable absorption of
    manufacturing expenses from the shortfall in sales in North
    America, as well as unfavorable mix, with declining fine
    fragrance sales, partially offset by lower incentive
    compensation expense.

Global
    Expenses

Global expenses represent corporate and headquarters-related
    expenses which include legal, finance, human resources and other
    administrative expenses that are not allocated to an individual
    business unit, as well as gains on asset sales and a pension
    curtailment charge. In 2008, Global expenses were
    $45 million as compared to $27 million in 2007. In
    2008, Global expenses included approximately $10 million of
    restructuring charges, $3 million of employee separation
    costs and $2 million of implementation costs related to our
    global shared service center, partially offset by a
    $3 million insurance recovery related to a 2005 product
    contamination. Global expenses in 2007 included a
    $6 million curtailment loss related to changes to the
    U.S. defined benefit pension plan and $11 million
    related to the gains on asset sales.

    in Comparison to 2006

Cost of goods sold, as a percentage of sales, was 58.2% compared
    with 57.8% in 2006. This increase was mainly as a result of
    product mix, notably higher sales of fragrance ingredients and
    flavor compounds. Lower selling prices for fragrance
    ingredients, some impact of higher material costs and under
    absorption of manufacturing costs at a new fragrance ingredient
    facility in China, which scaled up production in 2007, also
    contributed to the increase. The average cost of raw materials
    increased 2-3% over the prior year.

Research and Development expense, as a percentage of sales, was
    8.7%, comparable to the prior year levels.

Selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales,
    was 16.5% in the period compared to 16.8% in the prior year
    period, reflecting good cost control and the benefit of
    headcount reductions that occurred in the first half of 2006.
    Selling and administrative expenses in 2007 include
    $4 million of business transformation costs to



enable us to better leverage our global SAP software platform.
    The 2006 results also included the benefit of a $3 million
    insurance recovery related to a 2005 product contamination
    matter; excluding the insurance recovery, 2006 Selling and
    administrative expenses would have been 16.9% of sales for the
    year.

Interest
    Expense

In 2007, interest expense totaled $42 million, increasing
    63% compared to 2006, due to higher borrowings incurred in
    connection with share repurchase activities. See Note 10 to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of
    the share repurchase activities. Average cost of debt was 4.5%
    for 2007 compared to 3.3% in 2006.

Other
    (Income) Expense, Net

Other (income) expense, net in 2007 increased $1 million
    over the prior year, mainly due to favorable exchange results
    and higher interest income as a result of higher interest rates.
    Other income included $11 million and $15 million, in
    2007 and 2006, respectively, primarily related to gains on asset
    sales.

Income
    Taxes

The effective tax rate was 24.8% in 2007 as compared to a rate
    of 27.7% in the prior year. Both the 2007 and 2006 rates
    benefited from favorable tax rulings with respect to prior
    years; excluding the benefit of these rulings from both years,
    the 2007 effective tax rate would have been 27.8% compared to a
    rate of 28.8% for 2006. The lower effective tax rate for the
    current year was largely the result of a greater percentage of
    consolidated pre-tax earnings in lower tax jurisdictions.

Operating
    Results by Business Unit

We evaluate the performance of business units based on operating
    profit before gains/losses on the disposition of assets,
    interest expense, other income (expense), net and income taxes.
    See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for
    the reconciliation to Income before taxes.

Flavors
    Business Unit

In 2007, Flavors operating profit of $187 million, or 18.6%
    as a percentage of sales, increased as compared to
    $153 million or 17.1% in 2006. The amount reported in 2006
    benefited from a $3 million insurance recovery related to a
    2005 product contamination matter; excluding the insurance
    recovery from the prior year comparative, Flavors profitability
    would have increased an additional 30 basis points over
    2006. This profitability improvement was primarily driven by
    margin improvement enabled by strong sales growth, favorable
    product mix, increased absorption of manufacturing expenses and
    good cost control.

Fragrance
    Business Unit

In 2007, Fragrance operating profit of $210 million or
    16.5%, as a percentage of sales, declined from the
    $212 million or 17.7% reported in 2006. Profitability was
    negatively impacted by lower selling prices of fragrance
    ingredients, higher material costs and underabsorption of
    manufacturing costs related to scaling up the China facility in
    2007.

Global
    Expenses

Global expenses represent corporate and headquarters-related
    expenses which include legal, finance, human resources and other
    administrative expenses that are not allocated to an individual
    business unit, as well as gains on asset sales and a pension
    curtailment charge. In 2007, Global expenses increased
    $9 million to $27 million from $18 million
    incurred in 2006. In 2007, Global expenses included
    approximately $6 million of curtailment loss as a result of
    changes to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan and
    approximately $11 million related to gains on asset sales.
    The 2006 expenses included approximately $15 million of
    other income primarily related to gains on asset sales.



Goodwill
    and Intangible Assets

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, goodwill and other
    intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, totaled
    $727 million and $733 million, respectively.
    Additional details are contained in Note 4 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

We perform a goodwill impairment test on at least an annual
    basis, or more frequently in certain circumstances, by assessing
    the fair value of our reporting units based upon both discounted
    cash flow and comparison of multiples of comparable companies.
    We deem goodwill to be impaired if the carrying amount of the
    reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value. We completed
    our annual assessments in 2008 and 2007, concluding there was no
    impairment of goodwill.

Other intangible assets include patents, trademarks and other
    intellectual property, valued at acquisition, primarily through
    independent appraisals, which are amortized on a straight-line
    basis over periods ranging from 6 to 20 years. We review
    our other intangible assets for impairment when events or
    changes in business conditions indicate that their full carrying
    value may not be recovered.

Restructuring
    and Other Charges

Restructuring and other charges primarily consist of separation
    costs for employees including severance, outplacement and other
    benefit costs.

In 2008, as part of our business transformation initiative to
    enable us to better leverage our global SAP software platform,
    we implemented a plan to centralize transaction processing in a
    global shared service center that resulted in the elimination of
    127 positions globally, largely in the finance area. As a result
    of these actions, we recognized a pre-tax charge of
    approximately $7 million in 2008 related to employee
    separation costs and $2 million in implementation costs.
    The implementation costs were included in selling and
    administrative expenses in 2008. In addition, we incurred a
    pre-tax charge of approximately $12 million in the fourth
    quarter 2008 principally related to a performance improvement
    plan covering 91 positions across a variety of activities
    globally. Annual savings from these two initiatives is expected
    to be approximately $14 million beginning in 2009.

The 2006 charge primarily related to employee separation
    expenses, in connection with the consolidation of our
    operations, principally in Europe and North America.

Positions eliminated and charges, net of reversal by business
    segment in 2008 and 2006 are detailed in the table below; there
    were no such actions undertaken in 2007.

Income
    Taxes

Effective utilization of the cash generated by our international
    operations is a critical component of our tax strategy.
    Strategic dividend repatriation from foreign subsidiaries
    creates U.S. taxable income, which enables us to recognize
    deferred tax assets.

Pursuant to FAS 109, we establish a valuation allowance for
    net deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of the available
    evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
    the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Historically, we
    have provided a full valuation allowance against deferred tax
    assets resulting from state net operating losses and state
    credits, as well as selective

non-U.S. affiliates’

net operating losses. The changes in the valuation allowances
    from December 31, 2007 are primarily attributable to the
    current period net operating losses and currency translation
    adjustments.

Postretirement
    Benefits

In 2007, we recorded a curtailment loss of $5.9 million to
    recognize a portion of the unrecognized prior service costs
    associated with years of service no longer expected to be
    rendered and credited as service under the plans as a result of
    an amendment to the U.S. salaried qualified and
    non-qualified pension plans. We also introduced an enhanced
    defined contribution plan for those employees affected by the
    pension curtailment that became effective January 1, 2008.
    These events resulted in approximately $4 million of annual
    savings.

The global credit crisis has significantly increased volatility
    in the financial markets. The financial returns of our
    investment trusts during 2008 have been in-line with the markets
    by asset class. We had little exposure to financial equities and
    had no direct investments in sub-prime related assets. We do not
    expect the recent market declines to have a significant impact
    on our overall funding position as well as the timing and level
    of contributions.

Financial
    Condition

Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled
    $179 million at December 31, 2008 compared to
    $152 million and $115 million at December 31,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. Working capital totaled
    $710 million at year-end 2008 compared to $613 million
    at December 31, 2007. The 2008 increase in working capital
    was primarily related to decreases in short-term borrowings and
    accrued bonuses. The 2007 working capital amount was reduced by
    $39 million from the amount previously reported to conform
    to the 2008 presentation of deferred taxes assets and
    liabilities. Gross additions to property, plant and equipment
    were $85 million, $66 million and $58 million in
    2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and are expected to
    approximate $100 million in 2009.



Our financial condition continues to be strong, as evidenced by
    substantial cash flow from operations and substantial drawdown
    capacity of approximately $415 million on our multi-year
    revolving credit facility. Operating cash flow provides the
    primary source of funds for operating and capital needs as well
    as dividends paid to shareholders and share repurchase
    activities. We anticipate that cash flows from operations and
    availability under our existing credit facilities are sufficient
    to fund our capital spending and other cash requirements for at
    least the next eighteen months.

Operating cash flow in 2008 was $221 million compared to
    $314 million and $282 million in 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. The decline in operating cash flow in 2008
    compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to
    increased working capital, and higher interest payments
    principally related to $500 million of Senior Unsecured
    Notes we issued to repurchase stock as discussed below.

Net investing activities in 2008 utilized $90 million
    compared to $51 million and $48 million in 2007 and
    2006, respectively. The increase in investing activities was
    primarily related to higher capital spending and lower proceeds
    from asset dispositions.

In 2007 and 2006, we realized sizeable cash proceeds from the
    sale of assets. In both years, the proceeds related to the sale
    of land and buildings; to the extent such assets had been
    written down in connection with previous restructuring
    activities, any gain or loss on disposition was accounted for as
    part of the restructuring activities. All transactions were with
    third party investors and we retained no ownership interest in
    any of the disposed assets.

Compliance with existing governmental requirements regulating
    the discharge of materials into the environment has not
    materially affected our operations, earnings or competitive
    position. In 2008 and 2007, we spent $4 million and
    $3 million, respectively, on capital projects and
    $19 million and $18 million, respectively, in
    operating expenses and governmental charges for the purpose of
    complying with such regulations. Expenditures for these purposes
    will continue for the foreseeable future. In addition, we are
    party to a number of proceedings brought under the Comprehensive
    Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act or
    similar state statutes. It is expected that the impact of any
    judgments in or voluntary settlements of such proceedings will
    not be material to our financial condition, results of
    operations or liquidity.

The dividend paid per share in 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $.94,
    $.86 and $.74, respectively. In January, April and July 2008, we
    paid a quarterly cash dividend of $.23 per share to
    shareholders. In July 2008, we announced a 9% increase in our
    quarterly dividend rate to $.25 per share effective with the
    dividend payable in October 2008. We paid dividends totaling
    $75 million, $77 million and $67 million in 2008,
    2007 and 2006. Our current intention is to pay dividends
    approximating 30 — 35% of yearly earnings; however,
    the payment of dividends is determined by the Board of Directors
    (“Board”) at its discretion based on various factors,
    and no assurance can be provided as to future dividends.

We supplement short-term liquidity with access to capital
    markets, mainly through bank credit facilities and issuance of
    commercial paper. In 2005, IFF, including certain subsidiaries,
    entered into a revolving credit agreement (the
    “Facility”) with certain banks. The Facility provides
    for a five-year U.S. $350 million
    (“Tranche A”) and Euro 400 million
    (“Tranche B”) multi-currency revolving credit
    facility. Tranche A is available to IFF for commercial
    paper backstop and general corporate purposes; Tranche B is
    available to both IFF and the European subsidiaries for general
    corporate purposes. Borrowings under the Facility bear interest
    at an annual rate of LIBOR (or in relation to any
    Euro-denominated loans, EURIBOR) plus a margin, currently
    20 basis points, linked to our credit rating. We pay a
    commitment fee on the aggregate unused commitments and a
    utilization fee based on amounts outstanding under the Facility;
    such fees are not material. The Facility expires on
    November 23, 2012. During 2008 and 2007, the maximum amount
    of outstanding commercial paper was $30 million and
    $18 million, respectively.

At December 31, 2008, we had $1,256 million of debt
    outstanding which is comparable to the $1,213 million
    outstanding at December 31, 2007. In November 2008, ¥
    13.3 billion of our Japanese Yen borrowings were replaced
    with a three-year bank loan. In connection with this refinancing
    the related interest rate swaps expired. In October 2008, we
    closed out a $250 million USD LIBOR to EURIBOR interest
    rate swap and a $250 million fixed to floating interest
    rate swap at no cost. Additionally, in February 2009 we
    terminated a $300 million USD LIBOR to



EURIBOR interest rate swap which required us to make a payment
    of $16 million. See Quantitative and Qualitative
    Disclosures About Market Risk (Item 7A below) for
    additional information regarding these transactions.

In July 2007, our Board authorized us to repurchase up to 15% or
    $750 million worth of our then outstanding common stock,
    whichever is less. In September 2007, under the July 2007 Plan,
    we entered into two agreements to purchase shares of our common
    stock under a $450 million accelerated share repurchase
    (“ASR”) program. The ASR concluded in June 2008. Total
    aggregate shares repurchased under the ASR program were
    9.7 million shares at an average purchase price of $46.53.
    The ASR was primarily funded through the issuance of
    $500 million of Senior Unsecured Notes (“Senior
    Notes — 2007”) in four series under a Note
    Purchase Agreement. See Note 8, Borrowings, to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information
    regarding these notes.

The Facility and Yen loan contain the most restrictive covenants
    requiring us to maintain, at the end of each fiscal quarter, a
    ratio of net debt for borrowed money to adjusted EBITDA in
    respect of the previous

12-month

period of not more than 3.25 to 1.

At December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with all
    financial and other covenants. At December 31, 2008 our Net
    Debt/ Adjusted EBITDA(1) was 2.34 to 1 as defined by the debt
    agreements.

Failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under
    these agreements would constitute default and would allow the
    lenders to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the
    related agreement. If such acceleration were to occur, we would
    not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the
    indebtedness. We would likely have to seek amendments under the
    agreements for relief from the financial covenants or repay the
    debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity,

and/or

asset
    sales, if necessary. We may be unable to amend the agreements or
    raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event
    the maturities are accelerated.

Adjusted EBITDA and Net Debt, which are non-GAAP measures
    used for these covenants, are calculated in accordance with the
    definition in the debt agreements. In this context, these
    measures are used solely to provide information on the extent to
    which we are in compliance with debt covenants and may not be
    comparable to adjusted EBITDA and Net Debt used by other
    companies. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income and

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates

Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As disclosed in
    Note 1, the preparation of financial statements in
    conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and
    accompanying disclosures. These estimates are based on
    management’s best judgment of current events and actions
    that we may undertake in the future. Actual results may
    ultimately differ from estimates.

Those areas requiring the greatest degree of management judgment
    or deemed most critical to our financial reporting involve:

The periodic assessment of potential impairment of
    intangible assets acquired in business
    combinations

.

We currently have net
    intangible assets, including goodwill, of $727 million.
    Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually. In assessing
    goodwill, management uses the most current actual and forecasted
    operating data available, and current market based assumptions.
    A two-step approach is employed. The first step involves
    estimating the value of reporting units based on the present
    value of estimated future cash flows. The second step, if
    necessary, is to measure the value of the impairment loss, if
    any. Management’s most subjective assumptions relate to the
    estimated/projected sales and operating growth values employed
    in the forecast.

The analysis and evaluation of income
    taxes.

We account for taxes in accordance
    with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 109,
    “Accounting for Income Taxes”
    (“FAS 109”). Under FAS 109, deferred tax
    assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary
    differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets
    and liabilities, based on tax laws as currently enacted. The
    provision for income taxes is based on statutory income taxes
    rates and planning opportunities available in the various tax
    jurisdictions where we operate. Significant judgment is required
    in determining income tax provisions and tax positions. We may
    be challenged upon review by the applicable taxing authority and
    positions taken by us may not be sustained. We regularly update
    these accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances.



In 2007, we adopted SFAS No. 48, “Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes”, an interpretation of
    FAS 109 (“FIN 48”). As a result of adopting
    FIN 48, we recognized a $1 million increase in Other
    liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and a corresponding
    cumulative effect adjustment to Retained earnings. Also as
    prescribed by FIN 48, certain tax related amounts in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet are classified differently than in
    prior periods. Amounts receivable from various tax jurisdictions
    are now included in Other current assets and tax reserves
    previously classified as accrued taxes on income are now
    included in Other liabilities.

The evaluation of potential legal and environmental
    liabilities, where changing circumstances, rules and regulations
    require regular reassessment of related practices and
    anticipated costs.

We are subject to certain
    legal claims regarding products and other matters, as well as
    environmental-related matters. Significant management judgment
    is involved in determining when it is probable that a liability
    has been incurred and the extent to which it can be reasonably
    estimated.

We regularly assess potential liabilities with respect to all
    legal claims based on the most recent available information, in
    consultation with outside counsel handling the defense of such
    matters. To the extent a liability is deemed to have been
    incurred and can be reasonably estimated, we recognize a
    corresponding liability; if the reasonably estimated liability
    is a range, we recognize that amount considered most likely, or
    in the absence of such a determination, the minimum reasonably
    expected liability. To the extent such claims are covered by
    various insurance policies, we separately evaluate the
    likelihood of recovery and account for any related insurance
    receivable. Management judgments involve determination as to
    whether a liability has been incurred, the reasonably estimated
    amount of that liability, and any potential insurance recovery.

We regularly evaluate potential environmental exposure in terms
    of total estimated cost and the viability of other potentially
    responsible parties (“PRP’s”) associated with our
    exposure. Recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as
    remediation efforts progress and additional information becomes
    available. Critical management assumptions relate to expected
    total costs to remediate and the financial viability of
    PRP’s to share such costs.

Determination of the various assumptions employed in the
    valuation of pension and retiree health care expense and
    associated obligations.

Amounts recognized in
    the Consolidated Financial Statements related to pension and
    other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial
    valuations. Inherent in such valuations are assumptions
    including expected return on plan assets, discount rates at
    which the liabilities could be settled, rates of increase in
    future compensation levels, mortality rates and health care cost
    trend rates. These assumptions are updated annually and are
    disclosed in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements. In accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ
    from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future
    periods and, therefore, affect expense recognized and
    obligations recorded in future periods.

With respect to the U.S. plans, the expected return on plan
    assets was determined based on an asset allocation model using
    the current benchmark allocation, real rates of return by asset
    class and an anticipated inflation rate. The benchmark asset
    allocation was: 10 — 20% in cash and fixed income
    investments expected to yield 1.0%; 10 — 20% employed
    in corporate and government bonds expected to yield 2.1%; and
    65 — 75% in equity investments with a long-term
    expected yield of 8.5 — 9.3%. The inflation rate
    assumed in the model was 2.5%. The plan has achieved a
    compounded annual rate of return of approximately 9% over the
    previous 20 years. The expected annual rate of return for
    the

non-U.S. plans

employs a similar set of criteria adapted for local investments,
    inflation rates and in certain cases specific government
    requirements. The discount rate used for determining future
    pension obligations for each individual plan is based on a
    review of long-term bonds that receive a high rating from a
    recognized rating agency. Additionally, for the U.S. plans,
    the discount rate was based on the internal rate of return for a
    portfolio of Moody’s Aa3-rated high quality bonds with
    maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit
    payment obligations of the plan. The rate of compensation
    increase for all plans and the medical cost trend rate for the
    applicable U.S. plans are based on plan experience.

Management establishes the assumptions concerning discount rates
    and actuarial assumptions based on current market conditions,
    including asset returns and other factors applicable under the
    circumstances. Changes in pension and other post-employment
    benefits, and associated expenses, may occur in the future due



to changes in these assumptions. The impact that a .25% decrease
    in the discount rate or a 1% change in the medical cost trend
    rate would have on our pension and other post-employment benefit
    expense, as applicable, is discussed in Note 13 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

The ongoing assessment of the valuation of inventory,
    given the large number of natural ingredients employed, the
    quality of which may be diminished over
    time.

We maintain between 40% and 55% of our
    inventory as raw materials, providing the greatest degree of
    flexibility in manufacture and use. Materials are evaluated
    based on shelf life, known uses and anticipated demand based on
    forecasted customer order activity and changes in product/sales
    mix. Management policy provides for an ongoing assessment of
    inventory with adjustments recorded when an item is deemed to be
    slow moving or obsolete.

Determination of various assumptions employed in the
    calculation of equity compensation
    expense.

Amounts recognized in the
    Consolidated Financial Statements related to equity compensation
    are determined based on the number of awards and type of award
    as well as specific assumptions regarding expected life, stock
    price volatility, risk free interest rate, termination rates,
    exercise multiple and the dividend yield. These assumptions are
    employed in the Binomial model used to value certain awards.
    Management establishes the assumptions based on current market
    conditions and historical trends related to the equity awards.

Developing the assumptions used in the Binomial model requires
    significant judgment on our part and, generally, may involve
    analyzing available historical data, considering whether
    historical data is relevant to predicting future behavior,
    making appropriate adjustments to historical data for future
    expectations, supplementing or replacing company-specific
    historical data with data from other supportable sources and
    appropriately weighting each of the inputs. These assumptions
    are evaluated at each grant date. If factors change and we
    employ different assumptions for estimating share-based
    compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a
    different valuation model, the future periods may differ
    significantly from what we have recorded in the current period
    and could materially affect operating income, net income and net
    income per share.

We believe that we have considered relevant circumstances that
    we may be currently subject to, and the financial statements
    accurately reflect our best estimate of the results of our
    operations, financial condition and cash flows for the years
    presented. We have discussed the decision process and selection
    of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee
    of the Board of Directors.

New
    Accounting Standards

In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (“SFAS”) No. 141 (revised 2007),
    “Business Combinations” (“FAS 141(R)”).
    FAS 141(R) requires the measurement at fair value of assets
    acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling
    interest in the acquiree as of the acquisition date.
    SFAS 141(R) also requires that acquisition related costs
    and costs to restructure be expensed as incurred. We do not
    expect the adoption of FAS 141(R), which is effective for
    fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008, to
    have an impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. A
    significant impact may, however, result from any future business
    acquisitions.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
    “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51”
    (“FAS 160”)

.

FAS 160 establishes
    accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling
    interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a
    subsidiary. It also amends certain of ARB No. 51’s
    consolidation procedures for consistency with the requirements
    of FAS 141(R). This statement is effective for fiscal years
    beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and shall be
    applied prospectively as of the beginning of the year of
    adoption. We do not expect the adoption of FAS 160 to have
    a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,
    “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133”
    (“FAS 161”). FAS 161 amends and expands the
    disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 133 with the
    intent to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced
    understanding of: (i) how and why an entity uses derivative
    instruments; (ii) how derivative instruments and related
    hedged items are accounted for under SFAS 133 and its
    related interpretations and (iii) how derivative



instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s
    financial position statements. This statement is effective for
    fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, with early
    application encouraged. We are currently evaluating the impact
    of FAS 161 on the disclosures in our Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, “The
    Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles”
    (“FAS 162”). FAS 162 identifies the sources
    of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the
    principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements
    presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting
    principles in the United States of America. FAS 162 will be
    effective 60 days following the SEC’s approval of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) amendments to
    AU Section 411, “The Meaning of Present Fairly in
    Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles”.
    We are currently evaluating the potential impact of
    FAS 162, but do not believe its adoption will have a
    material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In June 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
    (“FSP”) Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)

No. 03-6-1,

“Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based
    Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities”
    (“FSP

EITF 03-6-1”),

which classifies unvested share-based payment awards that
    contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend
    equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) as participating securities
    and requires them to be included in the computation of earnings
    per share pursuant to the two-class method described in
    SFAS No. 128, “Earnings per Share”. This
    Staff Position is to be applied retrospectively and is effective
    for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2008. We have issued Purchase Restricted Stock
    (“PRS”) to certain eligible employees. The unvested
    portion of such PRS contains a nonforfeitable right to dividends
    paid by us, and as such, are participating securities and shall
    be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to
    the two-class method. We are currently evaluating the potential
    impact of FSP

EITF 03-6-1,

but do not believe its adoption will have a material impact on
    our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP
    FAS No. 132(R)-1, “Employers’ Disclosures
    about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets” (“FSP
    FAS 132(R)-1”). FSP FAS 132(R)-1 expands the
    disclosure requirements of FAS No. 132(R) with the
    intent to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced
    understanding of: (i) how investment allocation decisions
    are made, including the investment policies and strategies used,
    (ii) the major categories of plan assets, (iii) the
    inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value
    of plan assets, (iv) the effect of fair value measurements
    using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) on
    changes in plan assets and (v) significant concentrations
    of risk within plan assets. This statement is to be applied
    prospectively, effective for fiscal years ending after
    December 15, 2009, with early application permitted. We are
    currently evaluating the impact of FSP FAS 132(R)-1 on the
    disclosures in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Non-GAAP Financial
    Measures

Among the items in GAAP earnings but excluded for purposes of
    determining adjusted earnings are: benefits of favorable tax
    rulings relating to prior years; employee separation and
    restructuring charges, the benefit of an insurance recovery,
    costs for the implementation of the global shared services plan
    in 2008 and the gain on the sale of land, a curtailment charge
    resulting from changes made to our U.S. defined benefit
    pension plan in 2007. In addition, in certain instances, we
    exclude the effects of exchange rate fluctuations when
    discussing our historical performance. Such information is
    supplemental to information presented in accordance with GAAP
    and is not intended to represent a presentation in accordance
    with GAAP. In discussing our historical and expected future
    results and financial condition, we believe it is meaningful for
    investors to be made aware of and to be assisted in a better
    understanding of, on a period-to-period comparative basis, of
    financial amounts both including and excluding these identified
    items, as well as the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on
    operating results and financial condition. We believe such
    additional non-GAAP information provides investors with an
    overall perspective of the period-to-period performance of our
    core business. In addition, management internally reviews each
    of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate performance on a
    comparative period-to-period basis in terms of absolute
    performance, trends and expected future performance with respect
    to our core continuing business. A material limitation of these
    non-GAAP measures is that such measures do not reflect actual
    GAAP amounts, restructuring charges, employee separation costs
    and implementation costs include actual cash outlays, an
    insurance recovery is an actual cash recovery and benefits from
    favorable tax rulings reflect actual accounting and cash
    benefits realized; and we compensate for such limitations by
    presenting the accompanying reconciliation to the most directly
    comparable



GAAP measure. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to
    similarly titled measures used by other companies.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

We operate on a global basis and are exposed to currency
    fluctuation related to the manufacture and sale of our products
    in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The major foreign
    currencies involve the markets in the European Union, Great
    Britain, Mexico, Brazil, China, Indonesia, Australia and Japan,
    although all regions are subject to foreign currency
    fluctuations versus the U.S. dollar. We actively monitor
    our foreign currency exposures in all major markets in which we
    operate, and employ a variety of techniques to mitigate the
    impact of exchange rate fluctuations, including foreign currency
    hedging activities. We enter into foreign currency forward
    contracts with the objective of reducing exposure to cash flow
    volatility associated with foreign currency receivables and
    payables, and with anticipated purchases of certain raw
    materials used in operations. These contracts, the
    counterparties to which are major international financial
    institutions, generally involve the exchange of one currency for
    a second currency at a future date, and have maturities not
    exceeding six months. The notional amount and maturity dates of
    such contracts match those of the underlying transactions. The
    gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recorded in earnings
    at the same time as the transaction being hedged is recorded in
    earnings. In February 2003, we executed a

10-year

Yen
    - U.S. dollar currency swap related to the monthly sale and
    purchase of products between the U.S. and Japan, which is
    designated as a cash flow hedge. The annual notional value of
    this swap is approximately $5 million. The associated asset
    or liability on the open hedge instrument is recorded in Current
    assets or Current liabilities, as applicable. Gains and losses
    related to this swap are recorded currently, and the
    mark-to-market adjustment related to the value of the swap is
    reflected as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive
    Income (“AOCI”).



In addition to the foreign exchange forward contracts noted
    above, we use

non-U.S. dollar

borrowings and foreign exchange swap agreements, to hedge the
    foreign currency exposures of our net investment in certain
    foreign affiliates, primarily in the European Union. These
    foreign exchange swap agreements are designated as hedges of net
    investments. In September 2007 and January 2006, we entered into
    a $250 million and a $300 million Cross Currency
    Interest Rate Swap, respectively, to hedge a portion of our
    consolidated EUR net investment. The derivative was structured
    as a swap of floating USD LIBOR to floating EURIBOR, with both
    floating interest rates reset and paid semi-annually. Because
    the derivative is structured as a floating to floating swap, the
    only value, other than that derived from changes in the spot
    Foreign Exchange (FX) rate, are interest rate accruals which are
    reset semi-annually. These accruals are netted and booked in
    current earnings. Mark-to-market changes due to differences in
    the underlying FX rate are recorded in AOCI and provide an
    offset to the cumulative translation adjustment of the
    underlying Euro net investments being hedged. Effectiveness is
    assessed quarterly. At maturity, or if the swaps are terminated
    early, any gain or loss will not be recorded to earnings, but
    will be recorded to AOCI until the EUR net investment is
    divested. In October 2008, we closed out the $250 million
    USD LIBOR to EURIBOR interest rate swap at no cost. In February
    2009 we terminated the $300 million USD LIBOR to EURIBOR
    interest rate swap which required us to make a payment of
    $16 million.

We use derivative instruments as part of our interest rate risk
    management strategy. The derivative instruments used are
    comprised principally of fixed to floating rate interest rate
    swaps. In September 2007, we entered into a $250 million
    interest rate swap agreement effectively converting the fixed
    rate on our long-term U.S. dollar borrowings to a variable
    short-term rate based on USD LIBOR rate plus markup. In March
    2008, we realized an $18 million gain on termination of
    this swap, which has been deferred and is being amortized as a
    reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the
    related debt. During 2008, we entered into a similar interest
    rate swap and then in October 2008 we liquidated this position
    at no cost.

In addition, in 2005, we entered into certain interest rate swap
    agreements effectively converting the fixed rate on our
    long-term Japanese Yen borrowings to a variable short-term rate
    based on the Japanese Yen TIBOR rate plus markup. These swaps
    are designated as qualified fair value hedges. In November 2008,
    the portion of these swaps related to the 13.3 billion Yen
    notes refinanced, expired. Swap contracts are generally held to
    maturity and are intended to create an appropriate balance of
    fixed and floating rate debt. To the extent we have not received
    cash or otherwise amended or settled any swap agreements, any
    applicable mark-to-market adjustment relating to that swap is
    included as a separate component of debt.

The following table summarizes our derivatives outstanding as of
    December 31, 2008. These swaps were all effective under
    FAS 133.

Hedged risk

Foreign Exchange
    Risk

(1)

The risk of changes in fair value attributable to interest rate
    risk

(2)

The variability of cash flows attributable to foreign exchange
    risk

(3)

Method used to test for effectiveness:

(1)

Quarterly hedge effectiveness is tested using the forward rate
    method. We use a hypothetical derivative on an after-tax basis,
    and ensure that the hedged amount is less then the designated
    Euro net investment. We ensure that the terms of the hedging
    instrument have not changed and perform a review of counterparty
    creditworthiness.

(2)

Changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged are
    expected to be completely offset by the hedging derivative
    because the critical terms of the Interest Rate Swap and the
    hedged debt match (i.e., the currency, notional amount, timing
    and date of interest payments). Quarterly hedge effectiveness
    testing includes ensuring the terms of the hedging instrument
    and the debt have not changed and reviewing counterparty
    creditworthiness.



(3)

Changes in cash flow attributable to the risk being hedged are
    expected to be completely offset by the hedging derivative
    because the critical terms of the Cross Currency Swap and the
    forecasted transaction match (i.e., the currency, notional
    amount and timing). Quarterly hedge effectiveness testing
    includes reviewing counterparty creditworthiness, ensuring the
    probability of hedged forecasted transactions has not changed
    and ensuring the terms of the hedging instrument have not
    changed.

We have established a centralized reporting system to evaluate
    the effects of changes in interest rates, currency exchange
    rates and other relevant market risks. Our risk management
    procedures include the monitoring of interest rate and foreign
    exchange exposures and hedge positions utilizing statistical
    analyses of cash flows, market value and sensitivity analysis.
    However, the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk
    of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of
    their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions.
    Market exposures are evaluated using a sensitivity model that is
    intended to measure the potential 10% loss in interest rate and
    foreign exchange financial instruments, assuming adverse market
    conditions occur. Historical interest rates and foreign exchange
    rates are used to estimate the volatility and correlation of
    future rates.

The estimated maximum potential

one-day

loss
    in fair value of interest rate or foreign exchange rate
    instruments, calculated using the sensitivity model, is not
    material to our consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows in 2008, 2007 and 2006. The estimated
    maximum yearly loss in earnings due to interest rate or foreign
    exchange rate instruments, calculated utilizing the sensitivity
    model, is not material to our results of operations in 2008,
    2007 and 2006. Actual results in the future may differ
    materially from these projected results due to actual
    developments in the global financial markets.

The foreign currency and interest rate swap contracts existing
    during 2008 and 2007 were entered into for the purpose of
    seeking to mitigate the risk of certain specific adverse
    currency and interest rate risks. As a result of these financial
    instruments, we reduced financial risk in exchange for foregoing
    any gain (reward) that might have occurred if the markets moved
    favorably. In using these contracts, management exchanged the
    risks of the financial markets for counterparty risk.
    Counterparty risk arises from the inability of a counterparty to
    meet its obligations. To mitigate counterparty risk, we entered
    into derivative contracts with major leading financial
    institutions that have credit ratings equal to or better than
    our credit rating.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES.

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Changes in Internal
    Control over Financial Reporting.

Our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer,
    with the assistance of other members of our management, have
    evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
    procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and
    Interim Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our
    disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end
    of the period covered by this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

We have established controls and procedures designed to ensure
    that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we
    file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
    Commission’s rules and forms and is accumulated and
    communicated to management, including the principal executive
    officer and the principal financial officer, to allow timely
    decisions regarding required disclosure.



Our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer
    have concluded that there have not been any changes in our
    internal control over financial reporting during the fourth
    quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
    to materially affect, our internal control over financial
    reporting.

The registered public accounting firm that audited the financial
    statements included in the annual report containing the
    disclosure required by this Item has issued an attestation
    report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over
    financial reporting. The attestation report issued by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is included in Part IV of this Annual
    Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control
    over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
    reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
    reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
    external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control
    over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008. In making
    this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (“COSO”) in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

.

Based on this assessment, management determined that, as of
    December 31, 2008, our internal control over financial
    reporting was effective.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent registered public
    accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008 as
    stated in their report which is included herein.

Certifications
    to NYSE and SEC

Our Chief Executive Officer certification was timely filed with
    the NYSE as required by NYSE Rule 303A(12). We have filed
    the required Sarbanes-Oxley Section 302 certifications of
    the Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer
    regarding the quality of our public disclosures as exhibits to
    our most recently filed

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of International
    Flavors & Fragrances Inc.:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the index appearing under item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in
    all material respects, the financial position of International
    Flavors & Fragrances Inc. and its subsidiaries at
    December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, and the
    results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
    three years in the period ended December 31, 2008 in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the
    financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under
    Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects,
    the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with
    the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our
    opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these
    financial statements and financial statement schedule, for
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
    and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
    over financial reporting, included in Managements’ Report
    on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, appearing under
    Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these
    financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and
    on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in
    accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
    plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
    whether the financial statements are free of material
    misstatement and whether effective internal control over
    financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
    audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test
    basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
    financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
    and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
    for uncertain tax positions in 2007. As discussed in
    Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the
    Company changed the manner in which it accounts for defined
    benefit pension and other postretirement plans effective
    December 31, 2006.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1.

NATURE OF
    OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES

Nature of Operations

We are a leading creator
    and manufacturer of flavor and fragrance compounds used to
    impart or improve flavor or fragrance in a wide variety of
    consumer products. Our products are sold principally to
    manufacturers of perfumes and cosmetics, hair and other personal
    care products, soaps and detergents, cleaning products, dairy,
    meat and other processed foods, beverages, snacks and savory
    foods, confectionery, sweet and baked goods, and pharmaceutical
    and oral care products.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States requires management to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and
    accompanying disclosures. These estimates are based on
    management’s best knowledge of current events and actions
    we may undertake in the future. Actual results may ultimately
    differ from estimates.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated
    financial statements include our accounts and those of our
    subsidiaries. Significant intercompany balances and transactions
    have been eliminated. To the extent a subsidiary is not
    wholly-owned, any related minority interest is included in Other
    liabilities; applicable (income) expense attributable to the
    minority interest is included in Other (income) expense, net.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue when
    the earnings process is complete. This generally occurs when
    (i) products are shipped to the customer in accordance with
    the terms of sale, (ii) title and risk of loss have been
    transferred and (iii) collectibility is reasonably assured.
    Net sales are reduced, at the time revenue is recognized, by
    accruing for applicable discounts, rebates and sales allowances
    based on historical experience. Related accruals are included in
    accrued liabilities.

Foreign Currency Translation

We translate the
    assets and liabilities of

non-U.S. subsidiaries

into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates. Income and
    expense items are translated at average exchange rates during
    the year. Cumulative translation adjustments are shown as a
    separate component of Shareholders’ Equity.

Research and Development

All research and
    development costs are expensed as incurred.

Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents include
    highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or
    less at date of purchase.

Other Receivables

Other receivables consist
    primarily of Value Added Tax (VAT) receivables in the various
    countries in which we operate. VAT receivables are recorded when
    goods are received and are normally recoverable within
    30 days.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the
    lower of cost (on weighted average basis) or market. Our
    inventories consisted of the following:

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant
    and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is calculated
    on a straight-line basis, principally over the following
    estimated useful lives: buildings and improvements, 10 to
    40 years; machinery and equipment, 3 to 10 years;
    information technology hardware and software, 3 to 7 years;
    and leasehold improvements which are included in buildings and
    improvements, the estimated life of the improvements or the
    remaining term of the lease, whichever is shorter. We
    periodically evaluate whether current events or circumstances
    indicate that the carrying value of our depreciable assets may
    not be recoverable.



INTERNATIONAL
    FLAVORS & FRAGRANCES INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill
    represents the difference between the total purchase price and
    the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired
    in business acquisitions.

We perform a goodwill impairment test on at least an annual
    basis or more frequently in certain circumstances, by assessing
    the fair value of our reporting units based upon both discounted
    cash flows and comparison of multiples of comparable companies.
    We deem goodwill to be impaired if the carrying amount of the
    reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value. We completed
    our goodwill impairment assessment, which indicated no
    impairment of goodwill.

Other intangible assets include patents, trademarks and other
    intellectual property valued at acquisition, and amortized on a
    straight-line basis over periods ranging from 6 to 20 years.

We review our long-lived assets for impairment when events or
    changes in business conditions indicate that their full carrying
    value may not be recovered. An estimate of undiscounted future
    cash flows produced by an asset or group of assets is compared
    to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. If
    assets are determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based
    on an estimate of fair value using various valuation techniques,
    including a discounted estimate of future cash flows.

Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes reflect the
    impact of temporary differences between the amount of assets and
    liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such
    amounts recognized for tax purposes, based on tax laws as
    currently enacted. Additional taxes which would result from
    distributions by subsidiary companies to the parent are provided
    to the extent anticipated. No provision is made for additional
    taxes on undistributed earnings of subsidiary companies that are
    intended to be indefinitely invested in such subsidiaries. No
    income tax benefit is attributed to the currency translation
    component of Accumulated other comprehensive income
    (“AOCI”).

Retirement Benefits

Current service costs of
    retirement plans and postretirement health care and life
    insurance benefits are accrued currently. Prior service costs
    resulting from plan improvements are amortized over periods
    ranging from 10 to 20 years.

Financial Instruments

We use derivative
    financial instruments to manage interest and foreign currency
    exposures. The gain or loss on the hedging instrument is
    recorded in earnings at the same time as the transaction being
    hedged is recorded in earnings. The associated asset or
    liability related to the open hedge instrument is recorded in
    Current assets or Current liabilities, as applicable.

We record all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at
    fair value. Changes in a derivative’s fair value are
    recognized in earnings unless specific hedge criteria are met.
    If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the
    changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged
    item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in the
    consolidated statement of earnings. If the derivative is
    designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of
    changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in AOCI
    and are subsequently recognized in the consolidated statement of
    earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. Ineffective
    portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges, if
    any, are recognized as a charge or credit to earnings.

Software Costs

We capitalize direct internal
    and external development costs for certain significant projects
    associated with internal-use software and amortize these costs
    over 7 years. Neither preliminary evaluation costs nor
    costs associated with the software after implementation are
    capitalized. Costs related to projects that are not significant
    are expensed as incurred.

Shipping and Handling Costs

Net sales include
    shipping and handling charges billed to customers. Cost of goods
    sold includes all costs incurred in connection with shipping and
    handling.



INTERNATIONAL
    FLAVORS & FRAGRANCES INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Net Income Per Share

Net income per share is
    based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding. A
    reconciliation of shares used in the computations of basic and
    diluted net income per share is as follows:

Number of Shares

(SHARES IN THOUSANDS)




Basic

79,032

86,541

90,443

Dilution under stock plans


1,092


Diluted

79,964

87,633

91,369

Net income used in the computation of net income per share is
    unaffected by the assumed issuance of stock under our stock
    plans.

Options to purchase 798,000, 248,000 and 309,000 shares
    were outstanding at December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006,
    respectively, but not included in the computation of diluted net
    income per share because the exercise prices were greater than
    the average market price of the common shares in the respective
    years.

Stock-Based Compensation

We have stock-based
    compensation plans which are described more fully in
    Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We
    adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R)
    “Share-Based Payment” (“FAS 123R”)
    using the modified prospective method, which requires
    measurement of compensation cost of all stock-based awards at
    fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation
    expense over the service periods for awards expected to vest.
    Under this transition method, 2006 compensation cost includes
    the portion vesting in the year for (1) all share-based
    payments granted prior to, but not vested, as of January 1,
    2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance
    with the original provisions of FAS 123 “Accounting
    for Stock-Based Compensation” (“FAS 123”),
    and (2) all share-based payments granted subsequent to
    January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value
    estimated in accordance with the provisions of FAS 123R.
    The cost of employee stock options will be recognized on a
    straight-line attribution basis over their respective vesting
    periods, net of estimated forfeitures.

New
    Accounting Standards

In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (“SFAS”) No. 141 (revised 2007),
    “Business Combinations” (“FAS 141(R)”).
    FAS 141 (R) requires the measurement at fair value of
    assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling
    interest in the acquiree as of the acquisition date.
    SFAS 141(R) also requires that acquisition related costs
    and costs to restructure be expensed as incurred. We do not
    expect the adoption of FAS 141(R), which is effective for
    fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008, to
    have an impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. A
    significant impact may, however, result from any future business
    acquisitions.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
    “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51”
    (“FAS 160”)

FAS 160 establishes
    accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling
    interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a
    subsidiary. It also amends certain of ARB No. 51’s
    consolidation procedures for consistency with the requirements
    of FAS 141(R). This statement is effective for fiscal years
    beginning on or after December 15, 2008 and shall be
    applied prospectively as of the beginning of the year of
    adoption. We do not expect the adoption of FAS 160 to have
    a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,
    “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133”
    (“FAS 161”). FAS 161 amends and expands the
    disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 133 with the
    intent to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced
    understanding of: (i) how and why an entity uses derivative
    instruments; (ii) how derivative instruments and related
    hedged items are accounted for under SFAS 133 and its
    related interpretations and (iii) how derivative
    instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s
    financial position statements. This statement is effective for

fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, with early
    application encouraged. We are currently evaluating the impact
    of FAS 161 on the disclosures in our Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, “The
    Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles”
    (“FAS 162”). FAS 162 identifies the sources
    of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the
    principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements
    presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting
    principles in the United States of America. FAS 162 will be
    effective 60 days following the SEC’s approval of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) amendments to
    AU Section 411, “The Meaning of Present Fairly in
    Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles”.
    We are currently evaluating the potential impact of
    FAS 162, but do not believe its adoption will have a
    material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In June 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
    (“FSP”) Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)

No. 03-6-1,

“Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based
    Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities”
    (“FSP

EITF 03-6-1”),

which classifies unvested share-based payment awards that
    contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend
    equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) as participating securities
    and requires them to be included in the computation of earnings
    per share pursuant to the two-class method described in
    SFAS No. 128, “Earnings per Share”. This
    Staff Position is to be applied retrospectively and is effective
    for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2008. We have issued Purchase Restricted Stock
    (“PRS”) to certain eligible employees. The unvested
    portion of such PRS contains a nonforfeitable right to dividends
    paid by us, and as such, are participating securities and shall
    be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to
    the two-class method. We are currently evaluating the potential
    impact of FSP

EITF 03-6-1,

but do not believe its adoption will have a material impact on
    our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP

FAS No. 132(R)-1,

“Employers’ Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit
    Plan Assets” (“FSP

FAS 132(R)-1”).

FSP

FAS 132(R)-1

expands the disclosure requirements of FAS No. 132(R)
    with the intent to provide users of financial statements with an
    enhanced understanding of: (i) how investment allocation
    decisions are made, including the investment policies and
    strategies used, (ii) the major categories of plan assets,
    (iii) the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure
    the fair value of plan assets, (iv) the effect of fair
    value measurements using significant unobservable inputs
    (Level 3) on changes in plan assets and
    (v) significant concentrations of risk within plan assets.
    This statement is to be applied prospectively, effective for
    fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009, with early
    application permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of
    FSP

FAS 132(R)-1

on the disclosures in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Accounting
    Changes:

Fair
    Value Measurements (SFAS 157)

We adopted SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value
    Measurements” (“FAS 157”), as of
    January 1, 2008. FAS 157 defines fair value, expands
    disclosure requirements around fair value and specifies a
    hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to
    those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable.
    Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent
    sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market
    assumptions. These two types of inputs create the following fair
    value hierarchy:

•

Level 1 — Quoted prices for

identical

instruments in active markets.

•

Level 2 — Quoted prices for

similar

instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical
    or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and
    model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and
    significant value drivers are observable in active markets.

•

Level 3 — Valuations derived from valuation
    techniques in which one or more significant inputs or
    significant value drivers are unobservable.



INTERNATIONAL
    FLAVORS & FRAGRANCES INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

This hierarchy requires us to use observable market data, when
    available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when
    determining fair value.

FAS 157 requires that we consider our own credit risk when
    measuring fair value. Adoption of FAS 157 has also resulted
    in some other changes to valuation techniques used when
    determining fair value, most notably changes to the way that the
    probability of default of a counterparty is factored in. The
    change in fair value of these liabilities due to such changes in
    our own credit risk (or instrument-specific credit risk) was
    immaterial.

EITF

No. 06-4

In March 2006, the FASB issued EITF

No. 06-4,

“Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement
    Benefit Aspects of Endorsement Split-Dollar Life Insurance
    Arrangements”

(“EITF 06-4”).

EITF 06-4

clarifies that for an endorsement split-dollar life insurance
    arrangement, an employer should recognize a liability for future
    benefits and related compensation expense if the employer has
    effectively agreed to provide a benefit to an employee that
    extends to postretirement periods. EITF

No. 06-4

is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2007. The transition provisions require entities to recognize
    the effects of applying

EITF 06-4

through either (a) a change in accounting principle through
    a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings or to other
    components of equity or net assets in the statement of financial
    position as of the beginning of the year of adoption or
    (b) a change in accounting principle through retrospective
    application to all prior periods.

We adopted

EITF 06-4

on January 1, 2008. As a result of the adoption of

EITF 06-4,

we recognized a cumulative effect of a change in accounting
    principle adjustment of $10 million, net of related
    deferred income taxes of $5.5 million, which decreased
    beginning retained earnings in the shareholders’ equity
    component of the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet for the
    year ended December 31, 2008. We estimate additional
    expense of approximately $1 million per year as a result of
    this change in accounting.

Reclassifications and revisions

Certain
    reclassifications have been made to the prior years’
    financial statements to conform to the 2008 presentation. In
    addition, current assets decreased $34 million, non-current
    assets increased $34 million, current liabilities increased
    $5 million, non-current liabilities decreased
    $5 million for 2007 primarily to properly reflect our
    current and long-term deferred tax assets and liabilities that
    were previously shown as net deferred tax assets on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet.

NOTE 2.

RESTRUCTURING
    AND OTHER CHARGES

In 2008, as part of our business transformation initiative to
    enable us to better leverage our global SAP software platform,
    we implemented a plan to centralize transaction processing in a
    global shared service center that resulted in the elimination of
    127 positions globally, largely in the finance area. As a result
    of these actions, we recognized a pre-tax charge of
    approximately $7 million in 2008 related to employee
    separation costs and $2 million in implementation costs.
    The implementation costs were included in selling and
    administrative expenses in 2008. In addition, we incurred a
    pre-tax charge of $12 million in the fourth quarter 2008
    principally related to a performance improvement plan covering
    91 positions across a variety of activities globally.

The balance of the employee-related liabilities is expected to
    be utilized by the end of 2010 as obligations are satisfied.

In 2005, we eliminated positions in manufacturing, selling,
    research and administration functions, principally in our
    European and North American operating regions. As a result of
    these actions, restructuring charges, relating primarily to
    employee separation expenses, of $3 million were recognized
    in 2006.

Commercial paper issued by us generally has terms of
    30 days or less; there were no outstanding commercial paper
    borrowings at December 31, 2008 or 2007.

In November 2008, we entered into a credit agreement denominated
    in Japanese Yen in the original principal amount of
    ¥13.3 billion due on November 21, 2011
    (“Japanese Yen Loan — 2008”). We used the
    proceeds of this loan to repay our then existing 2.400%
    (Japanese Yen) Guaranteed Senior Notes, Series A, which
    matured on such date. The Japanese Yen Loan — 2008
    bears interest at a rate based on the TIBOR (Tokyo InterBank
    Offering Rate) plus an applicable margin as determined based on
    our credit rating.

In 2005, IFF, including certain subsidiaries, entered into a
    revolving credit agreement (the “Facility”) with
    certain banks. The Facility provides for a five-year US
    $350 million (“Tranche A”) and
    Euro 400 million (“Tranche B”)
    multi-currency revolving credit facility. Tranche A is
    available to IFF for commercial paper backstop and general
    corporate purposes; Tranche B is available to both IFF and
    the European subsidiaries for general corporate purposes.
    Borrowings under the Facility bear interest at an annual rate of
    LIBOR (London InterBank Offer Rate) (or in relation to any
    Euro-denominated loans, EURIBOR, European InterBank Offer Rate)
    plus a margin, currently 20 basis points, linked to our
    credit rating. We pay a commitment fee on the aggregate unused
    commitments and a utilization fee based on amounts outstanding
    under the Facility; such fees are not material. As permitted by
    the Facility, in 2007, the termination dates were extended by
    one year until November 23, 2012. The Facility contains
    various affirmative and negative covenants, including the
    requirement for us to maintain, at the end of each fiscal
    quarter, a ratio of net debt for borrowed money to adjusted
    EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and
    Amortization) in respect of the previous

12-month

period of not more than 3.25 to 1. We have complied with this
    covenant at all times. As the Facility is a multi-year revolving
    credit agreement, we classify the portion we expect to have
    outstanding longer than 12 months as long-term debt. At
    December 31, 2008, approximately $142 million of bank
    borrowings on the Tranche B was classified as long-term
    debt, and the remaining $38 million was classified as
    current portion of long-term debt.



INTERNATIONAL
    FLAVORS & FRAGRANCES INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Short-term bank loans primarily in the form of overdrafts, in
    addition to the Facility, were outstanding in several countries
    and averaged $19 million in 2008, compared with
    $26 million in 2007. The highest levels were
    $52 million in 2008, $66 million in 2007, and
    $31 million in 2006. The 2008 weighted average interest
    rate of these bank loans, based on balances outstanding at the
    end of each month, was 4.8% and the average rate on balances
    outstanding at December 31, 2008 was 6.0%. These rates
    compare with 4.6% and 5.1%, respectively, in 2007, and 3.9% and
    4.7%, respectively, in 2006.

On September 27, 2007, we issued $500 million of
    Senior Unsecured Notes (“Senior Notes —
    2007”) in four series under the Note Purchase Agreement
    (“NPA”): (i) $250 million in aggregate
    principal amount of 6.25% Series A Senior Notes due
    September 27, 2017, (ii) $100 million in
    aggregate principal amount of 6.35% Series B Notes due
    September 27, 2019, (iii) $50 million in
    aggregate principal amount of 6.50% Series C Notes due
    September 27, 2022, and (iv) $100 million in
    aggregate principal amount of 6.79% Series D Notes due
    September 27, 2027. Proceeds of the offering were used
    primarily to fund an accelerated repurchase of IFF stock.

In 2006, we issued $375 million of Senior Unsecured Notes
    (“Senior Notes - 2006”) in four series under another
    NPA: (i) $50 million in aggregate principal amount of
    5.89% Series A Senior Notes due July 12, 2009,
    (ii) $100 million in aggregate principal amount of
    5.96% Series B Notes due July 12, 2011,
    (iii) $100 million in aggregate principal amount of
    6.05% Series C Notes due July 12, 2013, and
    (iv) $125 million in aggregate principal amount of
    6.14% Series D Notes due July 12, 2016. Proceeds of
    the offering were used primarily to repay commercial paper
    borrowings used to fund our maturing debt.

Maturities on debt outstanding at December 31, 2008 are:
    2009, $102 million; 2011, $270 million; 2012,
    $141 million; 2013, $100 million; 2014 and thereafter,
    $625 million. There is no debt maturing in 2010. The
    estimated fair value of our long-term debt at December 31,
    2008 and 2007 approximated the recorded value, except that our
    Senior Notes — 2007 had an estimated fair value of
    approximately $450 million at December 31, 2008. The
    fair value of our long-term debt was calculated using discounted
    cash flows applying interest rates of recent issuances of debt
    with similar terms and maturities for companies with comparable
    credit risk.

In 2002, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements
    effectively converting the fixed rate on our long-term Japanese
    Yen borrowings to a variable short-term rate based on the
    Japanese Yen TIBOR rate plus a markup. These swaps were
    designated as qualified fair value hedges. Prior to 2006 we
    amended the swaps and the counterparty paid us amounts
    aggregating $4 million, including accrued interest. Such
    gains have been deferred and are being amortized over the
    remaining term of the debt. In November 2008, the portion of
    these swaps related to the 13.3 billion Yen notes
    refinanced expired.

In March 2008, we realized an $18 million gain on the
    termination of an interest rate swap, which has been deferred
    and is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over
    the remaining term of the related debt. The balance of this
    deferred gain was $17 million at December 31, 2008.

Total deferred tax assets in 2007 of $94 million is less
    than the $145 previously reported as $19 million was
    reclassed to Prepaid expenses and the remaining $32 million
    to Other Assets. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements, “Reclassifications and Revisions,” for
    additional information.

In 2007, as a result of adopting the FASB issued Interpretation
    No. 48 (“FIN 48”), “Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” we recognized a
    $1 million increase in other liabilities for unrecognized
    tax benefits and a corresponding cumulative effect adjustment to
    Retained earnings. Also as prescribed by FIN 48, certain
    tax related amounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheet are
    classified differently than in prior periods. Amounts receivable
    from various tax jurisdictions have been reclassified to Other
    liabilities.

A reconciliation of the total of unrecognized tax benefits at
    the beginning and end of 2007 and 2008 is as follows:

We have consistently recognized interest and penalties related
    to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax
    expense. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had accrued
    $8 million and $9 million, respectively, of interest
    and penalties classified as Other liabilities.

Net operating loss carryforwards were $172 million and
    $169 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. If unused, $2 million will expire between
    2009 and 2028. The remainder, totaling $170 million, may be
    carried forward indefinitely. Tax credit carryforwards were
    $8 million and $12 million at December 31, 2008
    and December 31, 2007, respectively. If unused, the credit
    carryforwards will expire between 2009 and 2028.

Of the $180 million deferred tax asset for net operating
    loss carryforwards and credits at December 31, 2008, we
    consider it unlikely that a portion of the tax benefit will be
    realized. Accordingly, a $172 million and $6 million
    valuation allowance has been established against these deferred
    tax assets, respectively.

Tax benefits credited to Shareholders’ equity totaled less
    than  $1 million and $7 million for 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes associated
    with the repatriation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries were
    not provided on a cumulative total of $683 million of
    undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. We intend to
    reinvest these earnings indefinitely in our foreign
    subsidiaries. Any additional U.S. taxes payable on the
    remaining foreign earnings, if remitted, would be substantially
    offset by credits for foreign taxes already paid.

We have several tax audits in process and have open tax years
    with various significant taxing jurisdictions that range
    primarily from 2002 to 2007. Based on currently available
    information, we do not believe the ultimate outcome of these tax
    audits and other tax positions related to open tax years, when
    finalized, will have a material adverse effect on our financial
    position, results of operations or cash flows.

NOTE 10.

SHAREHOLDERS’
    EQUITY

In July 2007, our Board authorized us to repurchase up to 15% or
    $750 million worth of our then outstanding common stock,
    whichever is less (the “July 2007 Plan”). In September
    2007, under the July 2007 Plan, we entered into two agreements
    to purchase shares of our common stock under a $450 million
    accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) program. The ASR
    concluded in June 2008. Total aggregate shares repurchased under
    the ASR program were 9.7 million shares at an average
    purchase price of $46.53 per share.

On March 9, 2000, we adopted a shareholder protection
    rights agreement (the “Rights Agreement”) and declared
    a dividend of one right on each share of common stock
    outstanding on March 24, 2000 or issued thereafter.

Under the Rights Agreement, as amended, until a person or group
    acquires 15% or more of our common stock or commences a tender
    offer that would result in such person’s or group’s
    owning 15% or more, the rights are evidenced by the common stock
    certificates, automatically trade with the common stock and are
    not exercisable.

Thereafter, if we are involved in a merger or sell more than 50%
    of our assets or earnings power, each right entitles its holder
    to purchase a certain number of shares for a specified exercise
    price. Also, under certain circumstances, our Board has the
    option to redeem or exchange one share of common stock for each
    right. Finally, in the event a new Board is elected in a
    successful proxy contest, (i) the rights may not be
    redeemed and no business combination with us can be effected for
    180 days thereafter unless certain procedures are followed
    to ensure (A) that steps are taken to maximize shareholder
    value, or (B) that any decision to redeem the rights, if
    challenged, would meet an “entire fairness” test; and
    (ii) the Rights Agreement may not be amended during such

180-day

period. To establish “entire fairness” in connection
    with a redemption, the new Board must be able to demonstrate
    that all aspects of the redemption decision were fair, including
    the redemption procedure and the financial terms of the
    redemption. The Rights Agreement expires in March 2010.

Dividends declared per share were $0.96, $0.88 and $0.765 in
    2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

NOTE 11.

STOCK
    COMPENSATION PLANS

We have various equity plans under which our officers, senior
    management, other key employees and directors may be granted
    options to purchase IFF common stock or other forms of
    equity-based awards. Beginning in 2004, we granted Restricted
    Stock Units (“RSU’s”) as the principal element of
    our equity compensation for all eligible U.S.-based employees
    and a majority of eligible overseas employees. Vesting of the
    RSU’s for officers and senior management has been
    performance and time based, and for the remainder of eligible
    employees, vesting is solely time based; the vesting period is
    primarily three years from date of grant. For a small group of
    employees, primarily overseas, we continue to grant stock
    options.

On January 1, 2006, we adopted FAS 123(R), and thereby
    recognized the cost of all employee stock options on a
    straight-line attribution basis over their respective vesting
    periods, net of estimated forfeitures. Total stock-based
    compensation expense included in our Consolidated Statement of
    Income for 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $17 million
    ($11 net of tax), $18 million ($12 net of tax),
    $18 million ($12 net of tax), respectively.

Under our 2000 Stock Award and Incentive Plan (“2000
    SAIP”) the issuance of 9 million shares was authorized
    by the Board and approximately 2 million shares available
    under a previous plan were rolled into the 2000 SAIP making the
    total number of available shares approximately 11 million
    to satisfy awards. At December 31, 2008,
    3,346,043 shares were subject to outstanding awards and
    988,188 shares remained available for future awards.

In 2006, our Board approved a Long-Term Incentive Plan
    (“LTIP”) for senior management under our 2000 SAIP for
    the years 2006 – 2008 (“Cycle VI”). Under
    Cycle VI, each participant has a range of awards that would be
    paid out 50% in cash and 50% in IFF stock at the end of the
    three-year cycle. The portion that would be paid in equity would
    not be determined until the end of the LTIP cycle. Because the
    number of shares is not fixed at the time of the award we
    account for these awards as liability based awards and recognize
    compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the
    three-year period based on the fair value of our stock at the
    end of each year and the expected payout based on the percent of
    performance achieved to date. Cycle VI concluded at the end of
    2008 and an aggregate 116,247 shares of common stock were
    issued in February 2009.

Beginning with the LTIP

2007-2009

cycle and thereafter, the targeted payout is 50% cash and 50%
    IFF stock at the end of the three-year cycle and provides for
    segmentation in which one-fourth of the award vests during each
    twelve-month period, with the final one-fourth segment vesting
    over the full three-year period. These awards are earned based
    on the achievement of defined EPS targets and our performance
    ranking of total shareholder return as a percentile of the
    S&P 500. When the award is granted, 50% of the target
    dollar value of the award is converted to a number of
    “notional” shares based on the closing price on the
    date the grant is approved by the Board. Because the award vests
    over the three-year cycle, the graded-vesting attribution method
    is used to recognize compensation expense over the cycle.

In 2006, our Board approved the Equity Choice Program (the
    “Program”) for senior management under our 2000 SAIP.
    Under the Program, eligible employees can choose from among
    three equity alternatives and will be granted such equity awards
    up to certain dollar awards depending on the participant’s
    grade level. A participant may choose among (1) Purchase
    Restricted Stock (“PRS”), (2) Stock Settled
    Appreciation Rights (“SSAR’s”) or
    (3) RSU’s. The balance of employees who are not
    eligible under the Program receive RSU’s or, as noted
    above, options.

Purchase
    Restricted Stock

PRS provides for the participant to purchase restricted shares
    of IFF stock at 50% of the fair market value on the grant date
    of the award. The shares vest on the third anniversary of the
    grant date, are subject to employment and other specified
    conditions, and pay dividends if and when paid by us. Holders of
    PRS have, in most instances, all of the rights of stockholders,
    except that they may not sell, assign, pledge or otherwise
    encumber such shares. RSU’s



INTERNATIONAL

provide no such rights. We issued 102,812 shares of PRS in
    2008 for an aggregate purchase price of $2 million and
    209,920 shares in 2007 for $5 million.

Stock
    Options and SSAR’s

Stock options granted vest in periods ranging from one to three
    years and have a maximum term of ten years. SSAR’s become
    exercisable on the third anniversary of the grant date and have
    a maximum term of seven years. We awarded 299,307 SSAR’s
    and no stock options in 2008. In 2007 we awarded stock options
    and SSAR’s of 188,000 and 66,493, respectively.

We use the Binomial lattice-pricing as our valuation model for
    estimating the fair value of options granted. In applying the
    Binomial model, we utilize historical information to estimate
    expected term and forfeitures within the model. The expected
    term of an option is based on historical employee exercise
    behavior, vesting terms and a contractual life of primarily ten
    years for options and seven years for SSAR’s. The risk-free
    interest rate for periods within the expected term of the award
    is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the
    time of grant. Expected volatility is based on an average of
    implied and historical volatility of the price of our common
    stock over the calculated expected term. We anticipate paying
    cash dividends in the future and therefore use an expected
    dividend yield in the valuation model; the cash dividend in
    effect at the time of grant was employed in this calculation.

    2008, 2007 and 2006 were:

As of December 31, 2008, there was $3.4 million of

Restricted
    Stock and Units

We may grant restricted shares and RSU’s to eligible
    employees. Such restricted shares and RSU’s are subject to
    forfeiture if certain employment conditions are not met.
    RSU’s generally vest 100% at the end of three years with no
    performance criteria; however, RSU’s granted to all
    officers and senior management in 2005 contained a performance
    restriction since achieved and vested at the end of their
    three-year term. The fair value of the RSU’s is equal to
    the market price of our stock at date of grant and is amortized
    to expense ratably over the vesting period.

NOTE 12.

SEGMENT
    INFORMATION

We are organized into two business segments, Flavors and
    Fragrances; these segments align with the internal structure
    used to manage these businesses. Flavor compounds are sold to
    the food and beverage industries for use in consumer products
    such as prepared foods, beverages, dairy, food and confectionery
    products. The Fragrance business unit, is comprised of three
    fragrance categories: functional fragrances, including fragrance
    compounds for personal care (e.g., soaps) and household products
    (e.g., detergents and cleaning agents); fine fragrance and
    beauty care, including perfumes, colognes and toiletries; and
    ingredients, consisting of synthetic ingredients that can be
    combined with other materials to create unique functional and
    fine fragrance compounds. Major fragrance customers include the
    cosmetics industry, including perfume and toiletries
    manufacturers, and the household products industry, including
    manufacturers of soaps, detergents, fabric care, household
    cleaners and air fresheners.

We evaluate the performance of business units based on operating
    profit before interest expense, other income (expense), net and
    income taxes. The Global expense caption represents corporate
    and headquarters-related expenses which include legal, finance,
    human resources and other administrative expenses that are not
    allocated to individual business units. In addition, in the year
    ended December 31, 2008 Global expenses include
    approximately $2 million of implementation costs related to
    the global shared service project, $3 million for employee
    separation costs and $10 million of restructuring costs
    offset by a $3 million benefit from an insurance recovery
    related to a prior year product contamination matter. In the
    year ended December 31, 2007, Global expenses include a
    pension curtailment charge of $6 million. Unallocated
    assets are principally cash, short-term investments and other
    corporate and headquarters-related assets.

POSTRETIREMENT
    BENEFITS

We, including some of our subsidiaries, have pension

and/or

other
    retirement benefit plans covering substantially all employees.
    Pension benefits are generally based on years of service and on
    compensation during the final years of employment. Plan assets
    consist primarily of equity securities and corporate and
    government fixed income securities. Substantially all pension
    benefit costs are funded as accrued; such funding is limited,
    where applicable, to amounts deductible for income tax purposes.
    Certain other retirement benefits are provided by balance sheet
    accruals.

We sponsor a qualified defined contribution plan covering
    substantially all U.S. employees. Under this plan, we match
    100% of participants’ contributions up to 4% of
    compensation and 75% of participants’ contributions from
    over 4% to 8%. Employees that are still eligible to accrue
    benefits under the defined benefit plan are limited to a 50%
    match up to 6% of the participants’ compensation.

In addition to pension benefits, certain health care and life
    insurance benefits are provided to qualifying United States
    employees upon retirement from IFF. Such coverage is provided
    through insurance plans with premiums based on benefits paid. We
    do not generally provide health care or life insurance coverage
    for retired employees of foreign subsidiaries; such benefits are
    provided in most foreign countries by government-sponsored
    plans, and the cost of these programs is not significant to us.

The plan assets and benefit obligations of our defined benefit
    pension plans are measured at December 31 of each year.

In 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 158,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans”. The initial impact of the
    standard due to unrecognized prior service costs or credits and
    net actuarial gains or losses as well as subsequent changes in
    the funded status is recognized as a component of accumulated
    other comprehensive income AOCI in Shareholders’ equity.

With respect to the U.S. plans, the expected return on plan
    assets was determined based on an asset allocation model using
    the current benchmark allocation, real rates of return by asset
    class and an anticipated inflation rate. The benchmark asset
    allocation was 10 — 20% employed in cash and fixed
    income investments expected to yield



INTERNATIONAL
    FLAVORS & FRAGRANCES INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

1.0%; 10 — 20% employed in corporate and government
    bonds expected to yield 2.1%; and 65 — 75% in equity
    investments with a long-term expected yield of 8.5 —
    9.3%. The inflation rate assumed in the model was 2.5%. The
    U.S. plan has employed a similar asset allocation strategy
    for the prior 20 years and has achieved a compounded annual
    return of approximately 9% during this period. The expected
    annual rate of return for the

non-U.S. plans

employs a similar set of criteria adapted for local investments,
    inflation rates and in certain cases specific government
    requirements. The discount rate used for determining future
    pension obligations for each individual plan is based on a
    review of long-term bonds that receive a high rating from a
    recognized rating agency. Additionally, for the U.S. plans,
    the discount rate was based on the internal rate of return for a
    portfolio of Moody’s Aa3-rated bonds with maturities that
    are consistent with the projected future benefit payment
    obligations of the plan. The rate of compensation increase is
    based on plan experience.

In 2008, the percentage of assets held in equities decreased
    primarily as a result of the performance of the equity
    investment portfolio. There has been no change in our long-term
    allocation.

Equity investments include our common stock valued at
    $9 million (4% of total plan assets) and $14 million
    (4% of total plan assets) at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

Total

non-U.S. plan

assets consist of a blend of various asset mixes defined by each
    plan’s liability profile and country or statutory
    requirements. Each plan maintains an investment policy
    appropriate to meet its benefit obligations.

The following weighted average assumptions were used to
    determine our postretirement benefit expense and obligation for

The effect of a 1% increase in the medical cost trend rate would
    increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation, and
    the annual postretirement expense, by approximately
    $6 million and $2 million, respectively; a 1% decrease
    in the rate would decrease the obligation and expense by
    approximately $6 million and $1 million, respectively.

We contributed $6 million and $22 million to our
    qualified U.S. pension plans and

non-U.S. pension

plans in 2008. In addition, $4 million of benefit payments
    were made with respect to the U.S. non-qualified plan.

The global credit crisis has significantly increased volatility
    in the financial markets. The financial returns of our
    investment trusts during 2008 have been in-line with the markets
    by asset class. We had little exposure to financial equities and
    had no direct investments in sub-prime related assets. We do not
    expect the recent market declines to have a significant impact
    on our overall funding position or the timing and level of
    contributions.

In 2007, we amended our U.S. salaried qualified and
    non-qualified pension plans under which accrual of future
    benefits was suspended for all participants that did not meet
    the rule of 70 (age plus years of service equal at least
    70) at December 31, 2007. As a result of this
    suspension, we recorded a curtailment loss of $5.9 million
    to recognize a portion of the unrecognized prior service costs
    associated with years of service no longer expected to be
    rendered and credited as service under the plans.

NOTE 14.

FINANCIAL
    INSTRUMENTS

Fair
    Value

Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted FAS 157 for
    financial assets and liabilities, which defines fair value,
    establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and
    expands disclosure requirements about fair value measurements.
    FAS 157 requires us to maximize the use of observable
    inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when
    measuring fair value. Nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial
    liabilities include those measured at fair value in goodwill
    impairment testing, indefinite lived intangible assets measured
    at fair value for impairment testing and asset retirement
    obligations initially measured at fair value.

As a result of the adoption of FAS 157, we have made some
    amendments to the techniques used in measuring the fair value of
    derivative and other positions. These amendments change the way
    that the probability of default by a counterparty is factored
    into the valuation of derivative positions, and include for the
    first time the impact of our own credit risk on derivatives and
    other liabilities measured at fair value.

Determination
    of Fair Value

When available, we generally use quoted market prices to
    determine fair value, and classify such items in Level 1.
    We determine the fair value of structured liabilities (where
    performance is linked to structured interest rates, inflation or
    currency risks) using the LIBOR swap curve and forward interest
    and exchange rates at period end. Such instruments are
    classified as Level 2 based on the observability of
    significant inputs to the model. The fair value of these
    liabilities was approximately $56 million at
    December 31, 2008.

The market valuation adjustments include a bilateral or
    “own” credit risk adjustment applied to reflect our
    own credit risk when valuing all liabilities measured at fair
    value, in accordance with the requirements of FAS 157. The
    methodology is consistent with that applied in generating
    counterparty credit risk adjustments, but incorporates our



INTERNATIONAL
    FLAVORS & FRAGRANCES INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

own credit risk as observed in the credit default swap market.
    As for counterparty credit risk, our own credit risk adjustments
    include the impact of credit risk mitigants. The estimated
    change in the fair value of these liabilities due to such
    changes in our own credit risk (or instrument-specific credit
    risk) was immaterial.

We enter into foreign currency forward contracts with the
    objective of reducing exposure to cash flow volatility
    associated with foreign currency receivables and payables, and
    with anticipated purchases of certain raw materials used in
    operations. These contracts, the counterparties to which are
    major international financial institutions, generally involve
    the exchange of one currency for a second currency at a future
    date, and have maturities not exceeding six months. The notional
    amount and maturity dates of such contracts match those of the
    underlying transactions. The gain or loss on the hedging
    instrument is recorded in earnings at the same time as the
    transaction being hedged is recorded in earnings. The associated
    asset or liability related to the open hedge instrument is
    recorded in Current assets or Current liabilities, as applicable.

In 2003, we executed a

10-year

Yen — U.S. dollar currency swap related to the
    monthly sale and purchase of products between the U.S. and
    Japan. The annual notional value of this swap is approximately
    $5 million. As of December 31, 2008, the cash flow
    hedge experienced no ineffectiveness and therefore no net gain
    or loss is recognized in earnings during the reporting period.
    In addition, no component of the derivative instruments’
    gain or loss is excluded from the assessment of hedge
    effectiveness. Interest income on the periodic settlement and
    the foreign exchange gain/loss on the closed out portion of the
    hedge is recorded in current income. Any gain or loss on the
    hedge is offset by a corresponding change in the
    receivable/revenue exchange rate. The gain or loss in the change
    in fair value of the remaining hedge balance outstanding is
    marked to market in AOCI as a hedge of forecasted future cash
    flow and released month by month through earnings over the
    ten-year period of the hedge.

We employ various interest rate swaps and debt issuances with
    the objective of managing and optimizing our interest rate
    exposure. In September 2007, we entered into a $250 million
    interest rate swap agreement effectively converting the fixed
    rate on our long-term U.S. dollar borrowings to a variable
    short-term rate based on USD LIBOR rate plus markup. In March
    2008, we realized an $18 million gain on termination of
    this swap, which has been deferred and is being amortized as a
    reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the
    related debt. During 2008, we entered into a similar interest
    rate swap and then in October 2008 we liquidated this position
    at no cost.

In September 2007 and January 2006, we entered into a
    $250 million and a $300 million Cross Currency
    Interest Rate Swap, respectively, to hedge a portion of our
    consolidated EUR net investment. The derivative was structured
    as a swap of floating USD LIBOR to floating EURIBOR, with both
    floating interest rates reset and paid semi-annually. Because
    the derivatives are structured as a floating to floating swap,
    the only value, other than that derived from changes in the
    foreign exchange (FX) spot rate, are interest rate accruals
    which are reset semi-annually. These accruals are netted and
    booked in current earnings. Mark-to-market changes due to
    differences in the underlying FX rate are recorded in AOCI and
    provide an offset to the cumulative translation adjustment of
    the underlying Euro assets being hedged, which are also being
    valued based on changes in the FX spot rate. Effectiveness is
    assessed quarterly. At maturity, or if the swap is terminated
    early, any gain or loss will be recorded to AOCI until the Euro
    net investment is divested. In October 2008, we closed out the
    $250 million USD LIBOR to EURIBOR interest rate swap at no
    cost. In February 2009 we terminated the $300 million USD
    LIBOR to EURIBOR interest rate swap which required us to make a
    payment of $16 million.

In 2002, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements
    effectively converting the fixed rate on our long-term Japanese
    Yen borrowings to a variable short-term rate based on the
    Japanese Yen TIBOR rate plus an interest markup. These swaps are
    designated as qualified fair value hedges. During 2003 and 2005,
    we amended the swaps and the counterparty paid us
    $3 million and $1 million, respectively, including
    accrued interest. Such gains have been deferred, classified as a
    separate component of debt and are amortized over the remaining
    term of the debt. In November 2008, the portion of these swaps
    related to the 13.3 billion Yen notes refinanced expired.
    As of December 31, 2008, the remaining fair value hedge
    experienced no ineffectiveness; therefore no net gain or loss is
    recognized in earnings during the reporting period. In addition,
    no component of the derivative instruments’ gain or



INTERNATIONAL
    FLAVORS & FRAGRANCES INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

loss is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.
    Interest income on the periodic settlement and reset of the
    floating interest rate is recorded in current income and the
    gain or loss in the change in fair value of the underlying debt
    attributable to the hedge risk adjusts the carrying amount of
    the hedged debt and is reflected as a component of income.

NOTE 15.

CONCENTRATIONS
    OF CREDIT RISK

We have no significant concentrations of risk in financial
    instruments. Temporary investments are made in a
    well-diversified portfolio of high-quality, liquid obligations
    of government, corporate and financial institutions. There are
    also limited concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade
    receivables because of the large number of customers spread
    across many industries and geographic regions.

NOTE 16.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases
    are $26 million in 2009, $24 million in 2010,
    $21 million in 2011, $19 million in 2012,
    $17 million in 2013 and from 2014 and thereafter through
    2030, the aggregate lease obligations are $179 million. The
    corresponding rental expense amounted to $28 million,
    $27 million and $25 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. None of our leases contain step rent provisions or
    escalation clauses and they do not require capital improvement
    funding.

We are party to a number of lawsuits and claims related
    primarily to flavoring supplied by us and by other third party
    suppliers, in most instances to manufacturers of butter flavored
    popcorn. A total of 18 actions involving 392 claimants are
    currently pending against us and other flavor suppliers and
    related companies based on similar claims of alleged respiratory
    illness. In certain cases, plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate
    that they have suffered a compensable loss as a result of such
    exposure, or that injuries incurred in fact resulted from
    exposure to our flavor products. In most of the complaints, the
    damages sought by the plaintiffs are not alleged at the pleading
    stage and may not be specified until a much later time in the
    proceeding, if at all. During 2008, there have been 9 new
    actions filed involving 73 claimants and 7 actions involving 23
    claimants have been dismissed or settled for a net out-of-pocket
    amount which is not material to us including insurance recovery.
    In addition, 338 claimants were voluntarily dismissed from
    continuing cases based on a determination that their claims
    lacked merit.

At each balance sheet date, or more frequently as conditions
    warrant, we review the status of each pending claim, as well as
    our insurance coverage for such claims with due consideration
    given to potentially applicable deductibles, retentions and
    reservation of rights under insurance policies with respect to
    all these matters. The liabilities are recorded at
    management’s best estimate of the outcome of the lawsuits
    and claims, taking into consideration the facts and
    circumstances of the individual matters as well as past
    experience on similar matters. Amounts accrued are also based
    upon our historical experience with these claims, including
    claims which have been closed with no liability as well as
    claims settled to date. Settled claims, since the inception of
    the flavor-related claims, have not been material to us in any
    reporting period including insurance recovery. At each balance
    sheet date, the key issues that management assesses are whether
    it is probable that a loss as to asserted or unasserted claims
    has been incurred and if so, whether the amount of loss can be
    reasonably estimated. We are not able to provide an amount or
    range of estimated loss in excess of the liability currently
    accrued at the balance sheet date as to asserted and unasserted
    claims because such estimate cannot reasonably be made.

While the ultimate outcome of any litigation cannot be
    predicted, management believes that adequate provision has been
    made with respect to all known claims. Based on information
    presently available and in light of the merits of its defenses
    and the availability of insurance, we do not expect the outcome
    of the above cases, singly or in the aggregate, to have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
    operation or liquidity. There can be no assurance that future
    events will not require us to increase the amount we have
    accrued for any matter or accrue for a matter that has not been
    previously accrued.



We periodically assess our insurance coverage for all known
    claims, taking into account aggregate coverages by occurrence,
    limits of coverage, self-insured retentions and deductibles,
    historical claims experience and claims experience with insurers.

We record the expected liability with respect to these claims in
    Other liabilities and expected recoveries from our insurance
    carrier group in Other assets. We believe that realization of
    the insurance receivable is probable due to the terms of the
    insurance policies and the payment experience to date of the
    carrier group as it relates to these claims.

Over the past approximately 20 years, various federal and
    state authorities and private parties have claimed that we are a
    Potentially Responsible Party (“PRP”) as a generator
    of waste materials for alleged pollution at a number of waste
    sites operated by third parties located principally in New
    Jersey and have sought to recover costs incurred and to be
    incurred to clean up the sites.

We have been identified as a PRP at ten facilities operated by
    third parties at which investigation

and/or

remediation activities may be ongoing. We analyze our liability
    on a regular basis and accrue for environmental liabilities when
    they are probable and estimable. At December 31, 2008, we
    estimated our share of the total future costs for these sites to
    be less than $5 million.

While joint and several liability is authorized under federal
    and state environmental laws, we believe that the amounts we
    have paid and anticipate paying in the future for

clean-up

costs and damages at all sites are not and will not be material
    to our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
    This conclusion is based upon, among other things, the
    involvement of other PRP’s at most sites, the status of the
    proceedings, including various settlement agreements and consent
    decrees, the extended time period over which payment will likely
    be made and an agreement reached in July 1994 with three of our
    liability insurers pursuant to which defense costs and indemnity
    amounts payable by us in respect of the sites will be shared by
    the insurers up to an agreed amount.
