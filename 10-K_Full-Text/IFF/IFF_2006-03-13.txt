INTERNATIONAL
FLAVORS & FRAGRANCES INC.


PART I

ITEM 1.    BUSINESS.

International Flavors &
Fragrances Inc., incorporated in New York in 1909 and its subsidiaries
(the ‘‘Registrant’’,
‘‘IFF’’ or the
‘‘Company’’), is a leading creator and
manufacturer of flavor and fragrance products used by other
manufacturers to impart or improve flavor or fragrance in a wide
variety of consumer products. Fragrance products are sold principally
to manufacturers of perfumes, cosmetics, toiletries, hair care
products, deodorants, soaps, detergents and air care products; flavor
products are sold principally to manufacturers of prepared foods,
beverages, dairy foods, pharmaceuticals and confectionery products as
well as the food service industry.

The present worldwide scope
of the Company's business is in part the result of the 1958
combination of (i) the business conducted prior to the combination
primarily in the United States by the Company under the name van
Ameringen-Haebler, Inc. (‘‘VAH’’) with (ii) the
business conducted prior to the combination primarily in Europe by N.
V. Polak & Schwarz's Essencefabrieken, a Dutch corporation
(‘‘P & S’’). The P & S enterprise,
founded in Holland in 1889, was also engaged in the manufacture and
sale of flavor and fragrance products, with operations in a number of
countries where VAH was not an important factor. Additionally, in
November  2000, the Company acquired Bush Boake Allen Inc.
(‘‘BBA’’), an international flavor, fragrance
and aroma chemical company.

The Company currently has 30
manufacturing facilities with the major manufacturing facilities
located in the United States, Great Britain, Ireland, the Netherlands,
Spain, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, India, Australia, China, Indonesia,
Japan and Singapore. The remaining manufacturing facilities are located
in 8 other countries. The Company maintains its own sales and
distribution facilities in 31 countries and is represented by sales
agents and distributors in other countries. The Company's
principal executive offices are located at 521 West 57th Street, New
York, New York 10019 (212-765-5500).

MARKETS

Fragrance
products are used by customers in the manufacture of consumer products
such as soaps, detergents, cosmetic creams, lotions and powders,
lipsticks, after-shave lotions, deodorants, hair preparations, candles,
air fresheners and all-purpose cleaners as well as in other consumer
products designed solely to appeal to the sense of smell, such as
perfumes and colognes. The cosmetics industry, including perfume and
toiletries manufacturers, is one of the Company's two largest
fragrance customer groups. Most of the major United States companies in
this industry are customers of the Company, and five of the largest
United States cosmetics companies are among its principal customers.
The household products industry, including soaps and detergents, is the
other important fragrance customer group. Four of the largest United
States household product manufacturers are major customers of the
Company. In the three years ended December  31,  2005,
sales of fragrance products accounted for 57%, 55% and
54%, respectively, of the Company's total sales.

Flavor products are sold principally to the food and beverage
industries for use in consumer products such as soft drinks, candies,
baked goods, desserts, prepared foods, dietary foods, dairy products,
drink powders, pharmaceuticals, snack foods and alcoholic beverages.
Two of the Company's largest customers for flavor products are
major producers of prepared foods and beverages in the United States.
In the three years ended December  31,  2005, sales of
flavor products accounted for 43%, 45% and 46%,
respectively, of the Company's total sales.

PRODUCTS

The Company's principal fragrance and flavor products consist
of compounds of large numbers of ingredients blended under proprietary
formulas created by its perfumers and flavorists. Most of these
compounds contribute the total fragrance or flavor to the consumer
products in which they are used. This fragrance or flavor
characteristic is often a major factor in the public selection and
acceptance of the consumer end product. A smaller number of compounds
are sold to manufacturers who further


blend them to achieve the finished fragrance
or flavor in their products. The Company produces thousands of
compounds, and new compounds are constantly being created in order to
meet the many and changing characteristics of its customers' end
products. Most of the fragrance and flavor compounds are created and
produced for the exclusive use of particular customers. The
Company's products are sold in solid and liquid forms and in
amounts ranging from a few pounds to many tons, depending upon the
nature of the product.

The ingredients used by the Company in
its compounds are both synthetic and natural. The Company manufactures
a substantial portion of the synthetic ingredients. While the major
part of the Company's production of synthetic ingredients is used
in its compounds, a substantial portion is also sold to others. The
natural ingredients are derived from flowers, fruits and other
botanical products as well as from animal products. They contain
varying numbers of organic chemicals, which are responsible for the
fragrance or flavor of the natural product. The natural products are
purchased for the larger part in processed or semi-processed form. Some
are used in compounds in the state in which they are purchased and
others after further processing. Natural products, together with
various chemicals, are also used as raw materials for the manufacture
of synthetic ingredients by chemical processes. The Company's
flavor products also include extracts and seasonings derived from
various fruits, vegetables, nuts, herbs and spices as well as
microbiologically-derived ingredients.

MARKET DEVELOPMENTS

The demand for consumer products utilizing flavors and fragrances
has been stimulated and broadened by changing social habits resulting
from various factors such as increases in personal income, and
dual-earner households, teenage population, leisure time, health
concerns and urbanization and by the continued growth in world
population. In the fragrance field, these developments have expanded
the market for hair care, candles and air care products and deodorant
and personal wash products with finer fragrance quality, as well as the
market for colognes, toilet waters, men's toiletries and other
products beyond traditional luxury items such as perfumes. In the
flavor field, similar market characteristics have stimulated the demand
for products such as convenience foods, soft drinks and low-fat food
products that must conform to expected tastes. New and improved methods
of packaging, application and dispensing have been developed for many
consumer products that utilize some of the Company's flavor or
fragrance products. These developments have called for the creation of
new compounds and ingredients compatible with the newly introduced
materials and methods of application.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND
RESEARCH

The development of new flavors and fragrances is a
complex artistic and technical process calling upon the combined
knowledge and skill of the Company's creative perfumers and
flavorists, and its scientists. With extensive experience, the
perfumers and flavorists continuously advance their skills for creating
fragrances or flavors best suited to the market requirements of the
customers' products.

Scientists from various disciplines
work in project teams with the perfumers and flavorists to develop
fragrance and flavor products with consumer preferred performance
characteristics. Scientific expertise includes: natural products
research, plant science, organic chemistry, analytical chemistry,
biochemistry, microbiology, process engineering, food science, material
science and sensory science. Analytical and sensory science is applied
to understand the complex interactions of the many ingredients in a
consumer product in order to optimize the flavor or fragrance
performance at all points of use. Material science technology is
applied to create controlled release and delivery systems to enhance
flavor and fragrance performance in consumer products. An important
contribution to the creation of new fragrances and flavors is the
discovery and development of new ingredients having improved fragrance
or flavor value. The ingredients research program discovers molecules
found in natural substances and creates new molecules that are
subsequently tested for their fragrance or flavor value. The new
molecules that meet rigorous requirements for commercial development
are subsequently transferred to manufacturing operations for
production.

Creative and technical product development is
conducted in 32 fragrance and flavor laboratories in 23 countries. The
Company maintains a research and development center at Union Beach,


New  Jersey. The Company spent
$179,812,000 in 2005, $175,173,000 in 2004 and $159,286,000 in 2003 on
its research and development activities. These expenditures are
currently expected to increase in 2006 to approximately $190,000,000.
Of the amount expended in 2005 on such activities, 68% was for
fragrances and the balance was for flavors. The Company employed 1,095
persons in 2005 and 1,056 persons in 2004 in such activities.

The business of the Company is not materially dependent upon any
patents, trademarks or licenses.

DISTRIBUTION

Most of
the Company's sales are through its own sales force, operating
from 4 sales offices in the United States and 48 sales offices in 30
foreign countries. Sales in additional countries are made through
agents and distributors. For the year ended December  31,
2005, 29% of the Company's sales were to customers in North
America, 37% in Europe, 17% in Asia Pacific, 13%
in Latin America and 4% in the India Region. For additional
information with respect to the Company's operations by major
geographical region, see Note 13 of the Notes to the Company's
Consolidated Financial Statements.

During 2005, the
Company's 30 largest customers accounted for 56% of its
sales; its five largest customers accounted for approximately
10%, 8%, 6%, 5% and 3%,
respectively, of its sales, and no other single customer accounted for
more than 3% of sales.

GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION

Manufacture and sale of the Company's products are subject to
regulation in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration,
the Agriculture Department, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration, the Drug Enforcement Administration and
state authorities. Foreign subsidiaries are subject to similar
regulation in a number of countries. Compliance with existing
governmental requirements regulating the discharge of materials into
the environment has not materially affected the Company's
operations, earnings or competitive position. The Company expects to
spend in 2006 approximately $6,200,000 in capital projects and
$15,200,000 in operating expenses and governmental charges for the
purpose of complying with such requirements.

RAW MATERIAL
PURCHASES

More than 5,000 different raw materials are purchased
from many sources all over the world. The principal natural raw
material purchases consist of essential oils, extracts and concentrate
derived from fruits, vegetables, flowers, woods and other botanicals,
animal products and raw fruits. The principal synthetic raw material
purchases consist of organic chemicals. The Company believes that
alternate sources of materials are available to enable it to maintain
its competitive position in the event of any interruption in the supply
of raw materials from present sources.

COMPETITION

The
Company has more than 50 competitors in the United States and world
markets. While no single factor is responsible, the Company's
competitive position is based principally on the creative skills of its
perfumers and flavorists, the technological advances resulting from its
research and development, the quality of its customer service, the
support provided by its marketing and application groups, and its
understanding of consumers. The Company believes that it is one of the
largest companies producing and marketing on an international basis a
wide range of fragrance and flavor products for sale to manufacturers
of consumer products. In particular countries and localities, the
Company faces competition from numerous companies specializing in
certain product lines, among which are some companies larger than the
Company and some more important in a particular product line or lines.
Most of the Company's customers do not buy all their fragrance or
flavor products from the same supplier, and some customers make their
own fragrance or flavor compounds with ingredients supplied by the
Company or others.


EMPLOYEE RELATIONS

At
December  31,  2005, the Company employed 5,160 persons, of
whom 1,486 were employed in the United States. The Company has never
experienced a work stoppage or strike and considers its employee
relations to be satisfactory.

Item 1A.    Risk
Factors.

Competitive factors may negatively impact our sales
and marketability.

The market for flavor and fragrance products
is fragmented and highly competitive. IFF competes with many companies
and some of the Company's competitors specialize in one or more
of our product lines while others sell many of the same product lines.
In addition, some competitors may have greater financial and technical
resources. Increased competition by existing or future competitors,
including aggressive price competition, could result in the need for
the Company to reduce prices or increase spending and this could have
an impact on sales and profitability.

The Company is subject to
economic and social changes which may impact sales.

Demand for
consumer products using flavors and fragrances has been stimulated and
broadened by changing social habits resulting from factors such as
increases in personal income, dual-earner households, teenage
population, leisure time, health concerns and urbanization and by the
continued growth in world population. Changes in any number of external
economic factors, or changes in social or consumer preferences, could
adversely impact our results of operations.

Results may be
negatively impacted by the price, quality and availability of raw
materials.

Raw materials are purchased from many sources from
all over the world, including essential oils, extracts and concentrate
derived from fruits, vegetables, flowers, woods and other botanicals,
animal products, raw fruits and organic chemicals. Disruptions in the
supply or quality of ingredients or rising prices for ingredients
purchased could adversely impact results of operations and
profitability of the Company.

Results may be
negatively impacted by the inability to implement the Company’s
business strategy, including the achievement of anticipated cost
savings, profitability or growth targets.

The Company is
committed to those particular business strategies which have been
identified as likely to drive profitable future growth and improve
operations and customer service. If the Company is unable to
successfully and timely implement these strategies, it would adversely
impact the financial condition and results of operations of the
Company.


Results may be negatively impacted by the
impact of currency fluctuation or devaluation in principal foreign
markets and the effectiveness of hedging and risk management
strategies.

The Company’s operations are conducted in
many countries, the results of which are reported in the local currency
and then translated into U.S. dollars at applicable exchange rates. The
exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. dollar have
fluctuated and may continue to do so in the future. The Company employs
a variety of techniques to reduce the impact of exchange rate
fluctuations, including foreign currency hedging activities. However,
volatility in currency exchange rates may adversely impact the
Company’s reported results of operations, financial condition or
liquidity.

The Company’s results may be negatively
impacted by the outcome of uncertainties related to litigation.

The Company is involved in a number of legal claims. While the
Company believes that related insurance coverage is adequate with
respect to such claims, the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome
of such litigation. In addition, the Company cannot provide assurance
that future events will not require an increase in the amount accrued
for any such claims, or require accrual for one or more claims that has
not been previously accrued.

The Company’s results and
cash flows may be negatively impacted by future pension funding and
other postretirement obligations.

The Company establishes
assumptions concerning discount rates and actuarial assumptions
regarding pension funding and other postretirement benefit obligations
based on current market conditions, plan participants, asset returns,
interest rates and other factors. Changes in pension and other
postretirement benefits, and associated expenses, may occur in the
future due to changes in demographics and assumptions. These changes
may adversely impact the Company’s financial condition, results
of operations or liquidity.

The Company’s
results may be negatively impacted by the effect of legal and
regulatory requirements, as well as restrictions imposed on operations
by foreign and domestic governmental entities.

Manufacture
and sale of the Company's products are subject to regulation in
the United States by the Food and Drug Administration, the Agriculture
Department, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the
Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration, the Drug Enforcement Administration and state
authorities. Foreign operations of the Company are subject to similar
governmental regulation in a number of countries. Compliance with
existing governmental requirements and future governmental regulations
may adversely impact the Company’s financial condition, results
of operations or liquidity.

The Company may face risks
associated with events which may affect the world economy.

World events such as terrorist attacks, the current U.S. military
action in the Middle East and elsewhere, and hostilities in the Middle
East, Asia and other geographical areas, have and may in the future
weaken the U.S. and world economies. Any resulting weaknesses in these
economies may adversely affect the Company’s business or the
businesses of our customers, with a resultant negative impact on the
Company’s financial condition, results of operations or
liquidity.

the Company and its New York laboratory facilities are located at 521
West 57th Street, New York City.

ITEM 3.    LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS.

The Company is subject to various claims and legal
actions in the ordinary course of its business.

In
September  2001, the Company was named as a defendant in a
purported class action brought against it in the Circuit Court of
Jasper County, Missouri, on behalf of employees of a plant owned and
operated by Gilster-Mary Lee Corp. in Jasper, Missouri
(

Benavides

case). The plaintiffs alleged that they sustained
respiratory injuries in the workplace due to the use by Gilster-Mary
Lee of a BBA and/or IFF flavor. For purposes of reporting these
actions, BBA and/or IFF are referred to as the
‘‘Company’’.

In January  2004, the
Court ruled that class action status was not warranted. As a result of
this decision, each of the 47 plaintiff cases was to be tried
separately. Subsequently, 8 cases were tried to a verdict, 4 verdicts
resulted for the plaintiffs and 4 verdicts resulted for the Company,
all of which were appealed by the losing party. The 4 cases which
resulted in a defense verdict and 1 of the cases which resulted in a
plaintiff verdict were subsequently settled, as were the 39 other cases
which did not go to trial and/or reach a verdict, the terms of all such
settlements being confidential. The 3 remaining plaintiffs’
verdicts are Moenning ($2.74  million), Brand ($15
million) and McNeely ($15  million). The appeal of each of these
cases is pending.

Thirteen other actions based on similar claims
of alleged respiratory illness due to workplace exposure to flavor
ingredients are currently pending against the Company and other flavor
suppliers and related companies. The parties remain in the discovery
phase in the action brought against the Company and another flavor
supplier by 24 former and current workers at a popcorn factory in
Marion, Ohio. This case was filed in March  2003 and is pending
in the Court of Common Pleas of Hamilton County, Ohio (

Arthur

case). In May  2004, the Company and another flavor supplier were
named defendants in a lawsuit by 4 former workers at a Ridgeway,
Illinois factory in an action brought in the Circuit Court for the
Second Judicial Circuit, Gallatin County, Illinois (

Barker

case) and another concerning 11 other workers at this same plant was
filed in July  2004 and is pending in this same Court against the
Company and another flavor supplier (

Batteese

case). In an
action filed in June  2004, the Company, 3 other flavor
suppliers, a flavor trade association and a consulting agency are
defendants in a lawsuit by 1 worker at a Sioux City, Iowa facility
which is pending in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
Iowa (

Remmes

case). In June  2004, the Company and 3
other


flavor suppliers were named defendants in a
lawsuit by 1 plaintiff brought in the Court of Common Pleas, Hamilton
Count, Ohio (

Mitchell

case). In June  2004, the Company
and 3 other flavor suppliers were named defendants in a lawsuit by 1
former worker at a Northlake, Illinois facility in an action brought in
the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois (

Lopez

case). In
August  2004, the Company and another flavor supplier were named
defendants in a lawsuit by 16 former workers at a Marion, Ohio factory
in an action brought in the Court of Common Pleas, Marion County, Ohio
(

Williams

case). In March  2005, the Company and 10
other companies were named defendants in a lawsuit by 1 former employee
of one of the defendants in an action brought in the Circuit Court of
Cook County, Illinois (

Robinson

case). In July  2005,
the Company and 9 other flavor and chemical suppliers were named
defendants in a lawsuit by 1 former worker of a Chicago area facility
alleging respiratory injuries due to alleged exposure in the workplace
of such facility (

Campbell

case). In August  2005, the
Company and 8 other companies were named defendants in a lawsuit by 3
former employees of the Gilster-Mary Lee facility in McBride, Missouri
in the City of St. Louis Circuit Court (

Fults

case). In
September  2005, the Company and 9 other companies were named
defendants in a lawsuit by 2 former employees of the Gilster-Mary Lee
facility in McBride, Missouri in the Circuit Court of St. Louis County
(

Bowling

case). In November  2005, the Company, a flavor
trade association and a consulting agency were named defendants in a
lawsuit by 1 former employee of a popcorn facility in Breda, Iowa
brought in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa,
Western Division (

Weimer

case). In January  2006, the
Company, three other flavor suppliers, a flavor trade association and a
consulting agency were named defendants in a lawsuit by one worker at a
Sioux City, Iowa facility filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Iowa (

Kuiper

case). All these cases remain in the
pretrial stage.

The Company believes that all IFF and BBA
flavors at issue in these matters meet the requirements of the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration and are safe for handling and use by
workers in food manufacturing plants when used according to specified
safety procedures. These procedures are detailed in instructions that
IFF and BBA provided to all their customers for the safe handling and
use of their flavors. It is the responsibility of IFF’s
customers to ensure that these instructions, which include the use of
appropriate engineering controls, such as adequate ventilation, proper
handling procedures and respiratory protection for workers, are
followed in the workplace.

At each balance sheet date, or more
frequently as conditions warrant, the Company reviews the status of
each pending claim, as well as its insurance coverage for such claims
with due consideration given to potentially applicable deductibles,
retentions and reservation of rights under its insurance policies, and
the advice of its outside legal counsel and a third party expert in
modeling insurance deductible amounts with respect to all these
matters. While the ultimate outcome of any litigation cannot be
predicted, management believes that adequate provision has been made
with respect to all known claims. Based on information presently
available and in light of the merits of its defenses and the
availability of insurance, the Company does not expect the outcome of
the above cases, singly or in the aggregate, to have an adverse effect
on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or
liquidity. There can be no assurance that future events will not
require the Company to increase the amount it has accrued for any
matter or accrue for a matter that has not been previously accrued. See
Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Over the past 20 years, various federal and state authorities and
private parties have claimed that the Company is a potentially
responsible party as a generator of waste materials for alleged
pollution at a number of waste sites operated by third parties located
principally in New Jersey and seek to recover costs incurred and to be
incurred to clean up the sites.

The waste site claims and suits
usually involve million dollar amounts, and most of them are asserted
against many potentially responsible parties. Remedial activities
typically consist of several phases carried out over a period of years.
Most site remedies begin with investigation and feasibility studies,
followed by physical removal, destruction, treatment or containment of
contaminated soil and debris, and sometimes by groundwater monitoring
and treatment. To date, the Company’s financial responsibility
for some sites has been settled through agreements granting the
Company, in exchange for one or more cash payments made or to be made,
either complete release of liability or, for certain sites, release
from further liability for early and/or later remediation phases,
subject to certain


‘‘re-opener’’
clauses for later-discovered conditions. Settlements in respect of some
sites involve, in part, payment by the Company and other parties of a
percentage of the site’s future remediation costs over a period
of years.

The Company believes that the amounts it has paid and
anticipates paying in the future for clean-up costs and damages at all
sites are not and will not be material to the Company’s
financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, because of the
involvement of other large potentially responsible parties at most
sites, because payment will be made over an extended time period and
because, pursuant to an agreement reached in July  1994 with
three of the Company’s liability insurers, defense costs and
indemnity amounts payable by the Company in respect of the sites will
be shared by the insurers up to an agreed amount.

Executive Overview

The Company is a leading creator and
manufacturer of flavor and fragrance compounds used to impart or
improve the flavor or fragrance in a wide variety of consumer products.
The precise size of the global market for flavors and fragrances is
difficult to determine because the industry is highly fragmented, both
geographically and along product lines; there are few publicly traded
companies in the industry; certain customers maintain in-house
capabilities fulfilling a portion of their flavor or fragrance needs;
and the quality and depth of market information in developing regions
of the world is limited. Analysts generally estimate the global market
to be $11 - $12  billion of which IFF represents 16 - 18%;
the Company's nearest sized competitor is of similar size. The
five largest companies in the industry combined represent approximately
65 - 70% of the global market.

Fragrance compounds are
used in perfumes, cosmetics, toiletries, hair care products,
deodorants, soaps, detergents and softeners as well as air care
products. Major fragrance customers include the cosmetics industry,
including perfume and toiletries manufacturers, and the household
products industry, including manufacturers of soaps, detergents,
household cleaners and air fresheners. Flavor products are sold to the
food and beverage industries for use in consumer products such as
prepared foods, beverages, dairy, food and confectionery products. The
Company is also a leading manufacturer of synthetic ingredients used in
making fragrances. Approximately 60% of the Company's
ingredient production is consumed internally; the balance is sold to
third party customers.

Changing social habits resulting from
such factors as increases in personal income and dual-earner
households, leisure time, health concerns, urbanization and population
growth stimulate demand for consumer products utilizing flavors and
fragrances. These developments expand the market for products with
finer fragrance quality, as well as the market for colognes and
toiletries. Such developments also stimulate demand for convenience
foods, soft drinks and low-fat food products that must conform to
expected tastes. These developments necessitate the creation and
development of flavors and fragrances and ingredients that are
compatible with newly introduced materials and methods of application
used in consumer products.


Flavors and fragrances are generally:

•

created for the exclusive use of
a specific customer;

•

sold in
solid or liquid form, in amounts ranging from a few pounds to several
tons depending on the nature of the end product in which they are
used;

•

a small percentage of
the volume and cost of the end product sold to the consumer; and

•

a major factor in consumer
selection and acceptance of the product.

Flavors and fragrances
have similar economic and operational characteristics, including
research and development, the nature of the creative and production
processes, the manner in which products are distributed and the type of
customer; many of the Company’s customers purchase both flavors
and fragrances.

A breakdown of sales by principal product
category is depicted in the graph below.

2005 Sales by
Category

The Company's five largest customers comprise 32%
of consolidated sales and its top thirty customers 56%; these
percentages have remained fairly constant for several years. No
customer accounts for 10% or more of sales. A key factor for
success is inclusion on major customers' core supplier lists
opening opportunities to win new business. The Company is currently on
the majority of core supplier lists of its major customers;
participation in such lists is key to the Company’s strategy for
growth.

The flavor and fragrance industry is impacted by
macroeconomic factors in all product categories and geographic regions.
In addition, pricing pressure placed on the Company's customers by
large and powerful retailers and distributors is inevitably passed
along to the Company and its competitors. Leadership in innovation and
creativity mitigates, to an extent, the impact of pricing pressure.
Success and growth in the industry is dependent upon creativity and
innovation in meeting the many and varied needs of the customers'
products in a cost-efficient and effective manner, and with a
consistently high level of timely service and delivery.

The
Company produces more than 33,000 unique compounds, of which
approximately 60% are flavors and 40% fragrances. The
Company continually creates new compounds to meet the changing
characteristics and needs of its customers' end products. No
single compound represents more than 1.5% of net sales.
Development of fragrances and flavors is a complex artistic and
technical process calling upon the combined knowledge and talents of
creative perfumers and flavorists, and application and research
chemists. An important contribution to the creation of new fragrances
and flavors is the development of new ingredients. The Company bears
essentially all costs incurred in connection with the creation and
development of new flavors and fragrances and such formulae are
generally protected under trade secrecy. The Company is not materially
dependent on any patents, trademarks or licenses.


The Company's recent
strategic focus has been:

•

To
integrate Bush Boake Allen Inc. (‘‘BBA’’),
acquired in November  2000, and to reorganize the integrated
organization under two global umbrellas of Business Development and
Operations. Business Development encompasses consumer and market
research, product category strategy, product development, global sales
and marketing and technical application. Operations are responsible for
the customer supply chain.

•

To
improve customer service, in terms of both on-time deliveries and
responsiveness to new product development initiatives, and to improve
the win rate for new business with the Company's customers.

•

To critically evaluate the
profitability and growth potential of the Company's product
portfolio, and to focus on those categories and customers considered to
be the best opportunities for long-term profitable growth.

•

To focus research and development
initiatives on those areas considered to be most likely, in the
long-term, to yield the greatest value to the Company's customers
and shareholders.

In the Company’s view, considerable
progress against these strategic initiatives has been achieved. The BBA
integration was completed quickly and associated savings exceeded those
anticipated at the time the acquisition was announced. Customer service
levels have improved to the point where on time deliveries exceed the
95% level, with further improvement targeted. The Company has
exited certain non-core businesses, the last of which was sold in 2004.
The quality and depth of the Company's research and development
efforts have improved significantly. In the period 2003 - 2005, the
Company patented numerous new, commercially-viable ingredients for use
in flavors and fragrances; fifteen were patented in 2003, nine in 2004
and fifteen in 2005. A number of these newly developed ingredients have
been used in flavor and fragrance compounds, and in 2006 new
ingredients and technologies are expected to play an important role in
meeting the Company’s growth objectives.

Moving forward,
the Company is committed to:

•

Research and development efforts
in those aspects of flavors and fragrances and associated delivery
mechanisms which the Company has identified as most likely to drive
profitable future growth. The Company anticipates that much of this
research will be conducted internally, but such efforts may be
augmented by joint research undertakings and through acquisition of
technology. An essential aspect of the overall research efforts is the
Company’s continued leadership in sensory science and consumer
insight, enabling the creation of consumer-preferred flavors and
fragrances.

•

The quality,
safety and suitability of its products for inclusion in its
customers’ end products; an essential element is the consistent
assurance of the quality and safety of raw materials through a
combination of steps including but not limited to vendor certification
and quality assurance testing.

•

Continuous improvement in
operations and customer service supported by the global implementation
of the enterprise requirements planning software package
(‘‘SAP’’), and related initiatives.

As
implementation of the strategy progresses, setting strategic
initiatives requires regular establishment and reassessment of
identified priorities and necessitates choices in order to provide the
best opportunity for continuous improvement in shareholder value.


Sales Commentary

Net sales for
2005, 2004 and 2003 were as follows:

The Company manages its operations by
major geographical region and considers destination sales a key
performance measure. Although reported sales and earnings are affected
by the weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar, this has not had
a long-term effect on the underlying strength of the Company's
business.

2005 Sales by Destination

The
Company acquired BBA effective November  3,  2000. In
conjunction with the integration of BBA, and as part of restructuring
the Company, certain non-core businesses (hereinafter referred to as
the ‘‘non-core businesses’’) were disposed of
including the fruit preparations businesses in Europe, North and Latin
America; the North American concentrates business and a portion of the
aroma chemicals business acquired in the BBA transaction. The non-core
businesses were disposed of in a series of transactions with third
parties; disposal of these businesses did not materially impact the
Company's operating results. The North American concentrates
business was disposed of in 2002 and the European fruit preparation
business in 2004; the other non-core businesses were disposed of in
2001.

The following table summarizes reported sales on a
geographic basis and reflects adjustments, as appropriate, to exclude
sales attributable to the non-core businesses; adjusted sales are the
basis on which the Company measures its operating performance:


Net sales below are adjusted to
exclude all sales associated with the non-core businesses:

2005 in Comparison to 2004

In 2005, reported sales declined 2% in dollars and 3%
in local currency compared to 2004. The sales performance was led by
strong growth in fine fragrances driven mainly by new product wins.
Flavor sales comparisons in 2005 were impacted by the disposition, in
the second half of 2004, of the Company’s European fruit
preparations business. On an as-adjusted basis, excluding sales
attributable to the fruit business from 2004 results, both 2005
consolidated sales and flavor sales would have increased 1% in
dollars and been flat in local currency. Flavor sales, most notably in
North America and Europe, were also unfavorably impacted by lower
selling prices for naturals, mainly vanilla.

Regional sales performance for 2005 was as
follows:

•

North America
fragrance and flavor sales declined 1% and 7%,
respectively; in total, regional sales declined 4%. Fine
fragrance and aroma chemical sales increased 4% and 3%,
respectively, while functional fragrance sales declined 8%. Fine
fragrance growth resulted from $14.5 in new wins, although this growth
was partially offset by erosion of existing products of $10.2.
Functional fragrance sales realized new wins of $10.2 though such
growth was offset by erosion in existing products of $20.5. Flavors
reported new product introductions of $21.3 partially offset by erosion
in existing products of $18.6.

•

Europe sales declined 6%
in dollars and 8% in local currency; reported dollar sales
benefited from the strength of the Euro and the Pound Sterling versus
the U.S. dollar. Fragrance sales increased 2% in dollars and
were flat in local currency. Local currency fine fragrance sales
increased 13%, driven primarily by new wins, while functional
fragrances and aroma chemicals declined 6% and 7%,
respectively. Flavor sales declined 18% in dollars and
19% in local currency, mainly as a result of the disposition of
the fruit preparations business. On an as-adjusted basis, excluding
sales attributable to the fruit business from 2004 results, 2005 flavor
sales would have been flat in dollars and decreased 1% in local
currency.

•

Asia Pacific sales
increased 2% in dollars and 1% in local currency; flavor
sales increased 4% in dollars and 3% in local currency,
while fragrance sales declined 2% in both dollars and local
currency. Flavor sales were strongest in Greater China, Indonesia and
Vietnam, with respective local currency increases of 15%,
7% and 46%; flavor growth was driven by new wins of $4.5.
Fragrance sales growth was strongest in Taiwan, South Korea, Vietnam
and the Philippines with respective local currency increases of
16%, 16%, 56% and 8%; this growth was
offset by local currency sales declines in Australia, Thailand and
Singapore/Malaysia of 12%, 17% and 16%,
respectively. Fragrance wins in the region totaled $2.9.

•

Latin American sales increased
10% with fragrance and flavor sales increasing 7% and
21%, respectively. Flavor sales were strongest in Mexico, Brazil
and Argentina, which grew 33%, 27% and 22%,
respectively, while fragrances were led by an 8% increase in
Mexico and increases of 12% in Argentina and 7% in
Brazil. Fragrance sales grew in all categories with functional
fragrance sales increasing 7% while fine fragrance and aroma
chemicals increased 4% and 7%, respectively. The
performance was driven mainly by new wins of $17.7 in fragrances and
$9.2 in flavors.


•

India
sales increased 14% in both local currency and reported dollars.
This performance was led by a 16% local currency increase in
flavor sales with fragrance sales increasing 12%. In both
flavors and fragrances, the sales performance reflected the benefit of
new wins and continued strong economic conditions.

2004 in
Comparison to 2003

In 2004, reported sales increased
7%. Reported sales benefited from the strengthening of various
currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar; had exchange rates remained
constant, sales would have increased 2% in comparison to the
prior year. Reported sales were strongest in fragrances, led by a
13% increase in fine fragrance sales; sales of aroma chemicals
and fragrances used in functional products each increased 7%.
The sales performance was impacted by the disposition of the
Company’s European fruit preparations business, which was sold
to Frutarom Industries Ltd. (‘‘Frutarom’’) in
the second half of the year. On an as-adjusted basis, excluding sales
attributable to the European fruit businesses from the 2004 and 2003
results, consolidated sales would have increased 5% in local
currency and 9% in reported dollars.

Flavor and
fragrance sales increased in all geographic regions, although growth in
Europe resulted from currency translation; sales performance by region
was as follows:

•

North America
fragrance sales grew 9% while flavor sales increased 8%;
the region grew 9%, mainly driven by new wins. Fragrance sales
increased in all categories, led by a 20% increase in aroma
chemical sales, while fine and functional fragrance sales increased
6% and 7%, respectively. The aroma chemical sales
increase was volume driven while growth in fine fragrances resulted
from $7.0 in new wins. Functional fragrance sales realized new wins of
$16.0, partially offset by erosion in existing products of $6.0.
Flavors reported new product introductions of $30.0, partially offset
by volume and erosion in existing products.

•

European fragrance sales
increased 8%, although this performance was partially offset by
a 2% decline in flavor sales; in total, regional sales increased
4%. Reported sales benefited from the strength of the Euro and
Pound Sterling; local currency sales declined 5%. Local currency
fragrance sales declined 2%; fine fragrance sales increased
5% offset by a 1% decrease in sales of functional
fragrances and a 10% decline in aroma chemical sales. The fine
fragrance performance was driven by a number of new product wins. Fine
and functional fragrances reported new product introductions of $40.0,
partially offset by the effects of erosion in existing products. Local
currency flavor sales declined 10%, mainly as a result of the
disposition of the fruit preparations business. On an as-adjusted
basis, excluding sales attributable to the fruit business for 2004 and
2003, flavor sales would have increased 11% in dollars and
2% in local currency, mainly due to new wins.

•

Reported sales in Asia Pacific
increased 10%, based on 6% sales growth in local
currency; the currency benefit was mainly attributable to the strength
of the Japanese Yen and the Australian dollar. Local currency fragrance
sales increased 3% in comparison to the prior year, resulting in
a 7% increase in reported dollars, driven mainly by new wins of
$6.0. Local currency flavor sales increased 7%, resulting in a
13% increase in reported dollars. The performance reflects the
benefit of both new wins and volume increases in existing products. For
the region, sales growth was strongest in Greater China, Vietnam,
Indonesia and Taiwan, with respective local currency increases of
17%, 47%, 9% and 8%, while Japan sales grew
3%.

•

Latin American
sales increased 7%; fragrance and flavor sales increased
9% and 3%, respectively. Sales growth was strongest in
Venezuela, Central America, Argentina and Colombia which grew
33%, 15%, 12% and 9%, respectively.
Fragrance sales were led by a 23% increase in aroma chemicals,
while sales of fine and functional fragrances increased 12% and
6%, respectively. Fragrance sales were driven by new wins and
volume increases while the flavor increase was mainly volume
driven.

•

India sales increased
15% in local currency and 17% in reported dollars. Local
currency fragrance sales increased 12%, resulting in a
16% increase in reported dollars. Flavor sales increased
18% in local currency, resulting in a 19% increase in
reported dollars. In both flavors and fragrances, the sales performance
reflected the benefit of new wins.


Operating Results

The percentage
relationship of cost of goods sold and other operating expenses to
reported sales is detailed in the following table.

Cost of
goods sold includes the cost of materials and manufacturing expenses;
raw materials generally constitute 70% of the total. Research
expenses are for the development of new and improved products,
technical product support, compliance with governmental regulations,
and help in maintaining relationships with customers who are often
dependent on technological advances. Selling, general and
administrative expenses support the Company's sales and operating
levels.

Segment profit, which excludes the effect of
restructuring and other charges, was $290.2 in 2005, $342.1 in 2004 and
$328.2 in 2003. The Company recorded restructuring and other charges of
$23.3, $31.8 and $42.4 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Operating
profit totaled $266.9, $310.3 and $285.8 in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

2005 in Comparison to 2004

Cost of goods
sold, as a percentage of sales, increased 150 basis points compared
with 2004, mainly due to higher raw material costs which the Company
was not able to fully recover through increased selling prices;
overall, the average cost of raw materials purchased by the Company
increased 5% – 6% in comparison to the prior year.
Gross margin was also negatively impacted by costs attributable to a
vendor-supplied raw material contamination issue; cost of sales include
$3.0 in related costs, comprised mainly of associated testing costs and
the write-off of affected materials. Cost of goods sold was also
impacted by lower expense absorption attributable to the facility
closure in Dijon and the cost of transfer of related production to
other manufacturing locations; production at the Dijon facility ceased
in March  2005.

Research and Development
(‘‘R&D’’) expenses increased to 9.0%
of sales, consistent with the Company’s stated intention to
expand its research initiatives; spending in 2006 is expected to remain
at approximately 9.0% of sales.

Selling, General and
Administrative (‘‘SG&A’’) expenses, as a
percentage of sales, increased to 17.0% from 16.8%.
SG&A expenses include $8.5  million related to the cost of
customer damages attributable to the raw material contamination issue.
The Company is seeking full indemnification from its supplier, the
supplier’s insurers and, to the extent necessary, its own
insurers, but no related insurance receivable has been recorded.
SG&A expenses also include $5.1 in equity compensation expense
compared to $5.0  million in the prior year. These costs were
partially offset by lower accruals under the Company’s various
incentive plans.

In 2005, cost of goods sold and SG&A
include $2.2 and $4.5, respectively, incurred in connection with the
implementation of SAP; these costs relate to training and data
conversion and are charged to operating expenses as incurred.
Implementation of SAP is essentially complete at December
31,  2005.

2004 in Comparison to 2003

Cost of
goods sold, as a percentage of sales, declined 40 basis points compared
with 2003. The improvement resulted from a combination of improved
sales performance, and better product mix from improved fine fragrance
sales and the disposition of the lower margin European fruit business.
The Company benefited from the elimination of 48 manufacturing
positions in North America and Europe which resulted in savings of
approximately $2.1. The above benefits were partially offset by poor
operating performance by the European fruit business for the period of
time owned by the Company, and by weak absorption of expenses resulting
from the transfer of production from the Company’s facility in
Dijon, France to other manufacturing plants.


R&D expenses increased to 8.6%
of sales, as the Company continued to expand its research initiatives.
This increase is mainly as a result of the elimination of the fruit
preparations business; relative to other parts of the Company’s
business, fruit preparations required less R&D as a percentage of
sales.

SG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to
16.8% from 16.2%; mainly from inclusion of $5.0 in equity
compensation expense for which there was no comparable amount in the
2003 results, and higher expense accruals under the Company’s
incentive compensation plans, based on sales and operating performance.
The increase in Global Expenses, as reported in Note 13 of the Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements, mainly related to these
expenses. In May  2004, the Company began using Restricted Stock
Units (‘‘RSU’s’’), rather than stock
options, as an element of the Company’s incentive compensation
plans for all eligible U.S. - based employees and a majority of
eligible overseas employees; previously, options had not been expensed
as permitted under applicable accounting guidance. Vesting of the
RSU’s for senior management is performance and time based; for
the remainder of eligible employees, vesting is time based (generally
over a three-year period).

In 2004, cost of goods sold and
SG&A include $1.4 and $3.8, respectively, incurred in connection
with the implementation of SAP.

Interest Expense

Interest expense totaled $24.0, $24.0 and $28.5 in 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively. The average interest rate was 3.3%,
3.2% and 3.0% in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Gross
borrowings at December  31,  2005 increased in comparison to
the prior year in connection with repatriation of foreign earnings
under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
(‘‘AJCA’’). More information on debt and
interest rate management is contained in Note 9 and Note 15 of the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other (Income)
Expense, Net

Other (income) expense, net was $3.3 income in
2005, $5.3 expense in 2004 and $5.4 expense in 2003. In 2005, income
resulted primarily from exchange gains and higher levels of interest
income earned on higher cash balances. Exchange gains or (losses) were
$2.8, ($2.9) and $1.6 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
exchange losses in 2004 were mainly the result of the Company having
U.S. dollar positions in Europe and Latin America which resulted in
exchange losses upon the weakening of the U.S. dollar in comparison to
the Euro and other currencies. In 2003, the Company repurchased $200.7
of long-term notes otherwise scheduled to mature in May  2006;
purchases were made through a series of open market transactions,
funded with commercial paper. As a result, the Company incurred a net
loss of $4.2 which is included in Other (income) expense, net.

Income Taxes

The effective tax rate for 2005 was
21.6%, compared to 30.2% for 2004 and 31.5% for
2003. The 2005 rate was significantly reduced as a result of a tax
benefit associated with the AJCA. The AJCA, enacted on
October 22, 2004, provided for a special one-time tax deduction
of 85% of dividends received on eligible repatriated foreign
earnings; the deduction resulted in an approximate 5.25% federal
tax rate on these earnings. Full year 2005 results include a net tax
benefit of $24.7 relating to the Company's repatriation of
$242.0  million of dividends from foreign subsidiaries under the
provisions of AJCA. Excluding the benefit of AJCA, the effective tax
rate for 2005 would have been 31.6%.

The fluctuating rate
over the three-year period is primarily the result of tax planning
initiatives and the benefit of combining various IFF and BBA legal
entities into a single tax structure. In the period 2003 - 2005, the
tax rate also benefited from restructuring and other charges, most of
which were incurred in higher tax jurisdictions.

Acquisitions
and Divestitures

In 2004, the Company sold its European fruit
preparations business which manufactured processed fruit and other
natural product preparations used in a variety of food products. Sales
of


fruit preparations in 2004, 2003 and 2002
were $58.3, $92.3 and $72.2; operating profit was $5.6, $12.4 and $6.3,
respectively. Proceeds from the sale were $40.0, including assumption
of certain liabilities; cash proceeds were used to reduce
borrowings.

In 2003, the Company acquired 70% of the
outstanding shares of Celessence International Ltd.
(‘‘Celessence’’), a company engaged in the
development and distribution of encapsulation and delivery systems for
use in fragrance and other applications, for $6.4. The acquisition was
accounted for as a purchase business combination. The principal
Celessence asset is a process technology patent included in other
intangible assets that is being amortized over its estimated remaining
useful life. Celessence results, which are not material, are included
in the consolidated results of the Company from acquisition date.

Movements in acquisition accounting accruals were:

At December  31,  2005 and
2004, goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated
amortization, totaled $772.7 and $789.7, respectively. The Company
completed its annual assessments in 2005, 2004 and 2003, concluding
that it has no impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets.
Additional details are contained in Note 5 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Restructuring and Other
Charges

Since 1999, the Company has undertaken a series of
actions associated with the closure of Company facilities and
elimination of various employee positions. As an element of this
program, the Company offered a voluntary early retirement incentive to
certain U.S. - based employees in the fourth quarter of 1999 with
notification of acceptance in the first quarter of 2000; 71 employees
accepted, resulting in pre-tax charges of $9.3 in 2000.

In
mid-2000, senior management changed, after which the Company conducted
a comprehensive analysis of its business development, research and
development, and operating activities and associated staffing levels.
In October  2000, the Company announced a significant
reorganization entailing the elimination of multiple layers of
management, closure of certain manufacturing facilities to improve
capacity utilization, and the intended disposal of certain non-core
businesses. The integration of BBA into IFF and the reorganization
proceeded concurrently.

An element of the reorganization was a
second voluntary early retirement program extended to U.S. - based
employees, which 85 employees accepted, resulting in pre-tax charges of
$14.5. An additional 41 employees were terminated by eliminating
duplicate management positions at corporate, regional and affiliate
locations, resulting in the Company recording pre-tax charges of $17.5.
In 2000, a total of 197 employees were severed and the Company recorded
pre-tax charges totaling $41.3, comprised of:

•

The first early retirement plan
– $9.3;

•

The second
early retirement plan – $14.5; and

•

Other reorganization costs
– $17.5.

During 2001, the Company sold its fruit
preparation business in the United States and Brazil and closed IFF
operations in Hong Kong, South Africa, Chile, Venezuela, Kenya, Texas
and Oregon. As a result, 465 employees were severed and the Company
recorded pre-tax charges totaling $30.1; $10.1 related to employee
terminations and $20.0 related to location closures and asset
write-downs.


During 2002, the Company closed IFF
operations in Australia, discontinued fragrance compounding in Japan
and sold its fruit concentrate business. As a result, 148 employees
were severed and the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $11.7; $4.3
related to employee severance and $7.4 related to location closures and
asset write-downs.

In 2003, the Company further eliminated
duplicate employment functions and processes, including several senior
corporate positions as well as at global, regional and local levels.
The Company eliminated 321 positions and recorded pre-tax charges of
$42.4; $38.0 related to employee terminations and $4.4 related to
location closures and asset write-downs. The 2003 asset-related charges
related principally to final quantification of costs for previous
actions taken.

In 2004, the Company disposed of its European
fruit preparations business. In addition, the Company closed its
Canadian manufacturing facility and committed to the closure of its
manufacturing facility in Dijon, France; the Dijon facility closed in
2005, on completion of transfer of production to other plants. As a
result, the Company eliminated 302 positions, and recognized pre-tax
charges of $31.8, of which $25.8 related to employee terminations and
$6.0 to location closures and asset write-downs, and other related
reorganization actions; the asset-related charges were net of gains of
$16.3 related to the sale of the fruit businesses and Canadian
facility. An additional 129 employees left the Company in 2005 on
closure of the Dijon facility.

In 2005, the Company undertook to
eliminate approximately 300 positions in manufacturing, selling,
research and administration functions, principally in its European and
North American operating regions. The majority of affected positions
involve employee separation while the balance relates to open positions
that will not be filled. As a result of these actions, the Company
anticipates recording pre-tax restructuring charges of $25
million to $30  million relating primarily to employee separation
expenses; $23.3  million was recognized in 2005. The remaining
charges are expected to be recognized in 2006. Annual savings from
these actions are expected to approximate $16  million to
$18  million.

With respect to all restructuring and other
charges:

•

Separation costs for
the employees relate primarily to severance, outplacement and other
benefit costs;

•

Asset
write-down charges relate to establishment of the new carrying value
for assets held for sale or disposal; and

•

Other costs include lease
termination costs and other reorganization expenses incurred to affect
either the employee separation or location closure.

The charges
above exclude all charges associated with the integration of BBA where
such costs were incurred in connection with the closure of BBA
facilities or the elimination of BBA employees.

In Europe, the
total reductions include 194 positions eliminated with the sale of the
Fruit business in 2004 and, in 2005 the elimination of 129 positions
related to the closure of the Dijon facility. Positions eliminated by
region in each of the three years in the period ended December
31,  2005 were as follows.


Charges by region in each of the three
years in the period ended December  31,  2005 were:

Movements in related accruals in each of
the three years in the period ended December  31,  2005
were:

The 2004 asset-related charges exclude
gains of $16.3 arising on the sale of the fruit businesses and Canadian
facility; such gains were accounted for in determining Restructuring
and other charges of $31.8 reported in 2004.

The
employee-related liabilities are expected to be utilized by 2008 as
obligations are satisfied; asset-related charges are expected to be
utilized in 2007 on final decommissioning and disposal of affected
equipment.

Financial Condition

Cash, cash equivalents
and short-term investments totaled $272.9 at December  31,
2005 compared to $33.0 and $12.6 at December  31,  2004 and
2003, respectively. The cash balance at December  31,  2005
increased as a result of the repatriation of funds under AJCA. Working
capital totaled ($11.4) at year-end 2005, compared to $561.8 and $376.6
at December  31,  2004 and 2003, respectively. The change in
2005 relates primarily to an increase in current debt due to the
maturity in May  2006 of the $499.3 in 6.45% Notes. Gross
additions to property, plant and equipment were $93.4, $70.6 and $66.0
in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and are expected to approximate
$70.0 in 2006.

At December  31,  2005, the Company had
$950.7 of debt outstanding, including $7.9 in deferred gains and
mark-to-market adjustments on interest rate swap transactions. Debt,
excluding the deferred swap gains, includes $499.2 of 6.45%
Notes maturing in May  2006, $314.6 in bank borrowings and
overdrafts and $129.0 in long-term Japanese Yen denominated debt. The
Company is developing plans for both short-term financing and the
potential issuance of additional long-term instruments on maturity of
the Notes.

In 2005, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries
entered into a revolving credit agreement (the
"Agreement" or the
‘‘Facility’’) with certain banks which replaced
existing credit facilities. The Agreement provides for a five-year US
$350,000,000 (‘‘Tranche A’’) and Euro
400,000,000 (‘‘Tranche B’’) multi-currency
revolving credit facility. Tranche A is available for commercial paper
backstop and general corporate purposes; Tranche B is available to
European subsidiaries for general corporate


purposes. Borrowings under the Facility bear
interest at an annual rate of LIBOR (London Inter Bank Offer Rate) (or
in relation to any Euro-denominated loans, EURIBOR, European Inter Bank
Offer Rate) plus a margin, currently 20 basis points, linked to the
credit rating of the Company. The Company pays a commitment fee on the
aggregate unused commitments and a utilization fee based on amounts
outstanding under the Facility; such fees are not material. The
Facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants customary
in a facility of this type, including a covenant requiring the Company
to maintain, at the end of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of net debt for
borrowed money to EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation
and Amortization) in respect of the previous 12-month period of not
more than 3.25 to 1. The Company has complied with this covenant at all
times.

Unless extended, the Agreement will expire on
November  22,  2010. The Company may request an extension of
the Facility for up to two years beyond the original term. In the event
of default, the lenders may terminate the Agreement and declare any
principal amount then outstanding and all accrued interest, fees and
other amounts payable under the Agreement to be immediately due and
payable. Defaults under the Agreement which could result in the
acceleration by the lenders of the obligations of the Company Parties
include a change of control of the Company (as defined in the Facility
Agreement) and certain acquisitions made in contemplation of a merger
where, as a direct result of the acquisition, the public debt rating of
the Company quoted by Moody’s or S&P (including any change
in terms of its outlook) is a lower rating than its public debt rating
immediately prior to such acquisition.

In July  2004 and
May  2005, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized
share repurchase programs of $100.0 and $200.0, respectively. Under
various programs, the Company repurchased 2.6  million shares in
2005 and 1.8  million shares in each of 2004 and 2003, at a cost
of $98.3, $66.5 and $55.4, respectively. Average per share cost of
shares acquired in 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $38.01, $36.89 and $31.66,
respectively. The Company completed the July  2004 repurchase plan
in August  2005 and as of December  31,  2005 had
repurchased approximately 0.6  million shares under the May
2005 plan. At December  31,  2005, the Company had $177.2
remaining under the May  2005 plan, representing approximately
5.1  million shares based on a stock price of $35.00 per share.
Repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with the
Company’s employee benefit plans and for other general corporate
purposes.

The dividend paid per share in 2005, 2004 and 2003 was
$.72, $.67 and $.62, respectively. In January and April  2005, the
Company paid a quarterly cash dividend of $.175 per share to
shareholders. In May  2005, the Board of Directors increased the
annual dividend by 5.7% to $.74 per share effective with the
dividend paid in July  2005. The Company paid dividends totaling
$67.8, $63.2 and $58.2 in 2005, 2004 and 2003. The Company's
current intention is to pay dividends approximating 30 - 35% of
yearly earnings; however, the payment of dividends is determined by the
Board in its discretion based on various factors.

The cumulative
translation adjustment component of Accumulated other comprehensive
income was ($47.4) at December  31,  2005, compared to $8.2
at December  31,  2004. The change results principally from
the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro, the Japanese Yen
and the Australian dollar during 2005. The Minimum pension liability
adjustment component of Accumulated other comprehensive income was
($100.4) at December  31,  2005, compared to ($110.7) at
December  31,  2004. The accumulated loss on derivatives
qualifying as hedges was ($2.6) at December  31,  2005
compared to ($5.7) at December  31,  2004.

Compliance
with existing governmental requirements regulating the discharge of
materials into the environment has not materially affected the
Company's operations, earnings or competitive position. In 2005,
the Company spent $20.4 on capital projects and $14.7 in operating
expenses and governmental charges for the purpose of complying with
such regulations. Expenditures for these purposes will continue for the
foreseeable future. In addition, the Company is party to a number of
proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act or similar state statutes. It is
expected that the impact of any judgments in or voluntary settlements
of such proceedings will not be material to the Company's
financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.


At December  31,  2005, the
Company has contractual payment obligations due within the time periods
as specified in the following table:

(1)

See
Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a
further discussion of the Company’s various borrowing
facilities.

(2)

Operating
leases include facility and other lease commitments executed in the
normal course of the business. Additional details concerning the United
States facilities are contained in Note 8 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements and further details concerning
worldwide aggregate operating leases are contained in Note 17 of the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(3)

Purchase obligations and capital
project commitments not recorded on the Company’s consolidated
balance sheet.

(4)

See Note
14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further
discussion of the Company’s retirement plans. Anticipated
funding obligations are based on current actuarial assumptions. Funding
requirements reported in the above table do not extend beyond
2015.

The Company anticipates that all financing
requirements will be funded from operations and credit facilities
currently in place. Cash flows from operations or credit facilities are
currently expected to be sufficient to fund the Company's
anticipated capital spending, dividends and other requirements for the
next 12 - 18 months. The Company currently anticipates reducing
borrowings by approximately $200.0 in 2006. In comparison, borrowings
were reduced by approximately $185.0 and $145.0 in 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

Market Risk

The Company is exposed to
market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and
commodity price fluctuations. The Company evaluates and manages
volatility relating to these exposures on a global basis to take
advantage, where applicable, of netting opportunities that may exist.
Identified net exposures are managed employing a number of techniques
including, but not limited to, borrowings in local currencies and the
use of certain derivative instruments.

The Company operates on a
global basis and is exposed to currency fluctuation related to the
manufacture and sale of its products in currencies other than the U.S.
dollar. The major foreign currencies involve the markets in the
European Union, Mexico, Brazil, China, Indonesia, Australia and Japan,
although all regions are subject to foreign currency fluctuations
versus the U.S. dollar. The Company actively monitors its foreign
currency exposures in all major markets in which it operates, and
employs a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate
fluctuations, including foreign currency hedging activities. The
Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts with the
objective of reducing exposure to cash flow volatility associated with
foreign currency receivables and payables, and with anticipated
purchases of certain raw materials used in operations. These contracts,
the counterparties to which are major international financial
institutions, generally involve the exchange of one currency for a
second currency at a future date, and have maturities not exceeding six
months. The notional amount and maturity dates of such contracts match
those of the underlying transactions. The gain or loss on the hedging
instrument is recorded in earnings at the same time as the transaction
being hedged is recorded in earnings. The associated asset or liability
on the open hedge instrument is recorded in Current Assets or Current
Liabilities, as applicable.

The Company employs various interest
rate swaps and debt issuances with the objective of managing and
optimizing its interest rate exposure. In 2001, the Company entered
into certain interest


swap agreements effectively converting the
fixed coupon rate on its 6.45% Notes to a variable short-term
rate based on the LIBOR plus an interest markup. In response to changes
in market conditions and the value of the swaps, and in 2003, in
connection with the Company's debt repurchase, the Company
periodically amended the swap agreements, changing the related interest
spread. As a result of these amendments, the counterparty paid the
Company $11.6 and $56.5 in 2003 and 2002, respectively, including
accrued interest of $3.7 and $6.5, respectively. The net realized gains
on the swaps have been deferred, classified as a separate component of
debt, and are amortized as a reduction in interest expense over the
remaining term of the Notes. In 2003, the Company terminated all such
swap agreements; as a result, the interest rate on the Notes, including
amortization of the deferred swap gains, was fixed at 3.4%
through maturity.

The Company has executed a 10-year Yen - U.S.
dollar currency swap related to the monthly sale and purchase of
products between the U.S. and Japan. The annual notional value of this
swap is approximately $5.0. Gains and losses related to this swap are
recorded currently, and the mark-to-market adjustment related to the
value of the swap is reflected as a component of Accumulated other
comprehensive income.

In 2002, the Company entered into certain
interest rate swap agreements effectively converting the fixed rate on
its long-term Japanese Yen borrowings to a variable short-term rate
based on the Japanese Yen LIBOR rate plus an interest markup. These
swaps are designated as qualified fair value hedges. During 2003 and
2005, the Company amended the swaps and the counterparty paid the
Company $3.0 and $0.8, respectively, including accrued interest of $0.5
and $0.1, respectively. In both cases, these net gains have been
deferred, are classified as a separate component of debt and are being
amortized over the remaining term of the debt. To the extent the
Company has not received cash or otherwise amended or settled any swap
agreements, any applicable mark-to-market adjustment relating to that
swap is included as a separate component of debt. The Company had no
ineffective interest rate swaps at December  31,  2005.

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates

Preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States
(‘‘GAAP’’) requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and accompanying
disclosures. These estimates are based on management’s best
judgment of current events and actions that the Company may undertake
in the future. Actual results may ultimately differ from estimates,
although management does not believe such changes will materially
affect the financial statements in any individual year.

Those
areas requiring the greatest degree of management judgment or deemed
most critical to the Company’s financial reporting involve:

The periodic assessment of potential impairment of
intangible assets acquired in business combinations.

The Company currently has net intangible assets, including
goodwill, of $772.7. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually. In
assessing its intangible assets, management uses the most current
actual and forecasted operating data available, current market based
assumptions and independent valuation experts. A two step approach is
employed. The first step involves estimating the value of reporting
units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. The
second step, if necessary, is to measure the value of the impairment
loss, if any. Management’s most subjective assumptions relate to
the estimated/projected sales and operating growth values employed in
the forecast.

The analysis and evaluation of
collectibility of accounts receivable.

The Company
sells to large global and regional firms. The majority of sales are
either made-to-order or products that the Company also employs in its
own manufacturing process as a raw material. Judgment is required in
assessing the realization of receivable balances, including assessment
of the creditworthiness of the customers, and in evaluating varying
circumstances that may impact the financial stability of a customer.
Allowances for loss on collection are established based on currently
available relevant facts, and are reevaluated and adjusted as
additional information becomes available. The Company’s
historical experience indicates the allowance recorded has been
sufficient to cover any reasonably expected potential loss.


The analysis and
evaluation of income taxes.

The Company accounts for
taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.
109 (‘‘FAS 109’’), Accounting for Income Taxes.
Under FAS 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based
on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of
assets and liabilities, based on tax laws as currently enacted. The
provision for income taxes is based on domestic and international
statutory income taxes rates and planning opportunities available in
the various tax jurisdictions where the Company operates. Significant
judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and tax
positions. The Company may be challenged upon review by the applicable
taxing authority and positions taken by the Company may not be
sustained. The Company regularly updates these accruals in light of
changing facts and circumstances.

The evaluation
of potential legal and environmental liabilities, where changing
circumstances, rules and regulations require regular reassessment of
related practices and anticipated costs.

The Company is
subject to certain legal claims regarding products and other matters,
as well as environmental-related matters. Significant management
judgment is involved in determining when it is probable that a
liability has been incurred and the extent to which it can be
reasonably estimated.

The Company regularly assesses
potential liabilities with respect to all legal claims based on the
most recent available information, in consultation with outside counsel
handling the defense of such matters, and other relevant independent
experts. To the extent a liability is deemed to have been incurred and
can be reasonably estimated, the Company recognizes a corresponding
liability; if the reasonably estimated liability is a range, the
Company recognizes that amount considered most likely, or in the
absence of such a determination, the minimum reasonably expected
liability. To the extent such claims are covered by various insurance
policies, the Company separately evaluates the likelihood of recovery
and accounts for any related insurance receivable. Management judgments
involve determination as to whether a liability has been incurred, the
reasonably estimated amount of that liability, and any potential
insurance recovery.

The Company regularly evaluates its
potential environmental exposure in terms of total estimated cost and
with respect to the viability of other potentially responsible parties
(‘‘PRP’s’’) associated with its
exposure. Recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation
efforts progress and additional information becomes available. Critical
management assumptions relate to expected total costs to remediate and
the financial viability of PRP’s to share such costs.

Determination of the various assumptions employed in
the valuation of pension and retiree health care expense and associated
obligations.

Amounts recognized in the Consolidated
Financial Statements related to pension and other postretirement
benefits are determined from actuarial valuations. Inherent in such
valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets,
discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled, rates of
increase in future compensation levels, mortality rates and health care
cost trend rates. These assumptions are updated annually and are
disclosed in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. In accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from
the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and,
therefore, affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future
periods.

With respect to the U.S. plans, the expected
return on plan assets was determined based on an asset allocation model
using the current benchmark allocation, real rates of return by asset
class and an anticipated inflation rate. The benchmark asset allocation
was: 10 - 20% in cash and fixed income investments expected to
yield 1.1%; 10 - 20% employed in corporate and government
bonds expected to yield 1.7 - 2.8%; and 65 - 75% in
equity investments with a long-term expected yield of 8.5 -
9.1%. The inflation rate assumed in the model was 2.5%.
The plan has achieved a compound annual rate of return of 9.2%
over the previous 15 years. The expected annual rate of return for the
non-U.S. plans employs a similar set of criteria adapted for local
investments, inflation rates and in certain cases specific government
requirements. The discount rate used for determining future pension
obligations for each individual plan is based on a review of long-term
bonds that receive a high rating from a recognized rating agency.
Additionally, for the U.S. Plan,


the discount rate was based on the internal
rate of return for a portfolio of Moody’s Aa3-rated high quality
bonds with maturities that are consistent with the projected future
benefit payment obligations of the plan. The rate of compensation
increase for all plans and the medical cost trend rate for the
applicable U.S. plans are based on plan experience.

Management establishes the assumptions concerning discount
rates and actuarial assumptions based on current market conditions,
including asset returns and other factors applicable under the
circumstances. Changes in pension and other post-employment benefits,
and associated expenses, may occur in the future due to changes in
these assumptions. The impact that a .25% decrease in the
discount rate or a 1% change in the medical cost trend rate
would have on the Company’s pension and other post-employment
benefit expense, as applicable, is discussed in Note 14 of the Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The
ongoing assessment of the valuation of inventory, given the large
number of natural ingredients employed, the quality of which may be
diminished over time.

The Company maintains between
40% and 55% of its inventory as raw materials, providing
the greatest degree of flexibility in manufacture and use. Materials
are evaluated based on shelf life, known uses and anticipated demand
based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in
product/sales mix. Management policy provides for an ongoing assessment
of inventory with adjustments recorded when an item is deemed to be
slow moving or obsolete.

Management believes that it has
considered relevant circumstances that the Company may be currently
subject to, and the financial statements accurately reflect
management’s best estimate of the results of operations,
financial condition and cash flows of the Company for the years
presented. Management has discussed the decision process and selection
of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the
Board of Directors.

New Accounting Standards

Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards (‘‘SFAS’’)
No. 123(R) Share-Based Payment (‘‘FAS 123R’’)
was issued in December  2004. FAS 123R is effective for the first
reporting period beginning after December  15,  2005. FAS
123R supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees (‘‘APB 25’’) and
establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an
entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. Under
FAS 123R, the Company must determine the fair value model to be used
for valuing share-based payments, the amortization method for
compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of
adoption. The Company will adopt the new requirements using the
modified prospective transition method in the first quarter which ends
March  31,  2006. Adoption of the standard is currently
expected to reduce 2006 annual earnings by $2.0- $3.0  million
based on unvested options currently outstanding. This impact does not
contemplate awards to be issued, cancelled or forfeited in 2006 or the
potential tax impact related to the initial adoption of this
standard.

SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No.
43, Chapter 4 ("FAS 151"), was issued in
November  2004. FAS 151 clarifies the accounting for abnormal
amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted
materials. Additionally, FAS 151 requires that allocation of fixed
production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on normal
capacity of production facilities. This statement is effective
January  1,  2006 and the Company believes its adoption will
not have a material impact on reported results.

In March
2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(‘‘FASB’’) issued FASB Interpretation No. 47,
Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, which
clarifies that a conditional asset retirement obligation, as used in
SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, refers to a
legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the
timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event
that may or may not be within the control of the Company. This
Statement was effective for 2005 and did not have a material impact on
reported results.


Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The
discussion of the Company's historical results include and, where
indicated, exclude the impact of sales and operating results
attributable to certain non-core businesses disposed of in 2004, the
impact of certain restructuring and other charges recorded in 2004, the
impact of the Company repatriatization of certain dividends from
foreign subsidiaries under the AJCA, as well as the effects of exchange
rate fluctuations. Such information is supplemental to information
presented in accordance with GAAP and is not intended to represent a
presentation in accordance with GAAP. In discussing its historical and
expected future results and financial condition, the Company believes
it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of and to be assisted
in a better understanding of, on a period-to-period comparative basis,
the relative impact of restructuring and other charges, the impact of
sales and operating results attributable to certain non-core businesses
disposed of, the impact of such restructuring charges and
repatriatization of dividends, as well as the impact of exchange rate
fluctuations on operating results and financial condition. The Company
believes such additional non-GAAP information provides investors with
an overall perspective of the period-to-period performance of the
Company’s core business. In addition, management internally
reviews each of these non-GAAP measures to evaluate performance on a
comparative period-to-period basis in terms of absolute performance,
trends and expected future performance with respect to its core
continuing business.

Cautionary Statement Under the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995

Statements in this
Annual Report, which are not historical facts or information, are
‘‘forward-looking statements’’ within the
meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such
forward-looking statements which may be identified by such words as
‘‘expect,’’
‘‘believe,’’
‘‘anticipate,’’
‘‘outlook,’’ ‘‘may,’’
and similar forward-looking terminology, involve significant risks and
uncertainties. Actual results of the Company may be materially
different from any future results or conditions expressed or implied by
such forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially
from management’s expectations. Such factors include, among
others, the following: general economic and business conditions in the
Company's markets, including economic, population health and
political uncertainties; weather; geopolitical and region specific
uncertainties; interest rates; the price and availability of raw
materials; the Company's ability to implement its business
strategy, including the achievement of anticipated cost savings,
profitability and growth targets; the impact of currency fluctuation or
devaluation in the Company's principal foreign markets and the
success of the Company's hedging and risk management strategies;
the impact of possible pension funding obligations and increased
pension expense on the Company's cash flow and results of
operations; and the effect of legal and regulatory proceedings, as well
as restrictions imposed on the Company, its operations or its
representatives by foreign governments; and the fact that the outcome
of litigation is highly uncertain and unpredictable and there can be no
assurance that the triers of fact or law, at either the trial level or
at any appellate level, will accept the factual assertions, factual
defenses or legal positions of the Company or its factual or expert
witnesses in any such litigation or other proceedings. The Company

ITEM
7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
RISK.

The Company enters into foreign currency forward
contracts with the objective of reducing exposure to cash flow
volatility associated with foreign currency receivables and payables,
and with anticipated purchases of certain raw materials used in
operations. These contracts, the counterparties to which are major
international financial institutions, generally involve the exchange of
one currency for a second currency at a future date, and have
maturities not exceeding six months.

The Company also uses
derivative financial instruments to hedge foreign currency exposures
resulting from forecasted purchase commitments. The Company enters into
these hedge contracts generally for periods ranging from one to three
months. The gain or loss on the hedging instrument is


recorded in earnings at the same time as the
transaction being hedged is recorded in earnings. The associated asset
or liability related to the open hedge instrument is recorded in
Current Assets or Current Liabilities, as applicable.

The
Company has executed a 10-year Yen - U.S. dollar currency swap related
to the monthly sale and purchase of products between the U.S. and
Japan. The annual notional value of this swap is approximately
$5.0  million. Gains and losses related to this swap are recorded
currently, and the mark-to-market adjustment related to the value of
the swap is reflected as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive
income.

In 2002, the Company entered into certain interest rate
swap agreements effectively converting the fixed rate on its long-term
Japanese Yen borrowings to a variable short-term rate based on the
Japanese Yen LIBOR rate plus an interest markup. These swaps are
designated as qualified fair value hedges. During 2003 and 2005, the
Company amended the swaps and the counterparty paid the Company $3.0
million and $0.8 million, respectively, including accrued interest of
$0.5 million and $0.1 million, respectively. In both cases, these net
gains have been deferred, are classified as a separate component of
debt and are being amortized over the remaining term of the debt. To
the extent the Company has not received cash or otherwise amended or
settled any swap agreements, any applicable mark-to-market adjustment
relating to that swap is included as a separate component of debt. The
Company had no ineffective interest rate swaps at December
31,  2005.

The Company uses foreign currency-rate and
interest rate-sensitive instruments to hedge a certain portion of its
existing and forecasted transactions. The Company expects that any
change in value for the hedging instrument would be offset by a change
in value related to the underlying transaction.

The
Company’s hedges of its foreign currency exposure are not
designed to and therefore cannot entirely eliminate the effect of
changes in foreign exchange rates on the Company’s consolidated
financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The
Company’s foreign currency swaps were analyzed at year-end to
determine their sensitivity to exchange rate changes. Based on the
outstanding balance of these financial instruments at December
31,  2005, a hypothetical 10% change (either an increase or
a decrease) in rates prevailing at that date, sustained for up to a
year, would not represent a material potential change in fair value,
earnings or cash flows.

At December  31,  2005, the
Company had $950.7 million of debt outstanding, including $7.9 million
in deferred gains and mark-to-market adjustments on interest rate swap
transactions. Debt, excluding the deferred swap gains, includes $499.2
million of 6.45% Notes maturing in May  2006, $314.6
million in bank borrowings and overdrafts and $129.0 million in
long-term Japanese Yen denominated debt. The Company’s
borrowings and interest rate swaps were analyzed at year-end to
determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes. Based on the
outstanding balance of all these financial instruments at
December  31,  2005, a hypothetical 10% change (either
an increase or a decrease) in interest rates prevailing at that date,
sustained for one year, would not represent a material potential change
in fair value, earnings or cash flows.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures and Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting.

The Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, with the assistance of other members of the
Company's management, have evaluated the effectiveness of the
Company's


disclosure controls and procedures as of the
end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on
such evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure
controls and procedures are effective.

The Company’s
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that
there have not been any changes in the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting during the Company’s fourth
quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting.

Management’s Report of Management is contained
in Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated
herein by reference.

Management’s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

Management of the
Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The
Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December
31,  2005. In making this assessment, management used the criteria
set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (‘‘COSO’’) in

Internal Control
– Integrated Framework

.

Based on this assessment,
management determined that, as of December  31,  2005, the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting was
effective.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Company’s
independent registered public accounting firm, has audited
management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December  31,  2005 as stated in their report which is
included herein.

The Company's Chief Executive Officer
certification was timely filed with the NYSE as required by NYSE Rule
303A(12). The Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer have each filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission the required certifications regarding the quality of the
Company's public disclosures.

(a)(1) FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:    The following
consolidated financial statements, related notes, management's
report and independent registered public accounting firm’s
report are included in this report on Form 10-K:


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and
Shareholders of International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.:

We have completed integrated audits of International Flavors
& Fragrances Inc.’s 2005 and 2004 consolidated financial
statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of
December  31,  2005 and an audit of its 2003 consolidated
financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based
on our audits, are presented below.

Consolidated
financial statements

In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under
item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. and its
subsidiaries at December  31,  2005 and 2004, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December  31,  2005 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted
our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Internal control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment,
included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December  31,  2005 based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(‘‘COSO’’), is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December  31,  2005,
based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated
Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express
opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on
our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial
reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over
financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s
assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures
as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (iii) provide


reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of
the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

NOTE 1.    NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Use of
Estimates

Preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts and accompanying disclosures. These estimates are
based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions
the Company may undertake in the future. Actual results may ultimately
differ from estimates.

Nature of
Operations

The Company is a leading creator and manufacturer
of flavor and fragrance compounds used to impart or improve flavor or
fragrance in a wide variety of consumer products. The Company's
products are sold principally to manufacturers of perfumes and
cosmetics, hair and other personal care products, soaps and detergents,
cleaning products, dairy, meat and other processed foods, beverages,
snacks and savory foods, confectionery, sweet and baked goods, and
pharmaceutical and oral care products.

Principles of
Consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include
the accounts of the Company and all subsidiaries. All intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated. To the extent a
subsidiary is not wholly-owned, any related minority interest is
included in Other liabilities and applicable (income) expense
attributable to the minority interest is included in Other (income)
expense, net.

Revenue Recognition

The
Company recognizes revenue when the earnings process is complete. This
generally occurs when (i) products are shipped to the customer in
accordance with the terms of sale, (ii) title and risk of loss have
been transferred and (iii) collectibility is reasonably assured.
Accruals are made for sales returns and other allowances based on the
Company’s historical experience.

Foreign
Currency Translation

The assets and liabilities of non-U.S.
subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange
rates. Income and expense items are translated at average exchange
rates during the year. Cumulative translation adjustments are shown as
a separate component of Shareholders' Equity.

Research and Development

All research and
development costs are expensed as incurred.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower
of cost (on an average basis) or market.

Cash
Equivalents

Cash equivalents include highly liquid
investments with maturities of three months or less at date of
purchase.

Property, Plant and
Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis, principally over
the following estimated useful lives: buildings and improvements, 10 to
40 years; machinery and equipment, 3 to 10 years; information
technology hardware and software, 3 to 7 years; and leasehold
improvements which are included in buildings and improvements, the
estimated life of the improvements or the remaining term of the lease,
whichever is shorter.

The Company reviews its long-lived assets
for impairment when events or changes in business conditions indicate
that their full carrying value may not be recovered. An estimate of
undiscounted future cash flows produced by an asset or group of assets
is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment
exists. If assets are determined to be impaired, the loss is measured
based on an estimate of fair value using various valuation techniques,
including a discounted estimate of future cash flows.


Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets

Identifiable intangible assets include patents,
trademarks and other intellectual property valued at acquisition
primarily through independent appraisals, and are amortized on a
straight-line basis over periods ranging from 7 to 20 years. For
purposes of assessing impairment, the fair values for goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangibles are determined based on discounted cash
flows, market multiples or appraised values, as appropriate. The
Company completed its annual goodwill impairment assessment and no
adjustments to goodwill were necessary.

Income
Taxes

Deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary
differences between the amount of assets and liabilities recognized for
financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax
purposes, based on tax laws as currently enacted. Additional taxes
which would result from distributions by subsidiary companies to the
parent are provided to the extent anticipated. No provision is made for
additional taxes on undistributed earnings of subsidiary companies that
are intended to be indefinitely invested in such subsidiaries. No
income tax benefit is attributed to the currency translation component
of Accumulated other comprehensive income.

Retirement
Benefits

Current service costs of retirement plans and
postretirement health care and life insurance benefits are accrued
currently. Prior service costs resulting from plan improvements are
amortized over periods ranging from 10 to 20 years.

Financial Instruments

The Company enters into
derivative instruments with terms that match the underlying exposure
being hedged. The Company's derivative instruments that qualify
for hedge accounting treatment are designated as cash flow hedges and
are considered highly effective. The net gain or loss from hedge
ineffectiveness is not material. The changes in value of the derivative
are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income and are
recognized in earnings when the offsetting effect of the hedged item is
recognized in earnings. The Company also uses derivative financial
instruments to manage interest and foreign currency exposures. The gain
or loss on the hedging instrument is recorded in earnings at the same
time as the transaction being hedged is recorded in earnings. The
associated asset or liability related to the open hedge instrument is
recorded in Current Assets or Current Liabilities, as applicable.

Risks and Uncertainties

The diversity of the
Company's products, customers and geographic operations
significantly reduces the risk that a severe impact will occur in the
near term as a result of changes in its customer base, competition,
sources of supply or markets.

Software
Costs

The Company capitalizes direct internal and external
development costs associated with internal-use software. Neither
preliminary evaluation costs nor costs associated with the software
after implementation are capitalized.

Shipping and
Handling Costs

Net sales include shipping and handling
charges billed to customers. Cost of goods sold includes all costs
incurred in connection with shipping and handling.

Net
Income Per Share

Net income per share is based on the
weighted average number of shares outstanding. A reconciliation of
shares used in the computations of basic and diluted net income per
share is as follows:

Net income used in the
computation of net income per share is unaffected by the assumed
issuance of stock under the Company's stock plans.

Options
to purchase 1,018,892, 761,750, and 4,440,455 shares were outstanding
at December  31,  2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, but not
included in the computation of diluted net income per share because the
exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the
common shares in the respective years.


Stock Plans

The
Company has stock-based compensation plans which are described more
fully in Note 12. The Company has applied the recognition and
measurement principles of APB 25 and related Interpretations in
accounting for these plans. No compensation expense for employee stock
options is reflected in net income, as all options granted under such
plans had an exercise price not less than the market value of the
common stock on the date of the grant. Net income, as reported,
includes pre-tax compensation expense related to restricted stock and
restricted stock units (‘‘RSU’s’’) of
$7.3  million, $8.1  million, and $1.8  million for the
years ended December  31,  2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

The following table illustrates the effect on net
income and net income per share if the Company had applied the fair
value recognition provisions of FAS No. 123, ‘‘Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation,’’ for the years ended
December  31,  2005, 2004 and 2003.

These pro-forma amounts may not be
representative of future results because the estimated fair value of
stock options is amortized to expense over the vesting period, and
additional options may be granted in future years.

The Company
granted annual RSU awards in 2004 and 2005 as elements of its equity
compensation plans for all eligible U.S. - based employees and a
majority of eligible overseas employees. Vesting of the RSU’s
for the Company’s senior management is both performance and time
based, and for the remainder of the eligible employees, vesting is time
based; vesting is generally three years from date of grant.

New Accounting Standards

Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (‘‘SFAS’’) No. 123(R)
Share-Based Payment (‘‘FAS 123R’’) was issued
in December  2004. FAS 123R is effective for the first reporting
period beginning after December  15,  2005. FAS 123R
supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees (‘‘APB 25’’) and
establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an
entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. Under
FAS 123R, the Company must determine the fair value model to be used
for valuing share-based payments, the amortization method for
compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of
adoption. The Company will adopt the new requirements using the
modified prospective transition method in the first quarter which ends
March  31,  2006.

SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, an
amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4 ("FAS
151"), was issued in November  2004. FAS 151
clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense,
freight, handling costs and wasted materials. Additionally, FAS 151
Statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the
costs of conversion be based on normal capacity of production
facilities. This statement is effective January  1,  2006 and
the Company believes its adoption will not have a material impact on
reported results.


In March  2005, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (‘‘FASB’’) issued
FASB Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations, which clarifies that a conditional asset retirement
obligation, as used in SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations, refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset
retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are
conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control
of the Company. This Statement was effective for 2005 and did not have
a material impact on reported results.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have
been made to the prior years' financial statements to conform to
2005 classifications.

NOTE 2.    RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER
CHARGES

In 2005, the Company undertook to eliminate
approximately 300 positions in manufacturing, selling, research and
administration functions, principally in its European and North
American operating regions. The majority of affected positions involve
employee separation while the balance relates to open positions that
will not be filled. As a result of these actions, the Company
recognized pre-tax charges of $23.3  million in 2005 related
primarily to employee separation expenses.

In 2004, the Company
disposed of its European fruit preparations business; proceeds from the
sale were $40.0  million, including assumption of certain
liabilities. In addition, the Company closed its Canadian manufacturing
facility and began the process of closing its manufacturing facility in
Dijon, France. As a result, the Company eliminated 302 positions, and
recognized pre-tax charges of $31.8  million, of which $25.8
million related to employee terminations and $6.0  million to
location closures and asset write-downs, and other related
reorganization actions; the asset-related charges were net of gains of
$16.3  million related to the sale of the fruit business and
Canadian facility.

In 2003, the Company recorded pre-tax charges
of $42.4  million, of which $38.0  million related to the
elimination of 321 employee positions and $4.4  million related to
location closures and asset write-downs. The $4.4  million
asset-related charges primarily relate to updates on costs for
previously commenced actions.

With respect to all restructuring
and other charges:

•

Separation
costs for the employees relate primarily to severance, outplacement and
other benefit costs;

•

Asset
write-down charges relate to establishment of the new carrying value
for assets held for sale or disposal; and

•

Other costs include lease
termination costs and other reorganization expenses incurred to affect
either the employee separation or location closure.

Movements in
related accruals were:


The 2004 asset-related accruals exclude
gains of $16.3  million arising on the sale of the fruit business
and Canadian facility; such gains were considered in determining
Restructuring and other charges of $31.8  million reported in
2004.

The employee-related liabilities are expected to be
utilized by 2008 as obligations are satisfied; asset-related charges
will be utilized in 2007 on final decommissioning and disposal of
affected equipment.

NOTE 3.    INVENTORIES

NOTE 4.    PROPERTY, PLANT AND
EQUIPMENT, NET


NOTE 5.    GOODWILL AND OTHER
INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET

Goodwill by operating segment for 2005
and 2004 is as follows:

Trademark and
other intangible assets consist of the following amounts:

Amortization expense for the year
ended December  31,  2005 was $15.1  million; estimated
annual amortization is $14.8  million in 2006, $13.5  million
in 2007 and $6.8  million in 2008 thru 2010. In 2005, 2004 and
2003, the Company performed its impairment assessments and concluded
there was no impairment.

NOTE 6.    OTHER ASSETS

Other Assets consist of the following amounts:

NOTE 7.    OTHER CURRENT
LIABILITIES

Other current liabilities consist of the following
amounts:


NOTE 8.    SALE AND LEASEBACK
TRANSACTIONS

In connection with the disposition of certain real
estate assets, the Company entered into long-term operating leases with
respect to the facilities disposed of. The leases are classified as
operating leases in accordance with SFAS No. 13,
‘‘Accounting for Leases,’’ and the gains
realized on the sale have been deferred and are being credited to
income over the initial lease term. The Company had deferred gains on
disposition of real estate totaling $70.7  million and $73.4
million at December  31,  2005 and 2004, respectively, of
which $67.7  million and $70.4  million, respectively, are
reflected in the accompanying balance sheet under the caption Deferred
gains, with the remainder included as a component of Other current
liabilities.

NOTE 9.    BORROWINGS

Debt consists of
the following at December  31:

Commercial paper issued by the
Company generally has terms of 30 days or less; there were no
outstanding commercial paper borrowings at December  31,
2005 or 2004.

In 2001, the Company issued $700.0  million
of 6.45% Notes; the Notes mature May  15,  2006.
During 2003, the Company repurchased $200.7  million of these
Notes in a series of open-market transactions. At December
31,  2005, these Notes represent the current portion of long-term
debt.

In 2005, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries
entered into a revolving credit agreement (the
‘‘Agreement’’ or the
‘‘Facility’’) with certain banks which replaced
existing credit facilities. The Agreement provides for a five-year US
$350,000,000 (‘‘Tranche A’’) and Euro
400,000,000 (‘‘Tranche B’’) multi-currency
revolving credit facility. Tranche A is available for commercial paper
backstop and general corporate purposes; Tranche B is available to
European subsidiaries for general corporate purposes. Borrowings under
the Facility bear interest at an annual rate of LIBOR (London Inter
Bank Offer Rate) (or in relation to any Euro-denominated loans,
EURIBOR, European Inter Bank Offer Rate) plus a margin, currently 20
basis points, linked to the credit rating of the Company. The Company
pays a commitment fee on the aggregate unused commitments and a
utilization fee based on amounts outstanding under the Facility; such
fees are not material. The Company may request an extension of the
Facility for up to two years beyond the original term of the Agreement.
The Facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants
customary in a facility of this type, including a covenant requiring
the Company to maintain, at the end of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of
net debt for borrowed money to EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes,
Depreciation and Amortization) in respect of the previous 12-month
period of not more than 3.25 to 1. The Company has complied with this
covenant at all times.

Short-term bank loans primarily in the
form of overdrafts, in addition to the above multi-currency facility,
were outstanding in several foreign countries and averaged $33.1
million in 2005, compared with $22.2  million in 2004. The highest
levels were $314.7  million in 2005, $33.8  million in 2004,
and


$37.4  million in 2003, respectively.
The 2005 weighted average interest rate of these foreign bank loans,
based on balances outstanding at the end of each month, was 3.4%
and the average rate on loans outstanding at December  31,
2005 was 2.8%. These rates compare with 3.2% and
4.7%, respectively, in 2004 and 4.1% and 3.7%,
respectively, in 2003.

Annual maturities on long-term debt
outstanding at December  31,  2005 are: 2006, $499.2
million; 2007, $0; 2008, $113.4  million; 2009, $0, and 2010 and
thereafter, $15.6  million. The estimated fair value of the
long-term debt at December  31,  2005 and 2004, based on
borrowing rates currently available to the Company with similar terms
and maturities, approximated the recorded amount.

The Company
has various interest rate swaps, the market value of which is included
in the caption FAS 133 adjustment. Interest rate swaps that have been
monetized and will be amortized over the life of the debt are reported
as Deferred realized gains on interest rate swaps.

Cash payments
for interest were $37.0  million in 2005, $36.7  million in
2004 and $44.6  million in 2003; such cash payments exclude the
benefit of cash the Company received under its various interest rate
swap agreements of $11.6  million in 2003; there were no new swap
agreements in 2005 or 2004.

At December  31,  2005 and
2004, the Company and its subsidiaries had unused lines of credit
approximating $641.0  million and $590.0  million,
respectively, in addition to the Facility.

NOTE
10.    INCOME TAXES

The following tables show the components
of consolidated income before taxes, and current and deferred income
tax expense by taxing jurisdiction, both domestic and foreign:


At December  31,  2005 and 2004,
gross deferred tax assets were $162.1  million and $165.6
million, respectively; gross deferred tax liabilities were $33.5
million and $72.2  million, respectively. No valuation allowance
was required for deferred tax assets. At December  31,  2005
and 2004, non-current deferred tax assets of $53.2  million and
$14.1  million, respectively, were included in Other Assets. The
principal components of deferred tax assets (liabilities) were:

Of the tax credit carryforwards,
$1.0  million will expire in 2013; the remainder can be carried
forward indefinitely.

Undistributed earnings of foreign
subsidiaries for which no deferred taxes have been provided totaled
$550.9  million and $647.1  million at December
31,  2005 and 2004, respectively. The portion of these foreign
earnings which the Company intends to indefinitely reinvest in its
foreign operations totaled $139.8  million and $228.1
million at December  31,  2005 and 2004, respectively. No
federal income or foreign withholding tax has been provided on these
indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings. Any additional U.S. taxes
payable on the remaining foreign earnings, if remitted, would be
substantially offset by credits for foreign taxes already paid.

In 2005, the effective tax rate was significantly reduced as a
result of a tax benefit associated with The American Jobs Creation Act
of 2004 (‘‘AJCA’’). AJCA, enacted on
October 22, 2004, provided for a special one-time tax deduction
of 85% of dividends received on eligible repatriated foreign
earnings; the deduction resulted in an approximate 5.25% federal
tax rate on these earnings. Tax expense for 2005 reflects a benefit of
$24.7  million relating to the Company's repatriation of
$242.0  million of dividends from foreign subsidiaries under the
provisions of AJCA. The benefit results from the reversal of prior
accruals relating to the repatriation of foreign earnings, net of the
applicable reduced U.S. tax cost of eligible repatriated foreign
earnings, as provided for in AJCA

A reconciliation between the
U.S. federal income tax rate and the effective tax rate is:

Income taxes paid were
$66.7  million in 2005, $75.4  million in 2004 and
$96.9  million in 2003.


NOTE
11.    SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

On March  9,
2000, the Company adopted a shareholder protection rights agreement
(the ‘‘Rights Agreement’’) and declared a
dividend of one right on each share of common stock outstanding on
March  24,  2000 or issued thereafter.

Under the
Rights Agreement, as amended, until a person or group acquires
15% or more of the Company's common stock or commences a
tender offer that would result in such person's or group's
owning 15% or more, the rights are evidenced by the common stock
certificates, automatically trade with the common stock and are not
exercisable.

Thereafter, if the Company is involved in a merger
or sells more than 50% of its assets or earning power, each
right entitles its holder to purchase a certain number of shares for a
specified exercise price. Also, under certain circumstances, the
Company's Board of Directors has the option to redeem or exchange
one share of common stock for each right. Finally, in the event a new
Board of Directors is elected in a successful proxy contest, (i) the
rights may not be redeemed and no business combination with the Company
can be effected for 180 days thereafter unless certain procedures are
followed to ensure (A) that steps are taken to maximize shareholder
value, or (B) that any decision to redeem the rights, if challenged,
would meet an ‘‘entire fairness’’ test; and
(ii) the Rights Agreement may not be amended during such 180-day
period. To establish ‘‘entire fairness’’ in
connection with a redemption, the new Board must be able to demonstrate
that all aspects of the redemption decision were fair, including the
redemption procedure and the financial terms of the redemption. The
Rights Agreement expires in March  2010.

The Board of
Directors authorized share repurchase programs of $100.0  million
in July  2004 and $200.0  million in May  2005. The
Company completed the 2004 program during 2005. At December
31,  2005, $177.2  million remained under the 2005 plan. The
repurchased shares may be used in connection with equity compensation
programs and for other general corporate purposes.

Dividends
paid per share were $0.72, $0.67 and $0.62 in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

The Accumulated other comprehensive income balance
includes Cumulative translation adjustments of ($47.4) million and
$8.2  million, Accumulated (losses) gains on derivatives
qualifying as hedges of ($2.6) million and ($5.7) million, and Minimum
pension liability of ($100.4) million and ($110.7) million, at
December  31,  2005 and 2004, respectively. Amounts are shown
net of tax, where appropriate.

NOTE 12.    STOCK PLANS

The Company has various equity plans under which the Company's
officers, directors and key employees may be granted options to
purchase the Company's common stock at 100% of the market
price on the day the option is granted or may receive other forms of
equity-based awards. Prior to 2004, stock option plans were the primary
form of equity compensation. In 2004, the Company granted RSU’s
as an element of its incentive compensation plans for all eligible U.S.
- - based employees and a majority of eligible overseas employees.
Vesting of the RSU’s for the Company’s senior management
is performance and time based, and for the remainder of eligible
employees, vesting is time based; the vesting period is generally three
years from date of grant. Compensation expense is recognized over the
vesting period.

Options granted prior to May  2001
generally become exercisable no earlier than two years after the date
of grant and expire 10 years after the date of grant. Options granted
after May  1,  2001 generally become exercisable no earlier
than one year from the date of grant and expire 10 years after grant
date, except for options granted to certain foreign employees, which
may be exercised immediately.

During 2005, options were granted
at exercise prices ranging from $39.00 to $42.12 per share. At
December  31,  2005, the price range for shares under option
was $17.94 to $49.88; options for 5,614,291 shares were exercisable at
that date.

The Company maintained a Global Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (‘‘GESPP’’). Eligible employees
were allowed to purchase a limited number of shares of the
Company's common stock at a


discount of 15% of the market value on
the grant date. The effective purchase date is one year after grant.
Shares purchased under the GESPP in 2004 and 2003 were 156,256 and
188,862, respectively. There were no shares purchased under the 2005
grant as the share price at December  31,  2005 was less than
the discounted grant date value.

Stock plan transactions
were:

The weighted average
exercise prices of the Company’s options exercisable at
December  31,  2005, 2004 and 2003 were $32.18, $32.82 and
$33.02, respectively. The following table summarizes information
concerning currently outstanding and exercisable options:

Using
the Black-Scholes option valuation model, the estimated fair values of
options granted during 2005, 2004 and 2003 were $10.57, $9.42 and
$7.84, respectively. The Black-Scholes model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting
restrictions. In addition, such models require the use of subjective
assumptions, including expected stock price volatility. In
management's opinion, such valuation models do not necessarily
provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee
stock options.


Principal assumptions used in applying the
Black-Scholes model were:

NOTE
13.    SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company manages its
operations by major geographical region. Flavors and fragrances have
similar economic and operational characteristics including research and
development, the nature of the creative and production processes, the
type of customers, and the methods by which products are distributed.
Accounting policies used for segment reporting are identical to those
described in Note 1.

The Company evaluates the performance of
its geographic regions based on segment profit which is income before
taxes on income, excluding interest expense, other income and expense
and the effects of restructuring and other charges and accounting
changes. The Company is divided into five geographic regions for
management purposes: North America, Europe, India, Latin America and
Asia Pacific. The Global Expenses caption represents corporate and
headquarters-related expenses which include legal, finance, human
resource and other administrative expenses not allocable to individual
regions. Transfers between geographic regions are accounted for at
prices that approximate arm's-length prices. Unallocated assets
are principally cash, short-term investments and other corporate and
headquarters-related assets. The Company’s reportable segment
information follows:


Sales of fragrance products were
$1,135.7  million, $1,123.1  million, and $1,035.0
million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Sales of flavor products
were $857.7  million, $910.6  million and $866.5
million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Sales in the United
States, based on the final country of destination of the Company's
products, were $536.7  million, $564.5  million and
$520.3  million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. No other
country of destination exceeded 7% of consolidated sales. No
customer accounted for 10% or more of sales. Total long-lived
assets consists of net property, plant and equipment and net intangible
assets and amounted to $1,271.8  million, $1,291.0  million
and $1,310.0  million at December  31,  2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively; of the respective totals, $946.3  million,
$965.6  million and $998.4  million were located in the
United States. No other individual country had long-lived assets that
exceeded 10% of total long-lived assets.

Net foreign
exchange transactions resulted in a gain of $2.8  million in 2005,
a loss of $2.9  million in 2004, and a gain of $1.6  million
in 2003, and are included in Other (income) expense, net.

NOTE
14.    RETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company and most of its
subsidiaries have pension and/or other retirement benefit plans
covering substantially all employees. Pension benefits are generally
based on years of service and on compensation during the final years of
employment. Plan assets consist primarily of equity securities and
corporate and government fixed income securities. Substantially all
pension benefit costs are funded as accrued; such funding is limited,
where applicable, to amounts deductible for income tax purposes.
Certain other retirement benefits are provided by balance sheet
accruals. Contributions to defined contribution plans are mainly
determined as a percentage of salary. Contributions to the
Company's United States defined contribution plan match 50%
of the employee's pre-tax contributions, up to plan limits.

In addition to pension benefits, certain health care and life
insurance benefits are provided to qualifying United States employees
upon retirement from the Company. Such coverage is provided through
insurance plans with premiums based on benefits paid. The Company does
not generally provide health care or life insurance coverage for
retired employees of foreign subsidiaries; such benefits are provided
in most foreign countries by government-sponsored plans, and the cost
of these programs is not significant to the Company.


The plan assets and benefit obligations of
a majority of the Company’s pension plans are measured at
December  31 of each year.

Pension expense included the
following components:

With respect to the U.S. plans,
the expected return on plan assets was determined based on an asset
allocation model using the current benchmark allocation, real rates of
return by asset class and an anticipated inflation rate. The benchmark
asset allocation was approximately 10 - 20% employed in cash and
fixed income investments expected to yield 1.1%; 10 - 20%
employed in corporate and government bonds expected to yield 1.7 -
2.8%; and 65 - 75% in equity investments with a long-term
expected yield of 8.5 - 9.1%. The inflation rate assumed in the
model was 2.5%. The U.S. plan has employed a similar asset
allocation strategy for the prior 15 years and has achieved a compound
annual return of 9.2% during this period. The expected annual
rate of return for the non-U.S. plans employs a similar set of criteria
adapted for local investments, inflation rates and in certain cases
specific government requirements. The discount rate used for
determining future pension obligations for each individual plan is
based on a review of long-term bonds that receive a high rating from a
recognized rating agency. Additionally, for the U.S. plans, the
discount rate was based on the internal rate of return for a portfolio
of Moody’s Aa3-rated bonds with maturities that are consistent
with the projected future benefit payment obligations of the plan. The
rate of compensation increase is based on plan experience.

The
Company's pension plan asset allocation for U.S. plans at
December  31,  2005 and 2004, and target allocation for 2006
is:

Equity investments include the
Company's common stock valued at $17.4  million (6.0%
of total plan assets) and $22.2  million (8.0% of total
plan assets) at December  31,  2005 and 2004,
respectively.


In 2005, the percentage of assets held in
equities decreased primarily as a result of market performance relative
to fixed income investments. There has been no change in the
Company's long-term target allocation.

The Company's
pension plan asset allocation for Non-U.S. plans at December
31,  2005 and 2004, and target allocation for 2006 is:

Total Non-U.S. plan assets consist
of a blend of various asset mixes defined by each plan’s
liability profile and country or statutory requirements. Each plan
maintains an investment policy appropriate to meet its benefit
obligations.

Expense recognized for postretirement benefits
other than pensions included the following components:

The following weighted average
assumptions were used to determine the Company’s postretirement
benefit expense for the years ended December  31:


Changes in pension and postretirement
benefit obligations were:


The following weighted average assumptions
were used to determine the Company’s pension benefit obligations
under the plans at December  31:

The following weighted average
assumptions were used to determine the Company’s postretirement
benefit obligations at December  31:

Changes in pension plan assets were:

The funded status
of pension and postretirement plans at December  31 was:


Pension assets and liabilities included in
the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December  31 were:

At December  31,  2005, of
the net amount recognized above, $65.2  million of the Non-U.S.
prepaid benefit cost is included in Other Assets with the remaining
amount included in Prepaid expenses in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet.

At the end of 2005 and 2004, the projected benefit
obligation (‘‘PBO’’), accumulated benefit
obligation (‘‘ABO’’), and fair value of plan
assets for the U.S. pension plans and pension plans outside the U.S.,
where the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the assets, were:

The effect of a .25% decrease
in the discount rate on the U.S. pension plan would be to increase the
pension expense in the subsequent year by approximately $0.9
million. The same change in the discount rate would result in an
increase in the ABO of $8.9  million, an increase in the
additional minimum pension liability (‘‘AML’’)
included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
(‘‘AOCI’’) of $8.9  million, and an
increase in the PBO of $9.7  million at the 2005 year-end. The
effect of a .25% decrease in the long term rate of return on
plan assets would increase expense in the subsequent year by $0.7
million.

The effect of a .25% decrease in the discount
rate on the Non-U.S. pension plans would be to increase the pension
expense in the subsequent year by approximately $1.9  million. The
same change would result in an increase in the ABO of $22.6
million, an increase in the AML included in AOCI of $36.3  million
and an increase in the PBO of $25.4  million at the 2005 year-end.
The effect of a .25% decrease in the long term rate of return on
plan assets would increase expense in the subsequent year by $1.3
million.

The effect of a .25% decrease in the discount
rate on the postretirement benefit plan would be to increase the
expense in the subsequent year by approximately $0.5  million. The
same change in the discount rate would result in an increase in the
APBO of $4.7  million.

The special termination benefits in
2004 are the result of termination agreements in the U.S. providing for
enhanced retirement benefits to eligible employees. The amounts
reported as a curtailment, a settlement and a divestiture in the 2004
Non-U.S. plans is a result of the sale of the Company’s fruit
businesses to Frutarom.

The Company recorded in AOCI an AML of
$147.1  million ($100.4  million net of taxes) and
$159.7  million ($110.7  million net of taxes) at
December  31,  2005 and 2004, respectively, as required by
SFAS No. 87, ‘‘Employers’ Accounting for
Pensions.’’ The AML is reflected in Retirement liabilities
and is prescribed when the accumulated benefit obligation in the plan
exceeds the fair value of the underlying pension plan assets and
accrued pension liabilities. The adjustment relates to plans in the
United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Ireland and Japan. Changes
in the AML included in AOCI for U.S. and Non-U.S. pension plans were as
follows:


Information about the expected cash
flows for the pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are as
follows:

Expected U.S. pension plan employer
contributions include approximately $2.7  million in benefit
payments for a non-qualified plan. Non-U.S. plan contributions are
based on current actuarial assumptions and funding plans in place.

The effect of a 1% increase in the assumed medical rate of
inflation would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation, and the annual postretirement expense, by approximately
$20.8  million and $2.0  million, respectively; a 1%
decrease in the rate would decrease the obligation and expense by
approximately $16.4  million and $1.6  million,
respectively.

The Company amended its postretirement medical and
life insurance plan in 2003. The plan changes require retirees to
increase their contribution amounts over a three-year period to a rate
equal to active employees and for all retiree prescription co-payments
to increase to the amounts currently paid by active employees.

On December  8,  2003, President Bush signed into law the
Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.
In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff
Position No. 106-2 (‘‘FSP FAS 106-2’’),
‘‘Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the
Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of
2003,’’ the Company accounted for the effects of the Act
and recognized the impact of the Medicare prescription drug subsidy
retrospectively from January  1,  2004 beginning July
1,  2004. The subsidy reduced the January  1,  2005 and
2004 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $14.5
million and $12.4  million, respectively, and the 2005 and 2004
annual postretirement expense by $2.0  million and $1.8
million, respectively.

The expected benefit payments shown above
are net of the Medicare Part D subsidy. The following table shows the
expected benefit payments prior to reflecting the subsidy, the expected
subsidy and the expected benefit payments reflecting the subsidy.


NOTE 15.    FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS

The Company enters into foreign currency forward
contracts with the objective of reducing exposure to cash flow
volatility associated with foreign currency receivables and payables,
and with anticipated purchases of certain raw materials used in
operations. These contracts, the counterparties to which are major
international financial institutions, generally involve the exchange of
one currency for a second currency at a future date, and have
maturities not exceeding six months. The notional amount and maturity
dates of such contracts match those of the underlying transactions. The
gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recorded in earnings at the
same time as the transaction being hedged is recorded in earnings. The
associated asset or liability related to the open hedge instrument is
recorded in Current Assets or Current Liabilities, as applicable.

The Company employs various interest rate swaps and debt issuances
with the objective of managing and optimizing its interest rate
exposure. In 2001, the Company entered into certain interest swap
agreements effectively converting the fixed coupon rate on its
6.45% Notes to a variable short-term rate based on the LIBOR
plus an interest markup. In response to changes in market conditions
and the value of the swaps, and in 2003, in connection with the
Company's debt repurchase, the Company periodically amended the
swap agreements, changing the related interest spread. As a result of
these amendments, the counterparty paid the Company $11.6 million and
$56.5 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, including accrued
interest of $3.7 million and $6.5 million, respectively. The net
realized gains on the swaps have been deferred, classified as a
separate component of debt, and are amortized as a reduction in
interest expense over the remaining term of the Notes. In 2003, the
Company terminated all such swap agreements; as a result, the interest
rate on the Notes, including amortization of the deferred swap gains,
was fixed at 3.4% through maturity of the Notes.

The
Company has executed a 10-year Yen - U.S. dollar currency swap related
to the monthly sale and purchase of products between the U.S. and
Japan. The annual notional value of this swap is approximately
$5.0  million. Gains and losses related to this swap are recorded
currently, and the mark-to-market adjustment related to the value of
the swap is reflected as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive
income.

In 2002, the Company entered into certain interest rate
swap agreements effectively converting the fixed rate on its long-term
Japanese Yen borrowings to a variable short-term rate based on the
Japanese Yen LIBOR rate plus an interest markup. These swaps are
designated as qualified fair value hedges. During 2003 and 2005, the
Company amended the swaps and the counterparty paid the Company $3.0
million and $0.8 million, respectively, including accrued interest of
$0.5 million and $0.1 million, respectively. In both cases, these net
gains have been deferred, are classified as a separate component of
debt and are being amortized over the remaining term of the debt. To
the extent the Company has not received cash or otherwise amended or
settled any swap agreements, any applicable mark-to-market adjustment
relating to that swap is included as a separate component of debt. The
Company had no ineffective interest rate swaps at December
31,  2005.

NOTE 16.    CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT
RISK

The Company has no significant concentrations of risk in
financial instruments. Temporary investments are made in a
well-diversified portfolio of high-quality, liquid obligations of
government, corporate and financial institutions. There are also
limited concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables
because of the large number of customers spread across many industries
and geographic regions.

NOTE 17.    COMMITMENTS AND
CONTINGENCIES

Minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable
operating leases are $21.7  million in 2006, $20.6  million
in 2007, $17.6  million in 2008, $15.6  million in 2009,
$15.2  million in 2010, and thereafter through 2030, the aggregate
lease obligations are $218.9  million. The corresponding rental
expense amounted to $21.3  million, $20.8  million and
$20.7  million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. None of the
Company’s leases contain step rent provisions or escalation
clauses nor do they require capital improvement funding.


The Company is party to a number of
lawsuits and claims related primarily to flavoring supplied by the
Company to manufacturers of butter flavor popcorn. At each balance
sheet date, or more frequently as conditions warrant, the Company
reviews the status of each pending claim, as well as its insurance
coverage for such claims with due consideration given to potentially
applicable deductibles, retentions and reservation of rights under its
insurance policies, and the advice of its outside legal counsel and a
third party expert in modeling insurance deductible amounts with
respect to all these matters. While the ultimate outcome of any
litigation cannot be predicted, management believes that adequate
provision has been made with respect to all known claims. There can be
no assurance that future events will not require the Company to
increase the amount it has accrued for any matter or accrue for a
matter that has not been previously accrued.

The Company
recorded its expected liability with respect to these claims in Other
liabilities and expected recoveries from its insurance carrier group in
Other Assets. The Company believes that realization of the insurance
receivable is probable due to the terms of the insurance policies, the
financial strength of the insurance carrier group and the payment
experience to date of the carrier group as it relates to these
claims.
