Business Overview

CarMax, Inc. was
incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1996. Its corporate offices are located at 4900 Cox Road, Glen Allen, Va. CarMax, Inc. is a holding company and its operations are conducted through its subsidiaries.

Under the ownership of Circuit City Stores, Inc. (“Circuit City”), CarMax began
operations in 1993 when it opened its first superstore in Richmond, Va. In fiscal 1997, Circuit City created two common stock series, Circuit City Stores, Inc.–Circuit City Group common stock and Circuit City Stores, Inc.–CarMax Group
(“CarMax Group”) common stock. On February 7, 1997, Circuit City completed an initial public offering of CarMax Group common stock, which was intended to track separately the performance of the CarMax operations. On October 1, 2002, the
CarMax business was separated from Circuit City through a tax-free transaction in which each share of CarMax Group common stock was exchanged for one share of CarMax, Inc. common stock. In addition, each holder of Circuit City Group common stock
received a distribution of a 0.313879 share of CarMax, Inc. common stock for each Circuit City Group share owned. As a result of the separation, all of the businesses, assets, and liabilities of the former CarMax Group are held in CarMax, Inc., an
independent, separately traded public company.

CarMax is the nation’s
largest retailer of used cars. The company purchases, reconditions, and sells used vehicles. CarMax opened a total of 33 used car superstores through fiscal 2000 before slowing its geographic growth to focus on improving sales and profits. CarMax
resumed geographic growth at the end of fiscal 2002 and through the end of fiscal 2005 opened an additional 25 used car superstores. The company also sells new vehicles under various franchise agreements. As planned, CarMax’s new car sales have
become a smaller part of its business mix as it has divested 14 new car franchises over the past four fiscal years while aggressively growing its used car business. CarMax intends to operate the seven new car franchises it currently owns for the
foreseeable future. In fiscal 2005, used vehicles represented 92% of the total retail vehicle units sold by CarMax.

CarMax provides its customers the opportunity to shop for vehicles the same way they shop for items at other “big-box” retailers by offering a broad selection
of high quality vehicles at low, no-haggle prices in a customer-friendly atmosphere. The company has separated the practice of trading in a used vehicle in conjunction with the purchase of another vehicle into two distinct and independent
transactions. CarMax provides an appraisal that allows current vehicle owners to sell their cars to CarMax regardless of their intent to purchase a vehicle from the company. CarMax also provides its customers with a full range of related services,
including the financing of vehicle purchases through CarMax Auto Finance (“CAF”) and third-party lenders, the sale of extended service plans and accessories, and vehicle repair service. CAF, the company’s own finance operation,
provides prime-rated financing to qualified customers for used and new car sales.



The CarMax process is designed to enable customers to evaluate separately each component of the sales process and to make
informed decisions on each component based on comprehensive information about their options and the associated prices. The customer can take or leave any aspect of the offer without affecting the offer on the other steps in the sales process.
CarMax’s no-haggle pricing and its commission structure, which is based on a fixed dollars-per-unit standard, allow its sales consultants to focus solely on meeting customer needs.

Industry and Competition.

With calendar year 2004 sales of approximately $367 billion, used vehicles make up nearly half of the U.S.
auto retail market, the largest retail segment of the economy. In calendar 2004, there were an estimated 42.5 million used vehicles sold compared with 16.9 million new vehicles. CarMax’s primary focus, late-model vehicles that are 1 to 6 years
old, is estimated at approximately $265 billion in annual sales and 20 million units per year.

Automotive retailing is highly competitive. Consumers typically have many choices when deciding where to purchase a used or new vehicle. In both the used and new vehicle markets, CarMax seeks to distinguish itself
from traditional dealerships through its consumer offer, sales approach, and other innovative operating strategies. The company’s primary competitors are the nation’s approximately 21,650 franchised new car dealers, which sell the majority
of late-model used vehicles. CarMax also competes with independent dealers and private individuals.

The company believes that its principal competitive factors in used vehicle retailing are price; breadth of selection, including the more popular makes and models; quality of vehicles; location of retail sites; and
degree of customer satisfaction with the car-buying experience. Customer satisfaction is driven by CarMax’s customer-friendly sales process, the quality of the used cars sold, and the services the company provides. CarMax’s Certified
Quality Inspection assures that every vehicle offered for sale at CarMax meets stringent mechanical, electrical, and safety standards. Upon request by the customer, CarMax will transfer virtually any used vehicle in the company’s nationwide
inventory to a local superstore. Transfers are free within a market; long distance transfers include a charge to cover transportation costs. CarMax backs every vehicle with a 5-day or 250-mile, money-back guarantee, and a 30-day limited warranty.
Other competitive factors include the ability to offer or arrange customer financing on competitive terms and the comprehensiveness and cost of extended service plans. CarMax believes that it is competitive in all of these areas and that it enjoys
advantages over competitors that employ traditional automotive selling methods.

CarMax’s sales consultants play a significant role in ensuring a customer-friendly sales process. A sales consultant is paid a commission based on a fixed dollars-per-unit standard. This ensures that the sales consultant’s primary
objective is helping customers find the right cars for their needs at prices they can afford. In contrast, sales and finance personnel at traditional dealerships often receive higher commissions for negotiating higher prices and for steering
customers toward vehicles with higher gross margins.

In the new vehicle
market, CarMax competes with other franchised dealers offering vehicles produced by the same or other manufacturers. Historically the new vehicle market has been served primarily by dealerships employing traditional high-pressure,
negotiation-oriented sales techniques. The company believes its customer-friendly, low-pressure sales methods are points of competitive differentiation.

Marketing and Advertising.

CarMax’s marketing strategies are focused on developing awareness of the advantages of shopping at its stores and on attracting
customers who are already in the market to buy or sell a vehicle. The company uses market awareness and customer satisfaction surveys to help tailor its marketing efforts to the purchasing habits and preferences of customers in each market area.
CarMax’s marketing strategies are implemented primarily through television and radio broadcasts, newspaper advertising, and www.carmax.com. Television and radio broadcast advertisements are designed to build consumer awareness of the CarMax
name, carmax.com, and key components of the CarMax offer. Newspaper advertisements promote CarMax’s broad selection of vehicles and price competitiveness, targeting consumers with immediate purchase intentions. Both broadcast and newspaper
advertisements are designed to drive customers to its stores and to the CarMax website.

The company’s website, carmax.com, is a marketing tool for communicating the CarMax consumer offer in detail, a sophisticated search engine for finding the right vehicle, and a sales channel for customers who prefer to complete a part
of the shopping and sales process online. The CarMax website offers complete inventory and pricing search capabilities. Information on the more than 20,000 cars available in the CarMax nationwide inventory is updated daily. Carmax.com includes
detailed information, such as pictures of each vehicle, prices, features, specifications, and store locations, as well as sorting and comparison features that allow consumers to easily compare vehicles. The site also includes features such as
detailed vehicle reviews, payment calculators, and an option to estimate trade-in values via a link with Kelley Blue Book. CarMax believes these features make it easier for consumers to meet all of their auto research needs on carmax.com. Customers
can contact sales consultants online via carmax.com, by telephone, or by fax. Customers can work with these sales consultants from the comfort of home, including applying for financing, and need to visit the store only to sign the paperwork and pick
up their vehicle.



Suppliers for Used Vehicles.

CarMax acquires its used vehicle inventory directly from customers through its unique
appraisal process and through other sources, including local and regional auctions, wholesalers, franchised and independent dealers, and fleet owners, such as leasing companies and rental companies. The CarMax appraisal offer process enables the
company to access the private market as its largest source for used vehicle inventory. Many vehicles purchased directly from consumers are among the highest quality used vehicles available in the market because they have been well maintained by
their owners. In stores open for more than one year, CarMax generally acquires a larger portion of its used vehicle inventory directly from customers than from any other source. This buying strategy also helps provide an inventory of makes and
models that reflects the tastes of the market.

CarMax has replaced the
traditional “trade-in” transaction with a process in which CarMax-trained buyers appraise most vehicles and provide the vehicle’s owner with a written, guaranteed cash offer that is good for 7 days or 300 miles, whichever is first. An
appraisal is available to every customer free of charge, whether or not the individual purchases a vehicle from CarMax. Because CarMax’s operating strategy is to build customer confidence and satisfaction by offering only high quality vehicles,
fewer than half of the vehicles acquired through the appraisal process meet the company’s retail standards. Those vehicles that do not meet the retail standards are sold at the company’s in-store auctions.

CarMax buyers evaluate all used vehicles on the basis of their estimated wholesale value and
reconditioning costs, and, for off-site purchases, cost of delivery to the store where they will be reconditioned. The inventory purchasing function is primarily performed at the store level and is the responsibility of the buyers. To decide which
inventory to purchase at off-site auctions, CarMax’s buyers, in collaboration with its headquarters staff, rely on the extensive inventory and sales trend data available through the CarMax information system. The company’s inventory and
pricing models help the buyers to tailor to the buying preferences at each superstore, recommend pricing adjustments, and optimize inventory turns to help maintain gross margin dollars per unit.

Based on consumer acceptance of the appraisal process at existing CarMax stores and
CarMax’s experience and success to date in acquiring vehicles from auctions and other sources, CarMax believes that its sources of used vehicles will continue to be sufficient to meet current needs and to support planned expansion.

Suppliers for New Vehicles.

CarMax operates seven new car franchises under separate
agreements with manufacturers. New car operations are governed by the terms of the sales and service agreements with DaimlerChrysler, General Motors, Nissan, and Toyota. These agreements generally impose operating requirements and restrictions,
including inventory levels, working capital, monthly financial reporting, signage, and cooperation with marketing strategies. A manufacturer may terminate a dealer agreement under certain circumstances, including a change in ownership without prior
manufacturer approval, failure to maintain adequate customer satisfaction ratings, or a material breach of other provisions of the agreement. CarMax also has entered into framework agreements with several major vehicle manufacturers. These
agreements generally contain provisions relating to the acquisition, ownership structure, advertising, and management of a dealership franchised by those manufacturers.

Seasonality.

CarMax’s business is seasonal. Most CarMax superstores experience their strongest traffic and sales in the spring
and summer fiscal quarters. Sales and gross margins are typically lowest in the fall quarter, which coincides with the new vehicle model-year-changeover period. In the fall quarter, the new model year introductions and discounting on model year
closeouts can cause rapid depreciation in used car pricing, particularly for late-model used cars. Seasonal patterns for car buying and selling may vary in different parts of the country, and as CarMax expands geographically, these differences could
have an effect on the overall seasonal pattern of the company’s results. In addition, the growth in sales to subprime customers, whose buying activity tends to peak early in the tax refund season, could modestly affect the seasonality.

Products and Services

Merchandising.

CarMax offers its customers a broad selection of makes and models of
used vehicles, including both domestic and imported vehicles, at competitive prices. CarMax’s used car selection covers popular brands from manufacturers such as DaimlerChrysler, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, and Toyota and
luxury brands such as BMW and Lexus. The company’s primary focus is vehicles that are 1 to 6 years old, have fewer than 60,000 miles, and generally range in price from $10,000 to $31,000. Each vehicle must pass a comprehensive quality
inspection that covers all major and minor mechanical systems and all safety functions as well as cosmetic criteria. For the more cost-conscious consumer, the company also offers used cars, branded “ValuMax,” that are more than 6 years old
or have 60,000 miles or more and that generally range in price from $7,000 to $21,000. These older vehicles must pass a quality inspection covering the major mechanical systems and all safety functions.



CarMax has implemented an everyday low-price strategy under which it sets “no-haggle” prices on both its used
and new vehicles. The company believes that its pricing is competitive with the best negotiated prices in the market. Prices on all vehicles are clearly displayed on each vehicle’s information sticker, on carmax.com, and in CarMax’s
newspaper advertising. CarMax extends its no-haggle philosophy to every component of the vehicle transaction, including trade-ins, financing rates, accessories, extended service plan pricing, and vehicle documentation fees. In addition to selling
new vehicles using the low, “no-haggle” price strategy, the franchise and dealer agreements generally allow CarMax to sell manufacturers’ brands, perform warranty work on these vehicles, and sell related parts and services within a
specified market area. Designation of specified market areas generally does not guarantee exclusivity within a specified territory.

An integral part of CarMax’s used car consumer offer is the reconditioning process. This process includes a comprehensive, certified quality inspection of the
engine, cooling and fuel systems, drive axle, transmission, electronic systems, suspension, brake system, steering, air conditioning, interior, and optional equipment. Based on this quality inspection, CarMax determines the reconditioning necessary
to bring the vehicle up to CarMax’s high quality standards. Vehicle inspections are completed by CarMax’s mechanics. CarMax performs most routine mechanical and minor body repairs in-house; however, for some reconditioning services, CarMax
engages third parties specializing in those services. Over the past several years, CarMax has performed an increasing percentage of reconditioning services in-house, and, based on the cost savings realized, that trend is expected to continue.

Service.

All CarMax used car locations provide vehicle repair service,
including used car extended service plan repairs. Factory-authorized service is also provided at all new car franchises. CarMax has developed systems and procedures that are intended to ensure that its retail repair service operations are conducted
in the same customer-friendly and efficient manner as its other operations.

CarMax believes that the efficiency of its service and reconditioning operations is enhanced by its modern facilities, a technician mentoring process, and its compensation programs. The mentoring process and compensation programs are
designed to increase the productivity of service technicians and result in reduced costs and higher-quality repairs. The experienced technicians in each store perform the more complicated repairs with assistance from apprentices, who also perform
less complex functions on their own. Each technician receives a flat rate for each repair or service performed. CarMax is able to track the productivity of each technician through the company’s information system.

Customer Credit.

CarMax provides prime-rated financing to qualified customers through
the company’s own finance operation, CarMax Auto Finance, and through Bank of America. Offering customers a third-party alternative for prime loans enhances the CarMax consumer offer and helps to ensure that CAF remains competitive. In
addition, DaimlerChrysler Services, General Motors Acceptance, Nissan Motors Acceptance, and Toyota Financial Services offer prime financing to qualified customers purchasing new vehicles at applicable CarMax locations. Nonprime financing is offered
by TransSouth Financial, Wells Fargo Financial Acceptance, and AmeriCredit Financial Services. Subprime financing is offered by DRIVE Financial Services. CarMax has tested and will continue to test other third-party finance companies in order to
expand the choices for its customers and increase discrete approvals.

Customers provide credit information that is electronically submitted by sales consultants through CarMax’s proprietary information system, first to CAF and Bank of America, and then, as necessary, to our nonprime and subprime lenders.
Responses from the lenders are received quickly, generally in less than five minutes from prime lenders. The vehicle financings, or loans, are retail installment contracts secured by the vehicles financed. CarMax has no recourse liability on retail
installment contracts arranged with third-party finance companies. Customers are permitted to refinance or pay off their loans within three business days of a purchase without incurring any finance or related charges. CarMax’s arrangements with
its third-party finance companies, excluding DRIVE, provide for payment of a fee to CarMax at the time of financing, provided the loan is not paid in full within 90 days. As is customary in the subprime finance industry, DRIVE purchases the loan
contracts at a discount.

Extended Service Plan Sales.

At the time
CarMax sells a vehicle, it offers the customer an extended service plan. Currently, in all the states in which CarMax operates, it sells these plans on behalf of unrelated third parties that are the primary obligors. Under these third-party service
plan programs, CarMax has no contractual liability to the customer. The extended service plans have terms of coverage from 12 to 72 months. CarMax offers these extended service plans at low, fixed prices. All extended service plans sold by CarMax
(other than manufacturers’ warranties) have been designed to CarMax specifications and are administered by third parties, through private-label arrangements under which CarMax receives a commission from the administrator at the time the
extended service plan is sold.

All CarMax locations provide vehicle repair
service including extended service plan repairs. CarMax’s extended service plan customers also have access to the third-party administrators’ nationwide network of approximately 14,000 independent service providers. CarMax believes that
the quality of the services provided by this provider network, as well as the broad scope of its extended service plans, helps promote customer satisfaction and loyalty, and thus increases the likelihood of repeat and referral business.



Systems

CarMax’s stores are supported by an advanced information system that improves the customer experience while providing tightly integrated automation of all operating
functions. Customers can select a range of vehicles using information kiosks that display their choices and provide a map showing customers where their selections are located on the display lot. CarMax’s inventory management system tracks every
retail vehicle through its CarMax life from purchase through reconditioning and test drives to ultimate sale. Bar codes are placed on each vehicle and on each on-site parking place. Daily scanning of bar codes tracks the movement of vehicles on the
lot. An electronic gate on the lot and a radio frequency transmitter on each vehicle helps track vehicle test-drives and sales consultants. Online financing and computer-assisted document preparation ensures rapid completion of the sales
transaction. Behind the scenes, CarMax’s proprietary store technology provides its management with real-time information about every aspect of store operations, such as inventory management, pricing, vehicle transfers, wholesale auctions, and
sales consultant productivity.

Advanced information systems, which are a key
to CarMax’s successful inventory management, provide CarMax stores with the ability to anticipate future inventory needs and manage pricing. Through this centralized system, CarMax is able to immediately integrate new stores into its store
network, allowing the new stores to rapidly achieve operating efficiency. CarMax continues to enhance and refine its information systems, which it believes to be a core competitive advantage.

In addition to inventory management, the company developed the Electronic Repair Order system
(“ERO”), which is used by the service department. This system drives the sequencing of reconditioning procedures. ERO has reduced cycle time, and it provides information that will help increase quality and reduce costs, which further
enhance our customer service and profitability.

Associates

On March 31, 2005, CarMax had 8,522 hourly and salaried associates and 2,653 sales
associates who worked on a commission basis. Additional CarMax associates are employed during peak selling seasons. No CarMax employee is subject to a collective bargaining agreement. At March 31, 2005, CarMax’s 62 location general managers
averaged 6 years of CarMax experience and more than 11 years of prior management experience.

Training.

CarMax places special emphasis on attracting, developing, and retaining qualified associates and believes that its favorable working conditions and compensation programs allow it to attract and retain
highly qualified individuals in each market the company enters. The company accomplishes this partly through its commitment to provide exceptional training to its associates. Store associates receive structured, self-paced training programs that
introduce them to company policies and their specific job responsibilities through an intranet-based testing and tracking system. Most new store associates are assigned mentors who provide on-the-job guidance and support. The company uses a system
of off-the-shelf products in conjunction with a learning management system to author, deliver, and track training events, and to measure learner competency before and after training. The company also provides comprehensive, facilitated classroom
training courses to sales consultants, buyers, automotive technicians, and managers. All sales consultants receive extensive customer service training both initially and on an ongoing basis. Buyers-in-training (“BIT”) undergo a 6– to
18–month apprenticeship under the direction of experienced buyers and each BIT appraises more than one thousand cars before making his or her first independent purchase. The company also has implemented an apprentice training program in an
effort to provide a stable future supply of qualified technicians. All technicians attend in-house training programs designed to develop their skills in performing routine repair services on the diverse makes and models of vehicles CarMax sells.
Technicians at our new car franchises also attend manufacturer-sponsored training programs to stay abreast of current diagnostic, repair, and maintenance techniques for those manufacturers’ vehicles. The management training program includes
rotations through each functional area. To the greatest extent possible, CarMax opens new stores with an experienced management team drawn from existing stores.

Governmental and Environmental Regulations

CarMax is subject to a wide range of federal, state, and local laws and regulations. These laws regulate, among other things, the manner in which CarMax conducts
business, including advertising, sales, consumer lending practices, local licensing requirements, consumer protection laws, and relationships between automotive dealerships and vehicle manufacturers. State and federal regulatory agencies, such as
departments of motor vehicles, OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration), the EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission), and the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency), have jurisdiction over the operation of the CarMax stores.
CarMax’s business also involves the use, handling, and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances, including motor oil, gasoline, transmission fluid, solvents, lubricants, and other materials. CarMax is subject to



compliance with governmental and environmental regulations concerning the past and current operation and/or removal of aboveground and underground storage
tanks containing these substances. CarMax believes that it does not have any material governmental or environmental liabilities and that compliance with such laws and regulations will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse
effect on its results of operations or financial condition.

Item 2. Properties

Store Formats

CarMax conducts its used vehicle operations in three basic retail formats
– mega, standard, and satellite superstores. However, the company’s current growth plan calls for only the construction of standard superstores and satellite superstores. Standard superstores are approximately 40,000 to 60,000 square feet
on 10 to 25 acres. Satellite superstores are approximately 10,000 to 20,000 square feet on 4 to 7 acres. Mega superstores are approximately 70,000 to 95,000 square feet on 20 to 35 acres.

As of March 31, 2005, CarMax’s operations were conducted in 63 retail stores. The
following table summarizes the company’s retail stores by format and location as of March 31, 2005:

(1)

The company currently operates seven new car franchises. Three franchises are integrated within used car superstores, and they do not operate as separate stores. The
remaining four franchises are operated from three new car stores that are co-located with used car superstores.

CarMax has financed the majority of its stores through sale-leaseback transactions, which have typically been executed within 6 to 12 months of the store opening date. As
of March 31, 2005, the company leased 55 of its 63 retail stores and owned the remaining 8 stores. The company also owns land associated with future year store openings. CarMax owns land for its future corporate office building near Richmond, Va.,
which is under construction and scheduled to open during the third quarter of fiscal 2006. CarMax leases its current corporate offices, which are located near the site of the first CarMax retail store in Richmond.

CarMax operates 23 of its retail locations pursuant to various leases under which its former
parent Circuit City was the original tenant and primary obligor. Circuit City had originally entered into these leases so that CarMax could take advantage of the favorable economic terms available at that time to Circuit City as a large retailer.
Circuit City has assigned each of these leases to CarMax. Despite the assignment and pursuant to the terms of the leases, Circuit City remains contingently liable under the leases. In recognition of this ongoing contingent liability, CarMax made a
one-time special dividend payment of $28.4 million to Circuit City on the October 1, 2002, separation date.

Expansion

CarMax has established a strong foundation for future growth based upon its unique knowledge of the used car market, its established presence in key locations, and its ability to execute its business plan in a market
subject to continuous change.



CarMax continues to refine its operating strategies and has grown to be the nation’s largest retailer of used cars. CarMax believes that it is well
positioned to succeed in the highly competitive automotive retail industry. Specifically, CarMax has enhanced its ability to identify profitable markets, determine the appropriate store formats to fit those markets, and effectively manage pricing
and inventory mix.

During the next three fiscal years, the company plans to
open superstores at an annual rate of approximately 15% to 20% of its used car superstore base. CarMax plans to open nine superstores in fiscal 2006, including five standard-sized stores and four satellite stores. The company will enter four new
mid-sized markets in fiscal 2006, including Jacksonville, Fla.; Salt Lake City, Utah; Virginia Beach, Va.; and Wichita, Kans. Satellite superstore additions are planned for Independence (Kansas City market), Mo.; Miami Lakes (Miami market), Fla.;
and Nashville, Tenn. CarMax also added both a standard superstore and a satellite superstore in the Los Angeles market in March 2005.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

In the normal course of
business, CarMax is involved in various legal proceedings. Based upon the company’s evaluation of information currently available, it believes that the ultimate resolution of any such proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on
CarMax’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

No matter was submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended February 28, 2005.
