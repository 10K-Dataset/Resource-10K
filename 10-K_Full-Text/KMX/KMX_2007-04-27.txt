BUSINESS
      OVERVIEW

CarMax
      Background.

CarMax,
      Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1996.
      CarMax, Inc. is a holding company and our operations are conducted through
      our
      subsidiaries. Our home office is located at 12800 Tuckahoe Creek Parkway,
      Richmond, Va.

Under
      the
      ownership of Circuit City Stores, Inc. (“Circuit City”), we began operations in
      1993 with the opening of our first CarMax superstore in Richmond, Va.

In
      1997,
      Circuit City completed the initial public offering of a tracking stock, Circuit
      City Stores, Inc.-CarMax Group common stock, which was intended to track
      separately the performance of the CarMax operations. On October 1, 2002, the
      CarMax business was separated from Circuit City through a tax-free transaction,
      becoming an independent, separately traded public company.

CarMax
      Business.

We are
      the nation’s largest retailer of used cars, based on the 337,021 used vehicles
      we retailed during the fiscal year ended February 28, 2007. As of the end of
      fiscal 2007, we operated 77 used car superstores in 36 metropolitan markets.
      In
      addition, we sold 208,959 wholesale vehicles in fiscal 2007 through our on-site
      auctions.

We
      were
      the first used vehicle retailer to offer a large selection of high quality
      used
      vehicles at competitively low, fixed prices using a customer-friendly sales
      process in an attractive, modern sales facility. The CarMax consumer offer
      provides our customers the opportunity to shop for vehicles the same way they
      shop for items at other “big-box” retailers, and it is structured around four
      core equities: low, no-haggle prices; a broad selection; high quality; and
      customer-friendly service. Our strategy is to better serve the auto retailing
      market by addressing the major sources of customer dissatisfaction with
      traditional auto retailers and to maximize operating efficiencies through the
      use of standardized operating procedures and store formats enhanced by
      sophisticated, proprietary management information systems.

Table
            of Contents


We
      purchase, recondition, and sell used vehicles. All of the used vehicles we
      retail are thoroughly reconditioned to meet high mechanical, electrical, safety,
      and cosmetic standards, and each vehicle must pass a comprehensive inspection
      before being offered for sale. Approximately 85% of the used vehicles we retail
      are one to six years old with fewer than 60,000 miles. We also offer a selection
      of used vehicles at each superstore that are more than six years old or have
      more than 60,000 miles, but which meet similar quality standards.

We
      also

sell new
      vehicles at seven locations under franchise agreements with four new car
      manufacturers. In fiscal 2007, new vehicles comprised 5% of our total retail
      vehicle unit sales. As planned, new car sales have become a smaller part of
      our
      business mix over the past several fiscal years as we have divested 14 new
      car
      franchises while aggressively growing our used car business. We may divest
      additional new car franchises in the future.

We
      provide our customers with a full range of related products and services,
      including the financing of vehicle purchases through CarMax Auto Finance
      (“CAF”), our own finance operation, and third-party lenders; the sale of
      extended service plans and accessories; the appraisal and purchase of vehicles
      directly from consumers; and vehicle repair service.

The
      CarMax consumer offer enables customers to evaluate separately each component
      of
      the sales process and to make informed decisions based on comprehensive
      information about the options, terms, and associated prices of each component.
      The

customer
      can accept or decline any individual element of the offer without affecting
      the
      price or terms of any other component of the offer

.
      Our
“no-haggle” pricing and our commission structure, which is based on a fixed
      dollars-per-unit standard, allow our sales consultants to focus solely on
      meeting customer needs.

We
      have
      separated the practice of trading in a used vehicle in conjunction with the
      purchase of another vehicle into two distinct and independent transactions.

We
      will
      appraise a consumer’s vehicle and make an offer to buy that vehicle regardless
      of whether the owner is purchasing a vehicle from us. We acquire the majority
      of
      our retail used vehicle inventory through this unique in-store appraisal
      process. We also acquire a significant portion of our used vehicle inventory
      through wholesale auctions and, to a lesser extent, directly from other sources,
      including wholesalers, dealers, and fleet owners. Those vehicles purchased
      through our in-store appraisal process that do not meet our retail standards
      are
      sold at on-site wholesale auctions.

Our
      inventory management and pricing system tracks each vehicle throughout the
      sales
      process. Using the information provided by this system, and applying
      sophisticated statistical modeling techniques, we are able to optimize our
      inventory mix, anticipate future inventory needs at each store, evaluate sales
      consultant and buyer performance, and refine our vehicle pricing strategy.
      Because of the pricing discipline afforded by the inventory management and
      pricing system, more than 99% of the entire used car inventory offered at retail
      is sold at retail.

Industry
      and Competition.

With
      calendar year 2006 sales of approximately $340 billion, used vehicles comprise
      nearly half of the U.S. auto retail market, the largest retail segment of the
      economy. In calendar 2006, there were an estimated 42.6 million used vehicles
      sold in the U.S. compared with approximately 16.6 million new vehicles. Our
      primary focus, late-model vehicles that are 1 to 6 years old, are estimated
      at
      approximately $290 billion in annual sales and 20 million units per
      year.

The
      U.S.
      used car marketplace is highly fragmented and competitive and includes
      approximately 21,800 franchised new car dealers and 44,000 independent dealers,
      as well as millions of private individuals. Our primary competitors are the
      franchised new car dealers, who sell the majority of late-model used vehicles.
      Independent dealers predominantly sell older, higher mileage cars than we do.
      In
      both the used and new vehicle markets, we seek to distinguish ourselves from
      traditional dealerships through our consumer offer, sales approach, and other
      innovative operating strategies.

We
      believe that our principal competitive factors in used vehicle retailing

are
      our
      ability to provide a high degree of customer satisfaction with the car-buying
      experience; our competitively low prices; our breadth of selection of the most
      popular makes and models available both on site and via our website, carmax.com;
      the quality of our vehicles; our proprietary information systems; and the
      location of our retail stores.

Upon
      request by a customer, we will transfer virtually any used vehicle in our
      nationwide inventory to a local superstore. Transfers are free within a market;
      longer distance transfers include a charge to cover transportation costs. In
      fiscal 2007, more than 20% of our vehicles sold were transferred at customer
      request.

Our
      Certified Quality Inspection assures that every vehicle

we offer
      for sale meets stringent mechanical, electrical, and safety standards. We back
      every vehicle with a 5-day, money-back guarantee, and at least a 30-day limited
      warranty. Other competitive factors include our ability to offer

Table
            of Contents


or
      arrange customer financing on competitive terms and the comprehensiveness and
      cost of the extended service plans we offer. We believe that we are competitive
      in all of these areas and that we enjoy advantages over competitors that employ
      traditional high-pressure, negotiation-oriented sales techniques.

Our
      sales
      consultants play a significant role in ensuring a customer-friendly sales
      process. A sales consultant is paid a commission based on a fixed
      dollars-per-unit

standard,
      thereby earning the same dollar sales commission regardless of the price or
      gross margin on the vehicle being sold. The sales consultant receives no
      commission on the finance process. This en

sures
      that the sales consultant’s primary objective is helping customers find the
      right vehicles for their needs at prices they can afford. In contrast, sales
      and
      finance personnel at traditional dealerships often receive higher commissions
      for negotiating higher prices and for steering customers toward vehicles with
      higher gross margins.

In
      the
      new vehicle market, we compete with other franchised dealers offering vehicles
      produced by the same or other manufacturers. Historically, the new vehicle
      market has been served primarily by dealerships employing traditional automotive
      selling methods. We believe our customer-friendly, low-pressure sales methods
      are points of competitive differentiation.

Marketing
      and Advertising.

Our
      marketing strategies are focused on developing awareness of the advantages
      of
      shopping at our stores and on attracting customers who are already considering
      buying or selling a vehicle. We use market awareness and customer satisfaction
      surveys to help tailor our marketing efforts to the purchasing habits and
      preferences of customers in each market area. Our marketing strategies are
      implemented primarily through television and radio broadcasts, carmax.com,
      the
      Internet, and newspaper advertising. Television and radio broadcast
      advertisements are designed to build consumer awareness of the CarMax name,
      carmax.com, and key components of the CarMax offer. Newspaper advertisements
      promote our broad selection of vehicles and price competitiveness, targeting
      consumers with immediate purchase intentions. Broadcast, Internet, and newspaper
      advertisements are designed to drive customers to our stores and to
      carmax.com.

The
      media
      landscape is changing rapidly and we are changing our marketing programs in
      response. We are customizing our marketing program based on awareness levels
      in
      each market. In selected markets, we have expanded our use of Internet-based
      advertising while curtailing our use of newspaper advertising. We are building
      awareness and driving traffic to our stores and carmax.com by listing every
      retail vehicle on both AutoTrader.com and cars.com. Through their syndicated
      networks, AutoTrader.com and cars.com vehicle listings appear on sites that
      we
      believe are visited by a majority of late model used vehicle buyers who use
      the
      Internet in their shopping process. Our advertising on the Internet also
      includes banner and key-word advertisements on search engines, such as Google
      and Yahoo!

Our
      website, carmax.com, is a marketing tool for communicating the CarMax consumer
      offer in detail, a sophisticated search engine for finding the right vehicle,
      and a sales channel for customers who prefer to complete a part of the shopping
      and sales process online. The website offers complete inventory and pricing
      search capabilities. Information on the more than 25,000 cars available in
      our
      nationwide inventory is updated daily. Carmax.com includes detailed information,
      such as vehicle photos, prices, features, specifications, and store locations,
      as well as sorting and comparison features that allow consumers to easily
      compare vehicles. The site also includes features such as detailed vehicle
      reviews, payment calculators, and an option to estimate trade-in values via
      a
      link with Kelley Blue Book. Customers can contact sales consultants online
      via
      carmax.com, by telephone, or by fax. Customers can work with these sales
      consultants from the comfort of home, including applying for financing, and
      need
      to visit the store only to sign the paperwork and pick up their
      vehicle.

Suppliers
      for Used Vehicles.

We
      acquire our used vehicle inventory directly from consumers through our unique
      in-store appraisal process and through other sources, including local and
      regional auctions, wholesalers, franchised and independent dealers, and fleet
      owners, such as leasing companies and rental companies. In calendar 2006,
      approximately 22 million used vehicles were remarketed in the U.S., of which
      nearly 10 million were sold at wholesale auction.

The
      majority of our used vehicle inventory is acquired directly from consumers
      through our appraisal process. The most popular makes and models are more
      readily available directly from consumers than from other sources. This buying
      strategy also helps provide an inventory of makes and models that reflects
      the
      tastes of each market. In May 2006, we began testing a stand-alone car buying
      center in the Atlanta market. Our goal for the car buying center is

Table
            of Contents


to
      increase appraisal traffic and generate incremental vehicle purchases from
      individual consumers. We plan to expand this test by opening three additional
      car buying centers in fiscal 2008.

We
      have
      replaced the traditional “trade-in” transaction with a process in which a
      CarMax-trained buyer appraises the vehicle and provides the vehicle’s owner with
      a written, guaranteed offer that is good for 7 days.

An
      appraisal is available to every customer free of charge, whether or not the
      individual purchases a vehicle from us. Based on their age, mileage, or
      condition, fewer than half of the vehicles acquired through this in-store
      appraisal process meet our high quality retail standards. Those vehicles that
      do
      not meet our retail standards are sold at our on-site wholesale
      auctions.

The
      inventory purchasing function is primarily performed at the store level and
      is
      the responsibility of the buyers, who handle both on-site appraisals and
      off-site auction purchases. Our buyers evaluate all used vehicles on the basis
      of their estimated wholesale value and reconditioning costs, and, for off-site
      purchases, cost of delivery to the store where they will be reconditioned.
      To
      decide which inventory to purchase at off-site auctions, our buyers, in
      collaboration with our home office staff, rely on the extensive inventory and
      sales trend data available through the CarMax information system. Our inventory
      and pricing models help the buyers tailor inventories to the buying preferences
      at each superstore, recommend pricing adjustments, and optimize inventory
      turnover to help maintain gross margin dollars per unit.

Based
      on
      consumer acceptance of the in-store appraisal process at existing CarMax stores,
      our experience and success to date in acquiring vehicles from auctions and
      other
      sources, and the large size of the U.S. auction market relative to our needs,
      we
      believe that our sources of used vehicles will continue to be sufficient to
      meet
      current needs and to support planned expansion.

Suppliers
      for New Vehicles.

Our new
      car operations are governed by the terms of the sales, service, and dealer
      agreements with DaimlerChrysler, General Motors, Nissan, and Toyota. Among
      other
      things, these agreements generally impose operating requirements and
      restrictions, including inventory levels, working capital, monthly financial
      reporting, signage, and cooperation with marketing strategies. A manufacturer
      may terminate a dealer agreement under certain circumstances, including a change
      in ownership without prior manufacturer approval, failure to maintain adequate
      customer satisfaction ratings, or a material breach of other provisions of
      the
      agreement. In addition to selling new vehicles using our low, no-haggle price
      strategy, the franchise and dealer agreements generally allow us to perform
      warranty work on these vehicles and sell related parts and services within
      a
      specified market area. Designation of specified market areas generally does
      not
      guarantee exclusivity within a specified territory.

Seasonality.

Our
      business is seasonal. Most of our superstores experience their strongest traffic
      and sales in the spring and summer quarters. Sales are typically lowest in
      the
      fall quarter, which coincides with the new vehicle model-year-changeover period.
      In the fall, the new model year introductions and discounts on model year
      closeouts generally can cause rapid depreciation in used car pricing,
      particularly for late-model used cars. Customer traffic also tends to slow
      in
      the fall as the weather gets colder and as customers shift their spending
      priorities toward holiday-related expenditures. Seasonal patterns for car buying
      and selling may vary in different parts of the country and, as we expand
      geographically, these differences could have an effect on the overall seasonal
      pattern of our results.

Products
      and Services

Merchandising.

We offer
      our customers a broad selection of makes and models of used vehicles, including
      both domestic and imported vehicles, at competitive prices. Our used car
      selection covers popular brands from manufacturers such as DaimlerChrysler,
      Ford, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru, Toyota,
      and Volkswagen and luxury brands such as Acura, BMW, Infiniti, Lexus, and
      Mercedes. Our primary focus is vehicles that are 1 to 6 years old, have fewer
      than 60,000 miles, and generally range in price from $11,500 to $30,000. For
      the
      more cost-conscious consumer, we also offer used cars that are more than 6
      years
      old or have 60,000 miles or more and that generally range in price from $8,000
      to $22,000.

We
      have
      implemented an everyday low-price strategy under which we set no-haggle prices
      on both our used and new vehicles. We believe that our pricing is competitive
      with the best-negotiated prices in the market. Prices on all vehicles are
      clearly displayed on each vehicle’s information sticker; on carmax.com,
      AutoTrader.com, and cars.com; and, where applicable, in our newspaper
      advertising. We extend our no-haggle philosophy to every component of

      financing rates, accessories, extended service plan pricing, and vehicle
      documentation fees.

Reconditioning
      and Service.

An
      integral part of our used car consumer offer is the reconditioning process.
      This
      process includes a comprehensive, Certified Quality Inspection of the engine
      and
      all major systems, including cooling, fuel, drivetrain, transmission,
      electronics, suspension, brakes, steering, air conditioning, and other
      equipment, as well as the interior and exterior of the vehicle. Based on this
      quality inspection, we determine the reconditioning necessary to bring the
      vehicle up to our high quality standards. Our service technicians complete
      vehicle inspections.

We
      perform most routine mechanical and minor body repairs in-house; however, for
      some reconditioning services, we engage third parties specializing in those
      services. Over the past several years, we have performed an increasing
      percentage of reconditioning services in-house, and, based on the cost savings
      realized, we expect this trend to continue. Satellite superstores depend upon
      nearby mega or standard superstores for reconditioning, which increases
      efficiency and reduces overhead.

All
      CarMax used car locations provide vehicle repair service including repairs
      of
      vehicles covered by our extended service plans. We also provide
      factory-authorized service at all new car franchises. We have developed systems
      and procedures that are intended to ensure that our retail repair service is
      conducted in the same customer-friendly and efficient manner as our other
      operations.

We
      believe that the efficiency of our reconditioning and service operations is
      enhanced by our modern facilities, a technician mentoring process, and our
      information systems. The mentoring process and compensation programs are
      designed to increase the productivity of technicians,  identify
      opportunities for cost reduction, and achieve high-quality repairs. Our
      information systems provide the ability to track repair history and enable
      trend
      analysis, which serves as guidance for our continuous improvement
      efforts.

Wholesale
      Auctions.

Vehicles
      purchased through our in-store appraisal process that do not meet our retail
      standards are sold at on-site wholesale auctions. At February 28, 2007,
      wholesale auctions were conducted at 46 of our 77 superstores. Auctions are
      generally not held at satellite superstores. Auctions are held on a weekly,
      bi-weekly, or monthly basis. Auction frequency at a given superstore is
      determined by the number of vehicles to be auctioned, which depends on the
      number of stores and the market awareness of the company and our in-store
      appraisal offer in that market. The typical wholesale vehicle is approximately
      10 years old and has more than 100,000 miles. Participation in our wholesale
      auctions is restricted to licensed automobile dealers, the majority of whom are
      independent dealers. To participate in a CarMax auction, dealers must register
      with our centralized auction support group, at which time we determine the
      purchase limit available to each dealer. We make conditional announcements
      on
      each vehicle, including those for vehicles with major mechanical issues,
      possible frame or flood damage, branded titles, salvage history, and unknown
      true mileage. Professional, licensed auctioneers conduct our auctions. These
      policies result in an auction sales rate that is generally between 95% and
      100%.
      Dealers pay a fee to the company based on the sales price of the vehicles they
      purchase.

Customer
      Credit.

We offer
      our customers a wide range of financing alternatives, which we believe enhances
      the CarMax consumer offer. Before the effect of 3-day payoffs and vehicle
      returns, CAF financed more than 40% of our used vehicle unit sales in fiscal
      2007. Customer credit applications are initially reviewed by CAF, and may also
      be reviewed by Bank of America. Customers who are not approved by either CAF
      or
      Bank of America are evaluated by our core, second-tier finance partners,
      including AmeriCredit Financial Services, Capital One Auto Finance,
      CitiFinancial Auto, and Wells Fargo Auto Finance. Customers who are not approved
      by any of these finance partners are evaluated by our third-tier lenders, which
      include Triad Financial and Drive Financial Services ("Drive"). Having a
      wide array of lenders not only expands the choices for our customers, but also
      increases discrete approvals. To this end, we have tested and will continue
      to
      test other third-party finance companies.

Customers
          applying for financing provide credit information that is electronically
          submitted by sales consultants through

our
          proprietary information system.

Responses
          from CAF and Bank of America are generally received in less than five minutes.
          The vehicle financings, or loans, are retail installment contracts secured
          by
          the vehicles financed. We have no recourse liability on retail installment
          contracts arranged with third-party finance companies. Customers are permitted
          to refinance or pay off their loans within three business days of a purchase
          without incurring any finance or related charges. Our arrangements with
          our
          primary and second-tier, third-party finance companies generally provide
          for
          payment of a fee to CarMax at the time of financing, provided the loan
          is not
          paid in full within 90 days. Drive purchases customer loans at a
          discount.

            of Contents


Extended
      Service Plan Sales.

At the
      time of the sale, we offer the customer an extended service plan. We sell these
      plans on behalf of unrelated third parties that are the primary obligors. Under
      the third-party service plan programs, we have no contractual liability to
      the
      customer. The extended service plans have terms of coverage from 12 to 72
      months, depending on the vehicle age and make. We offer these extended service
      plans at low, fixed prices, which are based primarily on the repair record
      of
      the vehicle and the length of coverage selected. All extended service plans
      that
      we sell (other than manufacturers’ warranties) have been designed to our
      specifications and are administered by the third parties through private-label
      arrangements under which we receive a commission from the administrator at
      the
      time the extended service plan is sold. In fiscal 2007, more than half of the
      customers purchasing a used vehicle from CarMax also purchased an extended
      service plan.

Our
      extended service plan customers have access to our vehicle repair service at
      each CarMax store and to the third-party administrators’ nationwide network of
      approximately 14,000 independent service providers. We believe that the quality
      of the services provided by this network, as well as the broad scope of our
      extended service plans, helps promote customer satisfaction and loyalty, and
      thus increases the likelihood of repeat and referral business.

Systems

Our
      stores are supported by an advanced information system that improves the
      customer experience while providing tightly integrated automation of all
      operating functions. Using in-store information kiosks, customers can search
      each store’s vehicle inventory and print a detailed listing for any vehicle,
      which includes the vehicle’s features and specifications, and a map showing its
      specific location on the display lot. Our inventory management system tracks
      every vehicle through its life from purchase through reconditioning and
      test-drives to ultimate sale. Bar codes are placed on each vehicle and on each
      parking space on the display lot, and all vehicle bar codes are scanned daily
      as
      a loss prevention measure. Test drive information is captured on every vehicle
      using radio frequency identification devices, linking the specific vehicle
      and
      the sales consultant. We also capture data on vehicles we wholesale, which
      helps
      us track market pricing. An online finance application process and
      computer-assisted document preparation ensure rapid completion of the sales
      transaction. Behind the scenes, our proprietary store technology provides our
      management with real-time information about every aspect of store operations,
      such as inventory management, pricing, vehicle transfers, wholesale auctions,
      and sales consultant productivity.

Our
      inventory management and pricing system allows us to buy the mix of makes,
      models, age, mileage, and price points tailored to customer buying preferences
      at each superstore. This system also generates recommended retail price
      markdowns for specific vehicles based on complex algorithms that take into
      account factors including sales history, consumer interest, and seasonal
      patterns. We believe this systematic approach to vehicle pricing allows us
      to
      optimize inventory turns, which minimizes the depreciation risk inherent in
      used
      cars and helps us to achieve our targeted gross profit dollars per
      unit.

In
      addition to inventory management, our Electronic Repair Order system (“ERO”) is
      used by the service department to sequence reconditioning procedures. ERO
      provides information that helps increase quality and reduce costs, which further
      enhances our customer service and profitability.

Through
      our centralized systems, we are able to immediately integrate new stores into
      our store network, allowing the new stores to rapidly achieve operating
      efficiency. We continue to enhance and refine our information systems, which
      we
      believe to be a core competitive advantage. The design of our information
      systems incorporates off-site backups, redundant processing, and other measures
      to reduce the risk of significant data loss in the event of an emergency or
      disaster.

Associates

On
      February 28, 2007, we had a total of 13,736 employees, including 10,394 hourly
      and salaried associates and 3,342 sales associates, who worked on a commission
      basis. Sales associates include both full-time and part-time employees. We
      employ additional associates during peak selling seasons. At February 28, 2007,
      our location general managers averaged more than 8 years of CarMax experience,
      in addition to prior retail management experience. Management believes that
      the
      company maintains good employee relations. No CarMax associate is subject to
      a
      collective bargaining agreement.

Table
            of Contents


Training.

We place
      special emphasis on attracting, developing, and retaining qualified associates
      and believe that our favorable working conditions and compensation programs
      allow us to attract and retain highly qualified individuals in each market
      that
      we enter. We accomplish this partly through our commitment to provide
      exceptional training to associates. Store associates receive structured,
      self-paced training programs that introduce them to company policies and their
      specific job responsibilities through KMX University - our proprietary
      intranet-based testing and tracking system. KMX University is comprised of
      customized applications hosted within a learning management system that allow
      us
      to author, deliver, and track training events, and to measure associate
      competency before and after training. Most new store associates are also
      assigned mentors who provide on-the-job guidance and support.

We
      also
      provide comprehensive, facilitated classroom training courses to sales
      consultants, buyers, automotive technicians, and managers. All sales consultants
      receive extensive customer service training both initially and on an ongoing
      basis. Buyers-in-training undergo a 6- to 18-month apprenticeship under the
      supervision of experienced buyers, and they generally will assist with the
      appraisal of more than one thousand cars before making their first independent
      purchase. We utilize a mix of internal and external technical training programs
      in an effort to provide a stable future supply of qualified technicians.
      Reconditioning and mechanical technicians attend in-house training and
      vendor-sponsored training programs designed to develop their skills in
      performing repairs on the diverse makes and models of vehicles we sell.
      Technicians at our new car franchises also attend manufacturer-sponsored
      training programs to stay abreast of current diagnostic, repair, and maintenance
      techniques for those manufacturers’ vehicles. Additionally, our
      management-training program includes rotations through each functional area.
      We
      open new stores with an experienced management team drawn from existing
      stores.

Laws
      and Regulations

Vehicle
      Dealer and Other Laws and Regulations.

We
      operate in a highly regulated industry. In every state in which we operate,
      we
      must obtain various licenses and permits in order to conduct business, including
      dealer, service, sales, and finance licenses issued by state and certain local
      regulatory authorities. A wide range of federal, state, and local laws and
      regulations govern the manner in which we conduct business, including
      advertising, sales, financing, and employment practices. These laws include
      consumer protection laws, privacy laws, anti-money laundering laws, and state
      franchise laws, as well as other laws and regulations applicable to new and
      used
      motor vehicle dealers. These laws also include federal and state wage-hour,
      anti-discrimination, and other employment practices laws. Our financing
      activities with customers are subject to federal truth-in-lending, consumer
      leasing, and equal credit opportunity laws and regulations, as well as state
      and
      local motor vehicle finance laws, installment finance laws, and usury
      laws.

Claims
      arising out of actual or alleged violations of law may be asserted against
      us by
      individuals or governmental authorities and may expose us to significant damages
      or other penalties, including revocation or suspension of licenses necessary
      to
      conduct business and fines.

Environmental,
      Health, and Safety Laws and Regulations.

We are
      subject to a variety of federal, state, and local laws and requirements that
      regulate the environment and public health and safety.

Our
      business involves the use, handling, and disposal of hazardous or toxic
      substances, including motor oil, gasoline, transmission fluid, solvents,
      lubricants, and other materials. We are subject to compliance with governmental
      and environmental regulations concerning the past and current operation and/or
      removal of aboveground and underground storage tanks containing these and other
      substances.

AVAILABILITY
      OF REPORTS AND OTHER INFORMATION

Our
      annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports
      on
      Form 8-K, and proxy statements on Schedule 14A, as well as any amendments to
      those reports, are available without charge through our website, carmax.com,

            of Contents


Item
      1A. Risk Factors.

We
      are
      subject to various risks, including the risks described below. Our business,
      operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely
      affected by any of these risks. Additional risks not presently known or that
      we
      currently deem immaterial may also impair the business and our
      operations.

Economic
      Conditions.

In the
      normal course of business, we are subject to changes in general or regional
      U.S.
      economic conditions, including, but not limited to, consumer credit
      availability, consumer credit delinquency and loss rates, interest rates,
      gasoline prices, inflation, personal discretionary spending levels, and consumer
      sentiment about the economy in general. Any significant changes in economic
      conditions could adversely affect consumer demand and/or increase costs
      resulting in lower profitability for the company.

Competition.

Automotive
      retailing is a highly competitive business. Our competition includes publicly
      and privately owned franchised new car dealers and independent dealers, as
      well
      as millions of private individuals. Our competitors may sell the same or similar
      makes of vehicles that we offer in the same or similar markets at competitive
      prices. Further,

new
      entrants to the market could result in increased acquisition costs for used
      vehicles and lower-than-expected vehicle sales and margins.

CAF
      is
      subject to competition from various financial institutions. Additionally,
      competition on vehicle sales and related financing is increasing, as these
      products are now being marketed and sold over the Internet. Customers are
      increasingly using the Internet to compare pricing for cars and related
      financing, which may further reduce our profitability.

Retail
      Prices.

Any
      significant changes in retail prices for used and new vehicles could reduce
      our
      sales and margins. If any of our competitors seek to gain or retain market
      share
      by reducing prices for used or new vehicles, we would likely reduce our prices
      in order to remain competitive, which could result in a decrease in our sales
      and profitability and require a change in our operating strategies.

Inventory.

A
      reduction in the availability or access to sources of inventory would adversely
      affect our business. A failure to

adjust
      appraisal offers to stay in line with the broader market trade-in offer trends,
      or a failure to recognize those trends, could negatively impact our ability
      to
      acquire inventory.

Should
      we
      develop excess inventory, the inability to liquidate the excess inventory at
      prices that allow us to meet margin targets or to recover our costs would
      adversely affect our profitability.

Real
      Estate.

The
      inability to acquire suitable real estate at favorable terms could limit the
      expansion of our store base and could have a material adverse affect on our
      future operating results.

Management
      and Workforce.

Our
      success depends upon the continued contributions of our store, region, and
      corporate management teams. Consequently, the loss of the services of key
      employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
      In
      addition, we will need to hire additional personnel as we open new stores.
      The
      market for qualified employees in the industry and in the regions in which
      we
      operate is highly competitive and may result in increased labor costs during
      periods of low unemployment.

Information
      Systems.

Our
      business is dependent upon the efficient operation of our information systems.

In
      particular, we rely on our information systems to effectively manage sales,
      inventory, consumer financing, and customer information.

The
      failure of these systems to perform as designed or the failure to maintain
      and
      continually enhance or protect the integrity of these systems could disrupt
      our
      business, impact sales and profitability, or expose us to customer or
      third-party claims.

Capital.

Changes
      in the availability or cost of capital and working capital financing, including
      the availability of long-term financing to support our geographic expansion
      and
      the availability of securitization financing, could adversely affect growth
      and
      operating strategies. Further, our current credit facility and certain
      securitization and sale-leaseback agreements

contain
      covenants and/or performance triggers. Any failure to comply with these
      covenants and/or performance triggers could have a material adverse effect
      on
      our business.

Weather.

The
      occurrence of severe weather events, such as rain, snow, wind, storms,
      hurricanes, or other natural disasters, adversely affecting consumer traffic
      at
      our superstores could negatively impact our operating results.

Table
            of Contents


Seasonal
      Fluctuations.

Our
      business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. We generally realize a higher
      proportion of revenue and operating profit during the first and second fiscal
      quarters. If conditions arise that impair vehicle sales during the first or
      second fiscal quarters, the adverse effect on our revenues and operating profit
      for the year could be disproportionately large.

Geographic
      Concentration.

Our

performance
      is subject to local economic, competitive, and other conditions prevailing
      in
      geographic areas where we operate. Since a large number of our superstores
      are
      located in the Southeastern U.S. and in the Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston,
      Dallas, and Washington, D.C./Baltimore markets, our results of operations depend
      substantially on general economic conditions and consumer spending habits in
      these markets. In the event that any of these geographic areas experience a
      downturn in economic conditions, it could adversely affect our
      business.

Regulatory
      Environment.

We
      are
      subject to a wide range of federal, state, and local laws and regulations,
      such
      as local licensing requirements and laws regarding

advertising,
      vehicle sales, financing, and employment practices

.
      Our
      facilities and operations are also subject to federal, state, and local laws
      and
      regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety.
      The violation of these laws and regulations could result in administrative,
      civil, or criminal penalties, or in a cease and desist order against operations.
      As a result, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating
      expenditures and other costs in complying with these laws and regulations.
      Further, over the past several years, private plaintiffs and federal, state,
      and
      local regulatory and law enforcement authorities have increased their scrutiny
      of advertising, sales, and finance and insurance activities in the sale and
      leasing of motor vehicles. If, as a result, other automotive retailers adopt
      more transparent, consumer-oriented business practices, our differentiation
      versus those retailers could be reduced.

Litigation.

We are
      subject to various litigation matters, which, if the outcomes in any significant
      matters are adverse, could negatively affect our business. Claims arising out
      of
      actual or alleged violations of law may be asserted against us by individuals,
      either individually or through class actions, or by governmental entities in
      civil or criminal investigations and proceedings. These actions could expose
      us
      to adverse publicity and to substantial monetary damages and legal defense
      costs, injunctive relief, and criminal and civil fines and penalties, including
      suspension or revocation of licenses to conduct operations.

Accounting
      Matters.

The
      implementation of new accounting requirements or changes to U.S. generally
      accepted accounting principles could adversely affect our reported financial
      position or results of operations. Potential changes currently under
      consideration by the Financial Accounting Standards Board include, but are
      not
      limited to, proposed rule changes relating to the accounting for securitization
      transactions and potential changes in accounting for leases and pension
      expense.

Other
      Material Events.

The
      occurrence of certain material events including natural disasters, acts of
      terrorism, the outbreak of war, or other significant national or international
      events could adversely affect our results.

      2. Properties.

We
      conduct our used vehicle operations in three basic retail formats - mega,
      standard, and satellite superstores. Our current growth plan primarily includes
      the construction of standard superstores and satellite superstores. Standard
      superstores are generally 40,000 to 60,000 square feet on 10 to 25 acres.
      Satellite superstores are generally 10,000 to 20,000 square feet on 4 to 10
      acres. Mega superstores are

approximately
      70,000 to 95,000 square feet on 20 to 35 acres.

We
                currently operate seven new car franchises. Two franchises are integrated
                within used car superstores and do not operate as separate stores.
                The
                remaining five franchises are operated from four new car stores that
                are
                co-located with used car
                superstores.

The
                Kenosha, Wisc. superstore has been reclassified from a satellite
                to a
                standard superstore.

We
      have
      financed the majority of our stores through sale-leaseback transactions. As
      of
      February 28, 2007, we leased 61 of our 81 retail stores and owned the remaining
      20 stores. We also own our home office building in Richmond, Va., and land
      associated with planned future store openings.

Expansion

We
      believe that we are well positioned to succeed in the highly competitive
      automotive retail industry. We have built a strong foundation for future growth
      based upon our unique knowledge of the used car market, established presence
      in
      key locations, and ability to execute our business plan in a market subject
      to
      continuous change. We continue to refine our operating strategies and have
      grown
      to be the nation’s largest retailer of used cars. Specifically, we have enhanced
      our ability to identify profitable markets and determine the appropriate store
      formats to fit those markets.

We
      plan
      to open superstores at an annual rate of approximately 15% to 20% of our used
      car superstore base. In fiscal 2008, we plan to open approximately 13
      superstores, including 5 standard-sized superstores and 8 satellite superstores,
      expanding our store base by 17%. Our fiscal 2008 expansion plans are largely
      focused on opening standard superstores in new mid-sized markets and satellite
      superstores in existing markets. We generally define

Table
            of Contents


mid-sized
      markets as those with television viewing populations of between 600,000 and
      2.5
      million people. Historically, mid-sized markets have been the easiest to enter
      from a real estate and an advertising/awareness building perspective, and they
      are where we have generally experienced the fastest ramp-up in store sales
      and
      profitability. We are also beginning to resume store growth in new large
      markets.

      additional details on fiscal 2008 planned store openings, please see “Operations
      Outlook,” included in Part II, Item 7, of this Form 10-K.

      3. Legal Proceedings.

On
      August
      29, 2006, Heather Herron, et al. filed a putative class action lawsuit against
      numerous South Carolina automobile dealers, including CarMax Auto Superstores,
      Inc., in the Court of Common Pleas in Aiken County, South Carolina. Subject
      to
      final judicial approval, we have settled this lawsuit, and we believe the
      settlement will not materially affect our financial position or results of
      operations.

We
      are
      involved in various other legal proceedings in the normal course of business.
      Based upon our evaluation of information currently available, we believe that
      the ultimate resolution of any such proceedings will not have a material adverse
      effect, either individually or in the aggregate, on our financial position,
      liquidity, or results of operations.

      4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security
      Holders.

No
      matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter
      of fiscal 2007.

To
      date,
      we have not paid a cash dividend on the CarMax common stock. We presently intend
      to retain our net earnings for use in our operations and for geographic
      expansion and, therefore, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in
      the
      foreseeable future.

During
      the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we sold no CarMax equity securities that
      were
      not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In addition, we
      did
      not repurchase any CarMax equity securities during this period.

BUSINESS
      OVERVIEW

General

CarMax
      is
      the nation’s largest retailer of used vehicles. We pioneered the used car
      superstore concept, opening our first store in 1993. At February 28, 2007,
      we
      operated 77 used car superstores in 36 markets, including 26 mid-sized markets,
      9 large markets, and 1 small market. We define mid-sized markets as those with
      television viewing populations generally between 600,000 and 2.5 million people.
      We also operated seven new car franchises, all of which are integrated or
      co-located with our used car superstores. In fiscal 2007, we sold 337,021 used
      cars, representing 95% of the total 355,584 vehicles we sold at retail.

We
      believe the CarMax consumer offer is unique in the automobile retailing
      marketplace. Our offer gives consumers a way to shop for cars in the same manner
      that they shop for items at other “big box” retailers. Our consumer offer is
      structured around our four core equities: low, no-haggle prices; a broad
      selection; high quality; and customer-friendly service. Our website, carmax.com,
      is a valuable tool for communicating the CarMax consumer offer, a sophisticated
      search engine, and an efficient channel for customers who prefer to conduct
      their shopping online. We generate revenues, income, and cash flows primarily
      by
      retailing used vehicles and associated items including vehicle financing,
      extended service plans (“ESP”), and retail service. A majority of the used
      vehicles we sell at retail are purchased directly from consumers.

We
      also
      generate revenues, income, and cash flows from the sale of vehicles purchased
      through our appraisal process that do not meet our retail standards. These
      vehicles are sold at our on-site wholesale auctions. Wholesale auctions are
      conducted at the majority of our superstores and are held on a weekly,
      bi-weekly, or monthly basis. In fiscal 2007, we sold 208,959 vehicles at our
      wholesale auctions. On average, the vehicles we wholesale are approximately
      years old and have more than 100,000 miles. Participation in our wholesale
      auctions is restricted to licensed automobile dealers, the majority of whom
      are
      independent dealers and licensed wholesalers.

CarMax
      provides financing to qualified customers through CarMax Auto Finance
      (“CAF”), the company’s finance operation, and Bank of America, and
      through several other third-party lenders. We collect fixed, prenegotiated
      fees from the majority of our third-party lenders, and we periodically test
      additional lenders. CarMax has no recourse liability for the loans provided
      by
      third-party lenders.

We
      sell
      ESPs on behalf of unrelated third parties who are the primary obligors. We
      have
      no contractual liability to the customer under these third-party service plans.
      Extended service plan revenue represents commissions from the unrelated third
      parties.

We
      are
      still at a relatively early stage in the national rollout of our retail concept.
      We believe the primary driver for future earnings growth will be vehicle unit
      sales growth from comparable stores and from geographic expansion.

Table
            of Contents


We
      target
      a similar dollar amount of gross profit per used unit, regardless of retail
      price. Used unit sales growth is our primary focus. We plan to open used car
      superstores at a rate of approximately 15% to 20% of our used car superstore
      base each year. In fiscal 2008, we plan to open 13 superstores, expanding our
      store base by approximately 17%. Over the long term, we expect comparable store
      used unit sales increases to average in the range of 4% to 8%, reflecting the
      multi-year ramp in sales at newly opened stores as they mature, continued market
      share gains at stores that have reached basic maturity sales levels, which
      we
      estimate occurs in a store’s fifth year of operation, and underlying industry
      sales growth.

The
      principal challenges we face in expanding our store base include our ability
      to
      build our management bench strength to support the store growth and our ability
      to procure suitable real estate at reasonable costs. We staff each newly opened
      store with an experienced management team. We must therefore continually
      recruit, train, and develop managers and associates to fill the pipeline
      necessary to support future store openings. If at any time we believed that
      the
      rate of store growth was causing our performance to falter, we would consider
      slowing the growth rate.

Fiscal
      2007 Highlights

·

Net
                sales and operating revenues increased 19% to $7.47 billion from
                $6.26
                billion in fiscal 2006, while net earnings increased 48% to $198.6
                million, or $0.92 per share, from $134.2 million, or $0.63 per share.

·

Total
                used vehicle unit sales increased 16%, reflecting the combination
                of our
                9% increase in comparable store used unit sales and the growth in
                our
                store base.

·

Total
                wholesale vehicle unit sales increased 16%, consistent with our used
                vehicle unit sales growth.

·

We
                opened ten used car superstores in fiscal 2007, including five standard
                superstores and five satellite superstores.

·

Our
                total gross profit per unit increased to $2,731 from $2,544 in fiscal
                2006. We realized improvements in gross profit per unit in all categories,
                including used vehicles, new vehicles, wholesale vehicles, and other.
                We
                believe our used vehicle gross profit benefited from our strong,
                consistent sales performance, which resulted in fewer pricing markdowns
                being made, as well as a more stable underlying economic environment.

·

CAF
                income increased 27% to $132.6 million from $104.3 million in fiscal
                2006.
                The improvement reflected the growth in retail vehicle sales and
                managed
                receivables, an improvement in the gain on loans originated and sold,
                and
                an increase in the average amount financed. CAF income included a
                benefit
                of $13.0 million, or $0.04 per share for favorable items, primarily
                valuation adjustments of our retained interest, in fiscal 2007, compared
                with a benefit of $15.2 million, or $0.04 per share in fiscal 2006.

·

Selling,
                general, and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales and
                operating revenues (the “SG&A ratio”) declined to 10.4% from 10.8% in
                fiscal 2006. We benefited from the leverage of fixed expenses generated
                by
                our strong comparable store sales growth.

·

As
                a result of adopting SFAS 123(R) in fiscal 2007, we recognized share-based
                compensation expense of $0.09 per share in fiscal 2007 compared with
                $0.07
                per share in fiscal 2006, as restated. The fiscal 2007 expense includes
                costs of $0.02 per share resulting from the retirement of our former
                chief
                executive officer.

·

Net
                cash provided by operations increased to $136.8 million from $117.5
                million in fiscal 2006, primarily reflecting the improved net earnings
                offset by increased investment in working
                capital.

      results of operations and financial condition as reflected in the consolidated
      financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally
      accepted accounting principles. Preparation of financial statements requires
      management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts
      of
      assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and the disclosures of contingent
      assets and liabilities. We use our historical experience and other relevant
      factors when developing our estimates and assumptions. We continually evaluate
      these estimates and assumptions. Note 2 includes a discussion of significant
      accounting policies. The accounting policies discussed below are the ones we
      consider critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements
      because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment.
      Our financial results might have been different if different assumptions had
      been used or other conditions had prevailed.

Securitization
      Transactions

We
      use a
      securitization program to fund substantially all of the automobile loan
      receivables originated by CAF. The securitization transactions are accounted
      for
      as sales. A gain, recorded at the time of the securitization transaction,

Table
            of Contents


results
      from recording a receivable equal to the present value of the expected residual
      cash flows generated by the securitized receivables. The fair value of our
      retained interest in securitization transactions includes the present value
      of
      the expected residual cash flows generated by the securitized receivables,
      cash
      reserve accounts, and an undivided ownership interest in the receivables.

The
      present value of the expected residual cash flows generated by the securitized
      receivables is determined by estimating the future cash flows using management’s
      assumptions of key factors, such as finance charge income, loss rates,
      prepayment rates, and discount rates appropriate for the type of asset and
      risk.
      These assumptions are derived from historical experience and projected economic
      trends. Adjustments to one or more of these assumptions may have a material
      impact on the fair value of the retained interest. The fair value of the
      retained interest may also be affected by external factors, such as changes
      in
      the behavior patterns of customers, changes in the economy, and developments
      in
      the interest rate markets. Note 2(C) includes a discussion of accounting
      policies related to securitizations. Note 4 includes a discussion of
      securitizations and provides a sensitivity analysis showing the hypothetical
      effect on the retained interest if there were variations from the assumptions
      used. In addition, see the “CarMax Auto Finance Income” section of this MD&A
      for a discussion of the effect of changes in our assumptions.

Revenue
      Recognition

We
      recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete, generally either at
      the
      time of sale to a customer or upon delivery to a customer. We recognize used
      vehicle revenue when a sales contract has been executed and the vehicle has
      been
      delivered, net of a reserve for returns under our 5-day, money-back guarantee.
      A
      reserve for vehicle returns is recorded based on historical experience and
      trends, and it could be affected if future vehicle returns differ from
      historical averages.

We
      also
      sell ESPs on behalf of unrelated third parties to customers who purchase a
      vehicle. Because these third parties are the primary obligors under these
      programs, we recognize commission revenue on the ESPs at the time of the sale,
      net of a reserve for returns. The reserve for ESP returns is recorded based
      on
      historical experience and trends, and it could be affected if future returns
      differ from historical averages.

Income
      Taxes

Estimates
      and judgments are used in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in
      the
      determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets.
      In
      the ordinary course of business, transactions occur for which the ultimate
      tax
      outcome is uncertain at the time of the transactions. We adjust our income
      tax
      provision in the period in which we determine that it is probable that our
      actual results will differ from our estimates. Tax law and rate changes are
      reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are
      enacted.

We
      evaluate the need to record valuation allowances that would reduce deferred
      tax
      assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. When assessing
      the need for valuation allowances, we consider future reversals of existing
      temporary differences and future taxable income. We believe that all of our
      recorded deferred tax assets as of February 28, 2007, will more likely than not
      be realized. However, if a change in circumstances results in a change in our
      ability to realize our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase
      in
      the period when the change in circumstances occurs.

In
      addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with
      uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize
      potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other
      tax
      jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which,
      additional taxes will be due. If payments of these amounts ultimately prove
      to
      be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits
      being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer
      necessary. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the
      ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result in the period
      of
      determination.

Information
      regarding income taxes is presented in Note 7.

Defined
      Benefit Retirement Plan

The
      plan
      obligations and related assets of our defined benefit retirement plan are
      presented in Note 8. Plan assets, which consist primarily of marketable equity
      and debt instruments, are valued using current market quotations. Plan
      obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by independent
      actuaries using a number of assumptions provided by the company. Key assumptions
      used to measure the plan obligations include the discount rate, the

Table
            of Contents


estimated
      rate of salary increases, and the estimated future return on plan assets. In
      determining the discount rate, we use the current yield on high-quality,
      fixed-income investments that have maturities corresponding to the anticipated
      timing of the benefit payments. Salary increase assumptions are based upon
      our
      historical experience and anticipated future board and management actions.
      Asset
      returns are estimated based upon the anticipated average yield on the plan
      assets. We do not believe that any significant changes in assumptions used
      to
      measure the plan obligations are likely to occur that would have a material
      impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Used
      Vehicle Sales

Fiscal
      2007 Versus Fiscal 2006.

The 23%
      increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2007 reflected a 16% increase in
      unit sales and a 6% increase in average retail selling price. The unit sales
      growth reflected a 9% increase in comparable store used units, together with
      sales from newer superstores not yet in the comparable store base. Our
      comparable store used unit sales growth benefited from strong store and Internet
      traffic and continued strong execution by our store teams. The increase in
      the
      average retail selling price was primarily the result of a shift in vehicle
      mix,
      as we experienced a resurgence in the sales of SUVs and trucks, which we believe
      had been adversely affected in the prior year by consumer reaction to higher
      gasoline prices. The increase in average retail selling price also reflected
      growth in the percentage of luxury vehicles in our sales mix.

Sales
      financed by Drive Financial Services declined to less than 1% of our used
      vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2007 from approximately 3% in fiscal 2006. In
      the
      fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, this lender implemented program changes in
      certain states, narrowing the selection of vehicles it would finance, and making
      this business less economically attractive to us. We chose to curtail our
      business with Drive in these states to preserve margins and profits. The decline
      in Drive-financed sales in fiscal 2007 was substantially offset, however, by
      incremental sales financed by additional lenders added to our third-party
      lender group in the second half of fiscal 2006.

Fiscal
      2006 Versus Fiscal 2005.

The 19%
      increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2006 reflected a 15% increase in
      unit sales and a 4% increase in average retail selling price. The unit sales
      growth reflected sales from newer superstores not yet in the comparable store
      base, together with a 4% increase in comparable store used units. The comparable
      store used unit sales growth was driven by an increase in store traffic,
      combined with continued strong execution by our store teams. Store traffic
      and
      comparable store sales increases were particularly strong during the period
      from
      June through September 2005, which coincided with the domestic new car
      manufacturers’ employee pricing incentive programs. Under these programs, the
      manufacturers established specific “employee” prices, available to all
      consumers, for each make and model. These programs created greater clarity
      on
      new car pricing and increased traffic in the marketplace, both of which we
      believe benefited CarMax. Our no-haggle consumer offer makes price comparing
      easy, and we believe it gives us a unique advantage as consumers cross-shop.

Sales
      financed by Drive, which was added to our third-party lender group in mid-fiscal
      2005, remained approximately 3% of total used vehicle unit sales in fiscal
      and fiscal 2005. The full-year benefit of adding this lender was offset by
      the
      program curtailments made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006.

New
      Vehicle Sales

Fiscal
      2007 Versus Fiscal 2006.

The 11%
      decline in new vehicle revenues in fiscal 2007 was substantially the result
      of a
      decline in unit sales, and in part reflects our strategic decision in fiscal
      2007 to increase targeted gross profit dollars per unit on new vehicles. We
      had
      anticipated that this decision would result in some reduction in new vehicle
      unit sales. The decline in new vehicle unit sales also reflects the effects
      of
      reduced industry new car sales for several of the brands we represent, including
      Chevrolet, DaimlerChrysler, and Nissan.

Fiscal
      2006 Versus Fiscal 2005.

The 2%
      increase in new vehicle revenues in fiscal 2006 was due to a 1% increase in
      unit
      sales and a 1% increase in average retail selling price. New vehicle unit sales
      were strong during the domestic new car manufacturers’ employee pricing programs
      in June through September 2005; however, these increases were substantially
      offset by the effects of softer industry new car sales in the months following
      the end of these programs. New vehicle sales were generally in line with
      industry performance for the core brands we

Table
            of Contents


represent—Chevrolet,
      DaimlerChrysler, Nissan, and Toyota. Our disposition of five new car franchises
      in the second half of fiscal 2005 also affected the change in our new car unit
      sales.

Wholesale
      Vehicle Sales

Our
      operating strategy is to build customer satisfaction by offering high-quality
      vehicles. Fewer than half of the vehicles acquired from consumers through the
      appraisal purchase process meet our standards for reconditioning and subsequent
      retail sale. Those vehicles that do not meet our standards are sold at our
      on-site wholesale auctions.

Fiscal
      2007 Versus Fiscal 2006.

The 18%
      increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2007 resulted from a 16%
      increase in wholesale unit sales and a 1% increase in average wholesale selling
      price. Our wholesale unit sales benefited from a substantial increase in
      appraisal traffic, primarily spurred by our strong comparable store unit sales
      growth, and the expansion of our store base. In the first half of fiscal 2007,
      our average wholesale selling price climbed 6% reflecting, we believe, the
      residual effects of industry shortages of older, higher-mileage vehicles
      experienced following Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma in the fall of 2005.
      In the second half of fiscal 2007, our average wholesale selling price was
      4%
      below the prior year level reflecting the challenging comparison with the
      previous year.

Fiscal
      2006 Versus Fiscal 2005.

The 32%
      increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2006 reflected a 16% increase
      in wholesale unit sales and a 14% increase in average wholesale selling price.
      Our wholesale unit sales growth benefited from a strong increase in appraisal
      traffic combined with the expansion of our store base. Appraisal traffic was
      higher throughout fiscal 2006, but it was particularly strong in the second
      quarter. We believe this increase was due, in part, to the domestic new car
      manufacturers’ employee pricing programs. In these programs, franchised dealers
      lost some ability to negotiate on trade-ins due to their inability to negotiate
      on the published employee discount price on new cars. In addition, the employee
      pricing programs coincided with a period of rapid decline in wholesale values
      for SUVs and large trucks as the result of a spike in gasoline prices, making
      some dealers reluctant to accept these vehicles in trade. These factors created
      an influx of appraisal traffic at CarMax as we continued to make appraisal
      purchase offers on all vehicles presented for appraisal. Appraisal traffic
      also
      benefited from our focused “We Buy Cars” advertising during fiscal 2006.

Our
      on-site wholesale auctions exhibited unusual aggregate price strength in fiscal
      2006, reflecting trends in the general wholesale market. We believe some of
      the
      factors that may have contributed to the unusually strong wholesale market
      pricing environment during various portions of the year included reduced
      supplies of off-lease and off-rental cars; the strong demand for smaller,
      fuel-efficient cars in the face of rising gasoline prices; and hurricanes
      Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, which destroyed an estimated 400,000 to 600,000
      vehicles and created a short-term supply/demand imbalance. Wholesale industry
      price increases were especially strong in older, higher mileage cars that make
      up the majority of the vehicles we sell at wholesale. Our wholesale prices
      also
      benefited from a record level of dealer attendance at our auctions and a record
      dealer-to-car ratio in fiscal 2006. We believe the high dealer attendance at
      our
      auctions reflected the industry shortage of older vehicles as well as our
      continuing efforts to attract dealers to our auctions.

Other
      Sales and Revenues

Fiscal
      2007 Versus Fiscal 2006.

Other
      sales and revenues increased 10% in fiscal 2007. The increase was primarily
      the
      result of increased sales of ESPs and an increase in third-party finance fees.
      The increase in ESP sales was consistent with our increase in used vehicle
      unit
      sales. The third-party finance fees benefited from the decline in Drive-financed
      sales. We record the discount at which this lender purchases loans as an offset
      to the third-party finance fee revenues. Service department sales declined
      modestly in fiscal 2007, as the reconditioning activities required to support
      our strong comparable store used vehicle sales growth limited the service
      capacity available for customer pay work.

Fiscal
      2006 Versus Fiscal 2005.

Other
      sales and revenues increased 14% in fiscal 2006, as all components benefited
      from the increase in retail vehicle sales and the expansion of our superstore
      base.

Used
      Vehicle Gross Profit

We
      target
      a similar dollar amount of gross profit per used unit, regardless of retail
      price. Our ability to quickly adjust appraisal offers to be consistent with
      the
      broader market trade-in trends and our rapid inventory turns reduce our exposure
      to the inherent continual depreciation in used vehicle values and contribute
      to
      our ability to manage our gross profit dollars per unit. In addition, over
      the
      past few years, we have continued to refine our car-buying strategies, which
      we
      believe has benefited our used vehicle gross profit per unit.

Fiscal
      2007 Versus Fiscal 2006.

Our used
      vehicle gross profit increased $95 per unit in fiscal 2007. This increase
      reflected the benefit of our strong, consistent sales performance throughout
      the
      year. We believe several external factors contributed to a greater degree of
      sales volatility in the prior year, including significant changes in gasoline
      prices, new vehicle incentives, and interest rates. We did not experience
      similar variability in these external factors in fiscal 2007, and therefore
      benefited from a more stable business environment. We employ a volume-based
      strategy, and we systematically mark down individual vehicle prices based on
      our
      proprietary pricing algorithms in order to appropriately balance sales growth,
      inventory turns, and gross profit achievement. When customer traffic and our
      sales are consistently strong, we generally take fewer pricing markdowns, which
      in turn maximizes our gross profit dollars per unit. In addition, our used
      vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2006 was adversely affected by slowing demand
      for
      SUVs and trucks that have lower gas mileage, which resulted in higher pricing
      markdowns for these vehicles.

Fiscal
      2006 Versus Fiscal 2005.

While
      our used vehicle gross profit dollars per unit in fiscal 2006 was similar to
      that achieved in fiscal 2005, our used vehicle gross profits remained under
      some
      pressure throughout fiscal 2006. The profit pressure was primarily the result
      of
      the combination of the strong wholesale industry pricing and our desire to
      price
      our retail cars at competitive levels for consumers comparing options in the
      new
      and used car markets. A strong wholesale industry pricing environment increases
      our cost of acquiring vehicles both in our in-store purchases and at auction.
      We
      were able to offset some of the resulting profit pressure through successful
      refinements in our in-store appraisal strategy. During portions of fiscal 2006,
      we did not increase our appraisal offers at the same rate as the steep increase
      in the major public wholesale auction market prices, as we did not believe
      the
      price trends at the major public wholesale auctions were reflective of the
      broader market trade-in offer trends. This belief was reinforced by the fact
      that we continued to experience strong increases in appraisal traffic while
      maintaining our ratio of appraisal buys to appraisal offers. This strategy
      allowed us to keep our retail prices more in line with underlying retail demand,
      while maintaining gross profit dollars per unit.

New
      Vehicle Gross Profit

Fiscal
      2007 Versus Fiscal 2006.

Our
      new
      vehicle gross profit increased $235 per unit in fiscal 2007. The increase
      primarily reflected our strategic decision to increase targeted new vehicle
      gross profit dollars per unit. While this decision contributed to a reduction
      in
      new vehicle unit sales, it resulted in an increase in the total gross profit
      contribution from new vehicles.

Fiscal
      2006 Versus Fiscal 2005.

Our new
      vehicle gross profit increased $74 per unit in fiscal 2006. The increase was
      primarily attributable to the higher profits realized during the domestic new
      car manufacturers’ employee pricing programs. We were able to modestly increase
      our new car prices during these programs, as our pricing had generally been
      below the manufacturers’ specified employee discount prices.

Wholesale
      Vehicle Gross Profit

Fiscal
      2007 Versus Fiscal 2006.

In
      spite
      of the challenging comparison with the prior year, our wholesale vehicle gross
      profit increased $42 per unit in fiscal 2007. Our wholesale vehicle
      profitability has steadily increased over the last several years, reflecting
      the
      benefits realized from improvements and refinements in our car-buying
      strategies, our appraisal delivery processes, and our in-store auction
      processes. We have made continuous improvements in these processes, which we
      believe has allowed us to become more efficient. Our in-store auctions have
      benefited from our initiatives to increase average dealer attendance, which
      we
      believe has allowed us to achieve higher prices.

Fiscal
      2006 Versus Fiscal 2005.

Our
      wholesale vehicle gross profit increased $236 per unit in fiscal 2006. We
      believe a portion of this increase resulted from the unusually strong wholesale
      pricing environment in fiscal 2006. In addition, the refinements in our in-store
      appraisal strategy benefited our wholesale operations, while allowing us to
      maintain used vehicle gross profit dollars per unit levels in the face of rising
      vehicle acquisition costs. While we did not increase our appraisal offers at
      the
      same rate as the steep increase in the major public wholesale auction market
      prices, our own wholesale auctions generally reflected the pricing trends of
      the
      public wholesale auctions.

Our
      wholesale gross profit was particularly strong in the second half of fiscal
      as the result of a combination of factors. The supply/demand imbalance for
      older, higher mileage cars created by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma
      resulted in unusually strong demand and price realizations for our wholesale
      vehicles. In addition, as we normally do in the third quarter, we adjusted
      our
      appraisal offers to incorporate the anticipated seasonal drop in wholesale
      pricing. Wholesale industry pricing typically declines during the fall due
      to
      pressure from model year closeout sales and from reduced demand at auction
      as
      dealers pare back inventories heading into the slower-volume winter months.
      We
      were particularly aggressive in our appraisals of SUVs where wholesale prices
      had fallen dramatically through the summer following sharp increases in the
      cost
      of gasoline. Pricing in the overall wholesale marketplace did not decline as
      much as anticipated, however, giving us unusually high third quarter wholesale
      gross profits.

Other
      Gross Profit

Fiscal
      2007 Versus Fiscal 2006.

Other
      gross profit increased $40 per unit in fiscal 2007. The improvement was the
      result of the growth in ESP sales and third-party finance fees, both of which
      have no associated cost of sales, and an increase in service department margins.
      Our service department reported higher profits, reflecting the greater overhead
      expense absorption provided by the significant increase in used vehicles sales
      and the associated reconditioning volumes.

Fiscal
      2006 Versus Fiscal 2005.

Other
      gross profit per unit increased $25 per unit in fiscal 2006. The improvement
      was
      primarily the result of improved penetration in sales of ESPs and the growth
      in
      service profits. The service department, which is the only category within
      other
      sales and revenues that has an associated cost of sales, reported higher profits
      reflecting the greater overhead expense absorption provided by the higher
      vehicle sales and reconditioning volumes.

Impact
      of Inflation

Inflation
      has not been a significant contributor to results. Profitability is based on
      achieving targeted unit sales and gross profit dollars per vehicle rather than
      on average retail prices. However, CAF income will benefit from an increase
      in
      the average amount financed.

CarMax
      Auto Finance Income

CAF
      provides automobile financing for our used and new car sales. Because the
      purchase of an automobile is traditionally reliant on the consumer’s ability to
      obtain on-the-spot financing, it is important to our business that financing
      be
      available to creditworthy customers. While financing can also be obtained from
      third-party sources, we believe that total reliance on third parties can create
      unacceptable volatility and business risk. Furthermore, we believe that our
      processes and systems, the transparency of our pricing, and our vehicle quality
      provide a unique and ideal environment in which to procure high-quality auto
      finance receivables, both for CAF and for our third-party lenders. CAF provides
      us the opportunity to capture additional profits and cash flows from auto loan
      receivables while managing our reliance on third-party finance sources.

CAF
      income does not include any allocation of indirect costs or income. We present
      this information on a direct basis to avoid making arbitrary decisions regarding
      the indirect benefit or costs that could be attributed to this operation.
      Examples of indirect costs not included are retail store expenses and corporate
      expenses such as human resources, administrative services, marketing,
      information systems, accounting, legal, treasury, and executive
      payroll.

CAF
      originates automobile loans to qualified customers at competitive market rates
      of interest. The majority of the profit contribution from CAF is generated
      by
      the spread between the interest rates charged to customers and our cost of
      funds. Substantially all of the loans originated by CAF are sold in
      securitization transactions. A gain, recorded at the time of securitization,
      results from recording a receivable approximately equal to the present value
      of
      the expected residual cash flows generated by the securitized receivables.
      In a
      normalized environment, we expect the gains on loans originated and sold as
      a
      percent of loans originated and sold (the “gain percentage”) to be in the range
      of 3.5% to 4.5%.

Total
      gain income in fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005 included the effects of retained
      interest valuation adjustments, new public securitizations, and the repurchase
      and resale of receivables in existing public securitizations. The following
      table provides information on the aggregate effect of these items on gain
      income, loans sold, and the gain percentage.

Fiscal
      2007 Versus Fiscal 2006.

CAF
      income rose 27% to $132.6 million in fiscal 2007. CAF income benefited from
      the
      growth in retail vehicle unit sales, and increases in the gain percentage,
      average amount financed, and total managed receivables. The gain percentage
      increased to 3.9% in fiscal 2007 from 3.5% in fiscal 2006, reflecting changes
      in
      the interest rate environment. In fiscal 2006, our funding costs were rising
      faster than rates charged to consumers resulting in a lower gain percentage.
      In
      fiscal 2007, the relative stability in our funding cost allowed us to achieve
      a
      higher gain percentage. The increases in other CAF income and direct CAF
      expenses in fiscal 2007 were proportionate to the growth in managed receivables
      during the year.

We
      recognized other gain income of $13.0 million, or $0.04 per share in fiscal
      compared with $15.2 million, or $0.04 per share, in fiscal 2006. In fiscal
      2007,
      substantially all of the other gain income resulted from favorable valuation
      adjustments. In fiscal 2006, other gain income included $0.03 per share of
      favorable valuation adjustments, $0.01 per share of favorable effects from
      new
      public securitizations, and a favorable effect of less than $0.01 per share
      from
      the repurchase and resale of receivables in existing public securitizations.
      These items are discussed below:

·

Valuation
                adjustments

.
                The net favorable valuation adjustments in both fiscal 2007 and fiscal
                2006 primarily resulted from lowering loss rate assumptions, mostly
                on
                pools of receivables securitized in calendar years 2003, 2004, and
                2005.
                We believe these pools of receivables experienced lower-than-expected
                loss
                rates as a result of a combination of factors, including
                better-than-expected performance of our new credit scorecard implemented
                in calendar year 2002, favorable economic conditions, operating
                efficiencies resulting from systems enhancements, and an improved
                recovery
                rate.

·

New
                public securitizations

.
                CarMax periodically repurchases receivables from the warehouse facility
                and refinances them in public securitizations. The impact of refinancing
                receivables can be favorable or unfavorable depending on the relative
                economics of funding structures at the time the receivables are
                refinanced. These transactions did not have a material impact in
                fiscal
                2007. In fiscal 2006, we recognized a benefit of $0.01 per share
                as we
                refinanced balances from the warehouse facility into new public
                securitizations.

·

Repurchase
                and resale of receivables

.
                Our securitizations typically contain an option to repurchase the
                securitized receivables when the outstanding balance in a pool of
                automobile loan receivables falls below 10% of the original pool
                balance.
                This option was exercised two times in each of fiscal 2007 and 2006.
                In
                each case, the remaining eligible automobile loan receivables were
                subsequently resold into the warehouse facility. These transactions
                did
                not have a material impact in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2006, the spread
                between the APR on the loans and the then-current funding cost in
                the
                warehouse facility resulted in an earnings benefit.

In
      future
      years, the effect of refinancing, repurchase, and resale activity could be
      favorable or unfavorable depending on the securitization structure and market
      conditions at the transaction date.

Table
            of Contents


Fiscal
      2006 Versus Fiscal 2005.

CAF
      income rose 26% to $104.3 million in fiscal 2006. The fiscal 2006 total gain
      income benefited from the growth in retail vehicle sales and a substantial
      increase in other gain income, partially offset by a modest decline in the
      gain
      percentage to 3.5% from 3.7% in fiscal 2005. The increases in other CAF income
      and direct CAF expenses in fiscal 2006 were proportionate to the growth in
      managed receivables during the year.

Other
      gain income was $15.2 million in fiscal 2006 compared with $3.3 million in
      fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2005, approximately half of the other gain income related
      to favorable valuation adjustments, and the remainder primarily resulted from
      the repurchase and resale of receivables in existing public securitizations.

We
      are at
      risk for the performance of the managed securitized receivables to the extent
      of
      our retained interest in the receivables. If the managed receivables do not
      perform in accordance with the assumptions used in determining the fair value
      of
      the retained interest, earnings could be impacted. Past due accounts as a
      percentage of total managed receivables increased moderately in fiscal 2007.
      While credit losses as a percentage of averaged managed receivables decreased
      slightly in fiscal 2007, the decrease was attributable to favorability in the
      first half of the year, offset by higher losses in the second half of the year.
      We believe the increase in losses during the second half of the year was the
      result of a combination of factors, including a gradual shift in credit mix
      of
      the portfolio as well as less favorable general economic and industry trends.
      Receivables originated in calendar years 2003, 2004, and early 2005 have
      experienced loss rates well below both CAF’s historical averages and our
      targeted loss rates. We believe this favorability was due, in part, to the
      credit scorecard we implemented in late 2002. As it became evident that the
      scorecard was resulting in lower-than-expected loss rates, CAF gradually
      expanded its credit offers beginning in late 2004. As a result, receivables
      originated in late 2005 and 2006 have been experiencing higher loss and
      delinquency rates than receivables originated in those prior years. The changes
      in loss and delinquency rates were largely anticipated and were incorporated
      in
      our initial loss assumptions for these pools.

The
      recovery rate represents the average percentage of the outstanding principal
      balance we receive when a vehicle is repossessed and liquidated at wholesale
      auction. We believe the improvement in the recovery rate in fiscal 2006
      reflected the stronger wholesale market pricing environment.

      SG&A ratio declined to 10.4% from 10.8% in fiscal 2006. We benefited from
      the leverage of fixed expenses generated by our strong comparable store sales
      growth. The improvement in the fiscal 2007 SG&A ratio was partially offset
      by an increase in share-based compensation costs and by the recognition of
      an
      impairment loss totaling $4.9 million, or $0.01 per share. The impairment loss
      related to the write down of intangible assets associated with one of our new
      car franchises.

Table
            of Contents


We
      recognized $32.7 million, or $0.09 per share, of share-based compensation costs
      in fiscal 2007, $30.4 million of which was included in SG&A, compared with
      $22.4 million, or $0.07 per share, in fiscal 2006, all of which was included
      in
      SG&A. The increase in share-based compensation cost was driven, in large
      part, by the accelerated vesting of stock options upon the retirement of our
      former chief executive officer in August 2006.

Fiscal
      2006 Versus Fiscal 2005.

The
      SG&A ratio increased slightly to 10.8% from 10.7% in fiscal 2005. The
      moderate rate of increase in comparable store used unit sales in fiscal 2006
      was
      not sufficient to provide SG&A leverage. The increase in the percentage of
      our store base that is comprised of newer stores not yet at basic maturity,
      which generally occurs in the fifth year of operation, also was a contributing
      factor. Newer stores typically experience higher SG&A ratios during their
      first four years of operation. On average, 45% of our stores were less than
      four
      years old in fiscal 2006 compared with 37% in fiscal 2005. Costs associated
      with
      the launch of market-wide television advertising in Los Angeles in fiscal 2006
      and the lower-than-normal corporate bonus expense in fiscal 2005 also precluded
      SG&A leverage.

Income
      Taxes

The
      effective income tax rate was 38.6% in fiscal 2007, 38.3% in fiscal 2006, and
      38.9% in fiscal 2005. The fiscal 2006 decrease resulted primarily from a legal
      entity reorganization in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. We created a
      centralized corporate management entity in an effort to obtain operational,
      legal, and other benefits that also resulted in state tax efficiencies.

      superstores.

Total
                planned openings



We
      expect
      to enter five new markets and expand our presence in six existing markets in
      fiscal 2008. We currently expect to open approximately four superstores in
      the
      first half of fiscal 2008 and nine superstores in the second half of the year.
      However, normal construction, permitting, or other scheduling delays could
      shift
      opening dates of stores into the following fiscal year.

In
      fiscal
      2008, we also plan to open three additional car buying centers, with one each
      in
      the Raleigh, Dallas, and Tampa markets. These sites will expand a test begun
      in
      fiscal 2007, when we opened our first car buying center in the Atlanta market.
      We only conduct appraisals and purchase cars at these sites and do not sell
      cars. These test stores are part of our long-term program to increase both
      appraisal traffic and retail vehicle sourcing self-sufficiency.

We
      currently estimate gross capital expenditures will total approximately $300
      million in fiscal 2008. Planned expenditures primarily relate to new store
      construction and land purchases associated with future year store openings.
      Compared with the approximately $192 million spent in fiscal 2007, the fiscal
      2008 capital spending

Table
            of Contents


estimate
      reflects more real estate purchases for future development in larger,
      multi-store markets. In addition, the fiscal 2007 capital spending amount was
      lower than originally projected, due in part to the acquisition of some store
      sites pursuant to ground leases.

Fiscal
      2008 Expectations

The
      fiscal 2008 expectations discussed below are based on historical and current
      trends in our business and should be read in conjunction with “Risk Factors,” in
      Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.

Fiscal
      2008 Sales.

We
      currently anticipate comparable store used unit growth for fiscal 2008 in the
      range of 3% to 9%. We also expect wholesale unit sales growth to be consistent
      with our total used unit sales increase. Total revenues are expected to climb
      by
      between 14% and 20%, reflecting our expectations for comparable store used
      unit
      growth, new store openings, a modest increase in used vehicle average selling
      price, and a continued decline in our new vehicle sales.

Fiscal
      2008 Earnings Per Share.

We
      currently anticipate fiscal 2008 earnings per share in the range of $1.03 to
      $1.14, representing EPS growth in the range of 12% to 24%. We expect modest
      improvement in both used vehicle and wholesale gross profits per unit in fiscal
      2008, as we continue to refine and improve our car-buying
      processes.

We
      expect
      CAF income to increase modestly, but at a pace slower than anticipated sales
      growth, primarily reflecting the challenging comparison created by the $13.0
      million of favorable CAF items reported in fiscal 2007. The CAF gain percentage
      is anticipated to be slightly above the midpoint of our normalized 3.5% to
      4.5%
      range in fiscal 2008, assuming no significant change in the interest rate
      environment.

Our
      effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 is expected to be similar to the fiscal
      rate. However, our diluted share count is expected to increase by approximately
      3%, reflecting the effects of the recent increase in our stock price and option
      exercises on the weighted average share calculation. The diluted share count
      for
      the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 was 1.4% higher than the average for the
      full
      year, accounting for approximately one-half of the anticipated 3%
      increase.

RECENT
      ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

For
      a
      discussion of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to the company, see
      Note 15.

FINANCIAL
      CONDITION

Operating
      Activities

We
      generated net cash from operating activities of $136.8 million in fiscal 2007,
      $117.5 million in fiscal 2006, and $41.8 million in fiscal 2005. Cash generated
      from operating activities was $19.3 million higher in fiscal 2007 compared
      with
      fiscal 2006. The $64.4 million increase in net earnings in fiscal 2007 was
      more
      than offset by the increased growth in inventories. Inventories increased by
      $166.4 million in fiscal 2007 compared with a $93.1 million increase in fiscal
      2006. The fiscal 2007 inventory increase related to store openings during fiscal
      2007 and shortly after the end of the fiscal year, as well as to added vehicle
      inventory required to support our strong increase in fourth quarter comparable
      store used unit sales.

Cash
      generated from operating activities was $75.7 million higher in fiscal 2006
      compared with fiscal 2005. The increase reflected the $32.9 million increase
      in
      net earnings in fiscal 2006 and a $44.6 million reduction in the year-over-year
      growth in working capital.

The
      aggregate principal amount of automobile loan receivables funded through
      securitizations, which are discussed in Notes 3 and 4 totaled $3.24 billion
      at
      February 28, 2007, $2.71 billion at February 28, 2006, and $2.43 billion at
      February 28, 2005. During fiscal 2007, we completed three public automobile
      securitizations totaling $1.87 billion. At February 28, 2007, the warehouse
      facility limit was $825.0 million and unused warehouse capacity totaled $227.0
      million. The warehouse facility matures in July 2007. Note 4 includes a
      discussion of the warehouse facility. We anticipate that we will be able to
      renew, expand, or enter into new securitization arrangements to meet CAF’s
      future needs.

Investing
      Activities

Net
      cash
      used in investing activities was $187.2 million in fiscal 2007, $116.1 million
      in fiscal 2006, and $141.1 million in fiscal 2005. Capital expenditures were
      $191.8 million in fiscal 2007, $194.4 million in fiscal 2006, and $230.1 million
      in fiscal 2005. In addition to store construction costs, capital expenditures
      for all three years included the cost of land acquired for future year store
      openings. In fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, capital expenditures also included
      costs associated with our new home office, which was completed in October 2005.

Historically,
      capital expenditures have been funded with internally generated funds, short-
      and long-term debt, and sale-leaseback transactions. Net proceeds from the
      sales
      of assets totaled $4.6 million in fiscal 2007, $78.3 million in fiscal 2006,
      and
      $89.0 million in fiscal 2005. The majority of the sale proceeds in fiscal 2006
      and fiscal 2005 related to sale-leaseback transactions. In fiscal 2006, we
      entered into sale-leaseback transactions involving five superstores valued
      at
      $72.7 million. In fiscal 2005, we entered into sale-leaseback transactions
      involving seven superstores valued at approximately $84.0 million. These
      transactions were structured with initial lease terms of either 15 or 20 years
      with four, five-year renewal options. At February 28, 2007, we owned 20
      superstores currently in operation, as well as the company’s home office in
      Richmond, Virginia. In addition, six store facilities were accounted for as
      capital leases.

Financing
      Activities

Net
      cash
      provided by financing activities was $48.1 million in fiscal 2007, $3.2 million
      in fiscal 2006, and $67.7 million in fiscal 2005. We used cash generated from
      operations to reduce total debt by $9.5 million in fiscal 2007 and $6.8 million
      in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2005, we increased total debt by $60.2 million
      primarily to fund increased inventory.

In
      December 2006, we amended our revolving credit facility. The term of the
      agreement was extended from August 2009 to December 2011, and the aggregate
      borrowings available under the agreement were increased from $450 million to
      $500 million. Borrowings under this credit facility are available for working
      capital and general corporate purposes, and are secured by our vehicle
      inventory.

As
      of
      February 28, 2007, $150.7 million was outstanding under the credit facility,
      with the remainder fully available to us. The outstanding balance included
      $3.3
      million classified as short-term debt, and $147.4 million classified as current
      portion of long-term debt. We classified the outstanding balance at February
      28,
      2007, as current portion of long-term debt based on our expectation that this
      balance will not remain outstanding for more than one year.

Cash
      received on equity issuances, which primarily related to employee stock option
      exercises, increased to $35.4 million in fiscal 2007 compared with $6.0 million
      in fiscal 2006 and $4.3 million in fiscal 2005. The increase reflected exercises
      by the former chief executive officer in connection with his retirement, and
      other exercises prompted by the significant increase in our stock price in
      fiscal 2007.

We
      expect
      that cash generated by operations; proceeds from securitization transactions;
      and, if needed, additional debt and sale-leaseback transactions will be
      sufficient to fund capital expenditures and working capital for the foreseeable
      future.

Off-Balance
      Sheet Arrangements

CAF
      provides financing for our used and new car sales. We use a securitization
      program to fund substantially all of the automobile loan receivables originated
      by CAF. We sell the automobile loan receivables to a wholly owned,
      bankruptcy-remote, special purpose entity that transfers an undivided interest
      in the receivables to a group of third-party investors. This program is referred
      to as the warehouse facility.

We
      periodically use public securitizations to refinance the receivables previously
      securitized through the warehouse facility. In a public securitization, a pool
      of automobile loan receivables is sold to a bankruptcy-remote, special purpose
      entity that in turn transfers the receivables to a special purpose
      securitization trust.

Additional
      information regarding the nature, business purposes, and importance of our
      off-balance sheet arrangement to our liquidity and capital resources can be
      found in the CarMax Auto Finance Income, Financial Condition, and Market Risk
      sections of this MD&A, as well as in Notes 3 and 4.

Automobile
      Installment Loan Receivables

At
      February 28, 2007, and February 28, 2006, all loans in our portfolio of
      automobile loan receivables were fixed-rate installment loans. Financing for
      these automobile loan receivables is achieved through asset securitization
      programs that, in turn, issue both fixed- and floating-rate securities. We
      manage the interest rate exposure relating to floating-rate securitizations
      through the use of interest rate swaps. Receivables held for investment or
      sale
      are financed with working capital. Generally, changes in interest rates
      associated with underlying swaps will not have a material impact on earnings.
      However, changes in interest rates associated with underlying swaps may have
      a
      material impact on cash and cash flows.

Credit
      risk is the exposure to nonperformance of another party to an agreement. We
      mitigate credit risk by dealing with highly rated bank counterparties. The
      market and credit risks associated with financial derivatives are similar to
      those relating to other types of financial instruments. Refer to Note 5 for
      a
      description of these items.

MANAGEMENT’S
      ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER
      FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management
      is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
      financial reporting for the company. Because of its inherent limitations,
      internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
      misstatements. Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial
      reporting can provide only reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
      financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
      purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Management
      conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over
      financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in

Internal
      Control—Integrated Framework

,
      issued
      by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based
      on this evaluation, our management has concluded that our internal control
      over
      financial reporting was effective as of February 28, 2007.

KPMG
      LLP,
      the company's independent registered public accounting firm, has issued a report
      on our management's assessment of our internal control over financial reporting.
      Their report is included herein.

PUBLIC
      ACCOUNTING FIRM

The
      Board
      of Directors and Shareholders

CarMax,
      Inc.:

We
      have
      audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying Management's
      Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that CarMax, Inc.
      and subsidiaries (the “Company”) maintained effective internal control over
      financial reporting as of February 28, 2007, based on criteria established
      in

Internal
      Control—Integrated Framework

issued
      by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
      The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
      control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
      of
      internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express
      an
      opinion on management's assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
      Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
      conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
      Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
      plan
      and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
      internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
      respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
      over
      financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating
      the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
      such
      other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
      that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
      company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
      provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
      and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
      with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control
      over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
      to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
      reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
      provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
      permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally
      accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
      company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
      and
      directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
      prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
      of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated
      financial statements.

Because
      of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
      not
      prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
      effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
      inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
      with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
      our
      opinion, management's assessment that CarMax, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained
      effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 28, 2007,
      is
      fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in

Internal
      Control—Integrated Framework

issued
      by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
      Also, in our opinion, CarMax, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material
      respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of February
      28,
      2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
      issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
      (COSO).

We
      also
      have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
      Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of CarMax,
      Inc.
      and subsidiaries as of February 28, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated
      statements of earnings, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the
      fiscal years in the three-year period ended February 28, 2007, and our report
      dated April 25, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
      financial statements.

REPORT
      OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED

PUBLIC
      ACCOUNTING FIRM

The
      Board
      of Directors and Shareholders

CarMax,
      Inc.:

We
      have
      audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CarMax, Inc. and
      subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of February 28, 2007 and 2006, and the
      related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders’ equity, and cash
      flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended
      February 28, 2007. In connection with our audits of the consolidated
      financial statements, we also have audited the financial statement Schedule
      II -
      valuation and qualifying accounts as of and for each of the fiscal years in
      the
      three-year period ended February 28, 2007. These consolidated financial
      statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
      Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
      consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
      our
      audits.

We
      conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
      Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
      plan
      and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
      statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
      on a
      test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
      statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
      and
      significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
      financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
      reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
      our
      opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly,
      in all material respects, the financial position of CarMax, Inc. and
      subsidiaries as of February 28, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their
      operations and their cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year
      period ended February 28, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
      accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement
      schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
      statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
      information set forth therein.

As
      discussed in Notes 2(A) and 10(C) to the consolidated financial statements,
      the
      Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
      No. 123 (revised 2004) (Statement 123(R)),

Share-Based
      Payment

,
      effective March 1, 2006, using the modified retrospective transition method.
      As
      discussed in Note 8(A) to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
      adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158,

Employers’
      Accounting for Defined Pension and Other Postretirement Plans

,
      effective February 28, 2007.

We
      also
      have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
      Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
      control over financial reporting as of February 28, 2007, based on criteria
      established in

Internal
      Control-Integrated Framework

issued
      by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO),
      and our report dated April 25, 2007, expressed an unqualified opinion on
      management’s assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control
      over financial reporting.

BUSINESS
                AND BACKGROUND

CarMax,
      Inc. (“we”, “our”, “us”, “CarMax”, and “the company”), including its wholly
      owned subsidiaries, is the largest retailer of used vehicles in the United
      States. We were the first used vehicle retailer to offer a large selection
      of
      quality used vehicles at low, “no-haggle” prices using a customer-friendly sales
      process in an attractive, modern sales facility. We also sell new vehicles
      under
      various franchise agreements. We provide our customers with a full range of
      related services, including the financing of vehicle purchases through our
      own
      finance operation, CarMax Auto Finance (“CAF”), and third-party lenders; the
      sale of extended service plans; the appraisal and purchase of vehicles directly
      from consumers; and vehicle repair service. Vehicles purchased through the
      appraisal process that do not meet our retail standards are sold at on-site
      wholesale auctions.

SUMMARY
                OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
                POLICIES

(A)
      Basis of Presentation and Use of Estimates

The
      consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CarMax and our wholly
      owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions
      have
      been eliminated in consolidation.

The
      preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
      accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
      that
      affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses,
      and
      the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ
      from those estimates.

We
      adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123 (Revised
      2004), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS 123(R)”), effective March 1, 2006, applying
      the modified retrospective method. As a result, we have restated prior period
      amounts to reflect the adoption of this standard. The impact of the adoption
      of
      SFAS 123(R) on net income for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 is consistent with
      the
      pro forma amounts disclosed in our previous annual reports to shareholders.
      See
      Note 10(C) for further discussion.

On
      February 22, 2007, the board of directors declared a 2-for-1 stock split in
      the
      form of a common stock dividend for shareholders of record on March 19, 2007,
      which was distributed on March 26, 2007. All share and per share data included
      in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been
      adjusted to reflect this stock split.

(B)
      Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash
      equivalents of $1.5 million at February 28, 2007, and $6.0 million at February
      28, 2006, consisted of highly liquid investments with original maturities of
      three months or less.

(C)
      Securitizations

The
      transfers of receivables associated with our automobile loan securitization
      program are accounted for as sales. We retain an interest in the automobile
      loan
      receivables that we securitize. The retained interest presented on our
      consolidated balance sheets includes the present value of the expected residual
      cash flows generated by the securitized receivables, various reserve accounts,
      and an undivided ownership interest in the securitized receivables. The retained
      interest is carried at fair value, and changes in fair value are included in
      earnings. See Notes 3 and 4 for additional discussion of securitizations.

(D)
      Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Due
      to
      the short-term nature and/or variable rates associated with these financial
      instruments, the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents, receivables
      including automobile loan receivables, accounts payable, short-term debt, and
      long-term debt approximates fair value. Our retained interest in securitized
      receivables and derivative financial instruments are recorded on the
      consolidated balance sheets at fair value.

(E)
      Trade Accounts Receivable

Trade
      accounts receivable, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts, include certain
      amounts due from finance companies and customers, as well as from manufacturers
      for incentives and from third parties for warranty reimbursements, and for
      other
      miscellaneous receivables. The estimate for doubtful accounts is based on
      historical experience and trends.

Table
            of Contents


(F)
      Inventory

Inventory
      is comprised primarily of vehicles held for sale or undergoing reconditioning
      and is stated at the lower of cost or market. Vehicle inventory cost is
      determined by specific identification. Parts and labor used to recondition
      vehicles, as well as transportation and other incremental expenses associated
      with acquiring and reconditioning vehicles, are included in inventory. Certain
      manufacturer incentives and rebates for new car inventory, including holdbacks,
      are recognized as a reduction to new car inventory when we purchase the
      vehicles. We recognize volume-based incentives as a reduction to cost of sales
      when we determine the achievement of qualifying sales volumes is probable.

(G)
      Property and Equipment

Property
      and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
      Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method
      over
      the shorter of the asset's estimated useful life or the lease term, if
      applicable. Property held under capital lease is stated at the lesser of the
      present value of the future minimum lease payments at the inception of the
      lease
      or fair value. Amortization of capital lease assets is computed on a
      straight-line basis over the shorter of the initial lease term or the estimated
      useful life of the asset and is included in depreciation expense. Costs incurred
      during new store construction are capitalized as construction-in-progress and
      reclassified to the appropriate fixed asset category when the store opens.

We
      review
      long-lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount
      of an asset may not be recoverable. We recognize impairment when the sum of
      undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of
      the
      asset is less than the carrying value of the asset.

(H)
      Other Assets

Computer
      Software Costs

We
      capitalize external direct costs of materials and services used in the
      development of internal-use software and payroll and payroll-related costs
      for
      employees directly involved in the development of internal-use software. We
      amortize amounts capitalized on a straight-line basis over five years.

Goodwill
      and Intangible Assets

We
      review
      goodwill and intangible assets for impairment annually or when circumstances
      indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

Restricted
      Cash Deposits

At
      February 28, 2007, and February 28, 2006, other assets included restricted
      cash
      deposits of $21.7 million and $17.7 million, respectively, associated with
      certain insurance programs.

(I)
      Defined Benefit Plan Obligations

Defined
      benefit retirement plan obligations are included in accrued expenses and other
      current liabilities and deferred revenue and other liabilities on our
      consolidated balance sheets. The current portion represents benefits expected
      to
      be paid over the next 12 months from our benefit restoration plan. We previously
      reported defined benefit retirement plan obligations entirely in accrued
      expenses and other current liabilities. The defined benefit retirement plan
      obligations are determined by independent actuaries using a number of
      assumptions provided by the company. Key

assumptions used in measuring the plan obligations include the discount rate,
      the estimated long-term return on plan assets, the estimated rate of
      compensation increases, and the mortality rate.

On
      February 28, 2007, we adopted SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined
      Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans - an amendment of FASB Statements
      No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R),” (“SFAS 158”). See Note 8(A) for additional
      discussion.

(J)
      Insurance Liabilities

Insurance
      liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities
      on
      our consolidated balance sheets. We use a combination of insurance and
      self-insurance for a number of risks including workers' compensation,

Table
            of Contents


general
      liability, and employee-related health care costs, a portion of which is paid
      by
      associates. Estimated insurance liabilities are determined by considering
      historical claims experience, demographic factors, and other actuarial
      assumptions.

(K)
      Store Opening Expenses

Costs
      related to store openings, including preopening costs, are expensed as incurred.

(L)
      Income Taxes

We
      file a
      consolidated federal income tax return for a majority of our subsidiaries.
      Certain subsidiaries are required to file separate partnership or corporate
      federal income tax returns. Deferred income taxes reflect the impact of
      temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities recognized
      for financial reporting purposes and the amounts recognized for income tax
      purposes, measured by applying currently enacted tax laws. A deferred tax asset
      is recognized if it is more likely than not that a benefit will be realized.
      Changes in tax laws and tax rates are reflected in the income tax provision
      in
      the period in which the changes are enacted.

(M)
      Revenue Recognition

We
      recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete, generally either at
      the
      time of sale to a customer or upon delivery to a customer. As part of our
      customer service strategy, we guarantee the vehicles we sell with a 5-day,
      money-back guarantee. If a customer returns the vehicle purchased within the
      parameters of the guarantee, we will refund the customer's money. We record
      a
      reserve for returns based on historical experience and trends.

We
      sell
      extended service plans on behalf of unrelated third parties. These service
      plans
      have terms of coverage ranging from 12 to 72 months. Because the third parties
      are the primary obligors under these service plans, we recognize commission
      revenue at the time of sale, net of a reserve for estimated customer returns.
      The reserve for returns is based on historical experience and trends.

We
      collect sales taxes and other taxes from customers on behalf of governmental
      authorities at the time of sale. These taxes are accounted for on a net basis
      and are not included in net sales and operating revenues or cost of sales.

(N)
      Advertising Expenses

Advertising
      costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses are included in selling,
      general, and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of earnings.

(O)
      Net Earnings Per Share

Basic
      net
      earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average
      number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted net earnings per share
      is
      computed by dividing net earnings by the sum of the weighted average number
      of
      shares of common stock outstanding and dilutive potential common stock.

(P)
      Derivative Financial Instruments

In
      connection with certain securitization activities, we enter into interest rate
      swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rates and to more closely
      match funding costs to the use of funding. We recognize the interest rate swaps
      as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at fair
      value
      with changes in fair value included in earnings as a component of CAF income.

(Q)
      Risks and Uncertainties

We
      sell
      used and new vehicles. The diversity of our customers and suppliers and the
      highly fragmented nature of the U.S. automotive retail market reduces the risk
      that near term changes in our customer base, sources of supply, or competition
      will have a severe impact on our business. However, management cannot assure
      that unanticipated events will not have a negative impact on the company.

(R)
      Reclassifications

Certain
      prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s
      presentation. The consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of
      cash flows reflect the reclassification of retirement plan liabilities of
      $18,445 at February 28, 2006, and $11,545 at February 28, 2005, from accrued
      expenses and other current liabilities to deferred revenue and other
      liabilities.

Our
      finance operation, CAF, provides financing for qualified customers at
      competitive market rates of interest. Throughout each month, we sell
      substantially all of the loans originated by CAF in securitization transactions
      as discussed in Note 4. The majority of CAF income is generated by the spread
      between the interest rates charged to customers and the related cost of funds.
      A
      gain, recorded at the time of securitization, results from recording a
      receivable approximately equal to the present value of the expected residual
      cash flows generated by the securitized receivables. The cash flows are
      calculated taking into account expected prepayments and losses.

CAF
      income does not include any allocation of indirect costs or income. We present
      this information on a direct basis to avoid making arbitrary decisions regarding
      the indirect benefit or costs that could be attributed to CAF. Examples of
      indirect costs not included are retail store expenses and corporate
      expenses such as human resources, administrative services, marketing,
      information systems, accounting, legal, treasury, and executive
      payroll.

4.

SECURITIZATIONS

We
      use a
      securitization program to fund substantially all of the automobile loan
      receivables originated by CAF. We sell the automobile loan receivables to a
      wholly owned, bankruptcy-remote, special purpose entity that transfers an
      undivided interest in the receivables to a group of third-party investors.
      The
      special purpose entity and investors have no recourse to our assets. Our risk
      is
      limited to the retained interest on our consolidated balance sheets. The
      investors issue commercial paper supported by the transferred receivables,
      and
      the proceeds from the sale of the commercial paper are used to pay for the
      securitized receivables. This program is referred to as the warehouse
      facility.

We
      routinely use public securitizations to refinance the receivables previously
      securitized through the warehouse facility. In a public securitization, a pool
      of automobile loan receivables is sold to a bankruptcy-remote, special purpose
      entity that in turn transfers the receivables to a special purpose
      securitization trust. The securitization trust issues asset-backed securities,
      secured or otherwise supported by the transferred receivables, and the proceeds
      from the sale of the securities are used to pay for the securitized receivables.
      Depending on the securitization structure and market conditions, refinancing
      receivables in a public securitization may or may not have a significant impact
      on our results. The impact of refinancing activity will depend upon the
      particular securitization structures and market conditions at the refinancing
      date.

All
      transfers of receivables are accounted for as sales. When the receivables are
      securitized, we recognize a gain or loss on the sale of the receivables as
      described in Note 3.

                as applicable.

Table
            of Contents


Retained
      Interest

We
      retain
      an interest in the automobile loan receivables that we securitize. The retained
      interest, presented as a current asset on our consolidated balance sheets,
      serves as a credit enhancement for the benefit of the investors in the
      securitized receivables. The retained interest includes the present value of
      the
      expected residual cash flows generated by the securitized receivables, or
“interest-only strip receivables,” various reserve accounts, and an undivided
      ownership interest in the securitized receivables, or “required excess
      receivables,” as described below. On a combined basis, the reserve accounts and
      required excess receivables are generally 2% to 4% of managed receivables.
      The
      special purpose entities and the investors have no recourse to our
      assets.

The
      fair
      value of the retained interest was $202.3 million as of February 28, 2007,
      and
      $158.3 million as of February 28, 2006. The retained interest had a weighted
      average life of 1.5 years as of February 28, 2007, and February 28, 2006.
      The weighted average life in periods (for example, months or years) of
      prepayable assets is calculated by multiplying the principal collections
      expected in each future period by the number of periods until that future
      period, summing those products, and dividing the sum by the initial principal
      balance.

Interest-only
      strip receivables

.
      Interest-only strip receivables represent the present value of residual cash
      flows we expect to receive over the life of the securitized receivables. The
      value of these receivables is determined by estimating the future cash flows
      using our assumptions of key factors, such as finance charge income, loss rates,
      prepayment rates, and discount rates appropriate for the type of asset and
      risk.
      The value of interest-only strip receivables may be affected by external
      factors, such as changes in the behavior patterns of customers, changes in
      the
      strength of the economy, and developments in the interest rate markets;
      therefore, actual performance may differ from these assumptions. We evaluate
      the
      performance of the receivables relative to these assumptions on a regular basis.
      Any financial impact resulting from a change in performance is recognized in
      earnings in the period in which it occurs.

Reserve
      accounts

.
      We are
      required to fund various reserve accounts established for the benefit of the
      securitization investors. In the event that the cash generated by the
      securitized receivables in a given period was insufficient to pay the interest,
      principal, and other required payments, the balances on deposit in the reserve
      accounts would be used to pay those amounts. In general, each of our
      securitizations requires that an amount equal to a specified percentage of
      the
      original balance of the securitized receivables be deposited in a reserve
      account on the closing date and that any excess cash generated by the
      receivables be used to fund the reserve account to the extent necessary to
      maintain the required amount. If the amount on deposit in the reserve account
      exceeds the required amount, the excess is released through the special purpose
      entity to the company. In the public securitizations, the amount required to
      be
      on deposit in the reserve account must equal or exceed a specified floor amount.
      The reserve account remains funded until the investors are paid in full, at
      which time the remaining balance is released through the special purpose entity
      to the company. The amount on deposit in reserve accounts was $31.5 million
      as
      of February 28, 2007, and $29.0 million as of February 28, 2006.

Required
      excess receivables

.
      The
      total value of the securitized receivables must exceed, by a specified
      amount, the principal amount owed to the investors. The required excess
      receivables balance represents this specified amount. Any cash flows generated
      by the required excess receivables are used, if needed, to make payments to
      the
      investors. Any remaining cash flows from the required excess receivables are
      released through the special purpose entity to the company. The unpaid principal
      balance related to the required excess receivables was $57.0 million as of
      February 28, 2007, and $52.2 million as of February 28, 2006.

Key
      Assumptions Used in Measuring the Retained Interest and Sensitivity
      Analysis.

The
      following table shows the key economic assumptions used in measuring the fair
      value of the retained interest at February 28, 2007, and a sensitivity analysis
      showing the hypothetical effect on the retained interest if there were
      unfavorable variations from the assumptions used. These sensitivity analyses
      are
      hypothetical and should be used with caution. In this table, the effect of
      a
      variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interest
      is calculated without changing any other assumption; in actual circumstances,
      changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which might magnify
      or
      counteract the sensitivities.

Prepayment
      rate

.
      We use
      the Absolute Prepayment Model or “ABS” to estimate prepayments. This model
      assumes a rate of prepayment each month relative to the original number of
      receivables in a pool of receivables. ABS further assumes that all the
      receivables are the same size and amortize at the same rate and that each
      receivable in each month of its life will either be paid as scheduled or prepaid
      in full. For example, in a pool of receivables originally containing 10,000
      receivables, a 1% ABS rate means that 100 receivables prepay each
      month.

Cumulative
      loss rate

.
      The
      cumulative loss rate, or “static pool” net losses, is calculated by dividing the
      total projected credit losses of a pool of receivables by the original pool
      balance. Projected credit losses are estimated using the losses experienced
      to
      date, the credit quality of the receivables, economic factors, and the
      performance history of similar receivables.

Continuing
      Involvement with Securitized Receivables.

We
      continue to manage the automobile loan receivables that we securitize. We
      receive servicing fees of approximately 1% of the outstanding principal balance
      of the securitized receivables. We believe that the servicing fees specified
      in
      the securitization agreements adequately compensate us for servicing the
      securitized receivables. No servicing asset or liability has been recorded.
      We
      are at risk for the retained interest in the securitized receivables and, if
      the
      securitized receivables do not perform as originally projected, the value of
      the
      retained interest would be impacted.

Proceeds
      from new securitizations

.
      Proceeds from new securitizations include proceeds from receivables that are
      newly securitized in or refinanced through the warehouse facility during the
      indicated period. Balances previously outstanding in public securitizations
      that
      were refinanced through the warehouse facility totaled $82.5 million in

Table
            of Contents


fiscal
      2007, $94.8 million in fiscal 2006, and $51.0 million in fiscal 2005. 
Proceeds received when we refinance receivables in public securitizations are
      excluded from this table as they are not considered new securitizations.

Proceeds
      from collections

.
      Proceeds from collections reinvested in revolving period securitizations
      represent principal amounts collected on receivables securitized through the
      warehouse facility that are used to fund new originations.

Servicing
      fees

.
      Servicing fees received represent cash fees paid to CarMax to service the
      securitized receivables.

Other
      cash flows received from the retained interest

.
      Other
      cash flows received from the retained interest represents cash that we receive
      from the securitized receivables other than servicing fees. It includes cash
      collected on interest-only strip receivables and amounts released to us from
      reserve accounts.

Financial
      Covenants and Performance Triggers.

Certain
      of the securitization agreements include various financial covenants and
      performance triggers. These agreements require us to meet financial covenants
      related to maintaining minimum tangible net worth, maximum total liabilities
      to
      tangible net worth ratio, minimum current ratio, and minimum fixed
      charge coverage ratio. Performance triggers require certain pools of securitized
      receivables to achieve specified thresholds related to portfolio yields, loss
      rates, and delinquency rates. If these financial covenants and/or thresholds
      are
      not met, in addition to other consequences, we may be unable to continue to
      securitize receivables through the warehouse facility. At February 28, 2007,
      we
      were in compliance with the financial covenants, and the securitized receivables
      were in compliance with the performance triggers.

FINANCIAL
                DERIVATIVES

We
      enter
      into amortizing fixed-pay interest rate swaps relating to our automobile loan
      receivable securitizations. Swaps are used to better match funding costs to
      the
      fixed-rate receivables being securitized by converting variable-rate financing
      costs in the warehouse facility to fixed-rate obligations. We entered into
      two
      17-month and forty 40-month amortizing interest rate swaps with initial notional
      amounts totaling approximately $2.05 billion in fiscal 2007, and two 17-month
      and twenty-five 40-month amortizing interest rate swaps with initial notional
      amounts totaling approximately $1.57 billion in fiscal 2006. The amortized
      notional amount of all outstanding swaps related to the automobile loan
      receivable securitizations was approximately $597.5 million at February 28,
      2007, and $584.0 million at February 28, 2006. The fair value of swaps included
      in accounts payable totaled a net liability of $1.0 million at February 28,
      2007, and the fair value of swaps included in prepaid expenses and other current
      assets totaled a net asset of $1.6 million at February 28, 2006.

The
      market and credit risks associated with interest rate swaps are similar to
      those
      relating to other types of financial instruments. Market risk is the exposure
      created by potential fluctuations in interest rates. We do not anticipate
      significant market risk from swaps as they are used on a monthly basis to match
      funding costs to the use of the funding. Credit risk is the exposure to
      nonperformance of another party to an agreement. We mitigate credit risk by
      dealing with highly rated bank counterparties.

Based
      on
      our historical and current pretax earnings, management believes the amount
      of
      gross deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized through future
      taxable income and future reversals of existing temporary differences;
      therefore, no valuation allowance is necessary.

BENEFIT
                PLANS

(A)
      Retirement Plans

We
      have a
      noncontributory defined benefit pension plan (the “pension plan”) covering the
      majority of full-time employees. We also have an unfunded nonqualified plan
      (the
“restoration plan”) that restores retirement benefits for certain senior
      executives who are affected by Internal Revenue Code limitations on benefits
      provided under the pension plan. We use a fiscal year end measurement date
      for
      both the pension plan and the restoration plan.

We
      adopted SFAS 158 as of February 28, 2007. SFAS 158 was required to be adopted
      on
      a prospective basis, and prior year financial statements and related disclosures
      were not permitted to be restated. SFAS 158 requires us to:

·

Recognize
                the funded status of postretirement benefit plans - measured as the
                difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected
                benefit
                obligation - on our balance sheet.

·

Recognize
                changes in the funded status in accumulated other comprehensive loss
                (a
                component of shareholders’ equity) in the year in which the change occurs.

·

Measure
                postretirement benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date
                of our
                fiscal year end. We had already been using our fiscal year end as
                our
                measurement date.

The
      amounts initially recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be
      subsequently recognized as net pension expense in our consolidated statement
      of
      earnings. In addition, actuarial gains and losses that arise in subsequent
      periods and are not recognized as net pension expense in the same periods will
      be recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Those
      amounts will be subsequently recognized as a component of net pension expense
      on
      the same basis as the amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive
      loss
      upon adoption of SFAS 158.

The
      following table summarizes the incremental effects of the adoption of SFAS
      on our consolidated balance sheet at February 28, 2007. SFAS 158 did not change
      the existing criteria for measurement of periodic benefit costs, plan assets,
      or
      benefit obligations, and the adoption of this statement had no effect on our
      consolidated statement of earnings for any period.

Funding
      Policy.

For the
      pension plan, we contribute amounts sufficient to meet minimum funding
      requirements as set forth in the employee benefit and tax laws plus any
      additional amounts as we may determine to be appropriate. We expect to
      contribute approximately $10 million to the pension plan in fiscal 2008. For
      the
      non-funded restoration plan, we contribute an amount equal to the expected
      benefit payments.

Our

      policies and strategies. Long-term strategic investment objectives include
      asset
      preservation and appropriately balancing risk and return. We oversee the
      investment allocation process, which includes selecting investment managers,
      setting long-term strategic targets, and monitoring asset allocations and

      occasionally plan fiduciaries will approve allocations above or below the
      targets.

Assumptions.

Underlying both the calculation of the PBO and the net pension expense are
      actuarial calculations of each plan's liability. These calculations use
      participant-specific information such as salary, age, and years of service,
      as
      well as certain assumptions, the most significant being the discount rate,
      expected rate of return on plan assets, rate of compensation increases, and
      mortality rate. We evaluate these assumptions annually, at a minimum, and make
      changes as necessary.

The
      discount rate used for retirement benefit plan accounting reflects the yields
      available on high-quality, fixed income debt instruments. For our plans, we
      review high-quality corporate bond indices in addition to a hypothetical
      portfolio of corporate bonds with maturities that approximate

the
      expected timing of the anticipated benefit payments.

To
      determine the expected long-term return on plan assets, we consider the current
      and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns
      on
      various categories of plan assets. We apply the expected rate of return to
      a
      market-related value of assets, which reduces the underlying variability in
      the
      asset values. The use of expected long-term rates of return on pension plan
      assets may result in recognized asset returns that are greater or less than
      the
      actual returns of those pension plan assets in any given year. Over time,
      however, the expected long-term returns are anticipated to approximate the
      actual long-term returns and therefore result in a pattern of income and expense
      recognition that more closely matches the pattern of the services provided
      by
      the employees. Differences between actual and expected returns, a component
      of
      unrecognized actuarial gains/losses, are recognized over the average future
      expected service of the active employees in the pension plan.

We
      determine the rate of compensation increases based upon our long-term plans
      for
      such increases. Mortality rate assumptions are based on the life expectancy
      of
      the population and were updated as of February 28, 2006, to account for recent
      increases in life expectancy.

(B)
      401(k) Plan

We
      sponsor a 401(k) plan for all associates meeting certain eligibility criteria.
      Under the plan, eligible associates can contribute up to 40% of their salaries,
      and we match a portion of those contributions. The total cost for matching
      contributions was $2.7 million in fiscal 2007, $2.0 million in fiscal 2006,
      and
      $1.5 million in fiscal 2005.

CarMax
      has a $500 million, five year revolving credit facility (the “credit agreement”)
      with Bank of America, N.A. and various other financial institutions. The credit
      agreement is secured by vehicle inventory and contains customary representations
      and warranties, conditions, and covenants. Borrowings accrue interest at
      variable rates

Table
            of Contents


based
      on
      LIBOR, the federal funds rate, or the prime rate, depending on the type of
      borrowing. We pay a commitment fee on the used and unused portions of the
      available funds. All outstanding principal amounts will be due and payable
      in
      December 2011, and there are no penalties for prepayment.

As
      of
      February 28, 2007, $150.7 million was outstanding under the credit agreement,
      with the remainder fully available to us. The outstanding balance included
      $3.3
      million of loans classified as short-term debt, and $147.4 million classified
      as
      current portion of long-term debt. We classified the outstanding balance at
      February 28, 2007 as current portion of long-term debt based on our expectation
      that this balance will not remain outstanding for more than one
      year.

We
      have
      recorded six capital leases for store facilities. The related capital lease
      assets are included in property and equipment. These leases were structured
      at
      varying interest rates with initial lease terms ranging from 10 to 20 years
      with
      payments made monthly. The present value of future minimum lease payments
      totaled $34.8 million at February 28, 2007, and $35.7 million at February 28,
      2006.

The
      weighted average interest rate on outstanding short-term debt was 6.4% during
      fiscal 2007, 5.5% during fiscal 2006, and 4.3% during fiscal 2005.

We
      capitalize interest in connection with the construction of certain facilities.
      Capitalized interest totaled $4.5 million in fiscal 2007, $6.0 million in fiscal
      2006, and $3.5 million in fiscal 2005.

STOCK
                AND STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE
                PLANS

(A)
      Shareholder Right Plan and Undesignated Preferred Stock

In
      conjunction with the company’s shareholder rights plan, shareholders received
      preferred stock purchase rights as a dividend at the rate of one right for
      each
      share of CarMax, Inc. common stock owned. The rights are exercisable only upon
      the attainment of, or the commencement of a tender offer to attain, a 15% or
      greater ownership interest in the company by a person or group. When
      exercisable, and as adjusted for our March 2007 2-for-1 stock split, each right
      would entitle the holder to buy one half of one one-thousandth of a share of
      Cumulative Participating Preferred Stock, Series A, $20 par value, at an
      exercise price of $140 per share, subject to adjustment. A total of 120,000
      shares of such preferred stock, which has preferential dividend and liquidation
      rights, have been authorized and designated. No such shares are outstanding.
      In
      the event that an acquiring person or group acquires the specified ownership
      percentage of CarMax, Inc. common stock (except pursuant to a cash tender offer
      for all outstanding shares determined to be fair by the board of directors)
      or
      engages in certain transactions with the company after the rights become
      exercisable, each right will be converted into a right to purchase, for half
      the
      current market price at that time, shares of CarMax, Inc. common stock valued
      at
      two times the exercise price. We also have an additional 19,880,000 authorized
      shares of undesignated preferred stock of which no shares are
      outstanding.

(B)
      Stock Incentive Plans

We
      maintain long-term incentive plans for management, key employees, and the
      nonemployee members of the board of directors. The plans allow for the grant
      of
      equity-based compensation awards, including nonqualified stock options,
      incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards,
      stock grants, or a combination of awards.

In
      fiscal
      2006 and prior years, we primarily awarded stock options to employees that
      received share-based compensation. Beginning in fiscal 2007, the substantial
      majority of employees receiving awards now receive restricted stock instead
      of
      stock options. Senior management continues to receive awards of nonqualified
      stock options. Nonemployee directors continue to receive awards of nonqualified
      stock options and stock grants.

Stock
      options are awards that allow the recipient to purchase shares of our stock
      at a
      fixed price. Stock options are granted at an exercise price equal to the fair
      market value of our stock on the grant date. Substantially all of the awards
      vest annually in equal amounts over periods of three to four years. These
      options generally expire no later than ten years after the date of the grant.
      Restricted stock awards are subject to specified restrictions and a risk of
      forfeiture. The restrictions typically lapse three years from the grant
      date.

As
      of
      February 28, 2007, a total of 34,000,000 shares of CarMax common stock have
      been
      authorized to be issued under the long-term incentive plans. The number of
      unissued common shares reserved for future grants under the long-term incentive
      plans was 10,117,116 at February 28, 2007.

Share-Based
      Compensation

Effective
      March 1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of SFAS 123(R), which established
      accounting for share-based awards exchanged for employee services. Under the
      provisions of SFAS 123(R), share-based compensation cost is measured at the
      grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award. We recognize the
      compensation cost as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite
      service period of the entire award, which is generally the vesting period of
      the
      equity grant. Prior to March 1, 2006, we applied Accounting Principles
      Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
      Employees,” and related interpretations for share-based awards, and provided the
      pro forma disclosures required by SFAS 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
      Compensation.” We elected to apply the modified retrospective application method
      as provided by SFAS 123(R), and, accordingly, financial statement amounts for
      the prior periods presented in this report have been restated to report the
      fair
      value method of expensing share-based compensation on a basis consistent with
      the pro forma disclosures required for those periods by SFAS 123.

In
      accordance with SFAS 123(R), we are required to base initial compensation cost
      on the estimated number of awards expected to vest. Historically, and as
      permitted under SFAS 123, we chose to reduce pro forma compensation expense
      in
      the periods the awards were forfeited. The cumulative effect on prior periods
      of
      the change to an estimated number of awards expected to vest was a $0.6 million
      reduction of selling, general, and administrative expenses recorded in fiscal
      2007.

For

      that
      would have been presented in cost of sales and CAF were immaterial. We recognize
      compensation expense for stock options and restricted stock on a straight-line
      basis over the requisite service period. Consistent with the provisions of
      SFAS
      123, our employee stock purchase plan is considered a liability-classified
      compensatory plan under SFAS 123(R); the associated costs of $0.9 million in
      fiscal 2007, $0.8 million in fiscal 2006, and $0.7 million in fiscal 2005 are
      included in share-based compensation expense. There were no capitalized
      share-based compensation costs at February 28, 2007, 2006, or 2005.

      common stock in fiscal 2007 and 5,210,954 shares of common stock in fiscal
      2006.
      We granted our nonemployee directors nonqualified options to purchase 68,040
      shares of common stock in fiscal 2007 and 68,382 shares of common stock in
      fiscal 2006.

The
      total

      was
      $35.4 million in fiscal 2007, $5.9 million in fiscal 2006, and $4.4
      million in fiscal 2005. We settle employee stock option exercises with
      authorized but unissued shares of CarMax common stock. The total intrinsic
      value
      of options exercised was $74.7 million for fiscal 2007, $13.0 million
      for fiscal 2006, and $10.2 million for fiscal 2005. We realized related tax

For
      all
      stock options granted prior to March 1, 2006, the fair value was estimated
      as of the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. For stock
      options granted to employees on or after March 1, 2006, the fair value of
      each award is estimated as of the date of grant using a binomial valuation
      model. In computing the value of the option, the binomial model considers
      characteristics of fair-value option pricing that are not available for
      consideration under the Black-Scholes model. Similar to the Black-Scholes model,
      the binomial model takes into account variables such as expected volatility,
      dividend yield, and risk-free interest rate. However, in addition, the binomial
      model considers the contractual term of the option, the probability that the
      option will be exercised prior to the end of its contractual life, and the
      probability of termination or retirement of the option holder. For these
      reasons, we believe that the fair value provided by the binomial model is more
      representative of actual experience and future expected experience than the
      value calculated using the Black-Scholes model. For grants to nonemployee
      directors, we will continue to use the Black-Scholes model to estimate the
      fair
      value of stock option awards due to the comparatively small population of
      recipients of these awards. Estimates of fair value are not intended to predict
      actual future events or the value ultimately realized by the recipients of
      share-based awards.

The
      weighted average fair values at the date of grant for options granted were
      $7.08
      per share in fiscal 2007, $6.34 per share in fiscal 2006, and $8.75 per share
      in
      fiscal 2005. The unrecognized compensation costs related to all nonvested
      options totaled $30.6 million at February 28, 2007.  These costs are
      expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.9
      years.

Restricted
      Stock Activity

We
      granted 984,500 shares of restricted stock to our employees in fiscal 2007.
      There were no restricted stock grants in fiscal 2006. The fair value of a
      restricted stock award is determined and fixed based on the price of our stock
      on the grant date.

The
      unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested restricted stock awards
      totaled $10.5 million at February 28, 2007. These costs are expected to be
      recognized over a weighted average period of 2.1 years.

Employee
      Stock Purchase Plan

We
      sponsor an employee stock purchase plan for all associates meeting certain
      eligibility criteria. Associate contributions are limited to 10% of eligible
      compensation, up to a maximum of $7,500 per year. For each $1.00 contributed
      by
      associates to the plan, we match $0.15. We have authorized up to 4,000,000
      shares of common stock for the employee stock purchase plan. The source of
      the
      shares available for purchase by associates may, at our option, be open market
      purchases or authorized but unissued shares.

At
      February 28, 2007, a total of 2,267,143 shares remained available under the
      plan. Shares purchased on the open market on behalf of associates were 337,311
      during fiscal 2007; 427,318 during fiscal 2006; and 451,922 during fiscal 2005.
      The average price per share purchased under the plan was $19.32 in fiscal 2007,
      $14.42 in fiscal 2006, and $12.98 in fiscal 2005. The total cost for matching
      contributions was $862,300 in fiscal 2007; $803,600 in fiscal 2006; and $746,700
      in fiscal 2005. These costs are included in share-based compensation
      costs.

LEASE
                COMMITMENTS

We
      conduct a majority of our business in leased premises. Our lease obligations
      are
      based upon contractual minimum rates. Most leases provide that we pay taxes,
      maintenance, insurance, and operating expenses applicable to the premises.
      The
      initial term of most real property leases will expire within the next 20 years;
      however, most of the leases have options providing for renewal periods of 5
      to
      20 years at terms similar to the initial terms. For operating leases, rent
      is
      recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, including scheduled
      rent increases and rent holidays. Rent expense for all operating leases was
      $75.4 million in fiscal 2007, $72.6 million in fiscal 2006, and $61.5 million
      in
      fiscal 2005.

We
      entered into no sale-leaseback transactions in fiscal 2007. We entered into
      sale-leaseback transactions involving five superstores valued at approximately
      $72.7 million in fiscal 2006, and transactions for seven superstores valued
      at
      $84.0 million in fiscal 2005. All sale-leaseback transactions are structured
      at
      competitive rates. Gains or losses on sale-leaseback transactions are recorded
      as deferred rent and amortized over the lease term. We do not have continuing
      involvement under the sale-leaseback transactions. In conjunction with certain
      sale-leaseback transactions, we must meet financial covenants relating to
      minimum tangible net worth and minimum coverage of rent expense. We were in
      compliance with all such covenants as of February 28, 2007.

SUPPLEMENTAL
                FINANCIAL STATEMENT
                INFORMATION

(A)
      Goodwill and Other Intangibles

Other
      assets on the consolidated balance sheets included goodwill and other
      intangibles with a carrying value of $10.1 million as of February 28, 2007,
      and
      $15.0 million as of February 28, 2006. We recognized an impairment charge of
      $4.9 million, included in selling, general, and administrative expenses, related
      to goodwill and franchise rights associated with one of our new car franchises
      in fiscal 2007. No impairment of goodwill or intangible assets resulted from
      our
      annual impairment tests in fiscal 2006 or fiscal 2005.

(B)
      Accrued Compensation and Benefits

Accrued
      expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets
      included accrued compensation and benefits of $60.1 million as of February
      28,
      2007, and $57.4 million as of February 28, 2006.

CONTINGENT
                LIABILITIES

(A)
      Litigation

On
      August
      29, 2006, Heather Herron, et al. filed a putative class action lawsuit against
      numerous South Carolina automobile dealers, including CarMax Auto Superstores,
      Inc., in the Court of Common Pleas in Aiken County, South Carolina. Subject
      to
      final judicial approval, we have settled this lawsuit, and we believe the
      settlement will not materially affect our financial position or results of
      operations.

We
      are
      involved in various other legal proceedings in the normal course of business.
      Based upon our evaluation of information currently available, we believe that
      the ultimate resolution of any such proceedings will not have a material adverse
      effect, either individually or in the aggregate, on our financial position,
      liquidity, or results of operations.

(B)
      Other Matters

In
      accordance with the terms of real estate lease agreements, CarMax generally
      agrees to indemnify the lessor from certain liabilities arising as a result
      of
      the use of the leased premises, including environmental liabilities and repairs
      to leased property upon termination of the lease. Additionally, in accordance
      with the terms of agreements entered into for the sale of properties, we
      generally agree to indemnify the buyer from certain liabilities and costs
      arising subsequent to the date of the sale, including environmental liabilities
      and liabilities resulting from the breach of representations or warranties
      made
      in accordance with the agreements. We do not have any known material
      environmental commitments, contingencies, or other indemnification issues
      arising from these arrangements.

As
      part
      of our customer service strategy, we guarantee the used vehicles we retail
      with
      a 30-day limited warranty. A vehicle in need of repair within 30 days of the
      customer's purchase will be repaired free of charge. As a result, each vehicle
      sold has an implied liability associated with it. Accordingly, we record a
      provision for estimated repairs during the guarantee period for each vehicle
      sold based on historical trends. The liability for this guarantee was $2.4
      million at February 28, 2007, and $1.9 million at February 28, 2006, and is
      included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated
      balance sheets.

RECENT
                ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In July 2006,
      the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation No.
      48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” (“FIN 48”) which establishes a
      consistent framework to use to determine the appropriate level of tax reserves
      to maintain for “uncertain tax positions.” This interpretation of SFAS No. 109,
“Accounting for Income Taxes,” uses a two-step approach wherein a tax benefit is
      recognized if a position is more likely than not to be sustained. The amount
      of
      the benefit is then measured as the highest tax benefit that is greater than
      fifty percent likely to be realized. FIN 48 also establishes new disclosure
      requirements related to tax reserves. We will be required to adopt FIN 48 as
      of
      March 1, 2007. We do not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact
      on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

In
      September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements,” (“SFAS
      157”) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value
      in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about
      fair value measurements. The statement does not require new fair value
      measurements, but is applied to the extent that other accounting pronouncements
      require or permit fair value measurements. Companies will be required to
      disclose the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and
      liabilities, the inputs used to develop the measurements, and the effect of
      certain of the measurements on earnings (or changes in net assets) for the
      period. CarMax will be required to adopt SFAS 157 as of March 1, 2008. We are
      currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 157 on our financial position,
      results of operations, and cash flows.

In
      September 2006, the SEC staff published Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108,
      “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying
      Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements” (“SAB 108”). The bulletin
      addresses quantifying the financial statement effects of misstatements,
      specifically, how the effects of prior year uncorrected errors must be
      considered in quantifying misstatements in the current year financial
      statements. The bulletin offers a special “one-time” transition provision for
      correcting certain prior year misstatements that were

Table
            of Contents


uncorrected
      as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. SAB 108 was effective for
      the current fiscal year ending February 28, 2007. The adoption of this statement
      did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations,
      or cash flows.

In
      February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for
      Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities - Including an amendment of FASB
      Statement No. 115,” (“SFAS 159”) which permits all entities to choose to measure
      many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and
      consequently report unrealized gains and losses on these items in earnings.
      SFAS
      159 will be effective for our fiscal year beginning March 1, 2008. We are
      currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 159 on our financial position,
      results of operations, and cash flows.

Evaluation
      of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We
      maintain disclosure controls and procedures (“disclosure controls”) that are
      designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
      filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,
      summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the U.S.
      Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are
      also designed to ensure that this information is accumulated and communicated
      to
      management, including the chief executive officer (“CEO”) and the chief
      financial officer (“CFO”), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
      required disclosure.

As
      of the
      end of the period covered by this report, we evaluated the effectiveness of
      the
      design and operation of our disclosure controls. This evaluation was performed
      under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the
      CEO and CFO. Based upon that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that our
      disclosure controls were effective as of the end of the period.

Changes
      in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There
      was
      no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
      the quarter ended February 28, 2007, that has materially affected, or is
      reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
      reporting.
