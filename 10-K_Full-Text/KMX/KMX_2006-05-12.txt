Item 1. Business.

Business Overview

CarMax, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1996. Its corporate offices are located at 12800 Tuckahoe Creek Parkway, Richmond, Va. CarMax, Inc. is a holding company and its
operations are conducted through its subsidiaries.

Under the ownership of Circuit City Stores, Inc. (“Circuit City”), CarMax began operations in
1993 when it opened its first superstore in Richmond, Va. In fiscal 1997, Circuit City created two common stock series, Circuit City Stores, Inc.–Circuit City Group common stock and Circuit City Stores, Inc.–CarMax Group (“CarMax
Group”) common stock. On February 7, 1997, Circuit City completed an initial public offering of CarMax Group common stock, which was intended to track separately the performance of the CarMax operations. On October 1, 2002, the CarMax
business was separated from Circuit City through a tax-free transaction in which each share of CarMax Group common stock was exchanged for one share of CarMax, Inc. common stock. In addition, each holder of Circuit City Group common stock received a
distribution of a 0.313879 share of CarMax, Inc. common stock for each Circuit City Group share owned. As a result of the separation, all of the businesses, assets, and liabilities of the former CarMax Group are held in CarMax, Inc., an independent,
separately traded public company.

CarMax is the nation’s largest retailer of used cars. CarMax was the first used vehicle retailer to offer a large
selection of high quality used vehicles at competitively low, fixed prices using a customer-friendly sales process in an attractive, modern sales facility. The CarMax consumer offer provides consumers the opportunity to shop for vehicles the same
way they shop for items at other “big-box” retailers. CarMax has designed a strategy to better serve the auto retailing market by addressing the major sources of dissatisfaction with traditional auto retailers and to maximize operating
efficiencies with standardized operating procedures and store formats enhanced by sophisticated, proprietary management information systems.

The company
purchases, reconditions, and sells used vehicles. In general, the used vehicles retailed by CarMax are one to six years old with fewer than 60,000 miles. All used vehicles are thoroughly reconditioned to meet high mechanical, electrical, safety, and
cosmetic standards and must pass a comprehensive inspection before being offered for sale. Each superstore also offers a selection of used vehicles that are more than six years old or have more than 60,000 miles, but which meet similar quality
standards.



The company also sells new vehicles under franchise agreements with four new car manufacturers. In fiscal 2006, new
vehicles comprised 7% of the company’s total retail vehicle unit sales. As planned, CarMax’s new car sales have become a smaller part of its business mix over the past five fiscal years as it has divested 14 new car franchises while
aggressively growing its used car business. CarMax expects to maintain long-term relationships with the automotive manufacturers that it currently represents.

CarMax provides its customers with a full range of related products and services, including the financing of vehicle purchases through CarMax Auto Finance (“CAF”), the company’s own finance operation, and third-party lenders;
the sale of extended service plans and accessories; the appraisal and purchase of vehicles directly from consumers; and vehicle repair service.

The CarMax
consumer offer enables customers to evaluate separately each component of the sales process and to make informed decisions based on comprehensive information about the options, terms, and associated prices of each component. The customer can accept
or decline any individual element of the offer without affecting the price or terms of any other component of the offer. CarMax’s “no-haggle” pricing and its commission structure, which is based on a fixed dollars-per-unit standard,
allow its sales consultants to focus solely on meeting customer needs.

The company has separated the practice of trading in a used vehicle in conjunction
with the purchase of another vehicle into two distinct and independent transactions. CarMax will appraise a consumer’s vehicle and make a cash offer to purchase that vehicle regardless of whether the owner is purchasing a vehicle from CarMax.
CarMax acquires the majority of its retail used vehicle inventory through this unique in-store appraisal process. The company also acquires a significant portion of its used vehicles through wholesale auctions and, to a lesser extent, directly from
other sources, including wholesalers, dealers, and fleet owners. Vehicles purchased through the company’s in-store appraisal process that do not meet CarMax’s retail standards are sold at on-site wholesale auctions.

CarMax’s inventory management and control system tracks each vehicle throughout the sales process. Using the information provided by this system and applying
sophisticated statistical modeling techniques enable CarMax to optimize its inventory mix and display by store, anticipate future inventory needs at each store, evaluate sales consultant performance, and refine its vehicle pricing strategy. Because
of the pricing discipline afforded by the inventory management and pricing system, more than 99% of the entire inventory offered at retail is sold at retail.

Since opening its first superstore in 1993, CarMax has expanded its store base to 67 superstores in 31 U.S. markets as of the end of fiscal 2006. The company opened a total of 33 used car superstores through fiscal 2000 before suspending
new store development to focus on improving sales and profits. CarMax resumed opening new stores at the end of fiscal 2002 and is currently opening used car superstores at an annual rate of approximately 15% to 20% of the company’s superstore
base.

Industry and Competition.

With calendar year 2005 sales of approximately $370 billion, used vehicles comprise nearly half of the U.S. auto
retail market, the largest retail segment of the economy. In calendar 2005, there were an estimated 44 million used vehicles sold in the U.S. compared with approximately 17 million new vehicles. CarMax’s primary focus, late-model
vehicles that are 1 to 6 years old, is estimated at approximately $280 billion in annual sales and 21 million units per year.

The U.S. used car
marketplace is highly fragmented and competitive and includes approximately 21,600 franchised new car dealers and 44,700 independent dealers, as well as millions of private individuals. The company’s primary competitors are the franchised new
car dealers, who sell the majority of late-model used vehicles. Independent dealers predominantly sell older, higher mileage cars than does CarMax. In both the used and new vehicle markets, CarMax seeks to distinguish itself from traditional
dealerships through its consumer offer, sales approach, and other innovative operating strategies.

The company believes that its principal competitive
factors in used vehicle retailing are its ability to provide a high degree of customer satisfaction with the car-buying experience; competitively low prices; breadth of selection of most popular makes and models available on site at each CarMax
superstore and on its website, carmax.com; quality of vehicles; proprietary information systems; and location of retail sites. Upon request by the customer, CarMax will transfer virtually any used vehicle in the company’s nationwide inventory
to a local superstore. Transfers are free within a market; longer distance transfers include a charge to cover transportation costs. CarMax’s Certified Quality Inspection assures that every vehicle offered for sale at CarMax meets stringent
mechanical, electrical, and safety standards. CarMax backs every vehicle with a 5-day, money-back guarantee, and at least a 30-day limited warranty. Other competitive factors include the ability to offer or arrange customer financing on competitive
terms and the comprehensiveness and cost of extended service plans. CarMax believes that it is competitive in all of these areas and that it enjoys advantages over competitors that employ traditional high-pressure, negotiation-oriented sales
techniques.



CarMax’s sales consultants play a significant role in ensuring a customer-friendly sales process. A sales consultant
is paid a commission based on a fixed dollars-per-unit standard, thereby earning the same dollar sales commission regardless of the price or gross margin on the vehicle being sold. This ensures that the sales consultant’s primary objective is
helping customers find the right cars for their needs at prices they can afford. In contrast, sales and finance personnel at traditional dealerships often receive higher commissions for negotiating higher prices and for steering customers toward
vehicles with higher gross margins.

In the new vehicle market, CarMax competes with other franchised dealers offering vehicles produced by the same or
other manufacturers. Historically, the new vehicle market has been served primarily by dealerships employing traditional automotive selling methods. The company believes its customer-friendly, low-pressure sales methods are points of competitive
differentiation.

Marketing and Advertising.

CarMax’s marketing strategies are focused on developing awareness of the advantages of shopping at
its stores and on attracting customers who are already considering buying or selling a vehicle. The company uses market awareness and customer satisfaction surveys to help tailor its marketing efforts to the purchasing habits and preferences of
customers in each market area. CarMax’s marketing strategies are implemented primarily through television and radio broadcasts, carmax.com, the Internet, and newspaper advertising. Television and radio broadcast advertisements are designed to
build consumer awareness of the CarMax name, carmax.com, and key components of the CarMax offer. Newspaper advertisements promote CarMax’s broad selection of vehicles and price competitiveness, targeting consumers with immediate purchase
intentions. Broadcast, Internet, and newspaper advertisements are designed to drive customers to CarMax stores and to carmax.com.

The media landscape is
changing rapidly and CarMax is changing its marketing programs in response. The company is customizing its marketing program based on awareness levels in each market. In selected markets, CarMax is expanding its use of Internet-based advertising
while de-emphasizing its use of newspaper advertising. The company is building awareness and driving traffic to its stores and carmax.com by listing every retail vehicle on both AutoTrader.com and cars.com. Through their syndication networks,
AutoTrader.com and cars.com vehicle listings appear on sites that are visited by more than 80% of all late-model used vehicle buyers who use the Internet in their shopping process. The company’s advertising on the Internet also includes banner
and key-word advertisements on search engines, such as Google and Yahoo!

The company’s website, carmax.com, is a marketing tool for communicating the
CarMax consumer offer in detail, a sophisticated search engine for finding the right vehicle, and a sales channel for customers who prefer to complete a part of the shopping and sales process online. The CarMax website offers complete inventory and
pricing search capabilities. Information on the more than 22,000 cars available in the company’s nationwide inventory is updated daily. Carmax.com includes detailed information, such as vehicle photos, prices, features, specifications, and
store locations, as well as sorting and comparison features that allow consumers to easily compare vehicles. The site also includes features such as detailed vehicle reviews, payment calculators, and an option to estimate trade-in values via a link
with Kelley Blue Book. Customers can contact sales consultants online via carmax.com, by telephone, or by fax. Customers can work with these sales consultants from the comfort of home, including applying for financing, and need to visit the store
only to sign the paperwork and pick up their vehicle.

Suppliers for Used Vehicles.

CarMax acquires its used vehicle inventory directly from
consumers through its unique in-store appraisal process and through other sources, including local and regional auctions, wholesalers, franchised and independent dealers, and fleet owners, such as leasing companies and rental companies. In calendar
2005, more than 23 million used vehicles were remarketed in the U.S., of which approximately 9.6 million were sold at wholesale auction.

The
CarMax in-store appraisal offer process gives the company access to individual consumers as its largest source for used vehicle inventory. The most popular makes and models are more readily available directly from consumers than from other sources.
In stores open for more than a year, CarMax acquires the majority of its used vehicle inventory directly from consumers. This buying strategy also helps provide an inventory of makes and models that reflects the tastes of each market. In May 2006,
CarMax began testing a stand-alone car-buying center in the Atlanta market in a major automotive retail center not currently served by CarMax. Staffed by CarMax buyers, this store is intended to increase appraisal traffic and the number of vehicles
sourced from individual consumers. The company does not sell cars at this store.

CarMax has replaced the traditional “trade-in” transaction with
a process in which a CarMax-trained buyer appraises the vehicle and provides the vehicle’s owner with a written, guaranteed cash offer that is good for 7 days or 300 miles, whichever comes first. An appraisal is available to every customer free
of charge, whether or not the individual purchases a vehicle from CarMax. Based on their age, mileage, or condition, fewer than half of the vehicles acquired through this in-store appraisal process meet the company’s high quality retail
standards. Those vehicles that do not meet CarMax’s retail standards are sold at the company’s on-site wholesale auctions.



The inventory purchasing function is primarily performed at the store level and is the responsibility of the buyers, who
handle both on-site appraisals and off-site auction purchases. CarMax buyers evaluate all used vehicles on the basis of their estimated wholesale value and reconditioning costs, and, for off-site purchases, cost of delivery to the store where they
will be reconditioned. To decide which inventory to purchase at off-site auctions, CarMax’s buyers, in collaboration with its home office staff, rely on the extensive inventory and sales trend data available through the CarMax information
system. The company’s inventory and pricing models help the buyers tailor inventories to the buying preferences at each superstore, recommend pricing adjustments, and optimize inventory turnover to help maintain gross margin dollars per unit.

Based on consumer acceptance of the in-store appraisal process at existing CarMax stores, the company’s experience and success to date in acquiring
vehicles from auctions and other sources, and the large size of the U.S. auction market relative to the company’s needs, CarMax believes that its sources of used vehicles will continue to be sufficient to meet current needs and to support
planned expansion.

Suppliers for New Vehicles.

CarMax operates seven new car franchises under separate agreements with manufacturers. New car
operations are governed by the terms of the sales and service agreements with DaimlerChrysler, General Motors, Nissan, and Toyota. These agreements generally impose operating requirements and restrictions, including inventory levels, working
capital, monthly financial reporting, signage, and cooperation with marketing strategies. A manufacturer may terminate a dealer agreement under certain circumstances, including a change in ownership without prior manufacturer approval, failure to
maintain adequate customer satisfaction ratings, or a material breach of other provisions of the agreement. CarMax also has entered into framework agreements with several of the manufacturers noted above. These agreements generally contain
provisions relating to the acquisition, ownership structure, advertising, and management of a dealership franchised by those manufacturers.

Seasonality.

CarMax’s business is seasonal. Most CarMax superstores experience their strongest traffic and sales in the spring and summer fiscal quarters. Sales and gross margins are typically lowest in the fall quarter, which
coincides with the new vehicle model-year-changeover period. In the fall quarter, the new model year introductions and discounts on model year closeouts generally can cause rapid depreciation in used car pricing, particularly for late-model used
cars. Seasonal patterns for car buying and selling may vary in different parts of the country and, as CarMax expands geographically, these differences could have an effect on the overall seasonal pattern of the company’s results.

Products and Services

Merchandising.

CarMax offers its
customers a broad selection of makes and models of used vehicles, including both domestic and imported vehicles, at competitive prices. CarMax’s used car selection covers popular brands from manufacturers such as DaimlerChrysler, Ford, General
Motors, Honda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, and Toyota and luxury brands such as Acura, BMW, Infiniti, Lexus, and Mercedes. The company’s primary focus is vehicles that are 1 to 6 years old, have fewer than 60,000 miles, and generally range in price
from $11,000 to $31,000. Each vehicle must pass a comprehensive quality inspection that covers all major and minor mechanical systems and all safety functions as well as cosmetic criteria. For the more cost-conscious consumer, the company also
offers used cars that are more than 6 years old or have 60,000 miles or more and that generally range in price from $8,000 to $21,000. These older vehicles must pass a quality inspection covering the major mechanical systems and all safety
functions.

CarMax has implemented an everyday low-price strategy under which it sets no-haggle prices on both its used and new vehicles. The company
believes that its pricing is competitive with the best negotiated prices in the market. Prices on all vehicles are clearly displayed on each vehicle’s information sticker; on carmax.com, AutoTrader.com, and cars.com; and in CarMax’s
newspaper advertising. CarMax extends its no-haggle philosophy to every component of the vehicle transaction, including vehicle appraisal offers, financing rates, accessories, extended service plan pricing, and vehicle documentation fees. In
addition to selling new vehicles using the low, no-haggle price strategy, the franchise and dealer agreements generally allow CarMax to perform warranty work on these vehicles and sell related parts and services within a specified market area.
Designation of specified market areas generally does not guarantee exclusivity within a specified territory.

Reconditioning and Service.

An
integral part of CarMax’s used car consumer offer is the reconditioning process. This process includes a comprehensive, certified quality inspection of the engine and all major systems, including cooling, fuel, drivetrain, transmission,
electronics, suspension, brakes, steering, air conditioning, and other equipment, as well as the interior and exterior of the vehicle. Based on this quality inspection, CarMax determines the reconditioning necessary to bring the vehicle up to
CarMax’s high quality standards. Vehicle inspections are completed by CarMax’s service technicians. CarMax performs most routine mechanical and minor body repairs in-house; however, for some reconditioning services, CarMax engages third
parties specializing in those services. Over the past several years, CarMax has performed an increasing percentage of reconditioning services in-house, and, based on the cost savings realized, this trend is expected to continue. Satellite
superstores depend upon nearby mega or standard superstores for reconditioning, which increases efficiency and reduces overhead.



All CarMax used car locations provide vehicle repair service, including used car extended service plan repairs.
Factory-authorized service is also provided at all new car franchises. CarMax has developed systems and procedures that are intended to ensure that its retail repair service is conducted in the same customer-friendly and efficient manner as its
other operations.

CarMax believes that the efficiency of its reconditioning and service operations is enhanced by its modern facilities, a technician
mentoring process, and its compensation programs. The mentoring process and compensation programs are designed to increase the productivity of service technicians and result in reduced costs and higher-quality repairs. CarMax is able to track the
productivity of each technician through the company’s information system. The experienced technicians in each store perform the more complicated repairs with assistance from apprentices, who also perform less complex functions on their own. At
the majority of the company’s stores, compensation is based on an industry “flat rate” system, in which the individual technician’s hourly pay rate is applied to a standard, defined time unit for each repair or service performed.

Wholesale Auctions.

Vehicles purchased through CarMax’s in-store appraisal process that do not meet the company’s retail standards are
sold at on-site wholesale auctions. At February 28, 2006, wholesale auctions were conducted at 42 of the company’s 67 superstores. Auctions are generally not held at satellite superstores. Auctions are held on a weekly, bi-weekly, or
monthly basis. Auction frequency at a given superstore is determined by the number of vehicles to be auctioned, which depends on the number of CarMax stores and the market awareness of the company and its in-store appraisal offer in that market. The
typical wholesale vehicle is approximately 10 years old and has more than 100,000 miles. Participation in the company’s wholesale auctions is restricted to licensed automobile dealers, the majority of whom are independent dealers. To
participate in a CarMax auction, dealers must register with the Company’s centralized auction support group, at which time the company determines the purchase limit available to each dealer. CarMax makes conditional announcements on each
vehicle, including those for vehicles with major mechanical issues, possible frame or flood damage, branded titles and salvage history, and unknown true mileage. The auctions are conducted by professional, licensed auctioneers. These policies result
in an auction sales rate that is generally between 95% and 100%. Dealers pay a fee to the company based on the sales price of the vehicles they purchase.

Customer Credit.

CarMax provides prime-rated financing to qualified customers through CAF and Bank of America. Offering customers a third-party alternative for prime financing enhances the CarMax consumer offer and helps ensure that
CAF remains competitive. In addition, DaimlerChrysler Services, General Motors Acceptance, Nissan Motors Acceptance, and Toyota Financial Services offer prime financing to qualified customers purchasing new vehicles at applicable CarMax locations.
Nonprime financing is offered by AmeriCredit Financial Services, Capital One Auto Finance, CitiFinancial Auto, Triad Financial, and Wells Fargo Auto Finance. In selected states, subprime financing is offered by Drive Financial Services
(“Drive”). CarMax has tested and will continue to test other third-party finance companies in order to expand the choices for its customers and increase discrete approvals.

Customers applying for financing provide credit information that is electronically submitted by sales consultants through CarMax’s proprietary information system, first to CAF and Bank of America, and then, as
necessary, to its nonprime and subprime lenders. Responses from the lenders are received quickly, generally in less than five minutes from prime lenders. The vehicle financings, or loans, are retail installment contracts secured by the vehicles
financed. CarMax has no recourse liability on retail installment contracts arranged with third-party finance companies. Customers are permitted to refinance or pay off their loans within three business days of a purchase without incurring any
finance or related charges. CarMax’s arrangements with its third-party finance companies, excluding Drive, provide for payment of a fee to CarMax at the time of financing, provided the loan is not paid in full within 90 days. As is customary in
the subprime finance industry, Drive purchases the loans at a discount.

Extended Service Plan Sales.

At the time CarMax sells a vehicle, it offers
the customer an extended service plan. Currently, in all the states in which CarMax operates, it sells these plans on behalf of unrelated third parties that are the primary obligors. Under these third-party service plan programs, CarMax has no
contractual liability to the customer. The extended service plans have terms of coverage from 12 to 72 months, depending on the vehicle age and make. CarMax offers these extended service plans at low, fixed prices, which are based primarily on the
repair record of the vehicle and the length of coverage selected. All extended service plans sold by CarMax (other than manufacturers’ warranties) have been designed to CarMax specifications and are administered by the third parties through
private-label arrangements under which CarMax receives a commission from the administrator at the time the extended service plan is sold.

CarMax’s
extended service plan customers have access to the company’s vehicle repair service at each store and to the third-party administrators’ nationwide network of approximately 14,000 independent service providers. CarMax believes that the
quality of the services provided by this provider network, as well as the broad scope of its extended service plans, helps promote customer satisfaction and loyalty, and thus increases the likelihood of repeat and referral business.



Systems

CarMax’s stores are supported by an advanced information system that improves the customer experience while providing tightly integrated automation of all operating functions. Using in-store information kiosks, customers can search
each store’s vehicle inventory and print a detailed listing for any vehicle, which includes the vehicle’s features and specifications, and a map showing its specific location on the display lot. CarMax’s inventory management system
tracks every vehicle through its CarMax life from purchase through reconditioning and test drives to ultimate sale. Bar codes are placed on each vehicle and on each parking space on the display lot, and all vehicle bar codes are scanned daily as a
loss prevention measure. Test drive information is captured on every vehicle using radio frequency identification devices, linking the specific vehicle and the sales consultant. The company also captures data on vehicles it wholesales, which helps
track market pricing. An online finance application process and computer-assisted document preparation ensure rapid completion of the sales transaction. Behind the scenes, CarMax’s proprietary store technology provides its management with
real-time information about every aspect of store operations, such as inventory management, pricing, vehicle transfers, wholesale auctions, and sales consultant productivity.

The company’s advanced inventory management systems provide CarMax with the ability to anticipate future inventory needs and manage pricing. Through its centralized systems, CarMax is able to immediately
integrate new stores into its store network, allowing the new stores to rapidly achieve operating efficiency. CarMax continues to enhance and refine its information systems, which it believes to be a core competitive advantage. In addition to
inventory management, the company’s Electronic Repair Order system (“ERO”) is used by the service department to sequence reconditioning procedures. ERO has reduced cycle time, and it provides information that will help increase
quality and reduce costs, which further enhance CarMax’s customer service and profitability.

Associates

On March 31, 2006, CarMax had 9,181 hourly and salaried associates and 2,880 sales associates who worked on a commission basis. Additional CarMax associates are
employed during peak selling seasons. At March 31, 2006, CarMax’s 70 location general managers averaged more than 7 years of CarMax experience and more than 11 years of prior management experience. Management believes that the company
maintains good employee relations. No CarMax employee is subject to a collective bargaining agreement.

Training.

CarMax places special emphasis on
attracting, developing, and retaining qualified associates and believes that its favorable working conditions and compensation programs allow it to attract and retain highly qualified individuals in each market that the company enters. The company
accomplishes this partly through its commitment to provide exceptional training to its associates. Store associates receive structured, self-paced training programs that introduce them to company policies and their specific job responsibilities
through KMX University – the company’s proprietary intranet-based testing and tracking system. KMX University is comprised of customized applications hosted within a learning management system that allows the company to author, deliver,
and track training events, and to measure associate competency before and after training. Most new store associates are also assigned mentors who provide on-the-job guidance and support.

The company also provides comprehensive, facilitated classroom training courses to sales consultants, buyers, automotive technicians, and managers. All sales consultants receive extensive customer service training
both initially and on an ongoing basis. Buyers-in-training undergo a 6– to 18–month apprenticeship under the direction of experienced buyers, and buyers-in-training appraise more than one thousand cars before making their first independent
purchase. The company utilizes a mix of internal and external technical training programs in an effort to provide a stable future supply of qualified technicians. Reconditioning and mechanical technicians attend in-house training and
vendor-sponsored training programs designed to develop their skills in performing repairs on the diverse makes and models of vehicles CarMax sells. Technicians at the company’s new car franchises also attend manufacturer-sponsored training
programs to stay abreast of current diagnostic, repair, and maintenance techniques for those manufacturers’ vehicles. The management training program includes rotations through each functional area. To the greatest extent possible, CarMax opens
new stores with an experienced management team drawn from existing stores.

Laws and Regulations

Vehicle Dealer and Other Laws and Regulations.

CarMax operates in a highly regulated industry. In every state in which CarMax operates, the company must obtain
various licenses and permits in order to conduct business, including dealer, service, sales, and finance licenses issued by state and certain local regulatory authorities. A wide range of federal, state, and local laws and regulations govern the
manner in which the company conducts business, including its advertising, sales, financing, and employment practices. These laws include consumer protection laws, privacy laws, anti-money laundering laws, and state franchise laws, as well as other
laws and regulations applicable to new and used motor vehicle dealers. These laws also include federal and state wage-hour, anti-discrimination, and other employment practices laws. CarMax’s financing activities with customers are subject to

Claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law may be asserted against the company by individuals or

Environmental, Health, and Safety Laws and Regulations.

CarMax’s business involves the use, handling, and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances, including motor oil, gasoline, transmission fluid,
solvents, lubricants, and other materials. CarMax is subject to compliance with governmental and environmental regulations concerning the past and current operation and/or removal of aboveground and underground storage tanks containing these and
other substances. As a result, CarMax is subject to a variety of federal, state, and local laws and requirements that regulate the environment and public health and safety.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

CarMax is subject to various risks, including the risks described below. CarMax’s business,
operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks. Additional risks not presently known to the company or that CarMax currently deems immaterial may also impair the business and its
operations.

Economic Conditions

. In the normal course of business, CarMax is subject to changes in general or regional U.S. economic conditions,
including, but not limited to, consumer credit availability, consumer credit delinquency and default rates, interest rates, gasoline prices, inflation, personal discretionary spending levels, and consumer sentiment about the economy in general. Any
significant changes in economic conditions could adversely affect consumer demand and/or increase costs resulting in lower profitability for the company.

Competition.

Automotive retailing is a highly competitive business. CarMax’s competition includes publicly and privately owned franchised new car dealers and independent dealers, as well as millions of private individuals. The
company’s competitors may sell the same or similar makes of vehicles that CarMax offers in the same or similar markets at competitive prices. Further, new entrants to the market could result in increased wholesale costs for used vehicles and
lower-than-expected vehicle sales and margins. CAF is subject to competition from various financial institutions. Additionally, competition on vehicle sales and related financing is increasing as these products are now being marketed and sold over
the Internet. Customers are using the Internet to compare pricing for cars and related financing, which may further reduce the company’s profitability.

Retail Prices.

Any significant changes in retail prices for used and new vehicles could result in lower sales and margins for the company. If any of CarMax’s competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices for
used or new vehicles, the company would likely reduce its prices in order to remain competitive, which may result in a decrease in its sales and profitability and require a change in its operating strategies.

Inventory.

A reduction in the availability or access to sources of inventory would adversely affect the company’s business. A failure to adjust appraisal
offers to stay in line with the broader market trade-in offer trends, or a failure to recognize those trends, could negatively impact CarMax’s ability to acquire inventory. Should excess inventory develop, the inability to liquidate excess
inventory at prices that allow the company to meet its margin targets or to recover its costs would adversely affect the company’s profitability.

Management and Workforce.

CarMax’s success depends upon the continued contributions of its store, region, and corporate management teams. Consequently, the loss of the services of key employees could have a material adverse
effect on the



company’s results of operations. In addition, as CarMax opens new stores, the company will need to hire additional personnel. The market for qualified
employees in the industry and in the regions in which CarMax operates is highly competitive and may subject the company to increased labor costs during periods of low unemployment.

Information Systems.

The company’s business is dependent upon the efficient operation of its information systems. In particular, CarMax relies on its information systems to effectively manage its sales,
inventory, consumer financing, and customer information. The failure of the company’s information systems to perform as designed or the failure to maintain and continually enhance or protect the integrity of these systems could disrupt the
company’s business, impact sales and profitability, or expose the company to customer or third-party claims.

Capital.

Changes in the
availability or cost of capital and working capital financing, including the availability of long-term financing to support development of the company and the availability of securitization financing, could adversely affect the company’s growth
and operating strategies. Further, CarMax’s current credit facility and certain securitization and sale-leaseback agreements contain covenants and/or performance triggers. Any failure by the company to comply with these covenants and/or
performance triggers could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business.

Real Estate.

The inability to acquire suitable
real estate at favorable terms could limit the expansion of the company’s store base and could have a material adverse affect on the company’s future operating results.

Weather.

The occurrence of weather events, such as rain, snow, wind, storms, hurricanes, or other natural disasters, adversely affecting consumer traffic at CarMax’s auto superstores could negatively
impact the company’s operating results.

Seasonal Fluctuations.

CarMax’s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. In the
company’s experience, demand for vehicles is generally lower during the third and fourth fiscal quarters. Therefore, CarMax generally realizes a higher proportion of its revenue and operating profit during the first and second fiscal quarters.
If conditions arise that impair vehicle sales during the first or second fiscal quarters, the adverse effect on company’s revenues and operating profit for the year could be disproportionately large.

Geographic Concentration.

The company’s performance is subject to local economic, competitive, and other conditions prevailing in geographic areas where
CarMax operates. Because a large number of the company’s superstores are located in the Southeast U.S. and in the company’s Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston, Dallas, and Washington, D.C./Baltimore markets, the company’s current results
of operations depend substantially on general economic conditions and consumer spending habits in these markets. In the event that any of these geographic areas experience a downturn in economic conditions, it may adversely affect CarMax’s
business.

Regulatory Environment.

CarMax’s business is subject to a wide range of federal, state, and local laws and regulations, such
as local licensing requirements and laws regarding advertising, vehicle sales, financing, and employment practices. The company’s facilities and operations are also subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to
environmental protection and human health and safety. The violation of these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal penalties against the company, or in a cease and desist order against CarMax’s operations. As a
result, the company has incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures, and other costs in complying with these laws and regulations. Further, over the past several years, private plaintiffs and federal, state, and local
regulatory and law enforcement authorities have increased their scrutiny of advertising, sales, and finance and insurance activities in the sale and leasing of motor vehicles.

Litigation.

CarMax is subject to various litigation matters, which, if the outcomes in any significant matters are adverse, could negatively affect the company’s business. Claims arising out of actual or
alleged violations of law may be asserted against the company by individuals, either individually or through class actions, or by governmental entities in civil or criminal investigations and proceedings. Such actions may expose CarMax to adverse
publicity and to substantial monetary damages and legal defense costs, injunctive relief, and criminal and civil fines and penalties, including suspension or revocation of its licenses to conduct operations.

Accounting Changes.

The implementation of new accounting requirements or changes to generally accepted accounting principles could adversely affect the
company’s reported financial position or results of operations. Such potential changes currently under consideration by the Financial Accounting Standards Board include, but are not limited to, proposed rule changes relating to the accounting
for securitization transactions and the accounting for defined benefit pension and other postemployment benefit plans.

Other Material Events.

The
occurrence of certain material events including natural disasters, acts of terrorism, the outbreak of war, or other significant national or international events could adversely affect the company’s operating results.



Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.

None.

Item 2. Properties.

CarMax conducts its used vehicle operations in three basic retail formats – mega, standard, and
satellite superstores. The company’s current growth plan primarily includes the construction of standard superstores and satellite superstores. Standard superstores are approximately 40,000 to 60,000 square feet on 10 to 25 acres. Satellite
superstores are approximately 10,000 to 20,000 square feet on 4 to 10 acres. Mega superstores are approximately 70,000 to 95,000 square feet on 20 to 35 acres.

Stores as of March 31, 2006

(1)

The company currently operates seven new car franchises. Two franchises are integrated within used car superstores, and they
do not operate as separate stores. The remaining five franchises are operated from four new car stores that are co-located with used car superstores.

CarMax has financed the majority of its stores through sale-leaseback transactions. As of March 31, 2006, the company leased 61 of its 71 retail stores and owned
the remaining 10 stores. CarMax also owns its home office building in Richmond, Va., which opened during the third quarter of fiscal 2006. The company also owns land associated with fiscal 2007 and future year store openings.

CarMax operates 23 of its retail locations pursuant to various leases under which its former parent Circuit City was the original tenant and primary obligor. Circuit
City had originally entered into these leases so that CarMax could take advantage of the favorable economic terms available at that time to Circuit City as a large retailer. Circuit City has assigned each of these leases to CarMax. Despite the
assignment and pursuant to the terms of the leases, Circuit City remains contingently liable under the leases. In recognition of this ongoing contingent liability, CarMax made a one-time special dividend payment of $28.4 million to Circuit City on
the October 1, 2002, separation date.

Expansion

CarMax believes that it is well positioned to succeed in the highly competitive automotive retail industry. The company has built a strong foundation for future growth based upon its unique knowledge of the used car market, its established
presence in key locations, and its ability to execute its business plan in a market subject to continuous change. CarMax continues to refine its operating strategies and has grown to be the nation’s largest retailer of used cars. Specifically,
CarMax has enhanced its ability to identify profitable markets, determine the appropriate store formats to fit those markets, and effectively manage pricing and inventory mix.



During the next three fiscal years, the company plans to open superstores at an annual rate of approximately 15% to 20%
of its used car superstore base. CarMax funds its store expansion program with sources of funding that provide the most attractive economics and greatest flexibility. In fiscal 2007, the company’s expansion plans are largely focused on opening
standard superstores in new mid-sized markets and satellite superstores in existing markets. Mid-sized markets are defined as those with television viewing populations ranging from 0.6 million to 2.5 million. These markets are the most
efficient to enter from a real estate and advertising perspective and are where CarMax has generally experienced the fastest store sales ramp-up and profitability. After fiscal 2007, CarMax expects to resume store growth in new large markets.

In fiscal 2007, CarMax plans to open approximately 11 superstores, including six standard-sized superstores and five satellite superstores. One of the
satellite openings will be in Charlottesville, Va., which is a test of a smaller-format superstore that will help the company understand the longer-term opportunities in small markets. Five of the 11 planned new stores are currently scheduled to
open in the fourth quarter. Accordingly, CarMax expects little, if any, contribution to sales and profits from these five stores in fiscal 2007. In addition, normal construction, permitting, or other scheduling delays could shift the opening dates
of any of these five stores into fiscal 2008.

Fiscal 2007 Planned Store Openings

Part of the Washington, D.C. television market.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

In the normal course of business, CarMax is involved in various legal proceedings. Based upon
the company’s evaluation of information currently available, it believes that the ultimate resolution of any such proceedings will not have a material adverse effect, either individually or in the aggregate, on CarMax’s financial position,
liquidity, or results of operations.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

No matter was submitted to a vote of security holders during
the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended February 28, 2006.
