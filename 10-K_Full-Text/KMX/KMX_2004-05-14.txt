Overview of Business

CarMax, Inc. was incorporated under the
laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1996. Its corporate offices are located at 4900 Cox Road, Glen Allen, Va. CarMax, Inc. is a holding company and its operations are conducted through its subsidiaries.

CarMax began operations in 1993 under the ownership of Circuit City Stores, Inc.
(“Circuit City”) when it opened its first location in Richmond, Va. In fiscal 1997, Circuit City created two common stock series, Circuit City Stores, Inc.–Circuit City Group common stock and Circuit City Stores, Inc.–CarMax
Group (“CarMax Group”) common stock. On February 7, 1997, Circuit City completed an initial public offering of CarMax Group common stock, which was intended to track separately the performance of the CarMax operations. On October 1, 2002,
the CarMax business was separated from Circuit City through a tax-free transaction in which each share of CarMax Group common stock was exchanged for one share of CarMax, Inc. common stock. In addition, each holder of Circuit City Group common stock
received a distribution of a 0.313879 share of CarMax, Inc. common stock for each Circuit City Group share. As a result of the separation, all of the businesses, assets, and liabilities of the CarMax Group are held in CarMax, Inc., an independent,
separately traded public company.

CarMax is the nation’s largest
specialty retailer of used cars and light trucks. The company purchases, reconditions, and sells used vehicles. CarMax opened a total of 33 used car superstores through fiscal 2000 before slowing its geographic growth to concentrate on improving
operations and profitability. Geographic growth was resumed at the end of fiscal 2002, and through the end of fiscal 2004 an additional 16 used car superstores were opened. The company also sells new vehicles under various franchise agreements. As
planned, CarMax’s new car sales have become a smaller part of its business mix as it has divested nine new car franchises over the past three fiscal years while aggressively growing its used car business. In fiscal 2004, used vehicles
represented 91% of the total vehicle units sold by CarMax.

CarMax provides its
customers the opportunity to shop for vehicles the same way they shop for items at other “big-box” retailers by offering a broad selection of great quality vehicles at low, no-haggle prices in a customer-friendly atmosphere. The company
has separated the practice of trading in a used vehicle in conjunction with the purchase of another vehicle into two distinct and independent transactions. CarMax provides an appraisal that allows current vehicle owners to sell their cars to CarMax
regardless of their intent to purchase a vehicle from the company. CarMax also provides its customers with a full range of related services, including the financing of vehicle purchases through CarMax Auto Finance (“CAF”) and third-party
lenders, the sale of extended warranties, accessories, and vehicle repair service. CAF is the company’s own finance operation that offers financing to prime-rated customers.



The CarMax process is designed to enable customers to evaluate separately each step of the sales process a la carte and
to make informed decisions at each step based on comprehensive information about their options and the associated prices. The customer can take or leave any aspect of the offer without affecting the offer on the other steps in the sales process.
CarMax’s no-haggle pricing and its fixed-dollar-per-unit commission structure allows its sales consultants to focus solely on meeting customer needs.

Industry and Competition.

With calendar year 2003 sales of approximately $366 billion, used vehicles make up nearly half of the U.S. auto retail market, the
largest retail segment of the economy. In calendar 2003, there were an estimated 43.6 million used vehicles sold compared with 16.7 million new vehicles. CarMax’s primary market, late-model vehicles that are 1 to 6 years old, is estimated at
approximately $265 billion in annual sales and 20 million units per year.

Automotive retailing is highly competitive. Consumers typically have many choices when deciding where to purchase a used or new vehicle. In both the used and new vehicle markets, CarMax seeks to distinguish itself from traditional
dealerships through its consumer offer, sales approach, and other innovative operating strategies. The company’s primary competitors are the nation’s approximately 21,700 franchised new car dealers, which sell the majority of late-model
used vehicles. CarMax also competes with independent dealers, rental companies, and private parties.

The company believes that its principal competitive factors in used vehicle retailing are price; breadth of selection, including the more popular makes and models; quality of the vehicles; location of retail sites;
and degree of customer satisfaction with the car-buying experience. Customer satisfaction is driven by CarMax’s customer-friendly sales process, the quality of the used cars sold, and the services the company provides. CarMax’s Certified
Quality Inspection assures that every vehicle offered for sale at CarMax meets rigorous mechanical, electrical, and safety standards. Upon request by the customer, CarMax will transfer any used vehicle in the company’s nationwide inventory to a
local superstore. Transfers are free within a market; long distance transfers include a charge to cover transportation costs. CarMax backs every vehicle with a 5-day, 250-mile, no-questions-asked, money-back guarantee, and a 30-day comprehensive
warranty. Other competitive factors include the ability to offer or arrange customer financing on competitive terms and the comprehensiveness and cost of extended warranties. CarMax believes that it is competitive in all of these areas and that it
enjoys advantages over competitors that employ traditional selling methods.

CarMax’s sales consultants play a significant role in ensuring a customer-friendly sales process. A sales consultant is paid the same fixed-dollar-per-unit commission on any vehicle sold, so the sales consultant’s only objective
is helping customers find the right car for their needs at a price they can afford. In contrast, sales and finance personnel at traditional dealerships often receive higher commissions for negotiating higher prices and for steering customers toward
vehicles with higher gross margins.

In the new vehicle market, CarMax competes
with other franchised dealers offering vehicles produced by the same or other manufacturers and with auto brokers and leasing companies. Historically the new vehicle market has been served primarily by dealerships employing traditional
high-pressure, negotiation-oriented sales techniques. The company believes its customer-friendly, low-pressure sales methods are points of competitive differentiation.

Marketing and Advertising.

CarMax’s marketing strategies are focused on developing awareness of the advantages of shopping at
its stores, attracting customers who are already in the market to buy or sell a vehicle, and targeting specific segments of the market through special promotions. The company uses market awareness and customer satisfaction surveys to help tailor its
marketing efforts to the purchasing habits and preferences of customers in each market area. CarMax’s marketing strategies are implemented primarily through newspaper, television, and radio advertising, and its Web site, www.carmax.com.
Television and radio broadcast advertisements are designed to enhance consumer awareness of the CarMax name, carmax.com, and key components of the CarMax offer. Newspaper advertisements promote CarMax’s broad selection of vehicles and price
leadership, targeting consumers with immediate purchase intentions. Both broadcast and newspaper advertisements are designed to drive customers to its stores and to the CarMax Web site.

The third major marketing tool for CarMax is its Web site, carmax.com, which is a marketing tool for communicating its consumer offer in
detail, a sophisticated search engine for finding the right vehicle, and a sales channel for customers who prefer to complete a part of the shopping and sales process online. The CarMax Web site offers complete inventory and pricing search
capabilities. Information on the more than 20,000 cars available in the CarMax nationwide inventory is updated daily. Carmax.com includes detailed information, such as pictures of each vehicle, prices, features, specifications, and store locations,
as well as sorting and comparison features that allow consumers to easily compare vehicles. The site also includes features such as detailed vehicle reviews, payment calculators, and an option to estimate trade-in values via a link with Kelley Blue
Book. CarMax believes these features make it easier for consumers to meet all of their auto research needs on carmax.com. Both used car and new car customers can contact sales consultants online via carmax.com, by telephone, or by fax. Customers can
work with these sales consultants from the comfort of home, including applying for financing, and only need to visit the store to sign the paperwork and pick up their vehicle.



CarMax also targets specific segments of the used vehicle market through special promotions. Such promotions may focus on
a particular type of vehicle (e.g., “Minivan Month”) or a particular price point (e.g., $9,999 or less) for a large number of vehicles. CarMax’s marketing staff closely coordinates with the purchasing departments at the locations
conducting the promotions to ensure that appropriate quantities of targeted inventory are purchased and displayed, thus maximizing the benefits of the promotion.

Suppliers for Used Vehicles.

CarMax acquires its used vehicle inventory directly from customers through its unique appraisal process
and through other sources, including local and regional auctions, wholesalers, franchised and independent dealers, and fleet owners, such as leasing companies and rental companies. CarMax believes that the appraisal offer process enables it to
access the private market as a significant additional source for used vehicle inventory. Many vehicles purchased directly from consumers are among the highest quality used vehicles available in the market because they have been well maintained by
their owners. In stores open for more than 1 year, CarMax generally acquires a larger portion of its used vehicle inventory from customers than from any other source. This buying strategy helps provide an inventory of makes and models that reflects
the tastes of the market.

CarMax has replaced the traditional
“trade-in” transaction with a process in which CarMax-trained buyers appraise any vehicle and provide the vehicle’s owner with a written, guaranteed cash offer that is good for 7 days or 300 miles, whichever is first. An appraisal is
available to everyone free of charge, whether or not the individual purchases a vehicle from CarMax. The CarMax sales process is different from that of traditional dealers who usually combine the vehicle purchase and trade-in transactions, as well
as the financing, the sale of extended warranties, and other add-ons. The CarMax sales process allows the customer to separately evaluate and make an informed decision on each individual component of the sales transaction. Because CarMax’s
operating strategy is to build customer confidence and satisfaction by offering only high quality vehicles, fewer than half of the vehicles acquired through the appraisal process meet the company’s retail standards. Those vehicles that do not
meet the retail standards are sold at the company’s on-site wholesale auctions.

The CarMax buyers evaluate all used vehicles on the basis of their wholesale value and reconditioning costs, and, for off-site purchases, cost of delivery to the store where they will be reconditioned. The inventory purchasing function is
primarily performed at the store level and is the responsibility of the buyers. To decide which inventory to purchase, CarMax’s buyers, in collaboration with its headquarters staff, rely on the extensive inventory and sales trend data available
through the CarMax information system.

Based on consumer acceptance of the
appraisal process at existing CarMax stores and CarMax’s experience and success to date in acquiring vehicles from auctions and other sources, CarMax believes that its sources of used vehicles will continue to be sufficient to meet current
needs and to support planned expansion.

Suppliers for New Vehicles.

CarMax operates new car dealerships under separate franchise or dealer agreements with manufacturers. New car operations for the franchise locations is governed by the terms of the sales and service agreements with DaimlerChrysler, Ford, General
Motors, Mitsubishi, Nissan, and Toyota. These agreements generally impose operating requirements and restrictions, including inventory levels, working capital, monthly financial reporting, signage, and cooperation with marketing strategies. A
manufacturer may terminate a dealer agreement under certain circumstances, including a change in ownership without prior manufacturer approval, failure to maintain adequate customer satisfaction ratings, or a material breach of other provisions of
the agreement. CarMax also has entered into framework agreements with several major vehicle manufacturers. These agreements generally contain provisions relating to the acquisition, ownership structure, advertising, and management of a dealership
franchised by those manufacturers.

Seasonality.

CarMax’s business
is seasonal. Most CarMax superstores experience their strongest traffic and sales in the spring and summer fiscal quarters. Sales and gross margins are typically lowest in the fall quarter, which is the new vehicle model-year-changeover period. In
the fall quarter, the new model year introductions and discounting on model year closeouts can cause rapid depreciation in used car pricing, particularly for late-model used cars. Seasonal patterns for car buying and selling may vary in different
parts of the country, and as CarMax expands geographically, these differences could have an effect on the overall seasonal pattern of the company’s results.

Products and Services

Merchandising.

CarMax offers its customers a broad selection of makes and models of used vehicles, including both domestic and imported cars and light trucks, at
competitive prices. CarMax’s used car selection covers popular brands from manufacturers such as DaimlerChrysler, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, and Toyota and luxury brands such as BMW and Lexus. The company’s primary
focus is vehicles that are generally less than six years old, have fewer than 60,000 miles, and generally range in price from $9,500 to $29,000. Each vehicle must pass a comprehensive quality inspection that covers all major and minor mechanical
systems and all safety functions as well as cosmetic criteria. For the more cost conscious consumer, the company also offers used cars, branded “ValuMax,” that are more than six years old or have 60,000 miles or more and that



generally range in price from $6,500 to $19,000. These older vehicles must pass a quality inspection covering the major
mechanical systems and all safety functions, and concentration is placed on providing good, basic, mechanically sound transportation. In some instances, cosmetic corrections may not be made to these older “ValuMax” cars.

CarMax has implemented an everyday low-price strategy under which it sets
“no-haggle” prices on its used and new vehicles. The company believes that its pricing is competitive with the best negotiated prices in the market. Prices on all vehicles are clearly displayed on each vehicle’s information sticker,
on carmax.com, and in CarMax’s newspaper advertising. CarMax extends its no-haggle philosophy to every stage of the vehicle transaction, including trade-ins, financing rates, accessories, extended warranty pricing, and vehicle documentation
fees. In addition to selling new vehicles using the “no-haggle” low price strategy, the franchise and dealer agreements generally allow CarMax to sell manufacturers’ brands, perform warranty work on these vehicles, and sell related
parts and services within a specified market area. Designation of specified market areas generally does not guarantee exclusivity within a specified territory.

An integral part of CarMax’s used car consumer offer is the reconditioning process. This process includes a comprehensive, certified quality inspection of the
engine, cooling and fuel systems, drive axle, transmission, electronic systems, suspension, brake system, steering, air conditioning, interior, and optional equipment. Based on this quality inspection, CarMax determines the reconditioning necessary
to bring the vehicle up to CarMax’s high quality standards. Vehicle inspections are completed by CarMax’s mechanics. CarMax performs most routine mechanical and minor body repairs in-house; however, for some reconditioning services, CarMax
engages third parties specializing in those services. Over the past several years, CarMax has performed an increasing percentage of reconditioning services in-house, and, based on the cost savings realized, that trend is expected to continue.

Service.

All CarMax used car locations provide vehicle repair service,
including used car extended warranty service. Factory-authorized service is also provided at all new car franchises. CarMax has developed systems and procedures that are intended to ensure that its retail repair service operations are conducted in
the same customer-friendly and efficient manner as its other operations.

CarMax believes that the efficiency of its service and reconditioning operations are enhanced by its modern facilities, a technician mentoring process, and its compensation programs. The mentoring process and compensation programs are
designed to increase the productivity of service technicians and result in reduced costs and higher-quality repairs and reconditioning. The experienced technicians in each store perform the more complicated repairs with assistance from apprentices,
who also perform simpler functions on their own. Each technician receives a flat rate for each repair or service performed. CarMax is able to track the productivity of each technician through the company’s information system.

Customer Credit.

CarMax offers financing for prime-rated customers through its own
finance operation, CarMax Auto Finance, and through Bank of America. In some cases where the used vehicle is a certified used vehicle, the manufacturer may also provide prime-rated customers an offer. Offering customers a third-party alternative for
prime loans enhances the CarMax consumer offer and helps to ensure that CAF remains competitive. CAF also reduces the sales risk associated with changes in third-party credit availability. In addition, Chrysler Financial, Ford Motor Credit, General
Motors Acceptance, Mitsubishi Motors Credit, Nissan Motors Acceptance, and Toyota Financial Services offer prime financing to customers purchasing new vehicles at applicable CarMax locations. Financing for non-prime rated customers is offered by
TransSouth Financial, Wells Fargo Financial Acceptance, and AmeriCredit Financial Services, with no financial recourse to CarMax. In addition, CarMax has tested and will continue to test other third-party lenders in order to expand the choices for
its customers and increase discrete approvals. Sales consultants use CarMax’s proprietary information system to electronically submit financing applications and receive responses, often from multiple lenders, generally in less than five minutes
from prime lenders. Financings are installment sale contracts secured by the vehicles financed. Customers are permitted to refinance their loans within three business days of a purchase without incurring any finance or related charges. Generally
CarMax’s arrangements with its third-party lenders provide for payment of a fee to CarMax at the time of financing, provided the loan is not refinanced within 90 days. CarMax has no recourse liability on used car loans arranged with third-party
lenders.

Extended Warranty Sales.

At the time CarMax sells a vehicle,
it offers the customer an extended warranty. Currently, in all the states in which CarMax operates, it sells warranties on behalf of unrelated third parties who are the primary obligors. Under these third-party warranty programs, CarMax has no
contractual liability. Contracts usually have terms of coverage between 12 and 72 months. CarMax offers these extended warranties at low, fixed prices. All extended warranties sold by CarMax (other than manufacturers’ warranties) have been
designed to CarMax specifications and are administered by a third party, through a private-label arrangement under which CarMax receives a fee from the administrator at the time the extended warranty is sold.



All CarMax locations provide vehicle repair service including extended warranty service. CarMax’s extended warranty
customers also have access to the third-party administrator’s nationwide network of approximately 14,000 independent service providers. CarMax believes that the quality of the services provided by this provider network, as well as the broad
scope of its extended warranties, helps promote customer satisfaction and loyalty, and thus increases the likelihood of repeat and referral business.

Systems

CarMax’s stores are supported by an advanced information system that improves the customer experience while providing tightly integrated automation of all operating functions. Customers can select a range of
vehicles using information kiosks that display their choices and provide a map showing customers where their selections are parked on the display lot. CarMax’s inventory management system includes bar codes on each vehicle and each on-site
parking place. Daily scanning of bar codes tracks the movement of vehicles on the lot. An electronic gate on the lot and a radio frequency transmitter on each vehicle helps track test-drives for vehicles and sales consultants. Online financing and
computer-assisted document preparation ensures rapid completion of the sales transaction. Behind the scenes, CarMax’s proprietary store technology provides its management with real-time information about every aspect of store operations, such
as inventory management, pricing, vehicle transfers, wholesale auctions, and sales consultant productivity.

Advanced information systems, which are a key to CarMax’s successful inventory management, provide CarMax stores with the ability to anticipate future inventory needs and manage pricing. Through this centralized
system, CarMax is able to immediately integrate new stores into its store network, allowing the new stores to rapidly achieve operating efficiency. CarMax continues to enhance and refine its information systems, which it believes to be a core
competitive advantage.

In addition to inventory management, the company
developed the Electronic Repair Order system (“ERO”), which is used by the service department. This system drives the sequencing of reconditioning procedures. ERO reduces cycle time, provides information that will help increase quality,
and reduces costs, which further enhance our customer service and profitability.

Associates

On March 31, 2004, CarMax had 7,269 hourly and
salaried associates and 2,453 sales associates who worked on a commission basis. No CarMax employee is subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Additional CarMax associates are employed during peak selling seasons. At March 31, 2004,
CarMax’s 52 location general managers averaged 6 years of CarMax experience and more than 11 years of prior management experience.

Training.

CarMax places special emphasis on attracting, developing, and retaining qualified associates and believes that its favorable working conditions and
compensation programs allow it to attract and retain highly qualified individuals in each market the company enters. The company accomplishes this through its commitment to provide exceptional training to its associates. Associates receive
structured, self-paced training programs that introduce them to company policies and their specific job responsibilities through an intranet-based testing and tracking system. Most new associates are assigned mentors who provide on-the-job guidance
and support. The company uses a system of off-the-shelf products in conjunction with a learning management system to author, deliver, and track training events, and to measure learner competency before and after training. The company also provides
comprehensive, facilitated classroom training courses to sales consultants, buyers, automotive technicians, and managers. All sales consultants receive extensive customer service training both initially and on an ongoing basis. Buyers-in-training
(“BIT”) undergo a 12– to 24–month apprenticeship under the tutelage of experienced buyers and each BIT appraises more than a thousand cars before making his or her first independent purchase. The company also has implemented an
apprentice training program in an effort to provide a stable future supply of qualified technicians. All technicians attend in-house training programs designed to develop their skills in performing routine repair services on the diverse makes and
models of vehicles CarMax sells. Technicians at our new car franchises also attend manufacturer-sponsored training programs to stay abreast of current diagnostic, repair, and maintenance techniques for those manufacturers’ vehicles. The
management training program includes rotations through each functional area. CarMax opens new stores with an experienced management team drawn from existing stores to the greatest extent possible.

Governmental and Environmental Regulations

CarMax is subject to a wide range of federal, state, and local laws and regulations. These
laws regulate, among other things, the manner in which CarMax conducts business, including advertising, sales, consumer lending practices, local licensing requirements, consumer protection laws, and relationships between automotive dealerships and
vehicle manufacturers. State and federal regulatory agencies, such as departments of motor vehicles, OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration), the EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission), and the EPA (Environmental Protection
Agency), have jurisdiction over the operation of the CarMax stores. CarMax’s business also involves the use, handling, and disposal of hazardous or toxic



substances, including motor oil, gasoline, transmission fluid, solvents, lubricants, and other materials. CarMax is
subject to compliance with governmental and environmental regulations concerning the past and current operation and/or removal of aboveground and underground storage tanks containing these substances. CarMax believes that it does not have any
material governmental or environmental liabilities and that compliance with such laws and regulations will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition.

Item 2. Properties

Store Formats

CarMax conducts its used vehicle operations in three basic retail formats
– mega, standard, and satellite superstores. However, our current growth plan calls for only the construction of standard superstores and satellite superstores. Existing standard superstores are approximately 40,000 to 60,000 square feet on 10
to 25 acres. Existing satellite superstores are approximately 10,000 to 20,000 square feet on 4 to 7 acres. Existing mega superstores are approximately 70,000 to 95,000 square feet on 20 to 35 acres.

As of March 31, 2004, CarMax’s operations were conducted in 53 retail stores. The
following table summarizes the company’s retail stores by format and location as of March 31, 2004:

(1)

Currently the company has three new car franchises that each operate in a separate retail
location that are co-located with a used car superstore. The remaining nine new car franchises are integrated into a used car superstore location.

CarMax has financed the majority of its stores through sale-leaseback transactions, which are typically executed within 6 to 12 months of
the store opening date. As of March 31, 2004, the company leased 48 of its 53 retail stores. The remaining five owned stores included newly opened stores in Glencoe, Ill. (Chicago); Los Angeles, Calif.; Las Vegas, Nev.; Louisville, KY.; and
Indianapolis, Ind. The company also owns land associated with future year store openings. Additionally, in fiscal 2004, CarMax purchased land for its future corporate office building near Richmond, Va. Currently, CarMax leases its corporate offices,
which are located near the site of the first CarMax retail store in Richmond.

CarMax operates 23 of its sales locations pursuant to various leases under which its former parent Circuit City was the original tenant and primary obligor. Circuit City had originally entered into these leases so that CarMax could take
advantage of the favorable economic terms available to Circuit City as a large retailer. Circuit City has assigned each of these leases to CarMax. Despite the assignment and pursuant to the terms of the leases, Circuit City remains contingently
liable under the leases. In recognition of this ongoing contingent liability, CarMax made a one-time special dividend payment of $28.4 million to Circuit City on the October 1, 2002, separation date.



Expansion

CarMax has established a strong foundation for future growth based upon its unique knowledge of the used car market, its established presence in key locations, and its
ability to execute its business plan in a market subject to continuous change. CarMax continues to refine its operating strategies and has emerged as the nation’s leading specialty retailer of used cars and light trucks in the United States.
CarMax believes that it is well positioned to succeed in the highly competitive automotive retail industry. Specifically, CarMax has enhanced its ability to identify profitable markets, determine the appropriate store formats to fit those markets,
and effectively manage pricing and inventory mix.

During the next three fiscal
years, the company plans to open superstores at an annual rate of approximately 15% to 20% of its used car superstore base. CarMax plans to open 10 used car superstores in fiscal 2005, including five standard superstores and five satellite
superstores. The company will enter four new mid-sized markets in fiscal 2005, including Indianapolis, Ind. (opened in March 2004); Columbia, S.C. (opened in April 2004); Austin, Tex.; and Albuquerque, N. Mex. Satellite superstore additions are
planned for Winston-Salem, N.C.; Fayetteville, N.C.; Pompano Beach (Miami market), Fla.; and Richmond, Va. CarMax also plans to add a standard superstore and a satellite superstore in the Los Angeles market on sites that were land-banked when the
company suspended growth in fiscal 2000.

CarMax expects mid-sized markets to
provide much of its future growth in the next few years. CarMax has defined “mid-sized market” as a market with a television-viewing population of approximately 1 million to 2.5 million people. As of March 31, 2004, CarMax was present in
16 mid-sized markets. CarMax believes that more than 30 additional mid-sized markets may be suitable for its standard superstore format. CarMax believes that focusing on mid-sized markets enhances its sales growth and profitability. Compared with
large, multi-store markets, site selection and real estate acquisition typically are more straightforward in mid-sized markets. Establishing consumer awareness also is more efficient in a mid-sized market because all forms of media can be used
economically to achieve broad consumer reach. As a result, CarMax’s stores in mid-sized markets have proven to be the company’s most profitable markets.

In addition to entering new mid-sized markets, CarMax plans to add satellite superstores in underserved trade areas in its existing
multi-store markets, which include Washington/Baltimore, Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, Miami, Los Angeles, and Tampa. CarMax has identified approximately 15 to 20 underserved trade areas to target in these markets. The company also is testing
the addition of satellite superstores in mid-sized markets to increase penetration and market share. CarMax is focusing on the addition of satellite superstores in existing markets because satellite superstores leverage existing facilities and
management in those markets. Satellite superstores present the same consumer offer, including size of inventory, on one-half to one-third the acreage of a standard superstore, and satellite superstores generally require little or no incremental
advertising.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

In the normal course of
business, CarMax is involved in various legal proceedings. Based upon the company’s evaluation of information currently available, it believes that the ultimate resolution of any such proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on
CarMax’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

No matter was submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended February 29, 2004.



Executive Officers of the Company
