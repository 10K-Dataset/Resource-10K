ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Our
Business

Roper Industries, Inc.
(“Roper” or the “Company”) was incorporated on December 17, 1981 under
the laws of the State of Delaware. We are a diversified industrial company that designs,
manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls, scientific and industrial
imaging products and software, industrial technology products, instrumentation products
and services and radio frequency (RF) products and services. We market these products and
services to selected segments of a broad range of markets including radio frequency
applications, water, energy, research and medical, and other niche markets.

We pursue consistent and sustainable
growth in sales and earnings by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating
performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected
businesses that offer high value-added, engineered products and solutions and are capable
of achieving growth and maintaining high margins. We compete in many niche markets and
believe that we are the market leader or a competitive alternative to the market leader in
the majority of these markets.

We continued our growth in 2005 from
internal growth and the full-year contributions from the acquisition of the Power
Generation business of R/D Tech on June 7, 2004 and TransCore Holdings, Inc.
(“TransCore”) on December 13, 2004. In 2005, we acquired Inovonics Corporation
(“Inovonics”) on February 25, 2005, CIVCO Holding, Inc. (“CIVCO”) on
June 17, 2005 and MEDTEC, Inc. (“MEDTEC”) on November 30, 2005, all of which
were purchased for cash and financed through borrowings under our credit agreement and
cash generated from operations.

The Company makes available free of
charge on our website (

www.roperind.com

), our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly
reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed
or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), as soon as reasonably practicable after we
electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”). These filings are also accessible on the SEC’s website
at http://www.sec.gov.

The annual certification of
Roper’s Chief Executive Officer required to be furnished to the New York Stock
Exchange pursuant to Section 303A.12(a) of the NYSE Listed Company Manual was previously
filed with the New York Stock Exchange on June 17, 2005.

Market
Share, Market Expansion, and Product Development

Leadership with Engineered Content
for Niche Markets.

We have developed and maintained a leading position in many of our
markets. We believe our market positions are attributable to the technical sophistication
of our products, the applications expertise used to create our advanced products and
systems, and our distribution and service capabilities. Our operating units grow their
businesses through new product development and development of new applications and
services for existing products to satisfy customer needs. In addition, our operating units
continue to grow our customer base by expanding our distribution, selling other products
through our existing channels and entering adjacent markets.

Diversified End Markets and
Geographic Reach.

Over the past decade, we have strategically expanded the number of
end markets we serve to increase revenue and business stability and expand our
opportunities for growth. During that same period, we grew our global presence to the
degree that our sales of products manufactured and exported from the U.S. and manufactured
abroad and sold to customers outside the U.S. accounted for $545 million for 2005, up from
$459 million in 2004

.

Information regarding our international operations is set
forth in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in
this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”).

Research and Development.

We
conduct applied research and development to improve the quality and performance of our
products and to develop new technologies and products to enter new markets. Our research
and development spending increased to $53.5 million in 2005 as compared to $38.7 million
in 2004 and $32.6 million in 2003. The increase in 2005 was expected with the December
2004 acquisition of TransCore. We expect the amount spent on research and development
activities to continue to rise in 2006 as a result of the acquisitions of Inovonics, CIVCO
and MEDTEC during 2005.

Our Business Segments

Our operations are reported in five
market-focused segments around common customers, markets, sales channels, technologies and
common cost opportunities. The segments are: Instrumentation, Industrial Technology,

          an immediate basis. Application-specific products typically ship within 6 to 12
          weeks following receipt of order. However, larger project orders and blanket
          purchase orders for certain original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, may
          extend shipment for longer periods. This segment’s backlog of firm unfilled
          orders, including blanket purchase orders, totaled $58.5 million at December 31,
          2005, as compared to $50.0 million at December 31, 2004.

RF
Technology

Our acquisition of TransCore on
December 13, 2004 established our newest segment, RF Technology. We added to this segment
early in 2005 with the acquisition of Inovonics Corporation. Both of these entities are
U.S. based. This segment provides radio frequency identification (RFID) and
satellite-based communication technologies that are used primarily in comprehensive toll
and traffic systems and processing, security and access control, mobile asset tracking and
water sub-metering and remote temperature monitoring applications. This segment had sales
of $396.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, representing 27.3% of our total

          project awards. Standard products typically ship within two weeks of receipt of
          order. This segment’s backlog of firm unfilled orders totaled $200.2
          million at December 31, 2005 compared to $183.7 million at December 31, 2004.

Distribution and Sales.

Distribution and sales occur through direct sales personnel, manufacturers’
representatives and distributors.

Customers.

No customer was responsible for as
much as 10% of this segment’s net sales for 2005.

Materials and Suppliers

We believe that most materials and
supplies used by us are readily available from numerous sources and suppliers throughout
the world. However, some of our components and sub-assemblies are currently available from
a limited number of suppliers. Some high-performance components for digital imaging
products can be in short supply and/or suppliers have occasional difficulty manufacturing
such components to our specifications. We regularly investigate and identify alternative
sources where possible, and we believe that these conditions equally affect our
competitors. Thus far, supply shortages have not had a significant adverse effect on
Roper’s sales although delays in shipments have occurred following such supply
interruptions.

Environmental Matters
and Other Governmental Regulation

Our operations and properties are
subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including laws and
regulations governing air emissions, water discharges, waste management and workplace
safety. We use, generate and dispose of hazardous substances and waste in our operations
and, as a result, could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the
investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal
injury. We are required continually to conform our operations and properties to these laws
and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change. We
have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, modest costs relating to our
compliance with environmental laws and regulations. In connection with our acquisitions,
we may assume significant environmental liabilities, some of which we may not be aware of,
or may not be quantifiable, at the time of acquisition. In addition, new laws and
regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of
previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could
increase our environmental compliance costs or subject us to new or increased liabilities.

Competition

Generally, our products and solutions
face significant competition, usually from a limited number of competitors. We believe
that we are a leader in most of our markets, and no single company competes with us over a
significant number of product lines. Competitors might be large or small in size, often
depending on the life cycle and maturity of the technology employed. We compete primarily
on product quality, performance, innovation, technology, price, applications expertise,
distribution channel access and customer service capabilities.

Patents and Trademarks

In addition to trade secrets,
unpatented know-how, and other intellectual property rights, we own the rights under a
number of patents, trademarks and copyrights relating to certain of our products and
businesses. We also employ various methods, including confidentiality and non-disclosure
agreements with employees, to protect our trade secrets and know-how. While we believe
that none of our operating units are substantially dependent on any single patent,
trademark, copyright, or other item of intellectual property or group of patents,
trademarks or copyrights, the product development and market activities of Compressor
Controls, Neptune Technology, TransCore and our imaging businesses, in particular, have
been planned and conducted in conjunction with continuing patent strategies. While we have
not significantly licensed patents, trademarks, trade secrets and similar proprietary
rights to and from third parties in the past, we may do so in the future.

Employees

As of December 31, 2005, we had
approximately 6,000 total employees, of whom approximately 4,450 were located in the
United States. Approximately 210 of our employees are subject to collective bargaining
agreements. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our
employees to be good.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Risks Relating to Our
Business

Our indebtedness may
affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility.

As of December 31, 2005, we had
approximately $894 million in total consolidated indebtedness. In addition, we had
approximately $315 million undrawn availability under our senior secured credit
facility. Our total consolidated debt could increase using this additional borrowing
capacity. Subject to certain restrictions contained in our senior secured credit
facility and other debt agreements, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future,
including indebtedness incurred to finance, or which is assumed in connection with,
acquisitions.

Our level of indebtedness and the
debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our
operations and business strategy. For example, our indebtedness could:

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industries in which we compete;

place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors, some of which have lower debt
service obligations and greater financial resources than us;

limit our ability to borrow additional funds;

limit our ability to complete future acquisitions;

limit our ability to pay dividends;

limit our ability to make capital expenditures; and

increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions.

Our ability to make scheduled
payments of principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness and to
satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance,
which may be affected by factors beyond our control. In addition, there can be no
assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable
terms for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. If we are unable to service our
indebtedness, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be
materially adversely affected.

In addition, our  senior secured
credit facility contains financial covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and
operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to
meet the financial covenants or requirements in our  senior secured credit facility may
be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants
and requirements. A breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the
financial ratios, tests or other restrictions contained in our  senior secured credit
facility could result in an event of default under this facility, which in turn could
result in an event of default under the terms of our other indebtedness. Upon the
occurrence of an event of default under our  senior secured credit facility, and the
expiration of any grace periods, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts
outstanding under the facility, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and
payable. If this were to occur, our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the
amounts due under this facility or our other indebtedness.

Unfavorable changes in
foreign exchange rates may significantly harm our business.

Several of our operating companies
have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most
of these transactions and balances are denominated in euros, Canadian dollars, British
pounds, Danish krone and Japanese yen. Sales by our operating companies whose functional
currency is not the U.S. dollar represented approximately 25% of our total net sales for
the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 31% for the year ended December 31, 2004.
Unfavorable changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and those currencies could
significantly reduce our reported sales and earnings. At present, we do not hedge against
foreign currency risks.

We export a significant portion
of our products. Difficulties associated with the export of our products could harm our
business.

Sales to customers outside the U.S.
by our businesses located in the U.S. account for a significant portion of our net sales.
These sales accounted for approximately 16% and 19% of our net sales for the years ended
December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively. We are subject to risks that could
limit our ability to export our products or otherwise reduce the demand for these products
in our foreign markets. Such risks include, without limitation, the following:

unfavorable changes in or noncompliance with U.S. and other jurisdictions' export requirements;

restrictions on the export of technology and related products;

unfavorable changes in or noncompliance with U.S. and other jurisdictions' export policies to certain countries;

unfavorable changes in the import policies of our foreign markets; and

a general economic downturn in our foreign markets.

The occurrence of any of these
events could reduce the foreign demand for our products or could limit our ability to
export our products and, therefore, could materially negatively affect our future sales
and earnings.

Economic, political and
other risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our
business.

As of December 31, 2005,
approximately 16% of our long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and intangibles were
attributable to operations outside the U.S. We expect our international operations to
continue to contribute materially to our business for the foreseeable future. Our
international operations are subject to varying degrees of risk inherent in doing business
outside the U.S. including, without limitation, the following:

adverse changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions, particularly in emerging
markets;

trade protection measures and import or export requirements;

trade liberalization measures which could expose our international operations to increased
competition;

subsidies or increased access to capital for firms who are currently, or may emerge, as competitors in countries in which we have operations;

partial or total expropriation;

potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws;

difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;

differing labor regulations;

differing protection of intellectual property;

unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;

longer payment cycles of foreign
customers and difficulty in collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions; and

international sentiment towards the U.S.

The occurrence of any of these events
could materially harm our business.

Our growth strategy
includes acquisitions. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates,
complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully.

Our historical growth has depended,
and our future growth is likely to continue to depend, to some degree on our
ability to make acquisitions and to successfully integrate acquired businesses. We intend
to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets
and to enhance our position in existing markets globally. There are no assurances, however,
that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate
acquisition terms, obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms, complete proposed
acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or
expand into new markets. Once integrated, acquired operations may not achieve levels of
revenues, profitability or productivity comparable with those achieved by our existing
operations, or otherwise perform as expected.

Acquisitions involve numerous risks,
including difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, services and
products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management’s attention from
other business concerns. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks
inherent in any particular transaction, there are no assurances that we will properly
ascertain all such risks. In addition, prior acquisitions have resulted, and future
acquisitions could result, in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and
other expenses. Future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of
equity securities. We cannot assure you that difficulties encountered with acquisitions
will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations.

Product liability,
insurance risks and increased insurance costs could harm our operating results.

Our business exposes us to potential
product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacturing and distribution of
our products. In addition, certain of our products are used in potentially hazardous
environments. We currently have product liability insurance; however, we may not be able
to maintain our insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us
against potential losses. We also maintain other insurance policies, including directors
and officers’ liability insurance. Our insurance costs increased in recent periods
and may continue to increase in the future. We believe that we have adequately accrued
estimated losses, principally related to deductible amounts under our insurance policies,
with respect to all product liability and other claims, based upon our past experience and
available facts. However, a successful product liability or other claim or series of
claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations. In addition, a significant increase in our insurance
costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results.

Our operating results
could be adversely affected by a reduction of business with our large customers.

We derive a significant amount of
revenue from larger customers. The loss or reduction of any significant contracts with any
of these customers could materially reduce our revenue and cash flows. Additionally, many
of our customers are government entities. Government entities can unilaterally terminate
or modify our existing contracts without cause and without penalty to the government
agency.

We face intense
competition. If we do not compete effectively, our business may suffer.

We face intense competition from
numerous competitors. Our products compete primarily on the basis of product quality,
performance, innovation, technology, price, applications expertise, system and service
flexibility and established customer service capabilities with existing customers. We may
not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts or with all of our competitors.
In addition, new competitors may emerge, and product lines may be threatened by new
technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines. To remain
competitive, we must develop new products, respond to new technologies and periodically
enhance our existing products in a timely manner. We anticipate that we may have to adjust
prices of many of our products to stay competitive.

Changes in the supply of,
or price for, parts and components used in our products could affect our business.

We purchase many parts and components
from suppliers. The availability and prices of parts and components are subject to
curtailment or change due to, among other things, suppliers’ allocations to other
purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and
prevailing price levels. Some high-performance components for digital imaging products may
be in short supply and/or suppliers may have occasional difficulty manufacturing these
components to meet our specifications. In addition, some of our products are provided by
sole source suppliers. Any change in the supply of, or price for, these parts and
components could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Environmental compliance
costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial
condition.

Our operations and properties are
subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to environmental
protection, including laws and regulations governing air emissions, water discharges,
waste management and workplace safety. These laws and regulations can result in the
imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations and could require the
installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit
pollution emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance
releases. We must conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to
regulatory requirements in the countries in which we operate as these requirements change.

We use and generate hazardous
substances and wastes in our operations and, as a result, could be subject to potentially
material liabilities relating to the investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties
and to claims alleging personal injury. We have experienced, and expect to continue to
experience, costs relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations. In
connection with our acquisitions, we may assume significant environmental liabilities,
some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition. In addition, new laws and
regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of
previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could
require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Some of the industries in
which we operate are cyclical, and, accordingly, our business is subject to changes in
the economy.

Some of the business areas in which
we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles. Certain
businesses are subject to industry cycles, including but not limited to, the industrial
and semiconductor markets. Accordingly, any downturn in these or other markets in which we
participate could materially adversely affect us. If demand changes and we fail to respond
accordingly, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in any given
quarter. The business cycles of our different operations may occur contemporaneously.
Consequently, the effect of an economic downturn may have a magnified negative effect on
our business.

Our intangible assets are
valued at an amount that is high relative to our total assets, and a write-off of our
intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total
capitalization.

Our total assets reflect substantial
intangible assets, primarily goodwill. At December 31, 2005, goodwill totaled
approximately $1.35 billion compared to approximately $1.25 billion of stockholders’
equity, which was approximately 54% of our total assets of approximately $2.52 billion.
The goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the fair
value of the net assets we have acquired. We assess at least annually whether there has
been an impairment in the value of our intangible assets. If future operating performance
at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels, if
competing or alternative technologies emerge or if business valuations become more
conservative, we could incur, under current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash charge
to operating earnings for goodwill impairment. Any determination requiring the write-off
of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our
results of operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material.

We depend on our
abilities to develop new products.

The future success of our business
will depend, in part, on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products
and to enhance existing products so that our products can be sold with high margins. This
product development may require substantial investment by us. There can be no assurance
that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development, performance or
market acceptance of new technologies or products or that we will otherwise be able to
successfully develop and market new products. Failure of our products to gain market
acceptance or our failure to successfully develop and market new products could reduce our
margins, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

Our technology is
important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a
competitive disadvantage.

Because many of our products rely on
proprietary technology, we believe that the development and protection of intellectual
property rights through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, confidentiality
agreements and other contractual provisions is important to the future success of our
business. Despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or
competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. The steps we
have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology, particularly in foreign
countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the U.S.
Current and future actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and
diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful.

Any business disruptions
due to political instability, armed hostilities, incidents of terrorism or natural
disasters couldadversely

impact our financial performance.

If terrorist activity, armed
conflict, political instability or natural disasters occur in the U.S. or other locations,
such events may negatively impact our operations, cause general economic conditions in the
U.S. and abroad to deteriorate or cause world-wide demand for U.S. products to decline. A
prolonged economic slowdown or recession in the U.S. or in other areas of the world could
reduce the demand for our products, and therefore, negatively affect our future sales and
profits. Any of these events could have a significant impact on our business, financial
condition or results of operations and may result in the volatility of the market price of
our common stock.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are defendants in various lawsuits
involving product liability, employment practices and other matters, none of which we
believe will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or
results of operations. The majority of such claims are subject to insurance coverage.

We and/or one of our subsidiaries are
named as defendants, along with many other companies, in asbestos-related personal injury
or wrongful death actions. The allegations in these actions are vague, general and
speculative. Given the state of these claims, it is not possible to determine the
potential liability, if any.

Dividends.

Roper has declared a cash dividend in each quarter since our February 1992
          initial public offering and we have also annually increased our dividend rate
          since our initial public offering. In November 2005, our Board of Directors
          increased the quarterly dividend paid January 31, 2006 to $0.05875 per share
          from $0.053125 per share, an increase of 11%. However, the timing, declaration
          and payment of future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our Board of
          Directors and will depend upon our profitability, financial condition, capital
          needs, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of
          Directors.

ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

You should read the following
discussion in conjunction with “Selected Financial Data” and our Consolidated
Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

Overview

We are a diversified industrial
company that designs, manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls, scientific
and industrial imaging products and software, industrial technology products,
instrumentation products and services and radio frequency identification and
satellite-based communication technologies and related services. We market these products
and services to selected segments of a broad range of markets including radio frequency
(RF) applications, water, energy, research and medical, and other niche markets.

We pursue consistent and sustainable
growth in earnings by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of
our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses. Our
acquisitions have represented both bolt-ons and new strategic platforms. We strive for
high cash and earnings returns from our acquisition investments. On February 25, 2005, we
purchased Inovonics, a provider of 900 MHz radio frequency products primarily for
security, sub-metering and remote temperature monitoring applications. On June 17, 2005 we
purchased CIVCO, a provider of diagnostic and therapeutic disposable products used in
conjunction with ultrasound imaging for minimally invasive medical procedures primarily in
urology, radiology and cardiology. On November 30, 2005, we purchased MEDTEC, which
designs, develops and distributes enabling technologies essential for accurate diagnosis
and treatment for cancer care. MEDTEC products include patient positioning devices,
image-guided therapy software, and related products and accessories.

During the year ended December 31,
2005, our results of operations benefited from the TransCore acquisition made on December
13, 2004, the power generation business of R/D Tech purchased on June 7, 2004, and the
partial year activities of Inovonics, CIVCO and MEDTEC.

In conjunction with the acquisition
of TransCore, a provider of technologies and related services in areas such as radio
frequency identification (RFID), satellite-based communication, mobile asset tracking,
security applications and comprehensive toll system and processing services, we replaced
our existing $625 million credit agreement, completed a public offering of 5,000,000
shares of our common stock, and entered into an amended and restated $1.055 billion credit
agreement. An underwriters’ overallotment of 115,000 shares of our common stock was
subsequently exercised and closed on December 28, 2004.

During the year ended December 31,
2004, our results of operations benefited from the Neptune Technology Group Holdings, Inc.
(“NTGH”) acquisition made on December 29, 2003 and the partial year activities
of the power generation business of R/D Tech purchased on June 7, 2004.

Application of Critical
Accounting Policies

Our Consolidated Financial Statements
are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States, or GAAP. A discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in
the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2005
included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

GAAP offers acceptable alternative
methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results, such as
determining inventory cost, depreciating long-lived assets, recognizing revenues and
issuing stock options to employees. We have not changed the application of acceptable
accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these
principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial
statements.

The preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments
and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental
disclosures.

The development of accounting
estimates is the responsibility of our management. Our management discusses those areas
that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors. The
audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the SEC.
Although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are
reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over
time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects
are accounted for prospectively.

Our most significant accounting
uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility,
inventory utilization, future warranty obligations, revenue recognition (percent of
completion), income taxes and goodwill and indefinite-lived asset analyses. These issues,
except for income taxes, which are not allocated to our business segments, affect each of
our business segments. These issues are evaluated primarily using a combination of
historical experience, current conditions and relatively short-term forecasting.

Accounts receivable collectibility is
based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after
shipment of products, including in certain cases credits for returned products. Accounts
receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed
upon terms, whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences, what historical
experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that current and
near-term forecast economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and
with specific customers. The returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to
determine likely future rates for such credits. At December 31, 2005, our allowance for
doubtful accounts receivable was $7.3 million and our allowance for sales returns and
sales credits was $1.3 million, for a total of $8.6 million, or 3.2% of total gross
accounts receivable. This percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying
receivables, the timing of write-offs of accounts deemed uncollectible and is not
significantly different as a percent of sales as compared to the December 31, 2004 level.

We regularly compare inventory
quantities on hand against anticipated future usage, which we determine as a function of
historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence
and excessive quantities. When we use historical usage, this information is also
qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using
historical information as an estimate of future usage. Business trends can change rapidly
and these events can affect the evaluation of inventory balances. At December 31, 2005,
inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were $24.3 million, or 15.4% of gross
first-in, first-out inventory cost. This percentage has decreased from 16.1% in the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2004. We expect this percentage to continue to decrease over time
as we physically dispose of obsolete inventory.

Most of our sales are covered by
warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying
defective items for a specified period after the time of sale, typically 12 months. Future
warranty obligations are evaluated using, among other factors, historical cost experience,
product evolution and customer feedback. At December 31, 2005, the reserve for future
warranty obligations was $6.6 million. Our expense for warranty obligations was less than
1% of net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2005, December 31, 2004, and
December 31, 2003.

Revenues related to the use of the
percentage-of-completion method of accounting are dependent on a comparison of total costs
incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project. During the year ended December
31, 2005, we recognized revenue of approximately $90.0 million using this method,
primarily for major turn-key, longer term toll and traffic and energy projects.
Approximately $16.8 million and $31.4 million of revenue was recognized using this method
during the years ended December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively. At December
31, 2005 approximately $100.0 million of revenue related to unfinished
percentage-of-completion contracts had yet to be recognized. Contracts accounted for under
this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues
accounted for under other methods. We expected the significant increase in revenue related
to the use of percentage-of-completion accounting in 2005 as TransCore has several longer
term projects related to toll and traffic systems that require use of this method and we
expect this higher level to continue in the future.

Income taxes can be affected by
estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and how and
when cash is repatriated to the United States, combined with other aspects of an overall
income tax strategy. Additionally, taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with
our tax treatment of certain items, and some historical transactions have income tax
effects going forward. Accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using
current laws, rules and regulations, each of which can change at any time and in an
unpredictable manner. During 2005, our effective income tax rate was 30.6%, which included
a $6.6 million reduction of tax expense related to the repatriation of foreign sourced
earnings under section 965 of the Internal Revenue Code at an effective tax rate
significantly lower than previously provided on these earnings. In 2004, our effective
income tax rate was 29.8% which included a $0.9 million additional R&D credit. We
expect our tax rate in 2006 to increase to approximately 33.8% as the company does not
expect a recurrence of 2005‘s reduction in tax expense from the repatriation of
foreign sourced earnings.

Roper accounts for goodwill in a
purchase business combination as the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets
acquired. Business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being
recognized. Amortization of intangible assets, if applicable, occurs over their estimated
useful lives. Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”) requires companies to cease amortizing
goodwill that existed at June 30, 2001 and establishes a two-step method for testing
goodwill for impairment on an annual basis (or an interim basis if an event occurs that
might reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value). Roper conducts
this review for all of its reporting units during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.
No impairment resulted from the annual review performed in 2005. SFAS 142 also requires
that an identifiable intangible asset that is determined to have an indefinite useful
economic life not be amortized, but separately tested for impairment using a one-step fair
value based approach. Total goodwill includes 24 different business units with individual
amounts ranging from less than $1 million to approximately $416 million.

Year Ended December 31,
2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004

Net sales for the year ended December
31, 2005 were $1.45 billion as compared to sales of $969.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004, an increase of 49.9%. This increase was the result of sales from
acquired companies and strong internal growth. Our 2005 results included a full year of
sales from the power generation business of R/D Tech and from TransCore, both acquired
during 2004, approximately ten months of sales from the Inovonics acquisition, six months
from CIVCO, and one month from MEDTEC. Net sales of these acquisitions accounted for
approximately $413 million of our 2005 net sales increase over 2004 and growth of our
other business accounted for the remaining $71 million of the increase.

In our Instrumentation segment, net
sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased by $19.2 million or 9.0% over the
year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was due primarily to increased unit volumes
attributable to generally favorable market conditions, increased sales of approximately $4
million in sulfur testing instruments as this testing moved from lab to process
applications with our customers and increased sales of our non-destructive testing
technology into new channels representing approximately $2 million.

Net sales for our Industrial
Technology segment increased by $33.4 million or 8.4% for the year ended December 31, 2005
over the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was due primarily to increased unit
volumes attributable to generally favorable market conditions including strong sales
growth in radio frequency technology in our water meter markets, representing
approximately $10 million, and increased sales of standard products in our water and waste
water pumps of approximately $5 million.

In our Energy Systems and Controls
segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased by $18.4 million or
11.8% over the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily due to the
full-year impact of the power generation business of R/D Tech acquired in 2004 of
approximately $9.4 million.

Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging
segment reported an increase in net sales of $31.6 million or 16.8% for the year ended
December 31, 2005 over the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was attributable to
the partial-year impact of CIVCO and MEDTEC acquired in 2005 which accounted for
approximately $22 million of the increase over prior year. The remainder of the increase
resulted primarily from new products and more focused selling activities driving market penetration in our
physical and life sciences camera markets.

In our RF Technology segment, net
sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased by $381.4 million over the year ended
December 31, 2004. The increase was attributable to the full-year results of TransCore,
purchased December 13, 2004, and the ten month results of Inovonics.

Our overall gross profit percentage
was 50.0% for the year ended December 31, 2005 which remained the same as 50.0% for the
year ended December 31, 2004. The Instrumentation segment gross margins increased to 58.5%
as compared to 57.8% in the prior year. The margins improved due to sales mix and leverage
from increased sales. Industrial Technology gross margins increased to 44.1% as compared
to 42.6% in the prior year, primarily due to the non-recurrence of inventory step-up costs
at Neptune in the first quarter of 2004 of approximately $1.5 million. Our Energy Systems
and Controls segment gross margins were 54.7% in 2005 as compared to 52.3% in 2004. This
was due to several factors none of which are easily quantifiable, including a product
rationalization effort in our non-destructive testing business, better large project scope
acceptance discipline and better engineering staff utilization in our oil and gas
business. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment gross margins were 55.3% in 2005
as compared to 55.7% in 2004. This decrease is due totally to inventory step-up costs of
approximately $2.1 million at CIVCO and MEDTEC incurred in 2005. Without these charges,
there was a modest improvement in this segment’s gross margins for the year. Our RF
Technology segment gross margins were 46.4% in 2005 as compared to 40.4% for the 18 day
period that TransCore was owned in 2004. Prior year gross margins were depressed due to
the low sales volume in the holiday period of our ownership in the prior year.

Selling, general and administrative
(SG&A) expenses decreased to 31.8% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005
from 32.4% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease is due to
leverage from higher sales while making a conscious effort to control general and
administrative expenses.

Interest expense increased $14.5
million, or 50.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2004, primarily as a result of higher debt levels incurred due to the
TransCore acquisition in December 2004, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility
for the Inovonics, CIVCO and MEDTEC acquisitions in 2005.

The loss on extinguishment of debt
for the year ended December 31, 2005 was a $3.9 million non-cash charge related to the
expensing of deferred financing costs for our senior subordinated convertible notes which
are required to be classified as short-term debt, based upon the triggering of the
conversion feature of the notes due to increases in the trading price of the
Company’s stock. The loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31,
2004 was a $8.2 million non-cash charge related to the expensing of deferred financing
costs due to the amendment of our credit facility concurrent with the acquisition of
TransCore.

The change in other income for the
year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily
due to a $0.8 million gain on sale of an investment in a previously owned business and
proceeds of $0.7 million from a business interruption insurance claim due to a fire at a
supplier to one of our Imaging segment businesses.

During 2005, our effective income tax
rate was 30.6%, which included a $6.6 million reduction to tax expense related to the
repatriation of foreign sourced earnings under section 965 of the Internal Revenue Code at
an effective tax rate significantly lower than previously provided on these earnings. In
2004, our effective income tax rate was 29.8% which included a $0.9 million additional
R&D credit. We expect our tax rate in 2006 to increase to approximately 33.8% as the
company does not expect a recurrence of the 2005 reduction in tax expense from the
repatriation of foreign sourced earnings.

At December 31, 2005, the functional
currencies of our European subsidiaries were weaker and the functional currencies of our
Canadian subsidiaries were stronger against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange
rates at December 31, 2004. The net result of these changes led to a decrease in the
foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $27.9 million in the year period
ending December 31, 2005. Approximately $21.8 million of these adjustments related to
goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. For the
entire year of 2005, operating profit was not affected by fluctuations in non-U.S.
currencies.

The following table summarizes our
net sales order information for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 (dollar amounts
in thousands).

Industrial Technology segment net
orders strengthened in most markets over the prior year and in particular from strong
orders for Neptune water meter and RF products, which is also the primary contributor to
the increased backlog in this segment as noted in the table below. Scientific and
Industrial Imaging net orders increased from the inclusion of orders from the partial year
ownership of CIVCO and MEDTEC and also from stronger orders for industrial cameras and
handheld computers, which leads to the higher backlog at 2005 in the Scientific and
Industrial Imaging segment.

Year Ended December 31,
2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003

Net sales for the year ended December
31, 2004 were $969.8 million as compared to sales of $657.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003, an increase of 47.5%. This increase was the result of sales from
acquired companies and strong internal growth. Our 2004 results included a full year of
sales from the NTGH acquisition, six months of sales from the power generation business of
R/D Tech and two weeks of sales from the TransCore acquisition. Net sales of these
acquisitions accounted for approximately $252 million of our 2004 net sales increase over
2003 and growth of our other business accounted for the remaining $60 million of the
increase.

In our Instrumentation segment, net
sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased by $32.4 million or 17.9% over the
year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was attributable to improved distribution, new
product introductions, favorable market conditions, and changes in exchange rates.

Net sales for our Industrial
Technology segment increased by $226.3 million or 132.9% for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2004 over the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. The increase primarily
resulted from the NTGH acquisition, accounting for approximately $206 million of the
increase, and also included stronger sales into industrial, energy, and commercial
refrigeration end markets.

In our Energy Systems and Controls
segment, net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 increased by $17.3
million or 12.4% over the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. The increase was due to
the partial-year impact of the power generation business of R/D Tech acquired in 2004 of
approximately $10 million as well as higher system and product sales of energy
applications, substantially offset by lower sales to Gazprom.

Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging
segment reported an increase in net sales of $21.2 million or 12.7% for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2004 over the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. Approximately $20
million of the increase was attributable to the full-year impact of NTGH acquired in 2003.

Our RF Technology segment was
established in the fourth quarter of 2004 with the acquisition of TransCore on December
13, 2004 and includes two weeks of sales in 2004.

Our overall gross profit percentage
was 50.0% for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to 52.7% for the year ended
December 31, 2003. Instrumentation segment gross margins decreased to 57.8% as compared to
58.3% in the prior year. The margins were impacted by increased sales of third party
sourced products that carried a lower gross profit margin, but good operating profit
margins. As expected, Industrial Technology gross margins decreased, to 42.6% as compared
to 45.6% in the prior year, because NTGH gross margins are lower than the segment average.
Our Energy Systems and Controls segment gross margins were 52.3% in 2004 as compared to
52.8% in 2003. This was due to a margin decrease in our turbomachinery controls business
offset by an increase in margins in our non-destructive testing business. Our Scientific
and Industrial Imaging segment gross margins were 55.7% in 2004 as compared to 53.6% in
2003. This increase is due to improved margins in our high-performance digital imaging
cameras and electron microscopes, much of which was achieved through the restructuring
efforts undertaken in 2003.

Selling, general and administrative
(SG&A) expenses decreased to 32.4% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2004
from 36.2% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease is due to
leverage from higher sales levels and the reductions in restructuring expenses that were
incurred in the prior year. This was offset with increased expenses related to compliance
with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

Interest expense increased $12.5
million, or 76.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2003, as a result of higher debt levels incurred due to the NTGH acquisition
in December 2003.

Income taxes were 29.8% of pretax
earnings in 2004 compared to 27.5% for 2003. Our 2003 rate was low due to the marginal
rate impact in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 of certain expenses related to the NTGH
acquisition and related financing. Our 2004 rate also included an additional $0.9 million
credit related to a R&D study completed during the year.

At December 31, 2004, the functional
currencies of our European subsidiaries were stronger against the U.S. dollar compared to
currency exchange rates at December 31, 2003. This strengthening resulted in an increase
in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $27.3 million in the twelve
month period ending December 31, 2004. Approximately $19.5 million of these adjustments
related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash
flows. 2004 operating earnings benefited 1.9% from stronger non-U.S. currencies. Foreign
exchange differences related to our other non-U.S. subsidiaries were immaterial to 2004
financial performance.

Instrumentation segment net orders
improved due to continued strength for oil and gas desulfurization applications and higher
orders for our materials analysis equipment. In addition, approximately 5.1% of the
increase was due to the stronger European and Asian currencies against the dollar.
Industrial Technology segment net orders strengthened over all markets from the prior year
and also benefited from the orders for Neptune which were not included in the prior year.
Energy Systems and Controls net orders rose due to strength in the non-destructive testing
markets as well as the inclusion of the orders of the power generation business of R/D
Tech which is included for almost seven months of the current year. In addition, there was
continued strength in non-Gazprom oil and gas sectors, offset by significantly lower
Gazprom orders. Scientific and Industrial Imaging net orders increased from strong orders
for electron microscopy products.

Financial Condition,
Liquidity and Capital Resources

Net cash provided by operating
activities was $281.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, $164.8 million for the
year ended December 31, 2004, and $71.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. 2003
results include a $24.4 million write-off of debt extinguishment costs related to the
recapitalization of the Company. The 2005 increase reflects stronger earnings from
operations due to the inclusion of TransCore, Inovonics, CIVCO, & MEDTEC in 2005,
strong growth from our other operations, and lower cash tax payments due primarily to the
utilization of certain U.S. net operating losses for tax purposes. Cash flows used in
investing activities during each of fiscal 2005, 2004, and 2003 were primarily business
acquisition costs. Cash flows from financing activities during each of these years were
largely debt repayments and borrowings for acquisitions and common stock issuances in 2004
and 2003. Financing activities in 2004 also included amending and restating our previous
$625 million credit agreement with our current $1.055 billion credit agreement to increase
capacity, lower borrowing costs, and improve other terms and conditions.

Net working capital (current assets,
excluding cash, less total current liabilities, excluding debt) was $212.8 million at
December 31, 2005 compared to $209.7 million at December 31, 2004. We acquired
approximately $21.7 million of net current assets through business acquisitions during
2005.

Total debt was $894.3 million at
December 31, 2005 (41.7% of total capital) compared to $891.9 million at December 31, 2004
(44.4% of total capital). Our increased debt at December 31, 2005 compared to December 31,
2004 was due to borrowings related to our 2005 acquisitions.

Our $1.055 billion credit facility
consists of a $655 million term loan and a $400 million revolving loan, both with five
year maturities. At December 31, 2005, our debt consisted of $230 million in senior
subordinated convertible notes due in 2034, a balance of $616.8 million on the term loan
and a balance of $40.1 million on the revolving loan. The Company had $44.5 million of
outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2005, thereby reducing its remaining
revolving credit capacity commensurately. We expect that our available borrowing capacity,
combined with existing cash balances and cash flows expected to be generated from existing
businesses, will be sufficient to fund normal operating requirements and finance
additional acquisitions. We also have several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings
or the issuance of letters of credit in various foreign locations to support our non-U.S.
businesses. In total, these smaller facilities do not represent a significant source of
credit for us.

We were in compliance with all debt
covenants related to our credit facilities throughout the year ended December 31, 2005.

Capital expenditures of $24.8
million, $12.1 million and $10.4 million were incurred during 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. The increase in capital expenditures in 2005 was primarily due to the higher
capital expenditure requirements of TransCore acquired in December, 2004. We expect
capital expenditures in 2006 to be approximately comparable as a percentage of sales to
2005.

Description of Certain
Indebtedness

Senior Secured Credit
Facility

Concurrently with the closing of the
TransCore acquisition and the common stock offering in December 2004, we entered into a
$1.055 billion senior secured credit facility. This credit facility consists of a
five-year $655 million term loan and a five-year $400 million revolving loan.

Our credit facility requires us to
prepay the term loan and, in certain cases, reduce the commitments under the revolving
loan, upon the receipt of certain proceeds, including from certain asset sales, the
incurrence of certain debt, and up to 75% of our excess cash flows unless we meet a
consolidated total leverage ratio test. We are also required to make quarterly principal
payments on the term loans.

The facility contains various
affirmative and negative covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur
new debt, prepay subordinated debt, make certain investments and acquisitions, sell assets
and grant liens, make restricted payments (including the payment of dividends on our
common stock) and capital expenditures, or change our line of business. We also are
subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage
ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio.

Senior Subordinated
Convertible Notes

In December 2003, we issued $230
million of senior subordinated convertible notes at an original issue discount of 60.498%,
resulting in an effective yield of 3.75% per year to maturity. Interest on the notes is
payable semiannually, beginning July 15, 2004, until January 15, 2009. After
that date, we will not pay cash interest on the notes prior to maturity unless contingent
cash interest becomes payable. Instead, after January 15, 2009, interest will be
recognized at the effective rate of 3.75% and will represent accrual of original issue
discount, excluding any contingent cash interest that may become payable. We will pay
contingent cash interest to the holders of the notes during any six month period
commencing after January 15, 2009 if the average trading price of a note for a five
trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals 120%
or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and accrued cash
interest, if any, for such note. The contingent cash interest payable per note in respect
of any six month period will equal the annual rate of 0.25%.

The notes are unsecured
senior subordinated obligations, rank junior to our existing and future senior secured
indebtedness and rank equally with our existing and future senior subordinated
indebtedness.

As originally issued, each $1,000
principal amount of the notes will be convertible at the option of the holder into 12.422
shares of our common stock (giving effect to the 2-for-1 stock split effective August 26,
2005 and subject to further adjustment), if (i) the sale price of our common stock
reaches, or the trading price of the notes falls below, specified thresholds, (ii) if the
notes are called for redemption or (iii) if specified corporate transactions have
occurred. Upon conversion, we would have the right to deliver, in lieu of common stock,
cash or a combination of cash and common stock. On November 19, 2004, the Company began a
consent solicitation to amend the notes such that the Company would pay the same
conversion value upon conversion of the Notes, but would change how the conversion value
is paid. In lieu of receiving exclusively shares of common stock or cash upon conversion,
noteholders would receive cash up to the value of the accreted principal amount of the
Notes converted and, at the Company’s option, any remainder of the conversion value
would be paid in cash or shares of common stock. The consent solicitation was successfully
completed on December 6, 2004 and the amended conversion provisions were adopted.

Holders
may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on January 15, 2009,
January 15, 2014, January 15, 2019, January 15, 2024, and January 15,
2029, at stated prices plus accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash
interest, if any. We may only pay the purchase price of such notes in cash and not in
common stock.

We may redeem for cash all or a
portion of the notes at any time on or after January 15, 2009 at redemption prices
equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash
interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any, on such notes to the
applicable redemption date.

As of September 30, 2005, the senior
subordinated convertible notes were reclassified from long term to short term debt as the
notes became convertible on October 1, 2005 based upon the Company’s common stock
trading above the trigger price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive
trading-day period ending on September 30, 2005.

In accordance with EITF 04-8,
“The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings Per Share,” the
Company is required to include in its diluted weighted-average common share calculation an
increase in shares based upon the difference between the Company’s average closing
stock price for the period and the conversion price of $31.80. This is calculated using
the treasury stock method.

At December 31, 2005 the Company had
outstanding surety bonds of $118.9 million.

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we did
not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as
entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would
have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or
other contractually narrow or limited purposes.

We believe that internally generated
cash flows and the remaining availability under our various credit facilities will be
adequate to finance normal operating requirements and further acquisition activities.
Although we maintain an active acquisition program, any further acquisitions will be
dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any
such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities, financial
condition and results of operations. We may also explore alternatives to attract
additional capital resources.

We anticipate that our recently
acquired businesses as well as our other businesses will generate positive cash flows from
operating activities, and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently
outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule. However, the rate at which we
can reduce our debt during 2006 (and reduce the associated interest expense) will be
affected by, among other things, the financing and operating requirements of any new
acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies. None of these
factors can be predicted with certainty.

Recently Issued
Accounting Standards

In November 2004, the FASB issued FAS
151, “Inventory Costs-An Amendment of ARB No. 43” to clarify the accounting for
abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and material waste.
The standard requires that abnormal amounts of these items be recognized as current period
charges. FAS 151 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The
implementation of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the
Company’s Financial Statements.

In December, 2004, the FASB issued
FAS 123R, “Share-Based Payment” (revised 2004) (“SFAS 123R”) which was
originally effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning after June 15,
2005. The effective date of this standard has been delayed until annual reporting periods
beginning after December 31, 2005, which was the company’s calendar year 2006
beginning on January 1, 2006. SFAS 123R applies to any unvested awards that are
outstanding on the effective date and to all new awards granted or modified after the
effective date. The remaining unrecognized portion of the original fair value of the
unvested awards will be recognized in the income statement at their fair value that the
company estimated for purposes of preparing its SFAS 123 pro forma disclosures. The
company adopted SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006 and applied the modified prospective
transition method. This method requires the company to expense the remaining unrecognized
portion of awards outstanding at the effective date and to expense any awards granted or
modified after the effective date, but does not require restatement of prior periods. In
accordance with FASB Staff Position FAS 123(R)-3, Transition Election to Accounting for
the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards, the company anticipates applying the
short-cut method for determining its Additional Paid-in Capital Pool, however the company
continues to evaluate such implementation. As a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R as of
January 1, 2006, the company estimates it will record expense of approximately $3.5
million in fiscal 2006 relating to its stock-based awards.

The FASB issued FSP 109-1 and 109-2
related to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. FSP 109-1 provides guidance related to
the accounting for special tax deductions on “qualified production activities
income”. FSP 109-2 provides companies with additional time to complete assessment of
repatriation plans related to the one time deduction on certain repatriated foreign
earnings as provided in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The FSPs were effective
upon issuance on December 21, 2004. The Act creates a temporary incentive for U.S.
corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent
dividend received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations.
The Company repatriated approximately $82 million of foreign sourced earnings during the
fourth quarter of 2005 which resulted in a net tax benefit of approximately $6.6 million
and is reflected in the Company’s effective tax rate in the fourth quarter.

In March 2005, the FASB issued
Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations,” (“FIN 47”) to clarify the requirement to record liabilities
stemming from a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the
timing or method of settlement is conditional on a future event. FIN 47 is effective for
fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. The implementation of this standard did not
have a material impact on the Company’s Financial Statements.

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No.
154 (“SFAS 154”), “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.” SFAS 154
requires that, when a company changes its accounting policies, it must apply the change
retrospectively to all prior periods presented, unless impracticable, instead of a
cumulative effect adjustment in the period of the change. SFAS 154 may also apply when the
FASB issues new rules requiring changes in accounting. However, if the new rule allows
cumulative effect treatment, it would take precedence over SFAS 154. This statement is
effective for accounting changes and error corrections beginning in the company’s
calendar year 2006 which began on January 1, 2006.

In June 2005, the FASB issued
FASB Staff Position 143-1,

Accounting for Electronic Equipment Waste Obligations

(“FSP 143-1”), which provides guidance on the accounting for certain
obligations associated with the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (the
“Directive”), adopted by the European Union (“EU”). Under the
Directive, the waste management obligation for historical equipment (products put on the
market on or prior to August 13, 2005) remains with the commercial user until the
customer replaces the equipment. FSP 143-1 is required to be applied to the later of the
first reporting period ending after June 8, 2005 or the date of the Directive’s
adoption into law by the applicable EU member countries in which the manufacturers have
significant operations. The Company adopted FSP 143-1 in the third quarter of fiscal 2005
and its adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations
or financial condition for fiscal 2005.

Information About
Forward Looking Statements

This Annual Report includes and
incorporates by reference “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the
federal securities laws. In addition, we, or our executive officers on our behalf, may
from time to time make forward-looking statements in reports and other documents we file
with the SEC or in connection with oral statements made to the press, potential investors
or others. All statements that are not historical facts are “forward-looking
statements.” The words “estimate,” “project,” “intend,”
“expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” and similar expressions
identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include statements
regarding our expected financial position, business, financing plans, business strategy,
business prospects, revenues, working capital, liquidity, capital needs, interest costs
and income, in each case relating to our company as a whole, as well as statements
regarding acquisitions, potential acquisitions and the benefits of acquisitions.

Forward-looking statements are
estimates and projections reflecting our best judgment and involve a number of risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by
the forward-looking statements. These statements are based on our management’s
beliefs and assumptions, which in turn are based on currently available information.
Examples of forward looking statements in this report include but are not limited to our
expectations regarding our ability to generate operating cash flows and reduce debt and
associated interest expense and our expectations regarding growth through acquisitions.
Important assumptions relating to the forward-looking statements include, among others,
assumptions regarding demand for our products, the cost, timing and success of product
upgrades and new product introductions, raw materials costs, expected pricing levels, the
timing and cost of expected capital expenditures, expected outcomes of pending litigation,
competitive conditions, general economic conditions and expected synergies relating to
acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances. These assumptions could prove inaccurate.
Although we believe that the estimates and projections reflected in the forward-looking
statements are reasonable, our expectations may prove to be incorrect. Important factors
that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or projections
contained in the forward-looking statements include:

difficulty making acquisitions and successfully integrating acquired businesses;

any unforeseen liabilities associated with future acquisitions;

limitations on our business imposed by our indebtedness;

unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates;

difficulties associated with exports;

risks and costs associated with our international sales and operations;

increased directors and officers liability and other insurance costs;

risk of rising interest rates;

product liability and insurance risks;

increased warranty exposure;

future competition;

the cyclical nature of some of our markets;

reduction  of business with large customers;

risks associated with government contracts;

changes in the supply of, or price for, parts and components;

environmental compliance costs and liabilities;

risks and costs associated with asbestos-related litigation;

potential write-offs of our substantial intangible assets;

our ability to successfully develop new products;

failure to protect our technology;

trade tariffs that may be applied due to the U.S. government's delay in complying with certain WTO directives;

terrorist attacks;

future health crises; and

the factors discussed in Item 1A to this Annual Report under the heading "Risk Factors."

We believe these forward-looking
statements are reasonable. However, you should not place undue reliance on any
forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations. Further,
forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no
obligation to publicly update any of them in light of new information or future events.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to interest rate risks
on our outstanding borrowings, and we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks on
our transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are also exposed
to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock.

At December 31, 2005, we had a
combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. Our $1.055 billion senior credit
facility contains $655 million variable rate term notes and a $400 million variable rate
revolver. To reduce the financial risk of future rate increases, in 2005 the Company
entered into a $250 million fixed rate swap agreement expiring March 13, 2008. Our $230
million senior unsecured convertible notes have a fixed interest rate. At December 31,
2005, the prevailing market rates were between 0.75% and 1.75% higher than the fixed rates
on our debt instruments.

At December 31, 2005, Roper’s
outstanding variable-rate borrowings not covered by the interest rate swap under the
$1.055 billion credit facility were $406.9 million. An increase in interest rates of 1%
would increase our annualized interest costs by $4.1 million.

Several Roper companies have
transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of
these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, Canadian dollars, British pounds,
Danish krone or Japanese yen. Sales by companies whose functional currency was not the
U.S. dollar were 25% of our total sales and 66% of these sales were by companies with a
European functional currency. The U.S. dollar strengthened against European and Asian
currencies during 2005 and weakened against the Canadian dollar. The difference between
2005 operating results for these companies translated into U.S. dollars during 2005 and
these operating results translated into U.S. dollars during 2005 was not material. If
these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout 2005 compared to currency
exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our expected net earnings would have
been approximately $2.5 million.

The changes in these currency
exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar during 2005 compared to currency exchange rates
at December 31, 2004 resulted in a decrease in net assets of $27.9 million that was
reported as a component of comprehensive earnings, $21.8 million of which was attributed
to goodwill. Goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect
our reported earnings or cash flows.

The trading price of Roper’s
common stock influences the valuation of stock option grants and the effects these grants
have on pro forma earnings disclosed in our financial statements. The stock prices also
influence the computation of potentially dilutive common stock which includes both stock
awards and the premium over the conversion price on senior subordinated convertible notes
to determine diluted earnings per share. The stock price also affects our employees’
perceptions of various programs that involve our common stock. We believe the
quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash
flows is not readily determinable.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders of
Roper Industries, Inc.:

We
have completed integrated audits of Roper Industries, Inc.‘s December 31, 2005 and
December 31, 2004 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 and an audit of its December 31, 2003
consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are
presented below.

Consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under
Item 15(a)(1), present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Roper
Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) at December 31, 2005 and
December 31, 2004, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our
opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item
15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when
read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial
statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

Internal control over
financial reporting

Also,
in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in Management’s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005
based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is
fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our
opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s management
is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for
its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on management’s assessment and on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s
assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
controls, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection
of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate. As described in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting appearing under Item 9A, management has excluded Inovonics Corporation, CIVCO
Holding, Inc. and MEDTEC, Inc. from its assessment of internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2005 because they were acquired by the Company in purchase
business combinations during 2005. We have also excluded Inovonics Corporation, CIVCO
Holding, Inc. and MEDTEC, Inc. from our audit of internal control over financial
reporting. Inovonics Corporation, CIVCO Holding, Inc. and MEDTEC, Inc. are wholly-owned
subsidiaries whose total assets represent 1.8%, 4.9% and 6.3%, respectively, and whose
total revenues represent 2.0%, 1.3% and 0.3%, respectively, of the related consolidated
financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005.

Summary of Accounting Policies

Basis
of Presentation

– These financial statements present consolidated information
for Roper Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Roper” or the “Company”).
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Nature
of the Business

– Roper is a diversified industrial company that designs,
manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls, scientific and industrial
imaging products and software, industrial technology products, instrumentation products
and services and radio frequency (RF) products and services. We market these products and
services to selected segments of a broad range of markets, including radio frequency
applications, water, energy, research and medical, and other niche markets.

Discontinued
Operations

– During the first quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company decided to
offer for sale the Petrotech operation. The accompanying financial statements have been
restated to conform to discontinued operations treatment for all periods presented. See
footnote 15 for additional disclosure.

Accounts
Receivable

— Accounts receivable were stated net of an allowance for doubtful
accounts of $8,625,000 and $7,838,000 at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Outstanding accounts receivable balances are reviewed periodically, and allowances are
provided at such time that management believes reasonable doubt exists that such balances
will be collected within a reasonable period of time.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

— Roper considers highly liquid financial instruments with
remaining maturities at acquisition of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Roper
had no cash equivalents at December 31, 2005, and had $44.0 million at December 31, 2004.

Earnings
per Share

– Basic earnings per share were calculated using net earnings and the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the respective year.
Diluted earnings per share were calculated using net earnings and the weighted average
number of shares of common stock and potential common stock outstanding during the
respective year. Potentially dilutive common stock consisted of stock options, restricted
stock awards and the premium over the conversion price on our senior subordinated
convertible notes based upon the trading price of the company’s common stock. The
effects of potential common stock were determined using the treasury stock method (in
thousands).

As
of and for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, there were 8,000, 81,000,
and 634,000 outstanding stock options that were not included in the determination of
diluted earnings per share because doing so would have been antidilutive.

Estimates

– The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

— Roper’s short-term debt at December 31,
2005 included $230 million of fixed-rate notes, the interest rate on which was 1.75% less
than prevailing market rates which results in a valuation of approximately $218 million.
Most of Roper’s other borrowings at December 31, 2005 were at various interest rates
that adjust relatively frequently under its $1.055 billion credit facility. The fair
value for each of these borrowings at December 31, 2005 was estimated to be the face
value of these borrowings.

Foreign
Currency Translation

— Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries whose functional
currency is not the U.S. dollar were translated at the exchange rate in effect at the
balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses were translated at average exchange rates
for the period in which those entities were included in Roper’s financial results.
Translation adjustments are reflected as a component of other comprehensive earnings.

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets

– The Company determines whether there has been an
impairment of long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and identifiable intangible assets
that are determined to have indefinite useful economic lives, when certain indicators of
impairment are present. In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the cost
of any long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability would be
performed. If an evaluation is required, the estimated future gross, undiscounted cash
flows associated with the asset would be compared to the asset’s carrying amount to
determine if a write-down to market value is required. Future adverse changes in market
conditions or poor operating results of underlying long-lived assets could result in
losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the long-lived assets that may
not be reflected in the assets’ current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring
an impairment charge in the future.

Income
Taxes

– Roper is a U.S.-based multinational company and the calculation of its
worldwide provision for income taxes requires analysis of many factors, including income
tax systems that vary from country to country, and the United States’ treatment of
non-U.S. earnings. Roper has provided for U.S. income taxes for deferred taxes on
undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries that are not expected to be permanently
reinvested in such companies. There has been no provision for U.S. income taxes for the
remaining undistributed earnings of approximately $3.8 million at December 31, 2005,
because Roper intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in operations outside the
United States. If such earnings were distributed, incremental U.S. taxes of approximately
$1.3 million would accrue after utilization of U.S. tax credits.

Certain
assets and liabilities have different bases for financial reporting and income tax
purposes. Deferred income taxes have been provided for these differences.

Goodwill
and Other Intangibles

–Roper accounts for goodwill in a purchase business
combination as the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired.
Business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being recognized.
Amortization of intangible assets, if applicable, occurs over their estimated useful
lives. Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets”(“SFAS 142”) requires companies to cease amortizing
goodwill that existed at June 30, 2001 and establishes a two-step method for testing
goodwill for impairment on an annual basis (or an interim basis if an event occurs that
might reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value). Roper conducts
this review for all of its reporting units during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.
No impairment resulted from the annual review performed in 2005. SFAS 142 also requires
that an identifiable intangible asset that is determined to have an indefinite useful
economic life not be amortized, but separately tested for impairment using a one-step
fair value based approach. Total goodwill includes 24 different business units with
individual amounts ranging from less than $1 million to approximately $416 million.

Inventories

— Inventories
are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in,
first-out method. The Company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or
excess inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated
market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.

Other
Comprehensive Earnings

– Comprehensive earnings includes net earnings and all
other non-owner sources of changes in a company’s net assets. The differences
between net earnings and comprehensive earnings were currency translation adjustments and
the unrealized gain related to an interest rate swap, net of tax.

Property,
Plant and Equipment and Depreciation and Amortization

— Property, plant and
equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation
and amortization are provided for using principally the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

Buildings

20-30 years

Machinery

8-12 years

Other equipment

3-5 years

Capitalized
Software

– The Company accounts for capitalized software under Statement of
Position (“SOP”) 98-1, “Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software
Developed or Obtained for Internal Use.” Among other provisions, SOP 98-1 requires
that entities capitalize certain internal-use software costs once certain criteria are
met. Under SOP 98-1, overhead, general and administrative and training costs are not
capitalized. Capitalized software was $9.5 million and $11.4 million at December 31, 2005
and 2004, respectively.

Recently
Released Accounting Pronouncements

– In November 2004, the FASB issued FAS 151,
“Inventory Costs-An Amendment of ARB No. 43” to clarify the accounting for
abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and material waste.
The standard requires that abnormal amounts of these items be recognized as current
period charges. FAS 151 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The
implementation of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
Financial Statements.

In
December, 2004, the FASB issued FAS 123R, “Share-Based Payment” (revised 2004) (“SFAS
123R”) which was originally effective for interim or annual reporting periods
beginning after June 15, 2005. The effective date of this standard has been delayed until
annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2005, which was the company’s
calendar year 2006 beginning on January 1, 2006. SFAS 123R applies to any unvested awards
that are outstanding on the effective date and to all new awards granted or modified
after the effective date. The remaining unrecognized portion of the original fair value
of the unvested awards will be recognized in the income statement at their fair value
that the company estimated for purposes of preparing its SFAS 123 pro forma disclosures.
The company adopted SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006 and applied the modified prospective
transition method. This method requires the company to expense the remaining unrecognized
portion of awards outstanding at the effective date and to expense any awards granted or
modified after the effective date, but does not require restatement of prior periods. In
accordance with FASB Staff Position FAS 123(R)-3,

Transition Election to

Accounting
for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards

, the company anticipates applying
the short-cut method for determining its Additional Paid-in Capital Pool, however the
company continues to evaluate such implementation. As a result of the adoption of SFAS
123R as of January 1, 2006, the company estimates it will record expense of approximately
$3.5 million in fiscal 2006 relating to its stock-based awards.

The
FASB issued FSP 109-1 and 109-2 related to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. FSP
109-1 provides guidance related to the accounting for special tax deductions on “qualified
production activities income”. FSP 109-2 provides companies with additional time to
complete assessment of repatriation plans related to the one time deduction on certain
repatriated foreign earnings as provided in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The
FSPs were effective upon issuance on December 21, 2004. The Act creates a temporary
incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by
providing an 85 percent dividend received deduction for certain dividends from controlled
foreign corporations. The Company repatriated approximately $82 million of foreign
sourced earnings during the fourth quarter of 2005 which resulted in a net tax benefit of
approximately $6.6 million and is reflected in the Company’s effective tax rate in
the fourth quarter.

In
March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset
Retirement Obligations,” (“FIN 47”) to clarify the requirement to record
liabilities stemming from a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in
which the timing or method of settlement is conditional on a future event. FIN 47 is
effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. The implementation of this
standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s Financial Statements.

In
May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154 (“SFAS 154”), “Accounting Changes
and Error Corrections.” SFAS 154 requires that, when a company changes its
accounting policies, it must apply the change retrospectively to all prior periods
presented, unless impracticable, instead of a cumulative effect adjustment in the period
of the change. SFAS 154 may also apply when the FASB issues new rules requiring changes
in accounting. However, if the new rule allows cumulative effect treatment, it would take
precedence over SFAS 154. This statement is effective for accounting changes and error
corrections beginning in the company’s calendar year 2006 which began on January 1,
2006.

In
June 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 143-1,

Accounting for Electronic
Equipment Waste Obligations

(“FSP 143-1”), which provides guidance on the
accounting for certain obligations associated with the Waste Electrical and Electronic
Equipment Directive (the “Directive”), adopted by the European Union (“EU”).
Under the Directive, the waste management obligation for historical equipment (products
put on the market on or prior to August 13, 2005) remains with the commercial user
until the customer replaces the equipment. FSP 143-1 is required to be applied to the
later of the first reporting period ending after June 8, 2005 or the date of the
Directive’s adoption into law by the applicable EU member countries in which the
manufacturers have significant operations. The Company adopted FSP 143-1 in the third
quarter of fiscal 2005 and its adoption did not have a material impact on its
consolidated results of operations or financial condition for fiscal 2005.

Research
and Development

— Research and development costs include salaries and benefits,
rents, supplies, and other costs related to various products under development. Research
and development costs are expensed in the period incurred and totaled $53.5 million,
$38.7 million and $32.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

Revenue
Recognition and Product Warranties

– The Company recognizes revenue when all of
the following criteria are met:

persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists

delivery has occurred or services have been rendered

the seller's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and

collectibility is reasonably assured.

In
addition, the Company recognizes revenue from the sale of product when title and risk of
loss pass to the customer, which is generally when product is shipped. The Company
recognizes revenue from services rendered upon customer acceptance. Revenues under
certain relatively long-term and relatively large-value construction projects are
recognized under the percentage-of-completion method using the ratio of costs incurred to
total estimated costs as the measure of performance. The Company recognized revenues of
approximately $90.0 million, $16.8 million and $31.4 million for the years ended December
31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, using this method. Estimated losses on any
projects are recognized as soon as such losses become known.

The
Company sells certain of its products to customers with a product warranty that provides
that customers can return a defective product during a specified warranty period
following the purchase in exchange for a replacement product, repair at no cost to the
customer or the issuance of a credit to the customer. The Company accrues its estimated
exposure to warranty claims based upon current and historical product sales date,
warranty costs incurred and any other related information known to the Company.

Stock-Based
Compensation

– Roper accounts for stock-based compensation under the provisions
of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 – “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees.” Stock-based compensation is measured at its fair value at the grant date
in accordance with an option-pricing model. SFAS 123 – “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation,” as amended by SFAS 148, provides that the related expense
may be recorded in the basic financial statements or the pro forma effect on earnings may
be disclosed in the financial statements. Roper provides the pro forma disclosures.

Had
Roper recognized compensation expense during 2005, 2004 and 2003 for the fair value of
stock options granted in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123, pro forma earnings
and pro forma earnings per share would have been approximately as presented below:

Business Acquisitions

On
February 25, 2005, the Company acquired all the outstanding shares of Inovonics
Corporation, a leading provider of 900 MHz radio frequency (RF) products for security
applications. The operations of Inovonics are included in the RF Technology segment. The
aggregate purchase price of the acquisition was approximately $46 million. The allocation
of the purchase price resulted in approximately $20 million of identifiable intangible
assets, and $17 million of goodwill.

On
June 17, 2005, the Company acquired all the outstanding shares of CIVCO Holdings, Inc., a
maker of disposable diagnostic ultrasound products. The operations of CIVCO are included
in the Scientific & Industrial Imaging segment. The aggregate purchase price of the
acquisition was approximately $121 million. The allocation of the purchase price resulted
in approximately $20 million of identifiable intangible assets, and $92 million of
goodwill.

On
November 28, 2005, the Company purchased MEDTEC, Inc. which designs, develops, and
distributes enabling technologies for accurate diagnosis and treatment for cancer care.
The operations are included in the Scientific & Industrial Imaging segment. The
aggregate purchase price of the acquisition was approximately $153 million. The
preliminary allocation of the purchase price resulted in approximately $55 million of
identifiable intangible assets, and $88 million of goodwill.

On
December 13, 2004, the Company acquired all the outstanding shares of TransCore Holdings,
Inc. (“TransCore”), a leader in toll and traffic systems and processing,
security and access control and mobile asset tracking. TransCore’s principal
facilities are located in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Dallas, Texas, Albuquerque, New
Mexico, Portland, Oregon and Mississauga, Ontario. The operations of TransCore are
reported in the new RF Technology segment. There were only 18 days of sales related to
TransCore in our results for 2004.

The
aggregate gross purchase price of the TransCore acquisition was approximately $606
million of cash and includes amounts incurred for due diligence and other direct external
costs associated with the acquisition.

Roper
acquired TransCore to provide a strategic growth platform for the Company and to gain
TransCore’s base of recurring business, technical and engineering competencies and
market channels. The purchase price reflected these factors and TransCore’s
historically strong margins and operating cash flows, and its future prospects and growth
potential.

Of
the $151.0 million of acquired intangible assets, $28 million was assigned to trade names
that are not subject to amortization. The remaining $123 million of acquired intangible
assets have a weighted-average useful life of approximately 10 years. The intangible
assets that make up that amount include customer relationships of $60 million (11 year
weighted-average useful life), technology of $36 million (10 year weighted-average useful
life), backlog of $14 million (4 year weighted-average useful life) and other intangibles
of $13 million (9 year weighted-average useful life).

The
majority of the $415 million of goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax
purposes.

On
June 7, 2004, the Company purchased the assets of the power generation business of R/D
Tech which became part of our Zetec business unit which supplies non-destructive
evaluation testing, primarily for use in power generating facilities. These operations
are included in the Energy Systems and Controls segment of the business. The aggregate
purchase price of the acquisition was $39.9 million of cash and includes amounts paid to
sellers, amounts incurred for due diligence and other direct external costs associated
with the acquisition. The total assets acquired were $43.2 million, which includes $27.4
million of goodwill and the liabilities assumed were $3.3 million.

On
December 29, 2003, the company acquired all the outstanding shares of Neptune Technology
Group Holdings, Inc. (“NTGH”), a leader in the water management market. In
connection with our acquisition of NTGH, we also purchased the remaining one-third
interest in DAP Technologies, a Canadian company that manufactures fully-rugged handheld
computers, that NTGH did not own. NTGH’s principal facilities are located in
Tallassee, Alabama, Mississauga, Ontario and Quebec City, Quebec. The operations of NTGH
are reported in both the Industrial Technology and Scientific and Industrial Imaging
segments in 2004. There were no sales related to NTGH in our results for 2003.

The
aggregate purchase price of the NTGH acquisition was approximately $482 million of cash
and includes amounts paid to sellers, amounts incurred for due diligence and other direct
external costs associated with the acquisition. We also paid approximately $9.1 million
for the remaining one-third interest in DAP Technologies consisting of cash consideration
of $7.5 million and 34,000 shares of our common stock.

The
following table (in thousands) summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition. The adjustments that were

intangible assets have a weighted-average useful life of approximately 22 years. The
intangible assets that make up that amount include customer relationships of $206.2
million (23 year weighted-average useful life), technology of $10.0 million (10-year
weighted-average useful life), and software of $9.0 million (8-year weighted-average
useful life).

The

Components
of the deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31 were as follows (in thousands):

On
December 31, 2005, Roper had approximately $13 million of U.S. federal net operating loss
carryforwards, which will expire in future years, with the majority of the carryforwards
expiring in 2024. Additionally, Roper had foreign tax credit carryforwards and research
and development credit carryforwards. Roper has not recognized a valuation allowance
since management has determined that it is more likely than not that the results of
future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize these deferred tax
assets.

On
October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act (“AJCA”) was signed into
law.  The AJCA includes a deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that are
repatriated, as defined in the AJCA.  The deduction is subject to a number of
limitations and complexities, and during the past twelve months, we have been analyzing
the guidance provided by Treasury and the potential impact of applying the repatriation
provision to unremitted foreign earnings held by our various controlled foreign
corporations.  During the quarter ended December 31, 2005, management completed its
analysis of the impact of the AJCA and finalized and executed a repatriation plan. Under
this plan, we repatriated approximately $82 million of dividends during December 2005.  Accordingly,
we recorded a tax benefit of approximately $6.6 million during the fourth quarter of 2005
as a result of this repatriation.  Management obtained the requisite corporate
officer and Board of Directors approvals of the domestic reinvestment plan within
the timeframe specified.

Our
principal $1.055 billion credit facility and our $230 million senior subordinated
convertible notes provide substantially all of our daily external financing requirements.
The credit facility consists of a $655 million term loan and a $400 million revolving
loan, both maturing on December 13, 2009. The interest rate on the borrowings under the
$1.055 billion credit facility is calculated based upon various recognized indices plus a
margin as defined in the credit agreement. The interest rate on our variable rate term
loan at December 31, 2005 was 5.48%. Our senior subordinated convertible notes are due in
2034. At December 31, 2005, our debt consisted of the $230 million in senior subordinated
convertible notes, $616.8 million term loan balance, and $40.1 million in revolver loans.
The company also had $44.5 million of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2005.
We expect that our available additional borrowing capacity combined with the cash flows
expected to be generated from existing business will be sufficient to fund normal
operating requirements and finance some additional acquisitions. We also have several
smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in
various foreign locations to support our non-U.S. businesses. In total, these smaller
facilities do not represent a significant source of credit for us.

In
December 2004, the Company amended and restated its previous $625 million credit
agreement to the current $1.055 billion credit agreement to increase capacity, lower
borrowing costs, and improve other terms and conditions. Due to this amendment, the
Company incurred a $8.2 million non-cash debt extinguishment cost related to deferred
financing costs for the previous credit agreement.

In
December 2003, we issued through a public offering $230 million of 3.75% subordinated
convertible notes due in 2034 at an original issue discount of 60.498% (the “Convertible
Notes”). The Convertible Notes are subordinated in right of payment and collateral
to all of our existing and future senior debt. Interest on the notes is payable
semiannually, beginning July 15, 2004, until January 15, 2009. After that date,
we will not pay cash interest on the notes prior to maturity unless contingent cash
interest becomes payable. Instead, after January 15, 2009, interest will be
recognized at the effective rate of 3.75% and will represent accrual of original issue
discount, excluding any contingent cash interest that may become payable. We will pay
contingent cash interest to the holders of the notes during any six month period
commencing after January 15, 2009 if the average trading price of a note for a five
trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals 120%
or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and accrued cash
interest, if any, for such note. The contingent cash interest payable per note in respect
of any six month period will equal the annual rate of 0.25%. As originally issued,
holders could convert their notes into 12.422 shares of our common stock (giving effect
for the 2-for-1 stock split effective August 26, 2005), subject to adjustment, only (1)
if the sale price of our common stock reaches, or the trading price of the notes falls
below, specified thresholds, (2) if the notes are called for redemption, or (3) if
specified corporate transactions have occurred. Upon conversion, we would have the right
to deliver, in lieu of our common stock, cash or common stock or a combination of cash
and common stock. On November 19, 2004, the Company began a consent solicitation to amend
the notes such that the Company would pay the same conversion value upon conversion of
the Notes, but would change how the conversion value is paid. In lieu of receiving
exclusively shares of common stock or cash upon conversion, noteholders would receive
cash up to the value of the accreted principal amount of the Notes converted and, at the
Company’s option, any remainder of the conversion value would be paid in cash or
shares of common stock. The consent solicitation was successfully completed on December
6, 2004 and the amended conversion provisions were adopted. Holders may require us to
purchase all or a portion of their notes on January 15, 2009 at a price of $395.02 per
note, on January 15, 2014 at a price of $475.66 per note, on January 15, 2019 at a price
of $572.76 per note, on January 15, 2024 at a price of $689.68 per note, and on January
15, 2029 at a price of $830.47 per note, in each case plus accrued cash interest, if any,
and accrued contingent cash interest, if any. We may only pay the purchase price of such
notes in cash and not in common stock. In addition, if we experience a change in control,
each holder may require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of such holder’s
notes at a price equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount
for non-tax purposes, accrued cash interest, if any, and accrued contingent cash
interest, if any, to the date of purchase.

As
of September 30, 2005, our $230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes were
reclassified from long term to short term debt as the notes became convertible on October
1, 2005 based upon the Company’s common stock trading above the trigger price for at
least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading-day period ending on September
30, 2005. In addition, deferred financing costs related to the notes of approximately
$3.9 million was expensed in 2005. These expenses were previously being amortized to the
first put date of the notes, which is January 15, 2009.

Our
credit facility requires us to prepay the term loan and, in certain cases, reduce the
commitments under the revolving loan, upon the receipt of certain proceeds, including
from certain asset sales, the incurrence of certain debt, and up to 75% of our excess
cash flows unless we meet a consolidated total leverage ratio test. We are also required
to make quarterly principal payments on the term loans.

The
facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants which, among other things,
limit our ability to incur new debt, prepay subordinated debt, make certain investments
and acquisitions, sell assets and grant liens, make restricted payments (including the
payment of dividends on our common stock) and capital expenditures, or change our line of
business. We also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our
consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio.
The most restrictive covenant is the consolidated total leverage ratio which, as defined
in the credit agreement, is limited to 4.25 until December 31, 2005, declining by 0.25
each year over the remaining term of the agreement.

At
December 31, 2005, and 2004, the Company was in compliance with its restrictive
covenants.

Retirement and Other
Benefit Plans

Roper
maintains four defined contribution retirement plans under the provisions of Section
401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code covering substantially all U.S. employees not subject
to collective bargaining agreements. Roper partially matches employee contributions. Its
costs related to these plans were $9,306,000, $7,548,000 and $5,156,000 for 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively.

Roper
also maintains various defined benefit retirement plans covering employees of non-U.S.
subsidiaries and a plan that supplements certain employees for the contribution ceiling
applicable to the Section 401(k) plans. The costs and accumulated benefit obligations
associated with each of these plans were not material.

Pursuant
to the fiscal 2002 Zetec acquisition, Roper agreed to assume a defined benefit pension
plan covering certain U.S. employees. Roper has obtained the necessary regulatory
approvals to terminate the plan and all plan assets were distributed during 2004.

All
U.S. and Canada employees are eligible to participate in Roper’s stock purchase plan
whereby they may designate up to 10% of eligible earnings to purchase Roper’s common
stock at a 10% discount to the average closing price of its common stock at the beginning
and end of a quarterly offering period. The common stock sold to the employees may be
either treasury stock, stock purchased on the open market, or newly issued shares. During
2005, 2004 and 2003, participants of the employee stock purchase plan purchased 41,000,
34,000 and 22,000 shares, respectively, of Roper’s common stock for total
consideration of $1,315,000, $826,000, and $378,000, respectively. All of these shares
were purchased from Roper’s treasury shares.

Stock-Based
Compensation

Roper
has two stock incentive plans (the “1991 Plan” and the “2000 Plan”)
which authorize the issuance of shares of common stock to certain directors, key
employees, and consultants of Roper as incentive and/or nonqualified stock options,
restricted stock, stock appreciation rights or equivalent instruments. Stock options
under both plans are typically granted at prices not less than 100% of market value of
the underlying stock at the date of grant. Stock options typically vest over a period of
up to five years. Options may no longer be granted under the 1991 Plan. A total of
5,000,000 shares have been reserved in the 2000 Plan for issuance as incentive equity
stock awards. The 2000 Plan has no expiration date for the granting of options and had
the capacity to grant an additional 694,000 and 1,864,000 options or equivalent
instruments at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Non-employee
directors of Roper are eligible to receive stock options for its common stock. These
stock options are accounted for the same as stock options granted to employees. Roper has
never issued stock options other than those issued to employees or its non-employee
directors.

Roper
also has a stock compensation plan for non-employee directors (the “Non-employee
Director Plan”). In 2003, 2004, and 2005 the Plan provided 4,000 restricted or
deferred stock awards to each non-employee director. The restrictions on 50% of the
restricted and deferred stock awards lapse upon continuous service for six months
following the grant, and the restrictions on the remaining 50% lapse upon continuous
service for one year following the award. At December 31, 2005, and 2004, respectively,
the Non-Employee Director Plan had the capacity to grant an additional 50,000 and 90,000
options or grants.

options outstanding shown adjusted for effect of the 2-for-1 stock split at December 31,

Common Stock
Transactions

On
July 27, 2005, the Company declared a two-for-one split of its common stock. The split
was effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend paid on August 26, 2005 to shareholders
of record at the end of business on August 12, 2005. All historical weighted average
share and per share amounts and all references to stock compensation data and market
prices of the Company’s common stock for all periods presented have been adjusted to
reflect this two-for-one stock split.

Roper’s
restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that each outstanding share of Roper’s
common stock entitles the holder thereof to five votes per share, except that holders of
outstanding shares with respect to which there has been a change in beneficial ownership
during the four years immediately preceding the applicable record date will be entitled
to one vote per share.

Roper
has a Shareholder Rights Plan whereby one Preferred Stock Purchase Right (a “Right”)
accompanies each outstanding share of common stock. Such Rights only become exercisable,
or transferable apart from the common stock, ten business days after a person or group
acquires various specified levels of beneficial ownership, with or without the Board’s
consent. Each Right may be exercised to acquire one one-thousandth of a newly issued
share of Roper’s Series A Preferred Stock, at an exercise price of $170, subject to
adjustment. Alternatively, upon the occurrence of certain specified events, the Rights
allow holders to purchase Roper’s common stock having a market value at such time of
twice the Right’s exercise price. The Rights may be redeemed by Roper at a
redemption price of $0.01 per Right at any time until the tenth business day following
public announcement that a 20% position has been acquired or 10 business days after
commencement of a tender or exchange offer. The Rights expire on January 8, 2006.

Concurrent
with the TransCore Holdings, Inc. acquisition in December 2004, the Company completed a
public offering of 5,000,000 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately
$300.5 million. On December 28, 2004, an underwriters’ overallotment of 115,000
shares of common stock was exercised and closed, providing the Company with gross
proceeds of approximately $6.9 million before expenses.

Concurrent
with the NTGH acquisition in December 2003, the Company completed a public offering of
4,200,000 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $201.6 million. In
connection with our acquisition of NTGH, we also purchased the remaining one-third
interest in DAP Technologies that NTGH did not own. Part of the consideration for this
one-third interest consisted of 34,000 shares of the Company’s treasury shares. In
January 2004, an underwriters’ overallotment of 630,000 shares of common stock was
exercised and closed, providing the Company with gross proceeds of approximately $30.2
million before expenses.

(13)

Contingencies

Roper,
in the ordinary course of business, is the subject of, or a party to, various pending or
threatened legal actions, including those pertaining to product liability and employment
practices. It is vigorously contesting all lawsuits that, in general, are based upon
claims of the kind that have been customary over the past several years. After analyzing
the Company’s contingent liabilities on a gross basis and, based upon past
experience with resolution of its product liability and employment practices claims and
the limits of the primary, excess, and umbrella liability insurance coverages that are
available with respect to pending claims, management believes that adequate provision has
been made to cover any potential liability not covered by insurance, and that the
ultimate liability, if any, arising from these actions should not have a material adverse
effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows of
Roper.

Over
recent years there has been a significant increase in certain U.S. states in
asbestos-related litigation claims against numerous industrial companies. Roper or its
subsidiaries have been named defendants in some such cases. No significant resources have
been required by Roper to respond to these cases and Roper believes it has valid defenses
to such claims and, if required, intends to defend them vigorously. Given the state of
these claims it is not possible to determine the potential liability, if any.

Roper’s
rent expense was approximately $17.6 million, $15.2 million and $11.6 million for fiscal
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Roper’s future minimum lease commitments totaled
$76.5 million at December 31, 2005. These commitments included $17.1 million in fiscal
2006, $13.8 million in fiscal 2007, $10.6 million in fiscal 2008, $8.5 million in fiscal
2009, $6.1 million in fiscal 2010 and $20.4 million thereafter.

Segment and
Geographic Area Information

Roper
operations are aligned into five market-focused segments to capture value-creating
opportunities around common customers, market orientation, sales channels and common cost
opportunities. The five segments are: Instrumentation; Industrial Technology; Energy
Systems and Controls, Scientific and Industrial Imaging, and RF Technology. Our
Instrumentation segment offers equipment and consumables for materials analysis, fluid
properties testing and industrial leak testing. Products included within the Industrial
Technology segment are industrial pumps, flow measurement and metering equipment, and
industrial valves and controls. The Energy Systems and Controls segment’s products
include control systems, machinery vibration and other non-destructive inspection and
measurement products and services. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment offers
high performance digital imaging products and software, patient positioning products and
software in medical applications and handheld computers and software. The RF Technology
segment includes products and systems related to comprehensive toll and traffic systems,
security and access control, mobile asset tracking and water sub-metering and remote
temperature monitoring applications. Roper’s management structure and internal
reporting are also aligned consistent with these five segments.

There
were no material transactions between Roper’s business segments during 2005, 2004
and 2003. Sales between geographic areas are primarily of finished products and are
accounted for at prices intended to represent third-party prices. Operating profit by
business segment and by geographic area is defined as sales less operating costs and
expenses. These costs and expenses do not include unallocated corporate administrative
expenses. Items below income from operations on Roper’s statement of earnings are
not allocated to business segments.

Identifiable
assets are those assets used primarily in the operations of each business segment or
geographic area. Corporate assets were principally comprised of cash, recoverable
insurance claims, deferred compensation assets, unamortized deferred financing costs and
property and equipment.

Selected
financial information by business segment for 2005, 2004 and 2003 follows (in thousands):

Summarized
data for Roper’s U.S. and foreign operations (principally in Canada, Europe and
Japan) for 2005, 2004 and 2003, based upon the country of origin of the Roper entity
making the sale, were as follows (in thousands):

Export
sales from the United States during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were
$232 million, $188 million and $216 million, respectively. In the year ended December 31,
2005, these exports were shipped primarily to Europe (27%), Canada (16%), Asia (excluding
the Middle East) (20%), Middle East (10%), Japan (8%), and other (19%).

Sales
to customers outside the United States accounted for a significant portion of Roper’s
revenues. Sales are attributed to geographic areas based upon the location where the
product is ultimately shipped. Foreign countries that accounted for at least 5% of Roper’s
net sales in any of the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 have been
individually identified in the following table (in thousands). Other countries have been
grouped by region.

Discontinued
Operations

In
connection with the realignment of our businesses during the first quarter of fiscal
2003, the Company formalized its decision to offer for sale the Petrotech operation.
Accordingly, related operating results reported as discontinued operations are outlined

The
Petrotech operation was previously reported in the Company’s Industrial Controls
segment prior to the segment realignment. Petrotech was sold on August 31, 2003.

(16)

Concentration of Risk

Financial
instruments which potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist primarily of
cash, cash equivalents and trade receivables.

The
Company maintains cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions.
Cash equivalents include investments in commercial paper of companies with high credit
ratings, investments in money market securities and securities backed by the U.S.
Government. At times such amounts may exceed the F.D.I.C. limits. The Company limits the
amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution and believes that no
significant concentration of credit risk exists with respect to cash investments.

Trade
receivables subject the company to the potential for credit risk with customers. To
reduce credit risk, the Company performs ongoing evaluations of its customers’ financial
condition.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND
DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

There have been no changes in
accountants or disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosures.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES

Management’s Report
on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate control over financial reporting, as such term is
defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control-Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in

Internal Control-Integrated
Framework

, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting
was effective as of December 31, 2005. Our management’s assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 has
been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting
firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.

Management excluded Inovonics, CIVCO
and MEDTEC from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2005 because they were acquired by the Company in purchase business combinations
during 2005. Inovonics, CIVCO and MEDTEC are wholly-owned subsidiaries whose total assets
represent 1.8%, 4.9% and 6.3%, respectively, and whose total revenues represent 2.0%, 1.3%
and 0.3%, respectively , of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2005.

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures

As required by Securities and
Exchange Commission rules, we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this
report. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer. Based on this evaluation, we have concluded that the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

Disclosure controls and procedures
are our controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without
limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act are
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.

Control over Financial Reporting

There was no change in the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth
quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
