PART I

ITEM 1.   
BUSINESS

Roper Industries, Inc.
(“Roper”) designs, manufactures and distributes specialty industrial
controls, fluid handling and analytical instrumentation products worldwide,
serving selected segments of a broad range of markets such as oil & gas,
scientific research, medical diagnostics, semiconductor, refrigeration,
petrochemical processing, large diesel engine and turbine/compressor control
applications, automotive, water and wastewater, power generation, and
agricultural irrigation industries.

Roper pursues consistent
and sustainable growth in sales and earnings by operating and acquiring
businesses that manufacture and sell high value-added, highly engineered
industrial products that are capable of achieving and maintaining high margins.
This strategy continually emphasizes (i) increasing market share and market
expansion, (ii) new product development, (iii) improving productivity and
reducing costs and (iv) acquisition of similar businesses. See
“MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Year Ended October 31, 2000 Compared to Year
Ended October 31, 1999 (i) and (ii) — Year Ended October 31, 1999
Compared to Year Ended October 31, 1998.”

Market Share, Market
Expansion and Product Development.

Roper competes in many narrowly defined
niche markets. Its position in these markets is typically as the market leader
or as a competitive alternate to the market leader. In those markets where Roper
is regionally dominant it seeks to sustain growth through geographic expansion
of its marketing efforts and the development of new products for associated
markets.

Roper continued its growth
in fiscal 2000 principally by new business and product-line acquisitions. In the
Industrial Controls segment, Hansen Technologies was acquired in September 2000.
Roper acquired two new Fluid Handling segment companies in February 2000;
Flowdata, which was merged with Flow Technology, and Cybor, now operated as a
division of Integrated Designs. A new industrial pump company also was added to
the segment in May 2000 with the acquisition of Abel Pump. In August 2000, Antek
Instruments was acquired to complement the Analytical Instrumentation
segment’s Petroleum Analyzer business.

In addition to the new
business acquisitions, an electron microscopy accessories product-line was
acquired to extend Gatan’s business, and the European distribution rights
to Compressor Controls’ products and services were also acquired from
Honeywell International, Inc. and its affiliates.

These new business
acquisitions and business expansion transactions were financed principally from
borrowings and represented a combined investment of approximately $161.5
million. Roper’s debt under its primary credit facility was $232.6 million
at October 31, 2000 and $109.0 million at October 31, 1999. Total debt was 47%
and 36% of total capitalization at October 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Roper believes it is well positioned for additional new business and other
business acquisitions.


International Sales.

Sales outside the United States continue to play an important part in
Roper’s overall operating results, including U.S.-based businesses. In
fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998, Roper’s net sales outside the U.S. were 52%,
51% and 50%, respectively, of total net sales. Information regarding
international operations is set forth in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
(“Annual Report”).

Research and
Development.

Roper conducts applied research and development to improve the
quality and performance of its products, to develop new products and to enter
new markets. Research and development performed by Roper often includes
extensive field testing of its products. Roper expensed $22.6 million, $16.7
million and $18.0 million in the years ended October 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively, on research and development activities.

INDUSTRIAL
CONTROLS

The Industrial Controls
segment’s principal products include a wide variety of machinery and other
industrial valves, controls, control systems and measurement and monitoring
instruments which are manufactured and distributed by five U.S.-based, and one
European-based, operating companies. Selected financial information for the
Industrial Controls segment is set forth in Note 13 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This
segment’s principal sales and services consist of: (i) rotating machinery
control systems and panels (ii) industrial valve, control and measurement
products, (iii) vibration instrumentation and (iv) design, build, construct and
install services.

Rotating Machinery
Control Systems and Panels.

Roper manufactures control systems and panels,
and provides related engineering and commissioning services, for applications
involving compressors, turbines, and engines in the oil & gas, pipeline,
power generation and marine industries.

Industrial Valve,
Control and Measurement Products.

Roper manufactures a variety of valve,
sensor, switch and control products used on engines, compressors, turbines and
other powered equipment for the oil & gas, pipeline, power generation,
refrigeration, marine and general industrial markets. Most of these products are
designed for use in hazardous environments.

Vibration
Instrumentation.

Roper manufactures industrial vibration sensors, switches
and transmitters for use in the broad industrial controls market. Their
applications typically involve turbomachinery, engines, compressors, fans and/or
pumps.

and Construction Services.

Roper provides specialized technical services to
the product markets described above and thus offers turnkey solution capability
to its customers. Services offered include engineering design, procurement,
packaging and on-site installation.


Those classes of products
within the Industrial Controls segment that accounted for at least 10% of
Roper’s consolidated net sales in any of the periods presented below were
as follows (in thousands):

Year ended October 31,




Rotating machinery control systems and panels

$91,409

$78,979

$93,540

Industrial valve, control and measurement products

27,996

25,123

32,298

The following chart shows
the breakdown of sales by market for fiscal 2000 for the Industrial Controls
segment:

Backlog.

The majority of this
segment’s business consists of large engineered oil &gas development and
transmission projects with lead times of three-to-nine months. Standard products
generally ship within two weeks of receipt of order, while shipment of orders for
specialty products varies according to the complexity of the product and availability of
the required components. Roper enters into blanket purchase orders for the manufacture of
products for certain original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and end-users
over periods of time specified by such customers. The segment’s backlog of firm
unfilled orders, including blanket purchase orders, totaled $29.2 million at October 31,
2000 compared to $29.3 million as of October 31, 1999.

Distribution and Sales.

Distribution
and sales occur through direct sales offices, manufacturer’s representatives and
industrial machinery distributors.

Customers.

Each of
Roper’s business units sells to a variety of customers worldwide. RAO
Gazprom (“Gazprom”), a large Russian natural gas company, was the
biggest single customer in this segment for the year, contributing approximately
21% of segment sales in fiscal 2000, and has indicated its interest to continue
purchases of control systems for several years by agreeing to extend its
existing supply agreement through 2007 to purchase an additional $150 million of
control system products and services. However, continuation of this business at
expected levels will continue to be subject to numerous commercial and political
risks beyond Roper’s control and cannot be assured. See
“MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Forward Looking Information”.


FLUID HANDLING

The Fluid Handling
segment’s principal products include general and specialty pumps and a
range of flow metering products which are manufactured and distributed by five
U.S.-based, and one European-based, operating units. Selected financial
information for the Fluid Handling segment is set forth in Note 13 of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
This segment’s principal products consist of (i) general industrial pumps,
(ii) integrated dispense systems and (iii) flow metering products.

General Industrial

Pumps.

Roper manufactures a variety of general industrial pumps including
(i) rotary gear pumps which operate on the principle of two gears intermeshing
and are primarily used for pumping particle-free viscous liquids such as oil and
certain fluid products, and specialty rotary gear pumps such as lubricating oil
pumps for diesel engines and fuel distribution devices, (ii) progressing cavity
pumps whose pumping elements consist of a steel rotor within an elastomeric
stator and which are used primarily for handling viscous liquids with suspended
solids and abrasive materials, such as Roper’s “mud motor” used
in the oil & gas industry for directional drilling, (iii) centrifugal pumps
which are used for pumping water and other low-viscosity liquids in
agricultural, industrial and municipal applications, (iv) membrane and piston
pumps which transport high solids content slurries used in a variety of
industries including municipal, mining, ceramics, and food, (v) high-pressure
piston pumps used in marine, food, and municipal applications, and (vi)
piston-type metering pumps able to handle most types of chemicals and fluids
within low-flow applications and used principally in the medical diagnostics,
chemical processing, food processing and agricultural industries.

Integrated

Dispense and Chemical Management Systems for Semiconductor Applications.

Roper’s microprocessor-based integrated dispense systems are used
principally in the semiconductor industry to dispense chemicals in a precise and
repeatable fashion during the wafer fabrication process. These highly reliable
dispense units either incorporate no mechanical displacement, utilizing the
application of electronically regulated pressure, or utilize positive
displacement technology. Cabinet based systems manage the distributions of bulk
chemicals used in wafer fabrication to equipment such as the dispense systems
mentioned above.

Flow Metering Products.

Roper manufactures turbine flow meters, positive displacement meters,
emissions measurement equipment and flow meter calibration products for the
aerospace, automotive and other industrial applications.


Those classes of products
within the Fluid Handling segment that accounted for at least 10% of
Roper’s consolidated net sales in any of the periods presented below were
as follows (in thousands):

Year ended October 31,




General industrial pumps

$78,955

$76,193

$72,095

The following chart shows
the breakdown of Fluid Handling segment sales by market for fiscal 2000:

Backlog.

The Fluid Handling
companies’ sales also reflect a combination of standard products and
specifically engineered, application-specific products. Standard products are
typically shipped within two weeks of receipt of order. Application-specific
products typically ship within six-to-twelve weeks following receipt of order,
although larger project orders and blanket purchase orders for certain OEMs may
extend for longer periods. This segment’s backlog of firm unfilled orders,
including blanket purchase orders, totaled $26.1 million at October 31, 2000
compared to $14.4 million as of October 31, 1999. The increase was attributed to
both improved business conditions throughout the segment and new business
acquisitions.

Distribution and Sales.

Distribution
and sales occur through direct sales personnel, manufacturer’s representatives and
stocking and non-stocking distributors.

Customers.

Several
of the Fluid Handling segment’s companies have sales to one or a few
customers that represent a significant portion of that company’s sales and
the relative importance of such a concentrated customer base for these companies
is expected to continue. However, no customer was responsible for as much as 10%
of the segment’s fiscal 2000 net sales.


ANALYTICAL
INSTRUMENTATION

The Analytical
Instrumentation segment offers several lines of imaging products, testing and
analysis products, and microscopy specimen preparation and handling products
that are manufactured and distributed by ten U.S.-based, and two European-based,
operating companies.

Selected financial information for the Analytical
Instrumentation segment is set forth in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This
segment’s principal products consist of (i) digital imaging products, (ii)
industrial leak-testing products, (iii) industrial fluid properties testing
products, (iv) microscopy specimen preparation/handling products and (v)
spectroscopy products.

Digital Imaging

$135,406

$89,739

$65,576

Industrial fluid properties testing products

51,499

27,300

14,891

The following chart shows
the breakdown of Analytical Instrumentation segment sales by market for fiscal
2000:

Backlog.

The Analytical
Instrumentation companies have lead times of up to several months on many of their
product sales, although standard products are often shipped within four weeks of receipt
of order. Blanket purchase orders are placed by certain OEMs and end-users, with
continuing requirements for fulfillment over specified periods of time. The segment’s
backlog of firm unfilled orders, including blanket purchase orders, totaled $54.6 million
at October 31, 2000 compared to $30.0 million as of October 31, 1999. Approximately half
of the year-over-year increase was attributed to the fiscal 2000 acquisitions and the
balance to general strength in the fiscal 2000 fourth quarter.

Distribution and Sales.

Distribution
and sales are achieved through a combination of manufacturers’ representatives, agents,
distributors and direct sales offices in both the U.S. and various leading industrial
nations.


Customers.

Each of
the companies in the Analytical Instrumentation segment sells to a variety of
customers worldwide, with certain major OEMs in the automotive, medical
diagnostics and microscopy industries having operations globally. No segment
customer accounted for as much as 10% of the segment’s sales.

MATERIALS AND
SUPPLIERS

Most materials and supplies
used by Roper are believed to be readily available from numerous sources and
suppliers throughout the world which are believed adequate for their needs. Some
high-performance components for digital imaging products can be in short supply
and Roper continuously investigates and identifies alternative sources where
possible. Roper believes this condition equally affects its competitors and,
thus far, it has not had a significant adverse effect on sales.

ENVIRONMENTAL
MATTERS AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION

Roper is subject to
environmental laws and regulations concerning emissions to the air, discharges
to waterways and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment
and disposal of waste materials. These laws and regulations are constantly
changing and it is impossible to predict with accuracy the effect they may have
on Roper in the future. It is Roper’s policy to comply with all applicable
environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.

Roper is subject to various
U.S. and foreign federal, state and local laws affecting its businesses, as well
as a variety of regulations relating to such matters as working conditions and
product safety. A variety of state laws regulate Roper’s contractual
relationships with its distributors and manufacturers’ representatives,
some of which impose substantive standards on these relationships.

COMPETITION

Roper has significant
competition from a limited number of companies in each of its markets. No single
competitor competes with Roper over a significant number of product lines.
Roper’s products compete primarily on the basis of performance, innovation
and price.

PATENTS AND
TRADEMARKS

Roper owns the rights under
a number of patents and trademarks relating to certain of its products and
businesses. While it believes that none of its companies is substantially
dependent on any single, or group, of patents, trademarks or other items of
intellectual property rights, the product development and market activities of
Compressor Controls, Gatan, Integrated Designs, MASD and Roper Scientific, in
particular, have been planned and conducted in conjunction with important and
continuing patent strategies. Compressor Controls has been granted a series of
U.S. and associated foreign patents and a significant portion of its fiscal 2000
sales of Compressor Controls-manufactured products was of equipment which
incorporated innovations that are the subject of several such patents which will
not begin to expire until 2004. Integrated Designs was granted a U.S. patent in
1994 related to methods and apparatus claims embodied in its integrated dispense
systems which accounted for the majority of its fiscal 2000 sales. The U.S.
patent will expire in 2011.


EMPLOYEES

As of October 31, 2000,
Roper had approximately 2,600 total employees, of whom approximately 2,000 were
located in the United States.

ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES

Roper’s corporate
offices, consisting of 9,500 square feet of leased space, are located near
Athens, Georgia. Roper has established sales and service locations around the
world to support its operating units. The principal operating company properties
are on the table that follows.

Roper considers each
facility to be in good operating condition and adequate for its present use and
believes that it has sufficient plant capacity to meet its current and
anticipated operating requirements.

Year Ended
October 31, 2000 Compared to Year Ended October 31, 1999

Net sales for fiscal 2000
of $503.8 million, a 24% increase compared to the prior year, was the eighth
consecutive year Roper established a record high. Excluding net sales to RAO
Gazprom (“Gazprom”), a large Russian natural gas company, net sales
increased 26% in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999. Net sales for fiscal 2000
were 1% less than pro forma net sales for fiscal 1999 (assuming fiscal 2000
acquisitions occurred at the same time in fiscal 1999).

Net sales for Roper’s
Analytical Instrumentation segment increased 50%, mostly the result of business
acquisitions (Petroleum Analyzer, MASD, Antek Instruments and other smaller
businesses). This segment’s net sales were 2% less than the prior
year’s pro forma net sales largely from lower comparative sales in fluid
properties test equipment markets.

Net sales for Roper’s
Fluid Handling segment increased 23%, mostly the result of business acquisitions
(Flowdata, Cybor and Abel Pump) and a very strong fiscal 2000 for this
segment’s semiconductor-related business. This segment’s net sales
were 6% higher than pro forma net sales for fiscal 1999. Fluid Handling’s
historical semiconductor business increased its net sales in fiscal 2000 by 81%
(partly from favorable comparisons to reported net sales in the first half of
fiscal 1999) and its recently-acquired business increased its net sales by 51%
compared to the same period in the prior year. Fiscal 2000 net sales for this
segment’s centrifugal pump business decreased 19% compared to the prior
year due to weak agricultural and water/wastewater markets. Agricultural markets
were adversely impacted by widespread drought conditions and low commodity
prices in the United States. Roper believes the municipal water and wastewater
markets were adversely affected by resources diverted to minimize Y2K exposures
early in the fiscal year, and its centrifugal pump business had increased
exposure to these markets as it developed larger pumps to pursue more lucrative
projects. Fluid Handling’s piston metering pumps business’ net sales
were also down 15% compared to fiscal 1999 as this company’s largest
customer reduced its purchases until it resolves an FDA compliance problem
unrelated to this company’s products. This company does not expect
shipments to this customer to return to previous levels in the near future.

Net sales for Roper’s
Industrial Controls segment decreased less than 1% in fiscal 2000 compared to
fiscal 1999 and fiscal 2000 net sales were 3% less than pro forma fiscal 1999
net sales. The timing of this segment’s primary fiscal 2000 acquisition
(Hansen Technologies) was such that it did not significantly affect fiscal 2000
results. This segment was significantly influenced by conditions in the
exploration and production sectors of the oil & gas industry. Roper believes
several large oil & gas business combinations early in the year delayed
capital spending programs, and spending had yet to recover from the effects of
relatively low oil and natural gas prices throughout much of fiscal 1999.
Throughout fiscal 2000, net sales each quarter (excluding sales to Gazprom)
improved in comparison to the same quarter of fiscal 1999. Whereas these first
quarter net sales were down 22% compared to the prior year, fourth quarter net
sales (also excluding Hansen Technologies) were up 13%. Net sales to Gazprom of
$33.9 million in fiscal 2000 were comparable to fiscal 1999 net sales of $35.0
million.


The gross profit percentage
for the Analytical Instrumentation segment decreased to 54.4% in fiscal 2000
compared to 56.3% in fiscal 1999. This decrease arose mostly from the inclusion
of MASD for most of fiscal 2000. If MASD’s results were excluded from the
segment’s results in fiscal 2000, the segment’s gross profit
percentage was 55.9%.

Selling, general and
administrative (“SG&A) expenses as a percentage of net sales in fiscal
2000 and fiscal 1999 are presented in the following table.

SG&A expenses increased
as a percentage of net sales for Roper as a whole because of the increased costs
in the Fluid Handling segment and the increased size of the Analytical
Instrumentation segment with its relatively high level of SG&A expenses
compared to Roper’s other business segments.

SG&A expenses for the
Fluid Handling segment increased as a percentage of net sales mostly due to
relatively high cost structures of recent acquisitions, particularly Abel Pump
and Flowdata. Roper expects to bring these cost structures more in line with the
segment’s other businesses. Another significant reason for this
segment’s increased SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales was the
adverse leverage associated with the decline in the segment’s centrifugal
pump business combined with the added costs of this business moving into a
larger facility early in fiscal 2000.

Interest expense was $13.5
million in fiscal 2000 compared to $7.3 million in fiscal 1999. Interest expense
was higher in fiscal 2000 due primarily to the borrowings associated with the
numerous acquisitions that occurred during fiscal 1999 and especially during
fiscal 2000. All of these acquisitions, representing total costs of
approximately $200 million during these two fiscal years, were paid for with
cash provided by Roper’s then-existing credit facilities.

The provision for income
taxes was 35.1% of pretax earnings in fiscal 2000 compared to 34.5% in fiscal
1999. The increase in the effective income tax rate was due to several of the
recent acquisitions located in relatively high income tax rate jurisdictions and
the amortization of some of the excess of the purchase price over the net assets
acquired (“goodwill”) which was not deductible for income tax
purposes.

Roper’s other
components of comprehensive earnings in fiscal 2000 were currency translation
adjustments resulting from net assets denominated in currencies other than the
U.S. dollar. These net assets were primarily denominated in Euros, British
pounds or Japanese yen. The U.S. dollar strengthened against each of these
currencies during fiscal 2000, but especially against the Euro and particularly
during Roper’s fourth quarter of fiscal 2000. During fiscal 2000,
Roper’s consolidated net assets decreased $6.7 million ($4.1 million in the
fourth quarter) due to foreign currency translation adjustments. Roper’s
goodwill denominated in non-U.S. currencies also decreased by $6.7 million due
to currency translation adjustments. Therefore, the impact of foreign currency
translation adjustments during fiscal 2000 on Roper’s future cash flows is
expected to be immaterial to Roper’s future cash flows.


The following table
summarizes Roper’s net sales orders and sales order backlog information (in
thousands). The pro forma amounts include comparable time periods for those
companies acquired during fiscal 2000.

The increase in Analytical
Instrumentation’s net sales orders in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999
pro forma net sales orders was mostly due to an 8% increase in the
segment’s digital imaging businesses and a 20% increase in its spectroscopy
business (which was influenced by the strong semiconductor industry).

The increase in Fluid
Handling’s net sales orders in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 pro
forma net sales orders was mostly due to continued strength in the
segment’s semiconductor-related businesses, whose net sales orders
increased 68%.

Year Ended
October 31, 1999 Compared to Year Ended October 31, 1998

Net sales for fiscal 1999
of $407.3 million represented the seventh consecutive year that Roper
established a record high. Net sales, excluding sales to Gazprom, increased 7%
for the year ended October 31, 1999 compared to the year ended October 31, 1998.
Total Industrial Controls net sales decreased 10% due mostly to difficult market
conditions throughout the oil & gas industry as oil and natural gas prices
were at historical lows in the early part of fiscal 1999, and consolidation
within the industry. Each of these factors caused reductions in capital spending
by Roper’s customers during fiscal 1999. Net sales to Gazprom were $35.0
million for the year ended October 31, 1999, down 16% from fiscal 1998, as a
result of dropping certain low margin, pass-through products from the contract.
Total Analytical Instrumentation net sales increased 32% due to full-year
contributions from the fiscal 1998 acquisitions of Acton Research (February
1998) and Photometrics (March 1998), the partial-year contribution from the
fiscal 1999 Petroleum Analyzer acquisitions (June 1999) and improved market
conditions for the segment’s digital imaging business. On a pro forma
basis, Analytical Instrumentation net sales increased 11% in fiscal 1999
compared to the prior year. Total Fluid Handling net sales decreased 1% in
fiscal 1999 compared to fiscal 1998. Poor semiconductor equipment industry
conditions that affected the Fluid Handling segment primarily in the first half
of fiscal 1999 offset the strength in the segment’s centrifugal pump
business as several new product offerings were very well received by the market.


Industrial Controls’
gross profit percentage increased 1.7 points in fiscal 1999 compared to the
prior year. The major reason for the increase was the elimination of certain
low-margin business with Gazprom in fiscal 1999. Analytical
Instrumentation’s gross profit also increased 1.7 points in fiscal 1999
compared to the prior year. The major contributors to this increase were a $1.9
million inventory write-down in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998, the
realization of cost structure improvements at those businesses acquired over the
past two years and volume leverage. Fluid Handling’s gross profit increased
3.1 points in fiscal 1999 compared to the prior year. This gain resulted from a
number of factors, including improved product mix in fiscal 1999 from larger
diameter centrifugal pumps, an improved power generation market, the leverage of
improved semiconductor industry conditions in the second half of fiscal 1999,
and improved cost structures throughout the segment. Every one of this
segment’s businesses improved gross margins in fiscal 1999 compared to
fiscal 1998. In addition, the improved consolidated gross profit percentage of
2.6 points in fiscal 1999 was due mostly to increased higher-margin Analytical
Instrumentation sales.

SG&A expenses increased
6% in fiscal 1999 compared to the year ended October 31, 1998 mostly due to the
partial year costs associated with Petroleum Analyzer. As a percentage of sales,
these costs were 33% in fiscal 1999 compared to 32% in fiscal 1998. This
increase was attributed mostly to the increased size of the Analytical
Instrumentation segment, whose businesses typically have higher engineering and
amortization costs compared to Roper’s other business segments. Analytical
Instrumentation’s SG&A costs were 38% and 40% of sales in fiscal 1999
and 1998, respectively. Comparative percentages for the Industrial Controls and
Fluid Handling segments were each within 1 point for these years. Excluding $3.8
million of Russian-related reserves recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal
1998 in the Industrial Controls segment, this segment’s SG&A costs were
about the same in fiscal 1999 as in fiscal 1998.

Interest expense was 8%
lower during the year ended October 31, 1999 compared to fiscal 1998, with lower
interest rates throughout most of fiscal 1999 as compared to fiscal 1998. The
German revolving credit facility opened in June 1999 also accrued interest at a
relatively low rate compared to U.S. borrowings. Average debt levels were about
4% higher in fiscal 1999 compared to the prior year.

The effective income tax
rate was 34.5% for the year ended October 31, 1999 and 34.1% for the year ended
October 31, 1998. The differences between the statutory income tax rate and the
effective income tax rate for these years were not considered significant.

Average outstanding shares
were less in fiscal 1999 than fiscal 1998 as a result of the repurchase of 1.2
million shares by Roper during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998 through the
second quarter of fiscal 1999. The buy-back program was terminated in May 1999.


Other components of
comprehensive earnings represented the change in cumulative translation
adjustments related to the net assets of non-U.S. subsidiaries whose functional
currency was not the U.S. dollar. The net change during each of fiscal 1999 and
fiscal 1998 was related to Roper’s subsidiaries in Europe and Japan.

Net cash provided by
operating activities declined by $24.7 million, or 31%, primarily as a result of
a $10.6 million increase in accounts receivable as compared to a $12.7 million
decrease in the fiscal years ended October 31, 1999 and October 31, 1998,
respectively. The reduction in 1998 was attributable to exceptional Gazprom cash
receipts and the increase in 1999 arose primarily at Roper Scientific and
Integrated Designs largely as a result of increased fourth quarter business
levels.

On a pro forma basis to
include fiscal 1999 acquisitions for the comparable prior year period,
Analytical Instrumentation’s net sales orders and sales order backlog were
up 8% and down 7%, respectively, in fiscal 1999 compared to fiscal 1998.
Consolidated pro forma net sales orders and sales order backlog were down 3% and
down 12%, respectively. Actual compared to pro forma results were about the same
for the Fluid Handling and Industrial Controls segments. The 33% increase in
Analytical Instrumentation’s net sales orders was due to the full-year
contributions of Acton Research and Photometrics, the partial-year contribution
of Petroleum Analyzer and strengthened digital imaging markets in fiscal 1999
(which also accounts for the pro forma increase). Fluid Handling’s net
sales orders increased from its stronger centrifugal pump business and the
increased sales order backlog reflected much better semiconductor industry
conditions. Decreased Industrial Controls’ net sales orders reflected weak
oil & gas industry conditions.

Financial
Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources

Working capital was $129.5
million at October 31, 2000 compared to $89.6 million at October 31, 1999. Total
debt was $241.3 million at October 31, 2000 (47% of total capital) compared to
$130.5 million at October 31, 1999 (36% of total capital). Roper’s
increased financial leverage at October 31, 2000 compared to the prior year was
due to the additional borrowings incurred to fund fiscal 2000 business
acquisitions.


Roper’s principal $275
million credit facility with a group of banks provides most of its daily
external financing requirements, consisting of revolving loans, swing line loans
and letters of credit. This facility also provides that up to $75 million of
borrowings may be denominated in designated non-U.S. currencies. At October 31,
2000, $79.0 million of U.S. denominated borrowings and the equivalent of $28.6
million of non-U.S. denominated borrowings were outstanding under this facility.
Total unused availability under this facility was $166.6 million at October 31,
2000. This facility matures May 2005.

Roper’s outstanding
indebtedness at October 31, 2000 also included $125 million of term notes. One
set of notes totaling $40 million bears interest at 7.58% and matures May 2007.
The other set of notes totaling $85 million bears interest at 7.68% and matures
May 2010. Neither set of notes requires sinking fund payments.

Roper’s other
outstanding indebtedness at October 31, 2000 totaled $8.7 million. $6.4 million
of this amount was with Japanese banks to fund normal business requirements of
its Japanese operations.

Most of the increase in
working capital at October 31, 2000 compared to October 31, 1999 resulted from
the working capital of the businesses acquired during fiscal 2000. Approximately
$28 million of working capital, excluding cash, was acquired with these
businesses. Another large increase in working capital resulted from refinancing
the short-term German revolving credit facility borrowings of $15.9 million that
existed at October 31, 1999. This agreement was replaced by the non-U.S.
borrowing capabilities of the $275 million credit facility.

Roper had significant
capital expenditures of $15.2 million during the year ended October 31, 2000 in
order to expand or move to larger facilities at Roper Pump, Cornell Pump and
Compressor Controls. Research and development-related capital expenditures were
also significant at Gatan and Roper Scientific, two of Roper’s digital
imaging businesses. Roper anticipates capital expenditures will decline in
fiscal 2001.

In November 2000,
Roper’s Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend paid on
its outstanding common stock from $0.07 per share to $0.075 per share, an
increase of 7%. This represents the eighth consecutive year in which the
quarterly dividend has been increased since Roper’s 1992 initial public
offering. There are no plans for further dividend increases during fiscal 2001.

Roper believes that
internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under its various
credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and
further acquisition activities. Although Roper maintains an active acquisition
program, any further acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it
is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will
occur and what the impact will be on Roper’s activities, financial
condition and results of operations. Roper may also explore alternatives to
increase its access to additional capital resources.


Roper anticipates that its
recently acquired companies as well as its other companies will generate
positive cash flows from operating activities, and that these cash flows will
permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt at a pace consistent with
that which Roper historically has experienced. However, the rate at which Roper
can reduce its debt during fiscal 2001 (and reduce the associated interest
expense) will be affected by, among other things, the financing and operating
requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of its
existing companies and cannot be predicted with certainty.

Recently
Issued Accounting Standards

The Financial Accounting
Standards Board has issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(“SFAS”) 133 – “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities,” (and subsequently amended by SFAS 137 and SFAS 138)
that will be applicable to Roper in its first quarter of fiscal 2001. Once
adopted, this standard is not expected to significantly affect Roper’s
financial position, operating results or disclosures. See Note 1 to Roper’s
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this
pronouncement.

The Securities and Exchange
Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 101 –
“Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements,” that will be applicable
to Roper in its first quarter of fiscal 2001. SAB 101 reflects the basic
principles of revenue recognition in existing generally accepted accounting
principles and does not supersede any existing authoritative literature. SAB 101
represents the interpretations and practices of the Securities and Exchange
Commission in administering the disclosure requirements of the Federal
securities laws. Once adopted, these guidelines are not expected to
significantly affect Roper’s revenue recognition practices. See Note 1 to
Roper’s Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion
of this pronouncement.

Other accounting
pronouncements have also been released whose effective dates were not yet
applicable to Roper’s fiscal 2000 financial statements. However, none of
these other standards are expected to significantly affect Roper’s future
financial statements.

Outlook

Fiscal 2001 is expected to
be another record year for sales and earnings. Fiscal 2001 is expected to
benefit from the full-year contributions from all of the acquisitions completed
during fiscal 2000. Whereas the oil & gas industry has been a difficult
market for Roper during the past two fiscal years, Roper’s Industrial
Controls segment (the segment most dependent on this industry) had its highest
level of sales and sales order bookings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000
than in any other quarter during this period. Roper is hopeful that this trend
will continue. As announced previously, Roper has extended its long-term supply
agreement with Gazprom whereby Gazprom will be supplied with an additional $150
million of equipment over and above the original agreement through December
2007. Roper expects that this extension will result in relatively consistent
shipments to Gazprom in the near term.


Roper expects to continue
an active acquisition program. However, completion of future acquisitions and
their impact on Roper’s results or financial condition cannot be accurately
predicted.

Forward
Looking Information

The information provided
elsewhere in this Annual Report, in Roper’s filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, in press releases and in other public disclosures contains
forward-looking statements about Roper’s businesses and prospects. These
forward-looking statements generally can be identified by use of statements that
include phrases such as “believe,” “expect,”
“anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,”
“foresee,” “likely,” “will” or other similar words
or phrases. Similarly, statements that describe Roper’s objectives, plans
or goals are or may be forward-looking statements. These forward-looking
statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors
which generally are beyond Roper’s control and which may cause Roper’s
actual results, performance or achievements to be different from any future
results, performance and achievements expressed or implied by these statements.
Some of these risks include continuing improvement in Roper’s oil & gas
markets, the level and timing of future business with Gazprom and other Eastern
European customers, changes in interest rates, and the future operating results
of the recently- and any newly-acquired companies. There is no assurance that
these and other risks and uncertainties will not have an adverse impact on
Roper’s future operations, financial condition, or financial results.


ITEM 7A.   
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Roper is exposed to
interest rate risks on its outstanding borrowings. It is exposed to foreign
currency exchange risks on its transactions denominated in currencies other than
the U.S. dollar. It is also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the
traded price of its common stock.

At October 31, 2000, Roper
had a combination of fixed-rate borrowings (primarily $125 million of term
notes) and relatively variable-rate borrowings (primarily borrowings under the
$275 million credit facility). Although each borrowing under the $275 million
credit facility has a fixed rate, the terms of these individual borrowings are
generally only 1-3 months.

At October 31, 2000,
interest rates were higher than the fixed rates on the term notes. This resulted
in the estimated fair values of the term notes being less than the face amounts
of the notes. Roper estimated this difference to be $2.4 million and it
represented an unrecorded increase in Roper’s net assets at October 31,
2000. If interest rates had been 0.1% higher, the difference between the fair
values of the term notes and their face values would have increased to $3.2
million.

At October 31, 2000,
Roper’s outstanding variable-rate borrowings under the $275 million credit
facility were $107.6 million. An increase in interest rates of 0.1% would
increase Roper’s annualized interest costs by $108,000.

Several Roper companies
have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S.
dollar. Most of these transactions or balances are denominated in Euros (or
equivalent currencies), British pounds or Japanese yen.

Sales by companies whose
functional currency was not the U.S. dollar were 20% of Roper’s total
sales. The U.S. dollar strengthened against each of these currencies during
fiscal 2000 (British pound: 13% and Japanese yen: 4%) and especially against the
Euro (25%) and especially during the fourth quarter (11%). These exchange rate
changes adversely impacted fiscal 2000 sales by approximately $9.2 million, or
less than 2% of total sales. The percentage impact on earnings was similar. A
similar strengthening of the U.S. dollar against these currencies in fiscal 2001
can be expected to have a similar adverse impact on Roper’s financial
results.

The weakening of these
currencies during fiscal 2000 also resulted in a reduction of net assets that
was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings. The decrease during
fiscal 2000 was $6.7 million. However, Roper’s future cash flow exposure to
this change in exchange rates was expected to be minimal.

The traded price of
Roper’s common stock influences the valuation of stock option grants and
the effects these grants have on pro forma earnings disclosed in Roper’s
financial statements. The stock prices also influence the computation of the
dilutive effect of outstanding stock options to determine diluted earnings per
share. Certain cash compensation arrangements are also directly related to
Roper’s stock price. The stock price also affects Roper’s
employees’ perceptions of various Roper programs that involve its common
stock.

Report of
Independent Public Accountants

To the Shareholders of Roper
Industries, Inc.:

We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Roper Industries, Inc. (a Delaware
corporation) and subsidiaries as of October 31, 2000 and 1999, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive
earnings and cash flows for the years then ended. These consolidated financial
statements and the schedule referred to below are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements and the schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Roper Industries, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of October 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of its operations
and cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles

Independent
Auditors’ Report

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders

Roper Industries, Inc.:

We have audited the
accompanying consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders’ equity and
comprehensive earnings and cash flows of Roper Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries
for the year ended October 31, 1998. In connection with our audit of the
consolidated financial statements, we also audited the related financial
statement schedule for the year ended October 31, 1998. These consolidated
financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of
the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based
on our audit.

We conducted our audit in
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the results of operations and the cash flows of Roper
Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries for the year ended October 31, 1998, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion,
the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the
basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in
all material respects, the information set forth therein for the year ended
October 31, 1998.

Summary
of Accounting Policies

Basis
of Presentation - These financial statements present consolidated information for Roper
Industries, Inc. (“Roper”) and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated.

Nature
of the Business - Roper designs, manufactures and distributes specialty industrial
controls, fluid handling and analytical instrumentation products worldwide, serving
selected segments of a broad range of industrial markets.

Accounts
Receivable - Accounts receivable were stated net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of
$4,294,000 and $3,760,000 at October 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Outstanding
accounts receivable balances are reviewed periodically, and allowances are provided at
such time that management believes reasonable doubt exists that such balances will be
collected within a reasonable period of time.

Certain
prior year sales to large natural gas distribution companies and compressor manufacturers
in countries that were part of the former Soviet Union were on an open account basis.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998, economic uncertainties in Russia and the region
deteriorated, and a severe devaluation of the region’s currencies occurred. This created
additional doubt concerning the collectibility of certain accounts receivable from
customers in this region. In response to these events, Roper provided $3.8 million to
fully reserve these receivables, except those from RAO Gazprom, a large Russian natural
gas company.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents - Roper considers highly liquid financial instruments with remaining
maturities at acquisition of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At October 31,
2000 and 1999, Roper had no cash equivalents.

Earnings
per Share - Basic earnings per share were calculated using net earnings and the weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the respective year. Diluted
earnings per share were calculated using net earnings and the weighted average number of
shares of common stock and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the
respective year. Common stock equivalents consisted of stock options, and the effects of
common stock equivalents were determined using the treasury stock method.

For
the years ended October 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, there were 9,000, none and 365,000 stock
options outstanding at October 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, that were not
included in the determination of diluted earnings per share because doing so would have
been antidilutive.

Estimates
- - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments - Roper’s long-term debt at October 31, 2000 included $125
million of fixed-rate term notes. Roper has determined that current comparable interest
rates at October 31, 2000 were higher than the stated rates of the term notes by
approximately one-fourth to one-third of a percentage point. A discounted cash flow
analysis of anticipated cash flows using October 31, 2000 interest rates indicated that
the fair values of the term notes were less than the face amounts of the term notes by
$2.4 million at October 31, 2000. This amount is not reflected in Roper’s basic financial
statements. At October 31, 1999, Roper had a similar unrecorded asset of $2.5 million.

Most
of Roper’s other borrowings at October 31, 2000 were at various interest rates that
adjust relatively frequently under its $275 million credit facility. The fair value for
each of these borrowings at October 31, 2000 was estimated to be the face value of these
borrowings.

ROPER INDUSTRIES, INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

October 31, 2000, 1999
and 1998

In
May 2000, Roper entered into a 3-year interest rate swap agreement for a notional amount
of $25 million. Under this agreement, Roper received a fixed interest rate of 7.68% and
paid a variable rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a margin. In November 2000, Roper entered into
another agreement that effectively terminated this swap agreement for an insignificant
gain.

In
February 1998 and April 1998, Roper entered into five-year interest rate swap agreements
for notional amounts of $50 million and $25 million, respectively. In both agreements,
Roper paid a fixed interest rate, and the other party paid a variable interest rate. In
June 1998, both of these agreements were amended to lower Roper’s fixed interest rate
obligations in exchange for granting the other party an option to extend the agreements
for an additional five years. In May 2000, Roper effectively terminated these agreements
and received $1.8 million. This gain is being amortized over the original term of the
agreements.

The
fair values for all of Roper’s other financial instruments at October 31, 2000
approximated their carrying values.

Foreign
Currency Translation - Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries whose functional
currency is not the U.S. dollar were translated at the exchange rate in effect at the
balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses were translated at average exchange rates
for the period in which those entities were included in Roper’s financial results.
Translation adjustments are reflected as a component of other comprehensive earnings.

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets - Roper periodically reviews its long-lived assets (mostly property,
plant and equipment, identified intangible assets and goodwill) for events or changes in
circumstances that may indicate that the carrying amount of these assets has been
impaired. Impairment, especially with respect to goodwill, is evaluated by comparing the
estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the related business to the carrying amount
of the goodwill. Roper’s review did not warrant recognition of any impairment during any
of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2000.

Income
Taxes - Roper is a U.S.-based multinational company and the calculation of its worldwide
provision for income taxes requires analysis of many factors, including income tax
structures that vary from country to country and the United States’ treatment of non-U.S.
earnings. United States income taxes, net of foreign taxes, have been provided on the
undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, except in those instances where such
earnings are currently expected to be permanently reinvested. If such permanently
reinvested earnings were to be distributed or otherwise subject to U.S. income taxes,
foreign tax credits would reduce the amount of income taxes otherwise due in the United
States. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income taxes related to
these permanently reinvested earnings is not practical.

Certain
assets and liabilities have different bases for financial reporting and income tax
purposes. Deferred income taxes have been provided for these differences.

Intangible
Assets - Intangible assets consisted principally of goodwill, which is amortized on a
straight-line basis over periods ranging from 5 to 40 years. The accumulated amortization
for intangible assets was $45.5 million and $32.3 million at October 31, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. Roper accounts for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the
excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired. Other intangible assets
not arising out of acquisitions are recorded at cost.

Inventories
- - Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using either
the first-in, first-out method or the last-in, first-out method (“LIFO”). Inventories
valued at LIFO cost comprised 11% and 15% of consolidated inventories at October 31, 2000
and 1999, respectively.

One
of Roper’s subsidiaries had a decrement in its LIFO reserve during fiscal 2000, 1999 and
1998. The impact of these decrements on Roper’s results of operations was immaterial for
each of these years.

Other
Comprehensive Earnings - Comprehensive earnings includes net earnings and all other
non-owner sources of changes in a company’s net assets. The differences between net
earnings and comprehensive earnings for Roper during fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998 were
currency translation adjustments. Income taxes have not been provided on currency
translation adjustments.

Property,
Plant and Equipment and Depreciation and Amortization - Property, plant and equipment is
stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and
amortization are provided for using the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives of the assets as follows:

Buildings

Machinery

Other equipment

20-30 years

8-12 years

3-5 years

Recently
Released Accounting and Reporting Pronouncements - Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) 133 - “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,”
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including
certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities. It
requires recognition of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement
of financial position at their fair value. SFAS 133 was subsequently amended by SFAS 137
and SFAS 138 to, among other things, defer the effective date of SFAS 133 such that it is
applicable to Roper beginning with its first quarter of fiscal 2001. Although Roper has
had agreements in the past that would affect Roper’s financial reporting under this new
standard, there were no such agreements in place at October 31, 2000 that would have a
significant effect on Roper’s financial statements.

The
Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 101 -
“Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements,” that will be applicable to Roper in its
first quarter of fiscal 2001. SAB 101 reflects the basic principles of revenue
recognition in existing generally accepted accounting principles and does not supersede
any existing authoritative literature. SAB 101 represents the interpretations and
practices of the Securities and Exchange Commission in administering the disclosure
requirements of the U.S. securities laws. Some of the topics addressed by SAB 101 include
persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery or performance, customer acceptance and a
fixed or determinable price. Once adopted, these guidelines are not expected to
significantly affect Roper’s revenue recognition practices.

Other
accounting pronouncements have also been released whose effective dates were not yet
applicable to Roper’s fiscal 2000 financial statements. However, none of these other
standards are expected to significantly affect Roper’s future financial statements.

Reclassifications
- - Certain reclassifications have been made to fiscal 1999 and fiscal 1998 information
that was previously reported to be consistent with the presentation of fiscal 2000
information.

Research
and Development - Research and development costs include salaries and benefits, rents,
supplies, and other costs related to various products under development. Research and
development costs are expensed in the period incurred and totaled $22.6 million, $16.7
million and $18.0 million for the years ended October 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively.

Revenue
Recognition - Revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or services are
rendered. Some sales contracts contain customer acceptance provisions. When the
customer’s specifications are known and Roper can demonstrate compliance with these
requirements, it recognizes revenue upon delivery of the product, which may precede
formal acceptance by the customer. In isolated cases whereby relevant criteria have been
satisfied, Roper may recognize revenue even though delivery has not occurred. Revenues
under certain relatively long-term and relatively large-value construction projects are
recognized under the percentage-of-completion method using the ratio of costs incurred to
total estimated costs as the measure of performance. Estimated losses on any projects are
recognized as soon as such losses become known.

Stock
Options - Roper accounts for stock-based compensation under the provisions of Accounting
Principles Board Opinion 25 — “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” Stock-based
compensation is measured at its fair value at the grant date in accordance with an
option-pricing model. SFAS 123 — “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” provides that
the related expense may be recorded in the basic financial statements or the pro forma
effect on earnings may be disclosed in the financial statements. Roper provides the pro
forma disclosures.

Non-employee
directors of Roper are eligible to receive stock options for its common stock. These
stock options are accounted for the same as stock options granted to employees. Roper has
never issued stock options other than those issued to employees or its non-employee
directors.

Business
Acquisitions

Over
the past three years, Roper completed nine business acquisitions in fiscal 2000, one in
fiscal 1999 and four in fiscal 1998. All of these acquisitions were accounted for using
the purchase method of accounting. The acquired assets and liabilities of the acquired
businesses were recorded at their estimated fair values, and the results of operations
were included in Roper’s results of operations beginning from the date acquired. Some
allocations of fair value associated with recent acquisitions included estimates and were
preliminary as of October 31, 2000. Also at October 31, 2000, Roper had several
unresolved issues with the sellers of acquired businesses, and the resolution of these
issues could affect the purchase price. Roper does not expect that subsequent fair value
revisions or purchase price revisions will be significant.

Acquisition
costs include amounts paid to sellers, amounts incurred for due diligence and other
direct external costs associated with the acquisition. Acquisitions whose costs were
greater than 5% of Roper’s total assets at the beginning of the fiscal year during which
the acquisition occurred are listed in the table below (acquisition costs in thousands).
All acquisitions listed below were paid for with cash.

In
May 2000, Roper entered into two new credit agreements and simultaneously cancelled its
then-existing $200 million U.S. revolving credit facility and its $30 million German
revolving credit facility.

One
of the new agreements was with a group of banks and provided for a $275 million credit
facility consisting primarily of revolving loans, swing line loans and letters of credit.
Up to $75 million of borrowings under this facility may be denominated in designated
non-U.S. currencies. Interest on outstanding borrowings is influenced by the type and
currency of the borrowings. Roper expects that the majority of the borrowings will be
denominated in U.S. dollars and bear interest at EURIBOR plus a margin. The margin is
influenced by certain financial ratios of Roper and can range from 0.625% to 1.125%. This
facility also provides that Roper will maintain certain financial ratios addressing,
among other things, coverage of fixed charges, total debt under other agreements,
consolidated net worth and capital expenditures. Other costs and provisions of this
facility are believed to be customary. Repayment of Roper’s obligations under this
facility is guaranteed by its domestic subsidiaries and the pledge of some of the stock
of some of Roper’s foreign subsidiaries. This agreement matures on May 18, 2005.

At
October 31, 2000, utilization of the $275 million facility included $79.0 million of U.S.
denominated borrowings, $28.6 million of borrowings denominated in Euros and $776,000 of
outstanding letters of credit. The weighted average interest rate on outstanding
borrowings at October 31, 2000 under this facility was 6.4%.

The
other new May 2000 agreement was with a group of insurance companies that provided for
$40 million of 7.58% term notes due May 18, 2007 and $85 million of 7.68% term notes due
May 18, 2010. The guarantees, pledges and financial covenants associated with this
agreement were similar, but slightly less restrictive, than those in the $275 million
credit facility.

Future
maturities of long-term debt during each of the next five years ending October 31 and
thereafter were as follows (in thousands):

Retirement
and Other Benefit Plans

Roper
maintains two defined contribution retirement plans, under the provisions of Section
401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, covering substantially all domestic employees not
subject to collective bargaining agreements. Roper partially matches employee
contributions. Its costs related to these two plans were $3,956,000, $3,269,000 and
$3,293,000 in fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

Roper
also maintains various defined benefit retirement plans covering employees of non-U.S.
subsidiaries and a plan that supplements certain employees for the contribution ceiling
applicable to the Section 401(k) plans. The costs and accumulated benefit obligations
associated with each of these plans were not material.

Pursuant
to the fiscal 1999 Petroleum Analyzer acquisition, Roper agreed to assume a defined
benefit pension plan covering certain U.S. employees subject to a collective bargaining
agreement. Upon obtaining necessary regulatory approvals, Roper intends to terminate this
plan. Total plan assets at October 31, 2000 were not material and the anticipated costs
associated with terminating this plan were not expected to be material.

In
November 1999, Roper’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved an employee stock
purchase plan covering eligible employees whereby they may designate up to 10% of
eligible earnings to purchase Roper’s common stock at a 10% discount to the average
closing price of its common stock at the beginning and end of a quarterly period. The
common stock sold to the employees may be either treasury stock, stock purchased on the
open market, or newly issued shares authorized by the Board on a periodic basis. During
the year ended October 31, 2000, participants of the employee stock purchase plan
purchased 9,000 shares of Roper’s common stock for total consideration of $271,000. All
of these shares were purchased from Roper’s treasury shares.

(10)

Common
Stock Transactions

Roper’s
restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that each outstanding share of Roper’s
common stock entitles the holder thereof to five votes per share, except that holders of
outstanding shares with respect to which there has been a change in beneficial ownership
during the four years immediately preceding the applicable record date will be entitled
to one vote per share.

Roper
has a Shareholder Rights Plan whereby one Preferred Stock Purchase Right (a “Right”)
accompanies each outstanding share of common stock. Such Rights only become exercisable,
or transferable apart from the common stock, ten business days after a person or group
acquires various specified levels of beneficial ownership, with or without the Board’s
consent. Each Right may be exercised to acquire one one-thousandth of a newly issued
share of Roper’s Series A Preferred Stock, at an exercise price of $170, subject to
adjustment. Alternatively, upon the occurrence of certain specified events, the Rights
allow holders to purchase Roper’s common stock having a market value at such time of
twice the Right’s exercise price. The Rights may be redeemed by Roper at a redemption
price of $0.01 per Right at any time until the tenth business day following public
announcement that a 20% position has been acquired or ten business days after
commencement of a tender or exchange offer. The Rights expire on January 8, 2006.

Roper
periodically enters into agreements with the management of newly-acquired companies for
the issuance of Roper’s common stock based on the achievement of specified goals. A
similar agreement was made with a corporate executive. At October 31, 2000, 20,000 shares
of common stock were reserved for future issuance under such agreements.

has two stock incentive plans (the “1991 Plan” and the “2000 Plan”), which authorize the
issuance of up to 4,500,000 shares of common stock to certain directors, key employees,
and consultants of Roper as incentive and/or nonqualified stock options, stock
appreciation rights or equivalent instruments. Stock options under both plans may be
granted at prices not less than 100% of market value of the underlying stock at the date
of grant. All stock options granted under these plans vest annually and ratably over a
five-year period from the date of the grant. Stock options expire ten years from the date
of grant. The 1991 Plan provided that options must be granted by December 17, 2001. The
2000 Plan has no expiration date.

Roper
also has a stock option plan for non-employee directors (the “Non-employee Director
Plan”). The Non-employee Director Plan provides for each non-employee director appointed
or elected to the Board initial options to purchase 4,000 shares of Roper’s common stock
and thereafter options to purchase an additional 4,000 shares each year under terms and
conditions similar to the above-mentioned stock option plans, except that following their
grant, all options become fully vested at the time of the Annual Meeting of Shareholders
following the grant date and are exercisable ratably over five years following the date
of grant.

A
summary of stock option transactions under these plans and information about stock
options outstanding at October 31, 2000 are shown below:

For
pro forma disclosure purposes, the following fair values and the primary assumptions used
to determine these fair values were used. All stock options granted during each of the
years ended October 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 were at exercise prices equal to the market
price of Roper’s common stock when granted.

The
disclosed pro forma effects on earnings do not include the effects of stock options
granted prior to fiscal 1996 since the provisions of SFAS 123 are not applicable to stock
options for this purpose. The pro forma effects of applying SFAS 123 to fiscal 2000, 1999
and 1998 may not be representative of the pro forma effects in future years. Based on the
vesting schedule of Roper’s stock option grants, the pro forma effects on earnings
are most pronounced in the early years following each grant. The timing and magnitude of
any future grants is at the discretion of Roper’s Board and cannot be assured.

(12)

Contingencies

Roper,
in the ordinary course of business, is the subject of, or a party to, various pending or
threatened legal actions, including those pertaining to product liability and employment
practices. It is vigorously contesting all lawsuits that, in general, are based upon
claims of the kind that have been customary over the past several years. Based upon Roper’s
past experience with resolution of its product liability and employment practices claims
and the limits of the primary, excess, and umbrella liability insurance coverages that
are available with respect to pending claims, management believes that adequate provision
has been made to cover any potential liability not covered by insurance, and that the
ultimate liability, if any, arising from these actions should not have a material adverse
effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of Roper. Included
in other noncurrent assets at October 31, 2000 are estimated insurable settlements
receivable from insurance companies of $1.0 million.

(13)

Segment
and Geographic Area Information

Roper’s operations are grouped into three business segments based on similarities between
products and services: Industrial Controls, Fluid Handling and Analytical
Instrumentation. The Industrial Controls segment’s products include industrial
valve, control and measurement products; microprocessor-based turbomachinery control
systems and associated technical services; and vibration monitoring instruments. Products
included within the Fluid Handling segment are rotary gear, progressing cavity, membrane,
positive displacement, centrifugal and piston-type metering pumps; flow metering
products; and precision integrated chemical dispensing systems. The Analytical
Instrumentation segment’s products include industrial fluid properties testing
products, industrial leak testing products, digital imaging products, spectroscopy
products and specimen preparation and handling equipment used in the operation of
transmission electron and other microscopes. Roper’s management structure and
internal reporting are also aligned consistent with these three segments.

There
were no material transactions between Roper’s business segments during any of the
three years ended October 31, 2000. Sales between geographic areas are primarily of
finished products and are accounted for at prices intended to represent third-party
prices. Operating profit by business segment and by geographic area is defined as sales
less operating costs and expenses. These costs and expenses do not include unallocated
corporate administrative expenses. Items below income from operations on Roper’s
statement of earnings are not allocated to business segments.

Identifiable
assets are those assets used exclusively in the operations of each business segment or
geographic area, or which are allocated when used jointly. Corporate assets were
principally comprised of cash, recoverable insurance claims, deferred compensation
assets, unamortized deferred financing costs and property and equipment.

Deductions from the
allowance for doubtful accounts represented the net write-off of uncollectible
accounts receivable. Deductions from the inventory obsolescence reserve
represented the disposal of obsolete items.

Other included the
allowance for doubtful accounts and reserve for inventory obsolescence of
acquired businesses at the dates of acquisition, the effects of foreign currency
translation adjustments for those companies whose functional currency was not
the U.S. dollar, reclassifications and other.

During the fourth quarter
of fiscal 1998, economic uncertainties in Russia and the region deteriorated and
a severe devaluation of the region’s currencies occurred. This created
additional doubt concerning the collectibility of certain accounts receivable
from customers in this region. In response to these events, Roper provided $3.8
million to fully reserve these receivables, except those from RAO Gazprom, a
large Russian natural gas company. These fully-reserved accounts were written
off during fiscal 1999.
