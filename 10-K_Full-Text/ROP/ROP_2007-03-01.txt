ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Our
Business

Roper Industries, Inc.
(“Roper” or the “Company”) was incorporated on December 17, 1981 under
the laws of the State of Delaware. We are a diversified growth company that designs,
manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls, scientific and industrial
imaging products and software, industrial technology products and radio frequency (RF)
products and services. We market these products and services to selected segments of a
broad range of markets including RF applications, water, energy, research/medical and
general industry.

We pursue consistent and sustainable
growth in sales and earnings by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating
performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected
businesses that offer high value-added, services, engineered products and solutions and
are capable of achieving growth and maintaining high margins. We compete in many niche
markets and believe that we are the market leader or a competitive alternative to the
market leader in the majority of these markets.

In 2006, Roper consolidated the
number of our reporting segments from five to four, reflecting the continued
implementation of our market-focus strategy. Roper’s four segments are: Industrial
Technology, Energy Systems and Controls, Scientific and Industrial Imaging and RF
Technology.

We continued our growth in 2006 from
internal growth and the full-year contributions from the 2005 acquisitions of Inovonics
Corporation (“Inovonics”), CIVCO Holding, Inc. (“CIVCO”) and MEDTEC,
Inc. (“MEDTEC”) in February, June and November, respectively. We acquired Sinmed
Holding International BV (“Sinmed”) on April 5, 2006, Intellitrans, LLC
(“Intellitrans”) on April 26, 2006, Lumenera Corporation (“Lumenera”)
on July 25, 2006, AC Analytical Controls Holding B.V. (“AC Controls”) on August
8, 2006 and Dynisco Parent, Inc. (“Dynisco”) on November 30, 2006, all of which
were purchased for cash and financed through borrowings under our credit agreement and
cash generated from operations.

All reports filed electronically by
Roper with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”),
including our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports
on Form 8-K and our annual proxy statements, as well as any amendments to those reports,
are accessible at no cost on our website at

www.roperind.com

. These filings are
also accessible on the SEC’s website at

www.sec.gov

. You may also read and
copy any material Roper files with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100
F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. You may obtain information on the operation of
the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.

The annual certification of
Roper’s Chief Executive Officer required to be furnished to the New York Stock
Exchange (“NYSE”) pursuant to Section 303A.12(a) of the NYSE Listed Company
Manual was previously filed with the New York Stock Exchange on July 27, 2006.

Market
Share, Market Expansion, and Product Development

Leadership with Engineered Content
for Niche Markets.

We have developed and maintained a leading position in many of our
markets. We believe our market positions are attributable to the technical sophistication
of our products, the applications expertise used to create our advanced products and
systems, and our distribution and service capabilities. Our operating units grow their
businesses through new product development and development of new applications and
services for existing products to satisfy customer needs. In addition, our operating units
continue to grow our customer base by expanding our distribution, selling other products
through our existing channels and entering adjacent markets.

Diversified End Markets and
Geographic Reach.

Over the past decade, we have strategically expanded the number of
end markets we serve to increase revenue and business stability and expand our
opportunities for growth. We have a global presence, with sales of products manufactured
and exported from the U.S. and manufactured abroad and sold to customers outside the U.S.
accounting for $610 million in 2006, compared to $545 million in 2005

.

Information
regarding our international operations is set forth in Note 14 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
(“Annual Report”).

Research and Development.

We
conduct applied research and development to improve the quality and performance of our
products and to develop new technologies and products to enter new markets. Our research
and development spending increased to $58.6 million in 2006 as compared to $53.5 million
in 2005, and increased as compared to $38.7 million in 2004. The dollar amount of research
and development expense in 2006 increased versus 2005 and decreased slightly as a percent
of sales as our internal sales have grown. We expect the dollar amount spent on research
and development activities to rise in 2007 as a result of the acquisitions of Sinmed,
Intellitrans, Lumenera, AC Controls, and Dynisco in 2006.

Our Business Segments

During 2006, Roper consolidated the
number of reporting segments from five to four, reflecting the continued implementation of
its market-focus strategy. Roper’s four segments are: Industrial Technology, Energy
Systems and Controls, Scientific and Industrial Imaging and RF Technology. All prior year
comparisons have been restated to conform to the current year presentation. Financial
information about our business segments is presented in Note 14 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Industrial
Technology

Our Industrial Technology segment
produces industrial pumps, equipment and consumables for materials analysis, industrial
leak testing equipment, flow measurement and metering equipment and water meter and
automatic meter reading (AMR) products and systems. These products and solutions are
provided through five U.S.-based and three European-based operating units. For 2006, this
segment had net sales of $550.0 million, representing 32.4% of our total net sales.

Industrial Pumps.

We
manufacture and distribute a wide variety of pumps. These pumps vary significantly in
complexity and in pumping method employed, which allows for the movement and application
of a diverse range of liquids and solids including low and high viscosity liquids, high
solids content slurries and chemicals. Our pumps are used in large and diverse sets of end
markets such as oil and gas, agricultural, water and wastewater, medical, chemical and
general industrial.

Materials Analysis Equipment and
Consumables.

We manufacture and sell equipment and supply various types of consumables
necessary to extract and shape certain materials for production and to prepare materials
samples for testing and analysis. These products are used mostly within the academic,
government research, electronics and material science end-user markets.

Industrial Leak Testing Equipment.

We manufacture and sell products and systems to test for leaks and confirm the
integrity of assemblies and sub-assemblies in automotive, medical, industrial and consumer
products applications.

Flow Measurement Equipment.

We
manufacture and distribute turbine and positive displacement flow meters, emissions
measurement equipment and flow meter calibration products for aerospace, automotive, power
generation and other industrial applications.

Water Meter and Automatic Meter
Reading (AMR) Products and Systems

. We manufacture and distribute several classes of
water meter products serving the residential, and certain commercial and industrial water
management markets, and several lines of automatic meter reading products and systems
serving these markets.

Backlog.

The Industrial Technology operating units’ sales also reflect a
          combination of standard products and specifically engineered,
          application-specific products. Standard products are typically shipped within
          two weeks of receipt of order, with certain valve and pump products shipped on
          an immediate basis. Application-specific products typically ship within 6 to 12
          weeks following receipt of order. However, larger project orders and blanket
          purchase orders for certain original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, may
          extend shipment for longer periods. This segment’s backlog of firm unfilled
          orders, including blanket purchase orders, totaled $95.5 million at December 31,
          2006, as compared to $55.0 million at December 31, 2005.

Distribution and Sales.

Distribution and sales occur through direct sales personnel, manufacturers’
representatives and distributors.

Customers.

No customer was responsible for as much as 10% of this segment’s net
          sales for 2006.

Energy
Systems and Controls

Our Energy Systems and Controls
segment principally produces control systems, fluid properties testing equipment,
industrial valves and controls, machinery vibration and other non-destructive inspection
and measurement products and solutions, which are provided through six U.S.-based and two
European-based operating units. For 2006, this segment had net sales of $343.7 million,
representing 20.2% of our total net sales.

Control Systems.

We
manufacture control systems and panels and provide related engineering and commissioning
services for turbomachinery applications, predominately in energy markets.

Fluid Properties Testing
Equipment.

We manufacture and sell automated and manual test equipment to determine
physical and elemental properties, such as sulfur and nitrogen content, flash point,
viscosity, freeze point and distillation, of liquids and gases for the petroleum and other
industries.

Industrial Valves and Controls.

We manufacture and distribute a variety of valves, sensors, switches and control
products used on engines, compressors, turbines and other powered equipment for the oil
and gas, pipeline, power generation, marine engine and general industrial markets. Many of
these products are designed for use in hazardous environments.

Non-destructive Inspection and
Measurement Instrumentation.

We manufacture non-destructive inspection and measurement
solutions including measurement probes, robotics, and machinery vibration sensors,
switches and transmitters. These solutions are applied principally in energy markets. Many
of these products are designed for use in hazardous environments.

Backlog.

The majority of this segment’s business consists of larger engineered
          projects with lead times of three to nine months. As such, backlog typically
          fluctuates significantly depending upon the timing of large project awards.
          Standard products generally ship within two weeks of receipt of order. This
          segment’s backlog of firm unfilled orders totaled $79.2 million at December
          31, 2006 compared to $63.6 million at December 31, 2005.

Distribution and Sales.

Distribution and sales occur through direct sales offices, manufacturers’
representatives and distributors in both the U.S. and various other countries.

Customers.

None of this segment’s customers accounted for as much as 10% of its net
          sales in 2006.

Scientific
and Industrial Imaging

Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging
segment principally offers high performance digital imaging products and software, patient
positioning products and software in medical applications and handheld computers and
software. These products and solutions are provided through nine U.S-based, one
European-based and three Canadian-based operating units. For 2006, this segment had net
sales of $338.9 million, representing 19.9% of our total net sales.

Digital Imaging Products and
Software.

We manufacture and sell extremely sensitive, high-performance charged couple
device (“CCD”) and complementary metal oxide semiconductor (“CMOS”)
cameras, detectors and related software for a variety of scientific and industrial uses,
which require high resolution and/or high speed digital video, including transmission
electron microscopy and spectroscopy applications. We principally sell these products for
use within academic, government research, semiconductor, security, automotive, and other
end-user markets such as biological and material science. They are frequently incorporated
into products by OEMs.

Patient Positioning Products and
Software.

We manufacture and sell patient positioning devices, image-guided therapy
software and supply diagnostic and therapeutic disposable products used in conjunction
with ultrasound imaging for minimally invasive medical procedures.

Handheld Computers and
Software.

We manufacture and sell fully rugged handheld computers for utility,
principally water management, and non-utility markets and we develop and sell software to
assist in utility meter reading and service order management.

Backlog.

Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment companies have lead times of up to
          several months on many of their product sales, although standard products are
          often shipped within two weeks of receipt of order. Blanket purchase orders are
          placed by certain OEMs and end-users, with continuing requirements for
          fulfillment over specified periods of time. The segment’s backlog of firm
          unfilled orders, including blanket purchase orders, totaled $68.6 million at
          December 31, 2006, as compared to $61.6 million at December 31, 2005.

Distribution and Sales.

Distribution and sales occur through direct sales personnel, manufacturers’
representatives, value added resellers (“VARs”), OEMs and distributors.

Customers.

No customer was responsible for as much as 10% of this segment’s net sales
          for 2006.

RF
Technology

Our RF Technology segment provides
radio frequency identification (RFID), satellite-based communication technologies and
software solutions that are used primarily in comprehensive toll and traffic systems and
processing, security and access control, freight matching, mobile asset tracking and water
sub-metering and remote temperature monitoring applications. These products and solutions
are provided through two U.S.-based operating units. This segment had sales of $468.1
million for the year ended December 31, 2006, representing 27.5% of our total net sales.

Backlog.

Backlog typically fluctuates significantly depending on the timing of large
          project awards. Standard products typically ship within two weeks of receipt of
          order. This segment’s backlog of firm unfilled orders totaled $261.2
          million at December 31, 2006 compared to $200.2 million at December 31, 2005.

Distribution and Sales.

Distribution and sales occur through direct sales personnel, manufacturers’
representatives and distributors.

Customers.

No customer was responsible for as much as 10% of this segment’s net sales
          for 2006.

Materials and Suppliers

We believe that most materials and
supplies used by us are readily available from numerous sources and suppliers throughout
the world. However, some of our components and sub-assemblies are currently available from
a limited number of suppliers. Some high-performance components for digital imaging
products can be in short supply and/or suppliers have occasional difficulty manufacturing
such components to our specifications. We regularly investigate and identify alternative
sources where possible, and we believe that these conditions equally affect our
competitors. Thus far, supply shortages have not had a significant adverse effect on
Roper’s sales although delays in shipments have occurred following such supply
interruptions.

Environmental Matters
and Other Governmental Regulation

Our operations and properties are
subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including laws and
regulations governing air emissions, water discharges, waste management and workplace
safety. We use, generate and dispose of hazardous substances and waste in our operations
and, as a result, could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the
investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal
injury. We are required continually to conform our operations and properties to these laws
and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change. We
have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, modest costs relating to our
compliance with environmental laws and regulations. In connection with our acquisitions,
we may assume significant environmental liabilities, some of which we may not be aware of,
or may not be quantifiable, at the time of acquisition. In addition, new laws and
regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of
previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could
increase our environmental compliance costs or subject us to new or increased liabilities.

Competition

Generally, our products and solutions
face significant competition, usually from a limited number of competitors. We believe
that we are a leader in most of our markets, and no single company competes with us over a
significant number of product lines. Competitors might be large or small in size, often
depending on the life cycle and maturity of the technology employed. We compete primarily
on product quality, performance, innovation, technology, price, applications expertise,
distribution channel access and customer service capabilities.

Patents and Trademarks

In addition to trade secrets,
unpatented know-how, and other intellectual property rights, we own the rights under a
number of patents, trademarks and copyrights relating to certain of our products and
businesses. We also employ various methods, including confidentiality and non-disclosure
agreements with employees, to protect our trade secrets and know-how. While we believe
that none of our operating units are substantially dependent on any single patent,
trademark, copyright, or other item of intellectual property or group of patents,
trademarks or copyrights, the product development and market activities of Compressor
Controls, Neptune Technology, TransCore and our medical and imaging businesses, in
particular, have been planned and conducted in conjunction with continuing patent
strategies. While we have not significantly licensed patents, trademarks, trade secrets
and similar proprietary rights to and from third parties in the past, we may do so in the
future.

Employees

As of December 31, 2006, we had
approximately 6,900 total employees, of whom approximately 5,000 were located in the
United States. Approximately 290 of our employees are subject to collective bargaining
agreements. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our
employees to be good.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Risks Relating to Our
Business

Our indebtedness may
affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility.

As of December 31, 2006, we had
approximately $1.0 billion in total consolidated indebtedness. In addition, we had
approximately $144 million undrawn availability under our senior secured credit facility.
Our total consolidated debt could increase using this additional borrowing capacity.
Subject to certain restrictions contained in our senior secured credit facility and other
debt agreements, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including
indebtedness incurred to finance, or which is assumed in connection with, acquisitions.

Our level of indebtedness and the
debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our
operations and business strategy. For example, our indebtedness could:

place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors, some of which have lower debt
service obligations and greater financial resources than us;

limit our ability to borrow additional funds;

limit our ability to complete future acquisitions;

limit our ability to pay dividends;

limit our ability to make capital expenditures; and

increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions.

Our ability to make scheduled
payments of principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness and to
satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance,
which may be affected by factors beyond our control. In addition, there can be no
assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable
terms for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. If we are unable to service our
indebtedness, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be
materially adversely affected.

In addition, our senior secured
credit facility contains financial covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and
operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to
meet the financial covenants or requirements in our senior secured credit facility may be
affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants
and requirements. A breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the
financial ratios, tests or other restrictions contained in our senior secured credit
facility could result in an event of default under this facility, which in turn could
result in an event of default under the terms of our other indebtedness. Upon the
occurrence of an event of default under our senior secured credit facility, and the
expiration of any grace periods, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts
outstanding under the facility, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and
payable. If this were to occur, our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the
amounts due under this facility or our other indebtedness.

Unfavorable changes in
foreign exchange rates may significantly harm our business.

Several of our operating companies
have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most
of these transactions and balances are denominated in euros, Canadian dollars, British
pounds, Danish krone and Japanese yen. Sales by our operating companies whose functional
currency is not the U.S. dollar represented approximately 29% of our total net sales for
the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 25% for the year ended December 31, 2005.
Unfavorable changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and those currencies could
significantly reduce our reported sales and earnings. At present, we do not hedge against
foreign currency risks.

We export a significant portion
of our products. Difficulties associated with the export of our products could harm our
business.

Sales to customers outside the U.S.
by our businesses located in the U.S. account for a significant portion of our net sales.
These sales accounted for approximately 14% and 16% of our net sales for the years ended
December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively. We are subject to risks that could
limit our ability to export our products or otherwise reduce the demand for these products
in our foreign markets. Such risks include, without limitation, the following:

unfavorable changes in or noncompliance with U.S. and other jurisdictions' export requirements;

restrictions on the export of technology and related products;

unfavorable changes in or noncompliance with U.S. and other jurisdictions' export policies to certain countries;

unfavorable changes in the import policies of our foreign markets; and

a general economic downturn in our foreign markets.

The occurrence of any of these events
could reduce the foreign demand for our products or could limit our ability to export our
products and, therefore, could materially negatively affect our future sales and earnings.

Economic, political and
other risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our
business.

As of December 31, 2006,
approximately 17% of our long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and intangibles were
attributable to operations outside the U.S. We expect our international operations to
continue to contribute materially to our business for the foreseeable future. Our
international operations are subject to varying degrees of risk inherent in doing business
outside the U.S. including, without limitation, the following:

adverse changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions, particularly in emerging
markets;

trade protection measures and import or export requirements;

trade liberalization measures which could expose our international operations to increased
competition;

subsidies or increased access to capital for firms who are currently, or may emerge, as competitors in countries in which we have operations;

partial or total expropriation;

potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws;

difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;

differing labor regulations;

differing protection of intellectual property;

unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;

longer payment cycles of foreign
customers and difficulty in collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions; and

international sentiment towards the U.S.

The occurrence of any of these events
could materially harm our business.

Our growth strategy
includes acquisitions. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates,
complete acquisitions or integrate acquisitions successfully.

Our historical growth has depended,
and our future growth is likely to continue to depend, to some degree on our ability to
make acquisitions and to successfully integrate acquired businesses. We intend to continue
to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to
enhance our position in existing markets globally. There are no assurances, however, that
we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate
acquisition terms, obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms, complete proposed
acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or
expand into new markets. Once integrated, acquired operations may not achieve levels of
revenues, profitability or productivity comparable with those achieved by our existing
operations, or otherwise perform as expected.

Acquisitions involve numerous risks,
including difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, services and
products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management’s attention from
other business concerns. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks
inherent in any particular transaction, there are no assurances that we will properly
ascertain all such risks. In addition, prior acquisitions have resulted, and future
acquisitions could result, in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and
other expenses. Future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of
equity securities. Difficulties encountered with acquisitions may have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Product liability,
insurance risks and increased insurance costs could harm our operating results.

Our business exposes us to potential
product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacturing and distribution of
our products. In addition, certain of our products are used in potentially hazardous
environments. We currently have product liability insurance; however, we may not be able
to maintain our insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us
against potential losses. We also maintain other insurance policies, including directors
and officers’ liability insurance. Our insurance costs increased in recent periods
and may continue to increase in the future. We believe that we have adequately accrued
estimated losses, principally related to deductible amounts under our insurance policies,
with respect to all product liability and other claims, based upon our past experience and
available facts. However, a successful product liability or other claim or series of
claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations. In addition, a significant increase in our insurance
costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results.

Our operating results
could be adversely affected by a reduction of business with our large customers.

In some of our businesses, we derive
a significant amount of revenue from larger customers. The loss or reduction of any
significant contracts with any of these customers could materially reduce our revenue and
cash flows. Additionally, many of our customers are government entities. In many
situations, government entities can unilaterally terminate or modify our existing
contracts without cause and without penalty to the government agency.

We face intense
competition. If we do not compete effectively, our business may suffer.

We face intense competition from
numerous competitors. Our products compete primarily on the basis of product quality,
performance, innovation, technology, price, applications expertise, system and service
flexibility and established customer service capabilities with existing customers. We may
not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts or with all of our competitors.
In addition, new competitors may emerge, and product lines may be threatened by new
technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines. To remain
competitive, we must develop new products, respond to new technologies and periodically
enhance our existing products in a timely manner. We anticipate that we may have to adjust
prices of many of our products to stay competitive.

Changes in the supply of,
or price for, parts and components used in our products could affect our business.

We purchase many parts and components
from suppliers. The availability and prices of parts and components are subject to
curtailment or change due to, among other things, suppliers’ allocations to other
purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and
prevailing price levels. Some high-performance components for digital imaging products may
be in short supply and/or suppliers may have occasional difficulty manufacturing these
components to meet our specifications. In addition, some of our products are provided by
sole source suppliers. Any change in the supply of, or price for, these parts and
components could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Environmental compliance
costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial
condition.

Our operations and properties are
subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to environmental
protection, including laws and regulations governing air emissions, water discharges,
waste management and workplace safety. These laws and regulations can result in the
imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations and could require the
installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit
pollution emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance
releases. We must conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to
regulatory requirements in the countries in which we operate as these requirements change.

We use and generate hazardous
substances and wastes in our operations and, as a result, could be subject to potentially
material liabilities relating to the investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties
and to claims alleging personal injury. We have experienced, and expect to continue to
experience, costs relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations. In
connection with our acquisitions, we may assume significant environmental liabilities,
some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition. In addition, new laws and
regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of
previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could
require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Some of the industries in
which we operate are cyclical, and, accordingly, our business is subject to changes in
the economy.

Some of the business areas in which
we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles. Certain
businesses are subject to industry cycles, including but not limited to, the industrial
and semiconductor markets. Accordingly, any downturn in these or other markets in which we
participate could materially adversely affect us. If demand changes and we fail to respond
accordingly, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in any given
quarter. The business cycles of our different operations may occur contemporaneously.
Consequently, the effect of an economic downturn may have a magnified negative effect on
our business.

Our intangible assets are
valued at an amount that is high relative to our total assets, and a write-off of our
intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and total
capitalization.

Our total assets reflect substantial
intangible assets, primarily goodwill. At December 31, 2006, goodwill totaled
approximately $1.65 billion compared to approximately $1.49 billion of stockholders’
equity, which was approximately 55% of our total assets of approximately $3.00 billion.
The goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the fair
value of the net assets we have acquired. We assess at least annually whether there has
been an impairment in the value of our intangible assets. If future operating performance
at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels, if
competing or alternative technologies emerge or if business valuations become more
conservative, we could incur, under current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash charge
to operating earnings for goodwill impairment. Any determination requiring the write-off
of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our
results of operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material.

We depend on our
abilities to develop new products.

The future success of our business
will depend, in part, on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products
and to enhance existing products so that our products can be sold with high margins. This
product development may require substantial investment by us. There can be no assurance
that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development, performance or
market acceptance of new technologies or products or that we will otherwise be able to
successfully develop and market new products. Failure of our products to gain market
acceptance or our failure to successfully develop and market new products could reduce our
margins, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

Our technology is
important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a
competitive disadvantage.

Because many of our products rely on
proprietary technology, we believe that the development and protection of intellectual
property rights through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, confidentiality
agreements and other contractual provisions is important to the future success of our
business. Despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or
competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. The steps we
have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology, particularly in foreign
countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the U.S.  
Current and future actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and
diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful.

Any business disruptions
due to political instability, armed hostilities, incidents of terrorism or natural
disasters could adversely impact our financial performance.

If terrorist activity, armed
conflict, political instability or natural disasters occur in the U.S. or other locations,
such events may negatively impact our operations, cause general economic conditions in the
U.S. and abroad to deteriorate or cause world-wide demand for U.S. products to decline. A
prolonged economic slowdown or recession in the U.S. or in other areas of the world could
reduce the demand for our products, and therefore, negatively affect our future sales and
profits. Any of these events could have a significant impact on our business, financial
condition or results of operations and may result in the volatility of the market price of
our common stock.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are defendants in various lawsuits
involving product liability, employment practices and other matters, none of which we
believe will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or
results of operations. The majority of such claims are subject to insurance coverage.

We and/or one of our subsidiaries are
named as defendants, along with many other companies, in asbestos-related personal injury
or wrongful death actions. The allegations in these actions are vague, general and
speculative. Given the state of these claims, it is not possible to determine the
potential liability, if any.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF

Dividends.

Roper has declared a cash dividend in each quarter since our February 1992
          initial public offering and we have also annually increased our dividend rate
          since our initial public offering. In November 2006, our Board of Directors
          increased the quarterly dividend paid January 31, 2007 to $0.06500 per share
          from $0.05875 per share, an increase of 11%. However, the timing, declaration
          and payment of future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our Board of
          Directors and will depend upon our profitability, financial condition, capital
          needs, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of
          Directors.

Recent Sales of Unregistered
Securities.

In 2006, there were no sales of unregistered securities.

ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

You should read the following
discussion in conjunction with “Selected Financial Data” and our Consolidated
Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

Overview

We are a diversified growth company
that designs, manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls, scientific and
industrial imaging products and software, industrial technology products and radio
frequency (RF) products and services. We market these products and services to selected
segments of a broad range of markets including RF applications, water, energy,
research/medical and general industry.

We pursue consistent and sustainable
growth in earnings by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of
our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses. Our
acquisitions have represented both bolt-ons and new strategic platforms. We strive for
high cash and earnings returns from our acquisition investments. On April 5, 2006, we
purchased Sinmed, a maker of medical positioning equipment. On April 26, 2006, we
purchased Intellitrans, a provider of asset tracking technology. On July 25, 2006, we
purchased Lumenera, a developer and manufacturer of high performance digital cameras for
industrial, scientific and security markets. On August 8, 2006, we purchased AC Controls,
a provider of chromatographic analyzers for the petrochemical industry. On November 30,
2006, we purchased Dynisco, a provider of highly engineered sensors and software used in
testing, measurement and control applications. The results of Sinmed and Lumenera are
reported in the Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment, Intellitrans in the RF
Technology segment, and AC Controls and Dynisco in the Energy Systems and Controls
segment.

During the year ended December 31,
2006, our results of operations benefited from the full-year results of the 2005
acquisitions of Inovonics, CIVCO and MEDTEC in February, June and November, respectively,
as well as the partial year activities of Intellitrans, Sinmed, AC Controls, Lumenera and
Dynisco.

During the year ended December 31,
2005, our results of operations benefited from the TransCore acquisition made on December
13, 2004, the power generation business of R/D Tech purchased on June 7, 2004, and the
partial year activities of Inovonics, CIVCO and MEDTEC.

Application of Critical
Accounting Policies

Our Consolidated Financial Statements
are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States, or GAAP. A discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in
the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2006
included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

GAAP offers acceptable alternative
methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results, such as
determining inventory cost, depreciating long-lived assets and recognizing revenue. We
have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant
estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a
manner that had a material effect on our financial statements. Effective January 1,
2006, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004),
“Share-Based Payment (“SFAS 123R”),” which requires the Company to
recognize expense for the grant date fair value of its employee stock option awards. The
Company recognizes the expense of all share-based awards on a straight-line basis over the
employee’s requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the award).

The preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments
and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental
disclosures.

The development of accounting
estimates is the responsibility of our management. Our management discusses those areas
that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors. The
audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the SEC.
Although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are
reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over
time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects
are accounted for prospectively.

Our most significant accounting
uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility,
inventory utilization, future warranty obligations, revenue recognition (percent of
completion), income taxes and goodwill and indefinite-lived asset analyses. These issues,
except for income taxes, which are not allocated to our business segments, affect each of
our business segments. These issues are evaluated primarily using a combination of
historical experience, current conditions and relatively short-term forecasting.

Accounts receivable collectibility is
based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after
shipment of products, including in certain cases credits for returned products. Accounts
receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed
upon terms, whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences, what historical
experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that current and
near-term forecast economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and
with specific customers. The returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to
determine likely future rates for such credits. At December 31, 2006, our allowance for
doubtful accounts receivable was $7.8 million and our allowance for sales returns and
sales credits was $1.2 million, for a total of $9.0 million, or 2.7% of total gross
accounts receivable. This percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying
receivables, and the timing of write-offs of accounts deemed uncollectible. The total
allowance at December 31, 2006 is $0.4 million higher than at December 31, 2005 but has
decreased as percent of sales by 0.5% as we continue to reduce our credit risk.

We regularly compare inventory
quantities on hand against anticipated future usage, which we determine as a function of
historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence
and excessive quantities. When we use historical usage, this information is also
qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using
historical information as an estimate of future usage. Business trends can change rapidly
and these events can affect the evaluation of inventory balances. At December 31, 2006,
inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were $26.4 million, or 13.5% of gross
first-in, first-out inventory cost. This percentage has decreased from 15.4% in the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2005. We expect this percentage to continue to decrease over time
as we physically dispose of obsolete inventory and improve our inventory purchasing
processes.

Most of our sales are covered by
warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying
defective items for a specified period after the time of sale, typically 12 months. Future
warranty obligations are evaluated using, among other factors, historical cost experience,
product evolution and customer feedback. At December 31, 2006, the reserve for future
warranty obligations was $7.6 million. Our expense for warranty obligations was less than
1% of net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004.

Revenues related to the use of the
percentage-of-completion method of accounting are dependent on a comparison of total costs
incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project. During the year ended December
31, 2006, we recognized revenue of approximately $94.8 million using this method,
primarily for major turn-key, longer term toll and traffic and energy projects.
Approximately $90.0 million and $16.8 million of revenue was recognized using this method
during the years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, respectively. At December
31, 2006 approximately $139 million of revenue related to unfinished
percentage-of-completion contracts had yet to be recognized. Contracts accounted for under
this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues
accounted for under other methods.

Income taxes can be affected by
estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and how and
when cash is repatriated to the United States, combined with other aspects of an overall
income tax strategy. Additionally, taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with
our tax treatment of certain items, and some historical transactions have income tax
effects going forward. Accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using
current laws, rules and regulations, each of which can change at any time and in an
unpredictable manner. During 2006, our effective income tax rate was 34.0%, which was
higher than the 2005 rate of 30.6% which included a one-time $6.6 million reduction of tax
expense related to the repatriation of foreign sourced earnings under section 965 of the
Internal Revenue Code at an effective tax rate significantly lower than previously
provided on these earnings. We expect our tax rate in 2007 to increase to approximately
35.0% to 35.5% as the Company continues to have a higher percentage of sales in the U.S.
subject to additional state income tax.

Roper accounts for goodwill in a
purchase business combination as the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets
acquired. Business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being
recognized. Amortization of intangible assets, if applicable, occurs over their estimated
useful lives. Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”) requires companies to cease amortizing
goodwill that existed at June 30, 2001 and establishes a two-step method for testing
goodwill for impairment on an annual basis (or an interim basis if an event occurs that
might reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value). Roper conducts
this review for all of its reporting units during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.
No impairment resulted from the annual review performed in 2006. SFAS 142 also requires
that an identifiable intangible asset that is determined to have an indefinite useful
economic life not be amortized, but separately tested for impairment using a one-step fair
value based approach. Total goodwill includes 22 different reporting units with individual
amounts ranging from less than $1 million to approximately $447 million.

Results of Operations

General

The following tables set forth
selected information for the years indicated. Dollar amounts are in thousands and
percentages are of net sales. Prior period presentations have been revised to conform to
the new segments.

(1)

Includes
results from the acquisitions of AC Controls from August 8,           2006, Dynisco from
November 30, 2006 and the power generation business of R/D           Tech from June 7,
2004.

(2)

Includes
results from the acquisitions of Sinmed from April 5, 2006, Lumenera           from July
25, 2006, CIVCO from June 17, 2005, MEDTEC from November 30, 2005 and           several
smaller business acquired during the years presented.

(3)

Includes
results from the acquisitions of Intellitrans from April 26, 2006,           Inovonics
from February 25, 2005 and TransCore from December 13, 2004.

Year Ended December 31,
2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005

Net sales for the year ended December
31, 2006 were $1.70 billion as compared to sales of $1.45 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2005, an increase of 17.0%. This increase was the result of sales from
acquired companies and strong internal growth. Our 2006 results included a full year of
sales from Inovonics, CIVCO and MEDTEC acquired during 2005, approximately eight months of
sales from Sinmed, seven months from Intellitrans, five months from Lumenera and AC
Controls, and one month from Dynisco. Net sales of these acquisitions accounted for
approximately $101 million of our 2006 net sales increase over 2005 and growth of our
other business accounted for the remaining $146 million of the increase.

Net sales for our Industrial
Technology segment increased by $53.9 million or 10.9% for the year ended December 31,
2006 over the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was due primarily to high market
penetration for our new radio-frequency integrated water meter at Neptune Technologies,
accounting for 68% of the year over year growth. In addition, sales in our materials
testing businesses were up $11 million dollars over the prior year due to increased unit
sales.

In our Energy Systems and Controls
segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased by $32.5 million or
10.4% over the year ended December 31, 2005. Approximately $19 million, or 6%, of the
increase was due to the 2006 acquisitions of AC Controls and Dynisco. Internal growth was
approximately $14 million or 4.4%, primarily from strength in the oil and gas related
businesses which have benefited from the strong global oil and gas market, offset by weak
sales at Zetec in the first half of 2006.

Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging
segment reported an increase in net sales of $89.0 million or 35.6% for the year ended
December 31, 2006 over the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was attributable to
the full-year impact of CIVCO and MEDTEC acquired in 2005, and partial year impact of
Sinmed and Lumenera in 2006, which accounted for approximately $65 million of the increase
over prior year. Internal growth was 9.7%, approximately 50% of which was related to
increased sales in the electron microscopy market due to higher demand from OEM customers.
Sales of new products in the digital camera businesses accounted for the remainder of the
growth.

In our RF Technology segment, net
sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased by $71.6 million or 18.0% over the
year ended December 31, 2005. The full-year results of Inovonics, purchased in February
2005, and eight months from the Intellitrans acquisition on April 26, 2006, accounted for
approximately $17 million of the increase. Internal growth increased 13.8% due to strong
performance in the freight matching business and our traffic and tolling business.

Our overall gross profit percentage
was 50.6% for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 50.0% for the year ended
December 31, 2005. Industrial Technology gross margins increased to 47.9% as compared to
47.4% in the prior year. Our Energy Systems and Controls segment gross margins were
unchanged at 54.2% in both 2006 and 2005, however, there was a $1.1 million purchase
accounting inventory step-up charge incurred in 2006. Our Scientific and Industrial
Imaging segment gross margins were 56.8% in 2006 as compared to 55.6% in 2005. There were
purchase accounting inventory step-up charges of $1.3 million in 2006 and $2.1 million in
2005. Excluding these charges, our gross margins would have increased in 2006 due to a
larger percentage of segment sales in our higher margin medical businesses. Our RF
Technology segment gross margins were 46.8% in 2006 as compared to 46.4% in 2005.

Selling, general and administrative
(SG&A) expenses decreased to 30.8% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2006
from 31.8% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005. The decrease is due to
leverage from higher sales while making a conscious effort to control general and
administrative expenses.

Interest expense increased $1.4
million, or 3.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December
31, 2005, primarily as a result of borrowings under our revolving credit facility for the
Dynisco acquisition on November 30, 2006. The average debt balances and associated
interest expense for the remaining 2006 acquisitions were relatively unchanged from the
average debt balances and associated interest expense related to 2005 acquisitions.

The loss on extinguishment of debt
for the year ended December 31, 2005 created a $3.9 million non-cash charge related to the
expensing of deferred financing costs for our senior subordinated convertible notes which
were required to be classified as short-term debt, based upon the triggering of the
conversion feature of the notes due to increases in the trading price of the
Company’s stock.

The change in other income for the
year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily
due to the 2005 $0.8 million gain on sale of an investment in a previously owned business
and proceeds of $0.7 million from a business interruption insurance claim due to a fire at
a supplier to one of our Imaging segment businesses that did not recur in 2006.

During 2006, our effective income tax
rate was 34.0%. In 2005, our effective income tax rate was 30.6% which included a $6.6
million reduction to tax expense related to the repatriation of foreign sourced earnings
under section 965 of the Internal Revenue Code at an effective tax rate significantly
lower than previously provided on these earnings. We expect our tax rate in 2007 to
increase to approximately 35.0% to 35.5% as the Company continues to have a higher
percentage of sales in the U.S. subject to additional state income tax .

At December 31, 2006, the functional
currencies of our European and Canadian subsidiaries were stronger against the U.S. dollar
compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2005. The net result of these changes
led to an increase in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $23.6
million in the year period ending December 31, 2006. Approximately $20.7 million of these
adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected
future cash flows. For the entire year of 2006, operating profit increased by 1% of sales
due to fluctuations in non-U.S. currencies.

net sales order information for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 (dollar amounts
in thousands).

The increase in sales orders is due
to internal growth of 12.7% with the remainder from acquisitions. The Industrial
Technology segment net orders strengthened in most markets over the prior year and in
particular from strong orders for Neptune water meter and RF products, which is also the
primary contributor to the increased backlog in this segment as noted in the table below.
Scientific and Industrial Imaging net orders increased from the inclusion of orders from
the partial year ownership of Sinmed and Lumenera and also from stronger orders in the
electron microscopy market, which led to the higher backlog at 2006 in the Scientific and
Industrial Imaging segment. The RF Technology segment experienced strong order growth
including a significant international project awarded in the fourth quarter of 2006
leading to the increased backlog in this segment.

The following table summarizes sales
order backlog information at December 31, 2006 and 2005 (dollar amounts in thousands).
Roper’s policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within
twelve months.

Year Ended December 31,
2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004

Net sales for the year ended December
31, 2005 were $1.45 billion as compared to sales of $969.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004, an increase of 49.9%. This increase was the result of sales from
acquired companies and strong internal growth. Our 2005 results included a full year of
sales from the power generation business of R/D Tech and from TransCore, both acquired
during 2004, approximately ten months of sales from the Inovonics acquisition, six months
from CIVCO, and one month from MEDTEC. Net sales of these acquisitions accounted for
approximately $413 million of our 2005 net sales increase over 2004 and growth of our
other business accounted for the remaining $71 million of the increase.

Net sales for our Industrial
Technology segment increased by $38.0 million or 8.3% for the year ended December 31, 2005
over the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was due primarily to increased unit
volumes attributable to generally favorable market conditions including strong sales
growth in radio frequency technology in our water meter markets, representing
approximately $10 million, increased sales of standard products in our water and waste
water pumps of approximately $5 million and increased sales of approximately $4 million in
sulfur testing instruments as this testing moved from lab to process applications with our
customers.

In our Energy Systems and Controls
segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased by $32.4 million or
11.6% over the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased
internal growth in all business units in this segment, along with the full-year impact of
the power generation business of R/D Tech acquired in 2004 of approximately $9.4 million.

Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging
segment reported an increase in net sales of $32.1 million or 14.8% for the year ended
December 31, 2005 over the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was attributable to
the partial-year impact of CIVCO and MEDTEC acquired in 2005 which accounted for
approximately $22 million of the increase over prior year. The remainder of the increase
resulted primarily from new products and more focused selling activities driving market
penetration in our physical and life sciences camera markets.

In our RF Technology segment, net
sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased by $381.4 million over the year ended
December 31, 2004. The increase was attributable to the full-year results of TransCore,
purchased December 13, 2004, and the ten month results of Inovonics.

Our overall gross profit percentage
was 50.0% for the year ended December 31, 2005 which remained the same as 50.0% for the
year ended December 31, 2004. Industrial Technology gross margins increased to 47.4% as
compared to 46.3% in the prior year, primarily due to the non-recurrence of inventory
step-up costs at Neptune in the first quarter of 2004 of approximately $1.5 million. Our
Energy Systems and Controls segment gross margins were 54.2% in 2005 as compared to 52.2%
in 2004. This was due to several factors none of which are easily quantifiable, including
a product rationalization effort in our non-destructive testing business, better large
project scope acceptance discipline and better engineering staff utilization in our oil
and gas business. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment gross margins were 55.6%
in 2005 as compared to 55.7% in 2004. This decrease is due totally to inventory step-up
costs of approximately $2.1 million at CIVCO and MEDTEC incurred in 2005. Without these
charges, there was a modest improvement in this segment’s gross margins for the year.
Our RF Technology segment gross margins were 46.4% in 2005 as compared to 40.4% for the 18
day period that TransCore was owned in 2004. Prior year gross margins were depressed due
to the low sales volume in the holiday period of our ownership in the prior year.

Selling, general and administrative
(SG&A) expenses decreased to 31.8% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005
from 32.4% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease is due to
leverage from higher sales while making a conscious effort to control general and
administrative expenses.

Interest expense increased $14.5
million, or 50.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2004, primarily as a result of higher debt levels incurred due to the
TransCore acquisition in December 2004, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility
for the Inovonics, CIVCO and MEDTEC acquisitions in 2005.

The loss on extinguishment of debt
for the year ended December 31, 2005 was a $3.9 million non-cash charge related to the
expensing of deferred financing costs for our senior subordinated convertible notes which
are required to be classified as short-term debt, based upon the triggering of the
conversion feature of the notes due to increases in the trading price of the
Company’s stock. The loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31,
2004 was a $8.2 million non-cash charge related to the expensing of deferred financing
costs due to the amendment of our credit facility concurrent with the acquisition of
TransCore.

The change in other income for the
year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily
due to a $0.8 million gain on sale of an investment in a previously owned business and
proceeds of $0.7 million from a business interruption insurance claim due to a fire at a
supplier to one of our Imaging segment businesses.

During 2005, our effective income tax
rate was 30.6%, which included a $6.6 million reduction to tax expense related to the
repatriation of foreign sourced earnings under section 965 of the Internal Revenue Code at
an effective tax rate significantly lower than previously provided on these earnings. In
2004, our effective income tax rate was 29.8% which included a $0.9 million additional
R&D credit. We expect our tax rate in 2006 to increase as the Company does not expect
a recurrence of the 2005 reduction in tax expense from the repatriation of foreign sourced
earnings.

At December 31, 2005, the functional
currencies of our European subsidiaries were weaker and the functional currencies of our
Canadian subsidiaries were stronger against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange
rates at December 31, 2004. The net result of these changes led to a decrease in the
foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $27.9 million in the year period
ending December 31, 2005. Approximately $21.8 million of these adjustments related to
goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. For the
entire year of 2005, operating profit was not affected by fluctuations in non-U.S.
currencies.

Financial Condition,
Liquidity and Capital Resources

Net cash provided by operating
activities was $262.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, $281.3 million for the
year ended December 31, 2005, and $164.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The
2006 decrease was expected due to higher tax payments in 2006 as net operating losses from
previous acquisitions were depleted, and we were required to reclassify cash flows from
the tax windfall benefits related to stock awards from operating cash flows to financing
cash flows. These benefits were $10.8 million and $4.2 million in 2006 and 2005,
respectively. Cash used by investing activities during 2006, 2005, and 2004 were primarily
business acquisition costs. Cash from financing activities during each of these years was
largely debt repayments and borrowings for acquisitions and a common stock issuance in
2004. Financing activities in 2004 also included amending and restating our previous $625
million credit agreement with our current $1.055 billion credit agreement to increase
capacity, lower borrowing costs, and improve other terms and conditions.

Net working capital (current assets,
excluding cash, less total current liabilities, excluding debt) was $270.3 million at
December 31, 2006 compared to $212.8 million at December 31, 2005. We acquired
approximately $21.1 million of net current assets through business acquisitions during
2006.

Total debt was $1.0 billion at
December 31, 2006 (40.8% of total capital) compared to $894.3 million at December 31, 2005
(41.7% of total capital). Our increased debt at December 31, 2006 compared to December 31,
2005 was due to borrowings related to our acquisition of Dynisco on November 30, 2006.

Our $1.055 billion credit facility
consists of a $655 million term loan and a $400 million revolving loan, both with five
year maturities. In 2005, the Company entered into a fixed rate swap agreement ending
March 2008 which fixes the interest rate on $250 million of our term notes. The interest
rate on the variable portion of our term loan at December 31, 2006 was 6.11%. At December
31, 2006, our debt consisted of $230 million in senior subordinated convertible notes due
in 2034, a balance of $588.8 million on the term loan and a balance of $202.0 million on
the revolving loan. In addition, we had $6.0 million of other debt in the form of capital
leases and several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters
of credit in various foreign locations to support our non-U.S. businesses. The Company had
$54.2 million of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2006, thereby reducing its
remaining revolving credit capacity commensurately. We expect that our available borrowing
capacity, combined with existing cash balances and cash flows expected to be generated
from existing businesses, will be sufficient to fund normal operating requirements and
finance additional acquisitions.

We were in compliance with all debt
covenants related to our credit facilities throughout the year ended December 31, 2006.

Capital expenditures of $32.2
million, $24.8 million and $12.1 million were incurred during 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The increase in capital expenditures in 2006 was due to the consolidation of
several of our businesses in the Energy Systems and Controls segment, including new
facilities in Houston, Texas and Snoqualmie, Washington. We also had increased
expenditures related to cost saving initiatives at our Neptune facility. We expect capital
expenditures in 2007 to be approximately comparable as a percentage of sales to 2006.

Description of Certain
Indebtedness

Senior Secured Credit
Facility

Concurrently with the closing of the
TransCore acquisition and the common stock offering in December 2004, we entered into a
$1.055 billion senior secured credit facility. This credit facility consists of a
five-year $655 million term loan and a five-year $400 million revolving loan.

Our credit facility requires us to
prepay the term loan and, in certain cases, reduce the commitments under the revolving
loan, upon the receipt of certain proceeds, including from certain asset sales, the
incurrence of certain debt, and up to 75% of our excess cash flows unless we meet a
consolidated total leverage ratio test. We are also required to make quarterly principal
payments on the term loans.

The facility contains various
affirmative and negative covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur
new debt, prepay subordinated debt, make certain investments and acquisitions, sell assets
and grant liens, make restricted payments (including the payment of dividends on our
common stock) and capital expenditures, or change our line of business. We also are
subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage
ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio.

Senior Subordinated
Convertible Notes

In December 2003, we issued $230
million of senior subordinated convertible notes at an original issue discount of 60.498%,
resulting in an effective yield of 3.75% per year to maturity. Interest on the notes is
payable semiannually, beginning July 15, 2004, until January 15, 2009. After
that date, we will not pay cash interest on the notes prior to maturity unless contingent
cash interest becomes payable. Instead, after January 15, 2009, interest will be
recognized at the effective rate of 3.75% and will represent accrual of original issue
discount, excluding any contingent cash interest that may become payable. We will pay
contingent cash interest to the holders of the notes during any six month period
commencing after January 15, 2009 if the average trading price of a note for a five
trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals 120%
or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and accrued cash
interest, if any, for such note. The contingent cash interest payable per note in respect
of any six month period will equal the annual rate of 0.25%.

The notes are unsecured
senior subordinated obligations, rank junior to our existing and future senior secured
indebtedness and rank equally with our existing and future senior subordinated
indebtedness.

As originally issued, each $1,000
principal amount of the notes will be convertible at the option of the holder into 12.422
shares of our common stock (giving effect to the 2-for-1 stock split effective August 26,
2005 and subject to further adjustment), if (i) the sale price of our common stock
reaches, or the trading price of the notes falls below, specified thresholds, (ii) if the
notes are called for redemption or (iii) if specified corporate transactions have
occurred. Upon conversion, we would have the right to deliver, in lieu of common stock,
cash or a combination of cash and common stock. On November 19, 2004, the Company began a
consent solicitation to amend the notes such that the Company would pay the same
conversion value upon conversion of the notes, but would change how the conversion value
is paid. In lieu of receiving exclusively shares of common stock or cash upon conversion,
noteholders would receive cash up to the value of the accreted principal amount of the
notes converted and, at the Company’s option, any remainder of the conversion value
would be paid in cash or shares of common stock. The consent solicitation was successfully
completed on December 6, 2004 and the amended conversion provisions were adopted.

Holders
may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on January 15, 2009,
January 15, 2014, January 15, 2019, January 15, 2024, and January 15,
2029, at stated prices plus accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash
interest, if any. We may only pay the purchase price of such notes in cash and not in
common stock.

We may redeem for cash all or a
portion of the notes at any time on or after January 15, 2009 at redemption prices
equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash
interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any, on such notes to the
applicable redemption date.

As of September 30, 2005, the senior
subordinated convertible notes were reclassified from long term to short term debt as the
notes became convertible on October 1, 2005 based upon the Company’s common stock
trading above the trigger price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive
trading-day period ending on September 30, 2005.

In accordance with EITF 04-8,
“The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings Per Share,” the
Company is required to include in its diluted weighted-average common share calculation an
increase in shares based upon the difference between the Company’s average closing
stock price for the period and the conversion price of $31.80. This is calculated using
the treasury stock method.

At December 31, 2006 the Company had
outstanding surety bonds of $137.5 million.

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, we did
not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as
entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would
have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or
other contractually narrow or limited purposes.

We believe that internally generated
cash flows and the remaining availability under our various credit facilities will be
adequate to finance normal operating requirements and further acquisition activities.
Although we maintain an active acquisition program, any further acquisitions will be
dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any
such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities, financial
condition and results of operations. We may also explore alternatives to attract
additional capital resources.

We anticipate that our recently
acquired businesses as well as our other businesses will generate positive cash flows from
operating activities, and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently
outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule. However, the rate at which we
can reduce our debt during 2007 (and reduce the associated interest expense) will be
affected by, among other things, the financing and operating requirements of any new
acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies. None of these
factors can be predicted with certainty.

Recently Issued
Accounting Standards

In July 2006, the FASB issued
Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
– an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.” FIN 48 clarifies the accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes by establishing minimum standards for the recognition and
measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Under the
requirements of FIN 48, the Company must review all of its uncertain tax positions and
make a determination as to whether its position is more-likely-than-not to be sustained
upon examination by regulatory authorities. If a position meets the more-likely-than-not
criterion, then the related tax benefit is measured based on the cumulative probability
analysis of the amount that is more-likely-than-not to be realized upon ultimate
settlement. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The
Company will adopt the provisions of FIN 48 beginning in the first quarter of 2007. The
cumulative effect of applying the provisions of FIN 48 will be reported as an adjustment
to the opening balance of retained earnings on January 1, 2007. While our analysis of the
impact of this Interpretation is not yet complete, we do not anticipate it will have a
material impact on our retained earnings at the time of adoption.

In September 2006, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements,” which clarifies the
definition of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands the
disclosures on fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently assessing the impact of
SFAS No. 157 on its consolidated financial position and results of operations.

In September 2006, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
Postretirement Plans-an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R).”
This statement requires a company to (a) recognize in its statement of financial position
an asset for a plan’s overfunded status or a liability for a plan’s underfunded
status (b) measure a plan’s assets and its obligations that determine its funded
status as of the end of the employer’s fiscal year, and (c) recognize changes in the
funded status of a defined postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur
(reported in comprehensive income). The requirement to recognize the funded status of a
benefit plan and the disclosure requirements are effective as of the end of the fiscal
year ending after December 15, 2006. The requirement to measure the plan assets and
benefit obligations as of the date of the employer’s fiscal year-end statement of
financial position is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. Our
adoption of SFAS No. 158 as of December 31, 2006 did not have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

In September 2006, the SEC issued SAB
108 “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying
Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements.” This standard addresses
quantifying the financial statement effect of misstatements, specifically, how the effects
of prior year uncorrected errors must be considered in quantifying misstatements in the
current year financial statements. This standard is effective for fiscal years ending
after November 15, 2006. The adoption of SAB 108 did not impact our financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.

In September 2006, the FASB issued
FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) AUG AIR-1 “Accounting for Planned Major
Maintenance Activities” (FSP AUG AIR-1). FSP AUG AIR-1 amends the guidance on the
accounting for planned major maintenance activities; specifically it precludes the use of
the previously acceptable “accrue in advance” method. FSP AUG AIR-1 is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We will adopt the provisions of
FSP AUG AIR-1 beginning in the first quarter of 2007 and do not expect FSP AUG AIR-1 to
have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Information About
Forward Looking Statements

This Annual Report includes and
incorporates by reference “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the
federal securities laws. In addition, we, or our executive officers on our behalf, may
from time to time make forward-looking statements in reports and other documents we file
with the SEC or in connection with oral statements made to the press, potential investors
or others. All statements that are not historical facts are “forward-looking
statements.” The words “estimate,” “project,” “intend,”
“expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” and similar expressions
identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include statements
regarding our expected financial position, business, financing plans, business strategy,
business prospects, revenues, working capital, liquidity, capital needs, interest costs
and income, in each case relating to our company as a whole, as well as statements
regarding acquisitions, potential acquisitions and the benefits of acquisitions.

Forward-looking statements are
estimates and projections reflecting our best judgment and involve a number of risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by
the forward-looking statements. These statements are based on our management’s
beliefs and assumptions, which in turn are based on currently available information.
Examples of forward looking statements in this report include but are not limited to our
expectations regarding our ability to generate operating cash flows and reduce debt and
associated interest expense and our expectations regarding growth through acquisitions.
Important assumptions relating to the forward-looking statements include, among others,
assumptions regarding demand for our products, the cost, timing and success of product
upgrades and new product introductions, raw materials costs, expected pricing levels, the
timing and cost of expected capital expenditures, expected outcomes of pending litigation,
competitive conditions, general economic conditions and expected synergies relating to
acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances. These assumptions could prove inaccurate.
Although we believe that the estimates and projections reflected in the forward-looking
statements are reasonable, our expectations may prove to be incorrect. Important factors
that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or projections
contained in the forward-looking statements include:

difficulty making acquisitions and successfully integrating acquired businesses;

any unforeseen liabilities associated with future acquisitions;

limitations on our business imposed by our indebtedness;

unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates;

difficulties associated with exports;

risks and costs associated with our international sales and operations;

increased directors and officers liability and other insurance costs;

risk of rising interest rates;

product liability and insurance risks;

increased warranty exposure;

future competition;

the cyclical nature of some of our markets;

reduction  of business with large customers;

risks associated with government contracts;

changes in the supply of, or price for, parts and components;

environmental compliance costs and liabilities;

risks and costs associated with asbestos-related litigation;

potential write-offs of our substantial intangible assets;

our ability to successfully develop new products;

failure to protect our technology;

trade tariffs that may be applied due to the U.S. government's delay in complying with certain WTO directives;

terrorist attacks;

future health crises; and

the factors discussed in Item 1A to this Annual Report under the heading "Risk Factors."

We believe these forward-looking
statements are reasonable. However, you should not place undue reliance on any
forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations. Further,
forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no
obligation to publicly update any of them in light of new information or future events.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to interest rate risks
on our outstanding borrowings, and we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks on
our transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are also exposed
to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock.

At December 31, 2006, we had a
combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. Our $1.055 billion senior credit
facility contains $655 million variable rate term notes and a $400 million variable rate
revolver. To reduce the financial risk of future rate increases, in 2005 the Company
entered into a $250 million fixed rate swap agreement expiring March 13, 2008. At December
31, 2006, the interest rate on the variable portion of the term loans was 6.11% and 4.54%
on the portion of the term loans covered by the rate swap. The weighted average interest
rate on the outstanding revolver balance was 6.33% at December 31, 2006. Our $230 million
senior unsecured convertible notes have a fixed interest rate of 3.75%. At December 31,
2006, the prevailing market rates were between 1.6% and 2.4% higher than the fixed rates
on our debt instruments.

At December 31, 2006, Roper’s
outstanding variable-rate borrowings not covered by the interest rate swap under the
$1.055 billion credit facility were $540.8 million. An increase in interest rates of 1%
would increase our annualized interest costs by $5.4 million.

Several of our businesses have
transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of
these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, Canadian dollars, British pounds,
Danish krone or Japanese yen. Sales by companies whose functional currency was not the
U.S. dollar were 29% of our total sales and 66% of these sales were by companies with a
European functional currency. The U.S. dollar weakened against most currencies during
2006, with the exception of the Japanese yen, which weakened slightly against the U.S.
dollar. However, the average rates for 2006 and 2005 are very similar, therefore, the
difference between 2006 operating results for these companies translated into U.S. dollars
during 2006 and these operating results translated into U.S. dollars during 2005 was only
1%. If these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout 2006 compared to
currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our expected net earnings
would have been approximately $4.2 million.

The changes in these currency
exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar during 2006 compared to currency exchange rates
at December 31, 2005 resulted in an increase in net assets of $23.6 million that was
reported as a component of comprehensive earnings, $20.7 million of which was attributed
to goodwill. Goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect
our reported earnings or cash flows.

The trading price of Roper’s
common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants
have on our results of operations. The stock prices also influence the computation of
potentially dilutive common stock which includes both stock awards and the premium over
the conversion price on senior subordinated convertible notes to determine diluted
earnings per share. The stock price also affects our employees’ perceptions of
various programs that involve our common stock. We believe the quantification of the
effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily
determinable.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

Index

Report of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders of
Roper Industries, Inc.:

We have completed integrated audits
of Roper Industries, Inc.‘s consolidated financial statements and of its internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on
our audits, are presented below.

Consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule

In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements, listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1), present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Roper Industries, Inc. and its
subsidiaries (the “Company”) at December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2006 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule
listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 1 to the
consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for
share-based compensation in 2006.

Internal control over
financial reporting

Also, in our opinion,
management’s assessment, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 based on criteria
established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2006 based on

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on
management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal
control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal
control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. As described in
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item
9A, management has excluded Dynisco Parent, Inc., Sinmed Holding International BV,
Intellitrans LLC, AC Analytical Controls Holding BV and Lumenera Corporation from its
assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 because
they were acquired by the Company in purchase business combinations during 2006. We have
also excluded Dynisco Parent, Inc., Sinmed Holding International BV, Intellitrans LLC, AC
Analytical Controls Holding BV and Lumenera Corporation from our audit of internal control
over financial reporting. Dynisco Corporation, Sinmed BV, Intellitrans LLC, AC Analytical
Controls Holding BV and Lumenera Corporation are wholly-owned subsidiaries whose total
assets represent 9.6%, 0.7%, 1.9%, 0.7% and 1.1% respectively, and whose total revenues
represent 0.5%, 0.3%, 0.7%, 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively, of the related consolidated
financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Summary of Accounting
Policies

Basis
of Presentation

– These financial statements present consolidated information
for Roper Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Roper” or the “Company”).
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Nature
of the Business

– Roper is a diversified growth company that designs,
manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls, scientific and industrial
imaging products and software, industrial technology products and radio frequency (RF)
products and services. We market these products and services to selected segments of a
broad range of markets, including radio frequency applications, water, energy, research
and medical, security and other niche markets.

Accounts
Receivable

— Accounts receivable were stated net of an allowance for doubtful
accounts and sales allowances of $9,003,000 and $8,625,000 at December 31, 2006 and
2005, respectively. Outstanding accounts receivable balances are reviewed periodically,
and allowances are provided at such time that management believes reasonable doubt exists
that such balances will be collected within a reasonable period of time.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

— Roper considers highly liquid financial instruments with
remaining maturities at acquisition of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Roper
had no cash equivalents at December 31, 2006 and 2005.

Earnings
per Share

– Basic earnings per share were calculated using net earnings and the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the respective year.
Diluted earnings per share were calculated using net earnings and the weighted average
number of shares of common stock and potential common stock outstanding during the
respective year. Potentially dilutive common stock consisted of stock options, restricted
stock awards and the premium over the conversion price on our senior subordinated
convertible notes based upon the trading price of the company’s common stock. The
effects of potential common stock were determined using the treasury stock method (in
thousands).

As
of and for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, there were 79,000, 8,000,
and 81,000 outstanding stock options that were not included in the determination of
diluted earnings per share because doing so would have been antidilutive.

Estimates

– The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

— Roper’s short-term debt at December 31,
2006 included $230 million of fixed-rate notes, the interest rate on which was 2.36% less
than prevailing market rates which results in a valuation of approximately $219 million.
Most of Roper’s other borrowings at December 31, 2006 were at various interest rates
that adjust relatively frequently under its $1.055 billion credit facility. The fair
value for each of these borrowings at December 31, 2006 was estimated to be the face
value of these borrowings.

Foreign
Currency Translation

— Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries whose functional
currency is not the U.S. dollar were translated at the exchange rate in effect at the
balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses were translated at average exchange rates
for the period in which those entities were included in Roper’s financial results.
Translation adjustments are reflected as a component of other comprehensive earnings.

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets

– The Company determines whether there has been an
impairment of long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and identifiable intangible assets
that are determined to have indefinite useful economic lives, when certain indicators of
impairment are present. In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the cost
of any long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability would be
performed. If an evaluation is required, the estimated future gross, undiscounted cash
flows associated with the asset would be compared to the asset’s carrying amount to
determine if a write-down to market value is required. Future adverse changes in market
conditions or poor operating results of underlying long-lived assets could result in
losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the long-lived assets that may
not be reflected in the assets’ current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring
an impairment charge in the future.

Income
Taxes

– Roper is a U.S.-based multinational company and the calculation of its
worldwide provision for income taxes requires analysis of many factors, including income
tax systems that vary from country to country, and the United States’ treatment of
non-U.S. earnings. Roper has provided for U.S. income taxes for deferred taxes on
undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries that are not expected to be permanently
reinvested in such companies. There has been no provision for U.S. income taxes for the
remaining undistributed earnings of approximately $12.9 million at December 31, 2006,
because Roper intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in operations outside the
United States. If such earnings were distributed, incremental U.S. taxes of approximately
$4.5 million would accrue after utilization of U.S. tax credits.

Certain
assets and liabilities have different bases for financial reporting and income tax
purposes. Deferred income taxes have been provided for these differences.

Goodwill
and Other Intangibles

–Roper accounts for goodwill in a purchase business
combination as the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired.
Business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being recognized.
Amortization of intangible assets, if applicable, occurs over their estimated useful
lives. Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets”(“SFAS 142”) requires companies to cease amortizing
goodwill that existed at June 30, 2001 and establishes a two-step method for testing
goodwill for impairment on an annual basis (or an interim basis if an event occurs that
might reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value). Roper conducts
this review for all of its reporting units during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.
No impairment resulted from the annual review performed in 2006. SFAS 142 also requires
that an identifiable intangible asset that is determined to have an indefinite useful
economic life not be amortized, but separately tested for impairment using a one-step
fair value based approach. Total goodwill includes 22 different business components with
individual amounts ranging from less than $1 million to approximately $447 million.

Inventories

— Inventories
are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in,
first-out method. The Company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or
excess inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated
market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.

Other
Comprehensive Earnings

– Comprehensive earnings includes net earnings and all
other non-owner sources of changes in a company’s net assets. The differences
between net earnings and comprehensive earnings were currency translation adjustments and
the unrealized gain related to an interest rate swap, net of tax.

Property,
Plant and Equipment and Depreciation and Amortization

— Property, plant and
equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation
and amortization are provided for using principally the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

Buildings

20-30 years

Machinery

8-12 years

Other equipment

3-5 years

Capitalized
Software

– The Company accounts for capitalized software under Statement of
Position (“SOP”) 98-1, “Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software
Developed or Obtained for Internal Use.” Among other provisions, SOP 98-1 requires
that entities capitalize certain internal-use software costs once certain criteria are
met. Under SOP 98-1, overhead, general and administrative and training costs are not
capitalized. Capitalized software was $9.4 million and $9.5 million at December 31, 2006
and 2005, respectively.

Recently
Released Accounting Pronouncements

–In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation
(“FIN”) No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.” FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for
uncertainty in income taxes by establishing minimum standards for the recognition and
measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Under the
requirements of FIN 48, the Company must review all of its uncertain tax positions and
make a determination as to whether its position is more-likely-than-not to be sustained
upon examination by regulatory authorities. If a position meets the more-likely-than-not
criterion, then the related tax benefit is measured based on the cumulative probability
analysis of the amount that is more-likely-than-not to be realized upon ultimate
settlement. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The
Company will adopt the provisions of FIN 48 beginning in the first quarter of 2007. The
cumulative effect of applying the provisions of FIN 48 will be reported as an adjustment
to the opening balance of retained earnings on January 1, 2007. While our analysis of the
impact of this Interpretation is not yet complete, we do not anticipate it will have a
material impact on our retained earnings at the time of adoption.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements,” which
clarifies the definition of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value
and expands the disclosures on fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective
for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently
assessing the impact of SFAS No. 157 on its consolidated financial position and
results of operations.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans-an amendment of FASB Statements
No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R).” This statement requires a company to (a) recognize in
its statement of financial position an asset for a plan’s overfunded status or a
liability for a plan’s underfunded status (b) measure a plan’s assets and its
obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer’s fiscal
year, and (c) recognize changes in the funded status of a defined postretirement plan in
the year in which the changes occur (reported in comprehensive income). The requirement
to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan and the disclosure requirements are
effective as of the end of the fiscal year ending after December 15, 2006. The
requirement to measure the plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the
employer’s fiscal year-end statement of financial position is effective for fiscal
years ending after December 15, 2008. Our adoption of SFAS No. 158 as of December 31,
2006 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In
September 2006, the SEC issued SAB 108 “Considering the Effects of Prior Year
Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements.”This
standard addresses quantifying the financial statement effect of misstatements,
specifically, how the effects of prior year uncorrected errors must be considered in
quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements. This standard is
effective for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. The adoption of SAB 108 did
not impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) AUG AIR-1 “Accounting
for Planned Major Maintenance Activities” (FSP AUG AIR-1). FSP AUG AIR-1 amends the
guidance on the accounting for planned major maintenance activities; specifically it
precludes the use of the previously acceptable “accrue in advance” method. FSP
AUG AIR-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We will
adopt the provisions of FSP AUG AIR-1 beginning in the first quarter of 2007 and do not
expect FSP AUG AIR-1 to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Research
and Development

— Research and development costs include salaries and benefits,
rents, supplies, and other costs related to various products under development. Research
and development costs are expensed in the period incurred and totaled $58.6 million,
$53.5 million and $38.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

Revenue
Recognition and Product Warranties

– The Company recognizes revenue when all of
the following criteria are met:

persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists

delivery has occurred or services have been rendered

the seller's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and

collectibility is reasonably assured.

In
addition, the Company recognizes revenue from the sale of product when title and risk of
loss pass to the customer, which is generally when product is shipped. The Company
recognizes revenue from services rendered upon customer acceptance. Revenues under
certain relatively long-term and relatively large-value construction projects are
recognized under the percentage-of-completion method using the ratio of costs incurred to
total estimated costs as the measure of performance. The Company recognized revenues of
approximately $94.8 million, $90.0 million and $16.8 million for the years ended December
31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, using this method. Estimated losses on any
projects are recognized as soon as such losses become known.

The
Company sells certain of its products to customers with a product warranty that provides
that customers can return a defective product during a specified warranty period
following the purchase in exchange for a replacement product, repair at no cost to the
customer or the issuance of a credit to the customer. The Company accrues its estimated
exposure to warranty claims based upon current and historical product sales date,
warranty costs incurred and any other related information known to the Company.

Stock-Based
Compensation

– Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the
provisions of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment (“SFAS 123R”),” which
requires the Company to recognize expense for the grant date fair value of its employee
stock option awards. The Company recognizes the expense of all share-based awards on a
straight-line basis over the employee’s requisite service period (generally the
vesting period of the award).

Prior
to January 1, 2006, the Company accounted for its stock option plans under the
recognition and measurement provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related Interpretations (“APB
25”), as permitted by SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation.” The Company elected to adopt the modified-prospective transition
method as provided by SFAS No. 123(R). Under that transition method, share-based
compensation cost recognized in 2006 includes: (a) compensation expense for all
share-based awards granted prior to, but not yet vested, as of January 1, 2006,
based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions
of SFAS No. 123, and (b) compensation expense for all share-based awards
granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated
in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). Financial statement amounts
for the prior periods presented have not been restated to reflect the fair value method
of expensing share based compensation.

On
November 10, 2005 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued
FASB Staff Position No. FAS 123(R)-3, “Transition Election Related to Accounting for
Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards.” The Company has elected to adopt the
alternative transition method provided in the FASB Staff Position for calculating the tax
effects of share-based compensation pursuant to SFAS 123(R). The alternative transition
method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional
paid-in capital pool (“APIC Pool”) related to the tax effects of employee
share-based compensation, and to determine the subsequent impact on the APIC Pool and
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows of the tax effects of employee and director
share-based awards that are outstanding upon adoption of SFAS 123(R). The Company use

s

the
short cut method to calculate the pool of windfall tax benefits.

Prior
to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company presented all tax benefits of
deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash flows in the
Statement of Cash Flows. Effective January 1, 2006 and in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R),
the Company changed its cash flow presentation so that the cash flows resulting from the
tax benefits arising from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized
for those options (excess tax benefits) are now classified as financing cash flows.

The
Company estimates the fair value of its option awards using the Black-Scholes option
valuation model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. The stock
volatility for each grant is measured using the weighted average of historical daily
price changes of the Company’s common stock over the most recent period equal to the
expected life of the grant. The expected term of options granted is derived from
historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations, and represents
the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free
rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury
yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The weighted average fair value of options
granted in 2006 was calculated to be $13.19 per share using the following weighted
average assumptions for the year ended December 31, 2006:

The
Company did not recognize compensation expense for employee stock based awards for the

market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant. The Company did recognize
compensation expense under APB 25 relating to its restricted stock awards.

On
December 31, 2006, Roper had approximately $6.7 million of U.S. federal net operating
loss carryforwards, which will expire in future years, with the majority of the
carryforwards expiring in 2024. Additionally, Roper had foreign tax credit carryforwards
and research and development credit carryforwards. Roper has not recognized a valuation
allowance since management has determined that it is more likely than not that the
results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize these
deferred tax assets.

On
October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act (“AJCA”) was signed into
law.  The AJCA includes a deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that are
repatriated, as defined in the AJCA.  During 2005, the Company repatriated
approximately $82 million of dividends, resulting in a tax benefit of approximately $6.6
million.  Management obtained the requisite corporate officer and Board of
Directors approvals of the domestic reinvestment plan within the timeframe specified.

Our
principal $1.055 billion credit facility and our $230 million senior subordinated
convertible notes provide substantially all of our daily external financing requirements.
The credit facility consists of a $655 million term loan and a $400 million revolving
loan, both maturing on December 13, 2009. The interest rate on the borrowings under the
$1.055 billion credit facility is calculated based upon various recognized indices plus a
margin as defined in the credit agreement. In 2005, the Company entered into a fixed rate
swap agreement ending March 2008 which fixes the interest rate on $250 million of our
term loans. At December 31, 2006, the interest rate on the variable portion of the term
loans was 6.11% and 4.54% on the portion of the term loans covered by the rate swap. The
weighted average interest rate on the outstanding revolver balance was 6.33% at December
31, 2006. Our senior subordinated convertible notes are due in 2034. At December 31,
2006, our debt consisted of the $230 million in senior subordinated convertible notes,
$588.8 million term loan balance, and $202.0 million in revolver loans. In addition, we
had $6.0 million of other debt in the form of capital leases, several smaller facilities
that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in various foreign
locations to support our non-U.S. businesses and $54.2 million of outstanding letters of
credit at December 31, 2006. We expect that our available additional borrowing capacity
combined with the cash flows expected to be generated from existing business will be
sufficient to fund normal operating requirements and finance some additional acquisitions.

In
December 2004, the Company amended and restated its previous $625 million credit
agreement to the current $1.055 billion credit agreement to increase capacity, lower
borrowing costs, and improve other terms and conditions. Due to this amendment, the
Company incurred an $8.2 million non-cash debt extinguishment cost related to deferred
financing costs for the previous credit agreement.

In
December 2003, we issued through a public offering $230 million of 3.75% subordinated
convertible notes due in 2034 at an original issue discount of 60.498% (the “Convertible
Notes”). The Convertible Notes are subordinated in right of payment and collateral
to all of our existing and future senior debt. Interest on the notes is payable
semiannually, beginning July 15, 2004, until January 15, 2009. After that date,
we will not pay cash interest on the notes prior to maturity unless contingent cash
interest becomes payable. Instead, after January 15, 2009, interest will be
recognized at the effective rate of 3.75% and will represent accrual of original issue
discount, excluding any contingent cash interest that may become payable. We will pay
contingent cash interest to the holders of the notes during any six month period
commencing after January 15, 2009 if the average trading price of a note for a five
trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals 120%
or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and accrued cash
interest, if any, for such note. The contingent cash interest payable per note in respect
of any six month period will equal the annual rate of 0.25%. As originally issued,
holders could convert their notes into 12.422 shares of our common stock (giving effect
for the 2-for-1 stock split effective August 26, 2005), subject to adjustment, only (1)
if the sale price of our common stock reaches, or the trading price of the notes falls
below, specified thresholds, (2) if the notes are called for redemption, or (3) if
specified corporate transactions have occurred. Upon conversion, we would have had the
right to deliver, in lieu of our common stock, cash or common stock or a combination of
cash and common stock. On December 6, 2004, the Company completed a consent solicitation
to amend the notes such that the Company pays the same conversion value upon conversion
of the notes, but changes how the conversion value is paid. In lieu of receiving
exclusively shares of common stock or cash upon conversion, noteholders would receive
cash up to the value of the accreted principal amount of the notes converted and, at the
Company’s option, any remainder of the conversion value would be paid in cash or
shares of common stock. Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their
notes on January 15, 2009 at a price of $395.02 per note, on January 15, 2014 at a price
of $475.66 per note, on January 15, 2019 at a price of $572.76 per note, on January 15,
2024 at a price of $689.68 per note, and on January 15, 2029 at a price of $830.47 per
note, in each case plus accrued cash interest, if any, and accrued contingent cash
interest, if any. We may only pay the purchase price of such notes in cash and not in
common stock. In addition, if we experience a change in control, each holder may require
us to purchase for cash all or a portion of such holder’s notes at a price equal to
the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount for non-tax purposes,
accrued cash interest, if any, and accrued contingent cash interest, if any, to the date
of purchase.

As
of September 30, 2005, our $230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes were
reclassified from long term to short term debt as the notes became convertible on October
1, 2005 based upon the Company’s common stock trading above the trigger price for at
least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading-day periods ending on September
30, 2005. In addition, deferred financing costs related to the notes of approximately
$3.9 million were expensed in 2005. These expenses were previously being amortized to the
first put date of the notes, which is January 15, 2009.

Our
credit facility requires us to prepay the term loan and, in certain cases, reduce the
commitments under the revolving loan, upon the receipt of certain proceeds, including
from certain asset sales, the incurrence of certain debt, and up to 75% of our excess
cash flows unless we meet a consolidated total leverage ratio test. We are also required
to make quarterly principal payments on the term loans.

The
facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants which, among other things,
limit our ability to incur new debt, prepay subordinated debt, make certain investments
and acquisitions, sell assets and grant liens, make restricted payments (including the
payment of dividends on our common stock) and capital expenditures, or change our line of
business. We also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our
consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio.
The most restrictive covenant is the consolidated total leverage ratio which, as defined
in the credit agreement, is limited to 4.00 during the year ended December 31, 2006,
declining by 0.25 each year over the remaining term of the agreement.

At
December 31, 2006, and 2005, the Company was in compliance with its restrictive
covenants.

Retirement and Other Benefit Plans

Roper
maintains four defined contribution retirement plans under the provisions of Section
401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code covering substantially all U.S. employees not subject
to collective bargaining agreements. Roper partially matches employee contributions. Its
costs related to these plans were $9,890,000, $9,306,000 and $7,548,000 for 2006, 2005
and 2004, respectively.

Roper
also maintains various defined benefit retirement plans covering employees of non-U.S.
and certain U.S. subsidiaries and a plan that supplements certain employees for the
contribution ceiling applicable to the Section 401(k) plans. The costs and accumulated
benefit obligations associated with each of these plans were not material.

stock-based compensation plans available to grant incentive stock options, nonqualified
stock options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights or equivalent instruments to
the Company’s employees, officers, directors and consultants. The Roper Industries,
Inc. 2006 Incentive Plan (“2006 Plan”) was approved by shareholders at the
Annual Meeting of Shareholders on June 28, 2006. The 2006 Plan replaces the Amended and
Restated 2000 Incentive Plan (“2000 Plan”), and no additional grants will be
made from the 2000 Plan or the Non-employee Director Plan. The number of shares reserved
for issuance under the 2006 plan is 3,000,000, plus the 17,000 remaining shares that were
available to grant under the 2000 Plan at June 28, 2006, plus any shares underlying
outstanding awards under the 2000 plan that terminate or expire unexercised, or are
cancelled, forfeited or lapse for any reason subsequent to June 28, 2006.

On
September 13, 2006, the Compensation Committee of Roper’s Board of Directors
approved an amendment to the 2006 Plan, changing the definition of fair market value to
be the closing trading price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date for any
awards made under the 2006 Plan.

Stock
Options –

Stock options under all plans are typically granted at prices not less
than 100% of market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant. Stock options
typically vest over a period of up to three to five years from the grant date and
generally expire seven to ten years after the grant date. During 2006, the Company
recorded $3,726,000 of compensation expense relating to outstanding options. No
compensation expense was recorded related to outstanding options during 2005.

At
December 31, 2006, there was $6,493,000 of total unrecognized compensation expense
related to nonvested shares granted to both employees and directors under the Company’s
share-based payment plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
period of 2.4 years. The weighted average grant date fair value of options during 2006
and 2005 was $13.19 and $12.21, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options
exercised in 2006 and 2005 was $34,153,000 and $12,994,000, respectively. Cash received
from option exercises under all plans in 2006 and 2005 was approximately $20,704,000 and
$13,693,000, respectively. The actual tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from
option exercises under all plans in 2006 and 2005 totaled approximately $11,539,000 and
$4,225,000 respectively.

Restricted
Stock Awards —

During 2006 and 2005, the Company granted 314,000 and 280,000
shares, respectively, of Restricted Stock to certain employee and director participants
under the 2006, 2000 and Non-Employee Director plans. Restricted Stock awards generally
vest over a period of 1 to 3 years. The weighted average fair value of the shares granted
in 2006 was $44.76 per share. The Company recorded approximately $11,462,000 and
$4,803,000 of compensation expense related to outstanding shares of Restricted Stock held
by employees and directors during 2006 and 2005, respectively. A summary of the Company’s
nonvested shares activity for 2006 is as follows:

related to nonvested shares granted to both employees and directors under the Company’s
share-based payment plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
period of 1.9 years. There were 177,000 and 88,000 shares that vested during 2006 and
2005, respectively. Unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested shares of
Restricted Stock awards is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital in
shareholder’s equity at December 31, 2006.

Employee
Stock Purchase Plan

— All employees in the U.S. and Canada are eligible to
participate in Roper’s stock purchase plan whereby they may designate up to 10% of
eligible earnings to purchase Roper’s common stock at a 10% discount to the average
closing price of its common stock at the beginning and end of a quarterly offering
period. The common stock sold to the employees may be either treasury stock, stock
purchased on the open market, or newly issued shares. During 2006, 2005 and 2004,
participants of the employee stock purchase plan purchased 38,000, 41,000 and 34,000
shares, respectively, of Roper’s common stock for total consideration of $1,568,000,
$1,315,000, and $826,000, respectively. All of these shares were purchased from Roper’s
treasury shares. The Company recorded $227,000, $0 and $0 of compensation expense
relating to the stock purchase plan during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

)

Common Stock Transactions

On
July 27, 2005, the Company declared a two-for-one split of its common stock. The split
was effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend paid on August 26, 2005 to shareholders
of record at the end of business on August 12, 2005. All historical weighted average
share and per share amounts and all references to stock compensation data and market
prices of the Company’s common stock for all periods presented have been adjusted to
reflect this two-for-one stock split.

At
the 2006 Shareholder Meeting, shareholders approved an amendment to the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, to eliminate time phase voting and give all outstanding
shares of common stock of the Company one vote on matters properly submitted to the
shareholders of the Company for their vote. Previously, Roper’s restated Certificate
of Incorporation provided that each outstanding share of Roper’s common stock
entitled the holder thereof to five votes per share, except that holders of outstanding
shares with respect to which there had been a change in beneficial ownership during the
four years immediately preceding the applicable record date would have been entitled to
one vote per share.

On
January 8, 2006, the Roper Shareholder Rights Plan expired. This plan had provided that
one Preferred Stock Purchase Right (a “Right”) accompanied each outstanding
share of common stock. Such Rights only became exercisable, or transferable apart from
the common stock, ten business days after a person or group acquires various specified
levels of beneficial ownership.

Concurrent
with the TransCore Holdings, Inc. acquisition in December 2004, the Company completed a
public offering of 5,000,000 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately
$300.5 million. On December 28, 2004, an underwriters’ overallotment of 115,000
shares of common stock was exercised and closed, providing the Company with gross
proceeds of approximately $6.9 million before expenses.

Concurrent
with the NTGH acquisition in December 2003, the Company completed a public offering of
4,200,000 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $201.6 million. In
connection with our acquisition of NTGH, we also purchased the remaining one-third
interest in DAP Technologies that NTGH did not own. Part of the consideration for this
one-third interest consisted of 34,000 shares of the Company’s treasury shares. In
January 2004, an underwriters’ overallotment of 630,000 shares of common stock was
exercised and closed, providing the Company with gross proceeds of approximately $30.2
million before expenses.

Contingencies

Roper,
in the ordinary course of business, is the subject of, or a party to, various pending or
threatened legal actions, including those pertaining to product liability and employment
practices. It is vigorously contesting all lawsuits that, in general, are based upon
claims of the kind that have been customary over the past several years. After analyzing
the Company’s contingent liabilities on a gross basis and, based upon past
experience with resolution of its product liability and employment practices claims and
the limits of the primary, excess, and umbrella liability insurance coverages that are
available with respect to pending claims, management believes that adequate provision has
been made to cover any potential liability not covered by insurance, and that the
ultimate liability, if any, arising from these actions should not have a material adverse
effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows of
Roper.

Over
recent years there has been a significant increase in certain U.S. states in
asbestos-related litigation claims against numerous industrial companies. Roper or its
subsidiaries have been named defendants in some such cases. No significant resources have
been required by Roper to respond to these cases and Roper believes it has valid defenses
to such claims and, if required, intends to defend them vigorously. Given the state of
these claims it is not possible to determine the potential liability, if any.

Roper’s
rent expense was approximately $21.8 million, $17.6 million and $15.2 million for fiscal
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Roper’s future minimum lease commitments totaled
$97.6 million at December 31, 2006. These commitments included $22.2 million in fiscal
2007, $18.1 million in fiscal 2008, $15.4 million in fiscal 2009, $12.0 million in fiscal
2010, $7.5 million in fiscal 2011 and $22.4 million thereafter.

Segment and Geographic Area Information

In
2006, Roper consolidated the number of reporting segments from five to four, reflecting
the continued implementation of its market-focus strategy to capture value-creating
opportunities around common customers, market orientation, sales channels and common cost
opportunities. All prior year comparisons have been restated to conform to the current
year presentation.  Roper’s four segments are: Industrial Technology, Energy Systems
and Controls, Scientific and Industrial Imaging and RF Technology. Products included
within the Industrial Technology segment are industrial pumps, flow measurement and
metering equipment, and industrial valves and controls, and equipment and consumables for
materials analysis and industrial leak testing. The Energy Systems and Controls segment’s
products include control systems, equipment and consumables for fluid properties testing,
machinery vibration and other non-destructive inspection and measurement products and
services. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment offers high performance digital
imaging products and software, patient positioning products and software in medical
applications and handheld computers and software. The RF Technology segment includes
products and systems related to comprehensive toll and traffic systems, security and
access control, mobile asset tracking and water sub-metering and remote temperature
monitoring applications. Roper’s management structure and internal reporting are
also aligned consistent with these four segments.

There
were no material transactions between Roper’s business segments during 2006, 2005
and 2004. Sales between geographic areas are primarily of finished products and are
accounted for at prices intended to represent third-party prices. Operating profit by
business segment and by geographic area is defined as sales less operating costs and
expenses. These costs and expenses do not include unallocated corporate administrative
expenses. Items below income from operations on Roper’s statement of earnings are
not allocated to business segments.

Identifiable
assets are those assets used primarily in the operations of each business segment or
geographic area. Corporate assets were principally comprised of cash, recoverable
insurance claims, deferred compensation assets, unamortized deferred financing costs and
property and equipment.

Selected
financial information by business segment for 2006, 2005 and 2004 follows (in thousands):

Summarized
data for Roper’s U.S. and foreign operations (principally in Canada, Europe and
Japan) for 2006, 2005 and 2004, based upon the country of origin of the Roper entity
making the sale, were as follows (in thousands):

Export
sales from the United States during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were
$234 million, $232 million and $188 million, respectively. In the year ended December 31,
2006, these exports were shipped primarily to Europe (32%), Canada (15%), Japan (8%),
China (8%), rest of Asia (excluding the Middle East) (15%), Middle East (9%) and other
(13%).

Sales
to customers outside the United States accounted for a significant portion of Roper’s
revenues. Sales are attributed to geographic areas based upon the location where the
product is ultimately shipped. Foreign countries that accounted for at least 5% of Roper’s
net sales in any of the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 have been
individually identified in the following table (in thousands). Other countries have been
grouped by region.

(15)

Concentration of Risk

Financial
instruments which potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist primarily of
cash, cash equivalents and trade receivables.

The
Company maintains cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions.
Cash equivalents include investments in commercial paper of companies with high credit
ratings, investments in money market securities and securities backed by the U.S.
Government. At times such amounts may exceed the F.D.I.C. limits. The Company limits the
amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution and believes that no
significant concentration of credit risk exists with respect to cash investments.

Trade
receivables subject the company to the potential for credit risk with customers. To
reduce credit risk, the Company performs ongoing evaluations of its customers’ financial
condition.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES

Management’s Report
on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate control over financial reporting, as such term is
defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control-Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in

Internal Control-Integrated
Framework

, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting
was effective as of December 31, 2006. Our management’s assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 has
been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting
firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.

Management excluded Sinmed,
Intellitrans, Lumenera, AC Controls and Dynisco from its assessment of internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 because they were acquired by the Company
in purchase business combinations during 2006. Sinmed, Intellitrans, Lumenera, AC Controls
and Dynisco are wholly-owned subsidiaries whose total assets represent 0.7%, 1.9%, 1.1%,
0.7% and 9.6%, respectively, and whose total revenues represent 0.3%, 0.7%, 0.5%, 0.6% and
0.5%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for
the year ended December 31, 2006.

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures

As required by SEC rules, we have
evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. This evaluation was carried
out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer. Based on this evaluation, we
have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of December
31, 2006.

Disclosure controls and procedures are our controls and other procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we
file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported,
within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules
and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and
procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in
the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act are accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
