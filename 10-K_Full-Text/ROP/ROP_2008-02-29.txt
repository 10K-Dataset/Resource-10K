PART
 I

ITEM
 1.     BUSINESS

Our
 Business

Roper
 Industries, Inc. (“Roper” or the “Company”) was incorporated on December 17, 1981 under the laws of the State
 of Delaware.  We are

a diversified

growth

company
 that designs, manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls, scientific and industrial imaging products and software,
 industrial technology products and radio frequency (RF) products and services. We market these products and services to selected
 segments of a broad range of markets including RF applic

ations, water, energy, research and

medical

,
 security and other niche markets.

We
 pursue consistent and sustainable growth in sales and earnings by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance
 of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses that offer high value-ad

ded

services,

engineered products and solutions and are capable
 of achieving growth and maintaining high margins. We compete in many niche markets and believe that we are the market leader or a
 competitive alternative to the market leader in the majority of these markets.

We
 continued our growth in 200


from internal growth and
 the full-year contributions from the



acquisitions of

Sinmed Holding International BV (“Sinmed”)
 on April 5, 2006, Intellitrans, LLC (“Intellitrans”) on April 26, 2006, Lumenera Corporation (“Lumenera”) on
 July 25, 2006, AC Analytical Controls Holding B.V. (“AC Controls”) on August 8, 2006 and Dynisco Parent, Inc. (“Dynisco”)

Market
 Share, Market Expansion, and Product Development

Leadership
 with Engineered Content for Niche Markets.

We have developed and maintained a leading
 position in many of our markets. We believe our market positions are attributable to the technical sophistication of our products,
 the applications expertise used to create our advanced products and systems, and our distribution and service capabilities.
Our operating units grow their businesses through new product development
 and development of new applications and services for existing products to satisfy customer
 needs.   In addition, our operating units continue to grow our customer base by expanding our
 distribution, selling other products through our existing channels and entering adjacent markets.

Diversified
 End Markets and Geographic Reach.

Over the past decade, we have strategically expanded
 the number of end markets we serve to increase revenue and business stability and expand our opportunities for growth. We
 have a global presence, with  sales
 of products manufactured and exported from the U.S. and manufactured abroad and sold to customers outside the U.S. accounting for $859 million
 in 2007, compared to $610 million in 2006.  Information regarding our international
 operations is set forth in Note 14 of the Notes to
 Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”).

Research
 and Development.

We conduct applied research and development to improve the quality and
 performance of our products and to develop new technologies and products to enter new markets. Our rese

arch

Materials
 and Suppliers

We
 believe that most materials and supplies used by us are readily available from numerous sources and suppliers throughout the
 world. However, some of our components and sub-assemblies are currently available from a limited number of suppliers. Some
 high-performance components for digital imaging products can be in short supply and/or suppliers have occasional difficulty
 manufacturing such components to our specifications. We regularly investigate and identify alternative sources where possible, and
 we believe that these conditions equally affect our competitors. Thus far, supply shortages have not had a material adverse
 effect on Roper’s sales although delays in shipments have occurred following such supply interruptions.

Environmental
 Matters and Other Governmental Regulation

Our
 operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including laws and regulations
 governing air emissions, water discharges, waste management and workplace safety.  We use, generate and dispose of hazardous
 substances and waste in our operations and, as a result, could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the
 investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury.  We are required continually to
 conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements
 change.  We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, modest costs relating to our compliance with environmental
 laws and regulations.  In connection with our acquisitions, we may assume significant environmental liabilities, some of which we
 may not be aware of, or may not be quantifiable, at the time of acquisition. In addition, new laws and regulations, stricter
 enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up
 requirements could increase our environmental compliance costs or subject us to new or increased liabilities.

Competition

Generally,
 our products and solutions face significant competition, usually from a limited number of competitors. We believe that we are a
 leader in most of our markets, and no single company competes with us over a significant number of product lines. Competitors
 might be large or small in size, often depending on the life cycle and maturity of the technology employed. We compete primarily
 on product quality, performance, innovation, technology, price, applications expertise, distribution channel access and customer
 service capabilities.

Patents
 and Trademarks

In
 addition to trade secrets, unpatented know-how, and other intellectual property rights, we own or license the rights under a number of
 patents, trademarks and copyrights relating to certain of our products and businesses. We also employ various methods, including
 confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with employees, to protect our trade secrets and know-how. While we believe that
 our operating units are not substantially dependent on any single patent, trademark, copyright, or other item of intellectual
 property or group of patents, trademarks or copyrights, the product development and market activities of Compressor Controls,
 Neptune Technology

, TransCore

and

our

medical
 and

imaging businesses

, in particular, have been
 planned and conducted in conjunction with continuing patent and license strategies.

Employees

As
 of December 31,


, we had approximately

7,100

total employees,

with

approximately

5,200

located in the United States.

Approximately


of our employees are subject to collective bargaining
 agreements. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with

our

employees
 to be good.

ITEM
 1A.     RISK FACTORS

Risks
 Relating to Our Business

Our
 indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility.

As
 of December 31,


, we had approximately $

1.0


b

illion in total consolidated indebtedness. In addition, we

had

approximately $


million undrawn availability under our senior secured credit facility. Our total consolidated debt
 could increase

using

this additional borrowing
 capacity. Subject to certain restrictions contained in our senior secured credit facility and other debt agreements, we may incur
 additional indebtedness in the future, including indebtedness incurred to finance, or which is assumed in connection with,
 acquisitions.

Our
 level of indebtedness and the debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our
 operations and business strategy. For example, our indebtedness could:

·

place
 us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors, some of which have lower debt service obligations and greater
financial resources than us;

·

limit
our ability to borrow additional funds;

·

limit
our ability to complete future acquisitions;

·

limit
our ability to pay dividends;

·

limit
our ability to make capital expenditures; and

·

increase
our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions.

Our
 ability to make scheduled payments of principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other
 debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond our control. In
 addition, there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms for the
 payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. If we are unable to service our indebtedness, our business, financial condition and
 results of operations would be materially adversely affected.

In addition, our senior secured credit facility contains
 financial covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified
 financial ratios. Our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our senior secured credit facility may be
 affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of these
 covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios, tests or other restrictions contained in our senior secured credit
 facility could result in an event of default under this facility, which in turn could result in an event of default under the
 terms of our other indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our senior secured credit facility, and the
 expiration of any grace periods, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the facility, together with
 accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the
 amounts due under this facility or our other indebtedness.

Unfavorable
 changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly harm our business.

Several
 of our operating companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of these
 transactions and balances are denominated in euros,

Canadian dollars,

British
 pounds

,

Danish krone

and Japanese yen

. Sales by our operating companies whose
 functional currency is not the U.S. dollar represented approximately


%
 of our total net sales for the year ended December 31,


compared
 to


% for the year ended December 31,


.
 Unfavorable changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and those currencies could significantly reduce our reported sales
 and earnings. At present, we do not hedge against foreign currency risks.

We
 export a significant portion of our products. Difficulties associated with the export of our products could harm our business.

Sales
 to customers outside the U.S. by our businesses located in the U.S. account for a significant portion of our net sales. These
 sales accounted for approximately


% and


%
 of our net sales for the years ended December 31,


and
 December 31,


, respectively. We are subject to
 risks that could limit our ability to export our products or otherwise reduce the demand for these products in our foreign
 markets. Such risks include, without limitation, the following:

·

unfavorable
changes in or noncompliance with U.S. and other jurisdictions' export requirements;

·

restrictions
on the export of technology and related products;

·

unfavorable
changes in or noncompliance with U.S. and other jurisdictions' export policies to certain countries;

·

unfavorable
changes in the import policies of our foreign markets; and

·

a
general economic downturn in our foreign markets.

The
 occurrence of any of these events could reduce the foreign demand for our products or could limit our ability to export our
 products and, therefore, could materially negatively affect our future sales and earnings.

Economic,
 political and other risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business.

As
 of December 31,


, approximately 1


%
 of our long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and intangibles

,

were attributable to operations outside the U.S. We expect our international operations to
 continue to contribute materially to our business for the foreseeable future. Our international operations are subject to varying
 degrees of risk inherent in doing business outside the U.S. including, without limitation, the following:

·

adverse
changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions, particularly in emerging markets;

·

trade
protection measures and import or export requirements;

·

trade
liberalization measures which could expose our international operations to increased competition;

·

subsidies
or increased access to capital for firms who are currently, or may emerge, as competitors in countries in which we have operations;

·

partial
or total expropriation;

·

potentially
negative consequences from changes in tax laws;

·

difficulty
in staffing and managing widespread operations;

·

differing
labor regulations;

·

differing
protection of intellectual property;

·

unexpected
changes in regulatory requirements;

·

longer
payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty in collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions; and

·

international
sentiment towards the U.S.

The
 occurrence of any of these events could materially harm our business.

Our
 growth strategy includes acquisitions. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, complete acquisitions or
 integrate acquisitions successfully.

Our
 historical growth has depended, and our future growth is likely to continue to depend, to

some

degree
 on our ability to make acquisitions and to successfully integrate acquired businesses. We intend to continue to seek additional
 acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets globally.

There
 are no assurances

, however, that we will be able to successfully identify suitable
 candidates, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms, complete proposed
 acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets. Once integrated,
 acquired operations may not achieve levels of revenues, profitability or productivity comparable with those achieved by our
 existing operations, or otherwise perform as expected.

Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in
 the integration of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management's
 attention from other business concerns. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular
 transaction,

there are no assurances

that we will
 properly ascertain all such risks. In addition, prior acquisitions have resulted, and future acquisitions could result, in the
 incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses. Future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive
 issuances of equity securities.

D

ifficulties
 encountered with acquisitions

may

have a material
 adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Product
 liability, insurance risks and increased insurance costs could harm our operating results.

Our
 business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacturing and distribution of our
 products. In addition, certain of our products are used in potentially hazardous environments. We currently have product liability
 insurance; however, we may not be able to maintain our insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us
 against potential losses. We also maintain other insurance policies, including directors and officers

’

liability insurance. Our insurance costs increased in recent periods and may continue to increase
 in the future. We believe that we have adequately accrued estimated losses, principally related to deductible amounts under our
 insurance policies, with respect to all product liability and other claims, based upon our past experience and available facts.
 However, a successful product liability or other claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect
 on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a significant increase in our insurance costs could
 have an adverse impact on our operating results.

Our
 operating results could be adversely affected by a reduction of business with our large customers.

In
 some of our businesses, w

e derive a significant amount of revenue from larger customers. The
 loss or reduction of any significant contracts with any of these customers could materially reduce our revenue and cash flows.
 Additionally, many of our customers are government entities.

In many situations, g

overnment
 entities can unilaterally terminate or modify our existing contracts without cause and without penalty to the government agency.

We
 face intense competition. If we do not compete effectively, our business may suffer.

We
 face intense competition from numerous competitors. Our products compete primarily on the basis of product quality, performance,
 innovation,

technology,

price, applications
 expertise, system and service flexibility and established customer service capabilities with existing customers. We may not be
 able to compete effectively on all of these fronts or with all of our competitors. In addition, new competitors may emerge, and
 product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines. To remain
 competitive, we must develop new products, respond to new technologies and periodically enhance our existing products in a timely
 manner. We anticipate that we may have to adjust prices of many of our products to stay competitive.

Changes
 in the supply of, or price for, parts and components used in our products could affect our business.

We
 purchase many parts and components from suppliers. The availability and prices of parts and components are subject to curtailment
 or change due to, among other things, suppliers' allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers,
 changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. Some high-performance components for digital imaging products may be in
 short supply and/or suppliers may have occasional difficulty manufacturing these components to meet our specifications. In
 addition, some of our products are provided by sole source suppliers. Any change in the supply of, or price for, these parts and
 components could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Environmental
 compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition.

Our
 operations and properties are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to environmental protection,
 including laws and regulations governing air emissions, water discharges, waste management and workplace safety. These laws and
 regulations can result in the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations and could require the installation of
 costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of
 accidental hazardous substance releases. We must conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory
 requirements in the countries in which we operate as these requirements change.

We use and generate hazardous
 substances and wastes in our operations and, as a result, could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the
 investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury. We have experienced, and expect to
 continue to experience, costs relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations. In connection with our acquisitions,
 we may assume significant environmental liabilities, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of acquisition. In addition,
 new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination
 or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased
 liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Some

of the industries in which we operate are cyclical, and, accordingly, our business is
 subject to changes in the economy.

Some

of the business areas in which we operate are subject to specific industry and general economic
 cycles. Certain businesses are subject to industry cycles, including but not limited to, the

industrial

,
 energy

and semiconductor

markets

.
 Accordingly, any downturn in these or other markets in which we participate could materially adversely affect us. If demand
 changes and we fail to respond accordingly, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected in any given quarter.
 The business cycles of our different operations may occur contemporaneously. Consequently, the effect of an economic downturn may
 have a magnified negative effect on our business.

Our
 intangible assets are valued at an amount that is high relative to our total assets, and a write-off of our intangible assets
 would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization.

Our
 total assets reflect substantial intangible assets, primarily goodwill. At December 31,


,
 goodwill totaled

$

1.71

billion compared to $

1.7


billion of stockholders' equity, which was


%
 o

f our total assets of $

3.45

billion. The goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the fair
 value of the net assets we have acquired. We assess at least annually whether there has been an impairment in the value of our
 intangible assets. If future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current
 levels, if competing or alternative technologies emerge or if business valuations become more conservative, we could incur, under
 current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating earnings for goodwill impairment. Any determination requiring
 the write-off of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and
 total capitalization,

the effect of

which could be
 material.

We
 depend on our abilities to develop new products.

The
 future success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to design and manufacture new competitive products and to
 enhance existing products so that our products can be sold with high margins. This product development may require substantial
 investment by us. There can be no assurance that unforeseen problems will not occur with respect to the development, performance
 or market acceptance of new technologies or products or that we will otherwise be able to successfully develop and market new
 products. Failure of our products to gain market acceptance or our failure to successfully develop and market new products could
 reduce our margins, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our
 technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage.

Because
 many of our products rely on proprietary technology, we believe that the development and protection of intellectual property
 rights through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions is
 important to the future success of our business. Despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or
 competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. The steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized
 use of our technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the
 U.S. Current and future actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no
 assurances that any such actions will be successful.

Any
 business disruption due to political instability, armed hostilities, incidents of terrorism or natural disasters could adversely
 impact our financial performance

.

If
 terrorist activity, armed conflict, political instability or natural disasters occur in the U.S. or other locations, such events
 may negatively impact our operations, cause general economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad to deteriorate or cause world-wide
 demand for U.S. products to decline.  A prolonged economic slowdown or recession in the U

.

S

.

or in other areas of the world could reduce the demand for our products, and therefore, negatively
 affect our future sales and profits.  Any of these events could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition or
 results of operations and may result in the volatility of the market price of our common stock.

Application
 of Critical Accounting Policies

Our
 Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States,
 or GAAP. A discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our Consolidated Financial
 Statements for the year ended December 31,


included
 elsewhere in this Annual Report.

GAAP
 offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results, such as determining
 inventory cost, depr

eciating long-lived assets
 and

recognizing

revenue

.
 We have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of
 these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of

Statement
 of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”)

No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment (“SFAS
 123R”),” which requires the Company to recognize expense for the grant date fair value of its employee stock option
 awards. The Company recognizes the expense of all share-based awards on a straight-line basis over the employee’s requisite
 service period (generally the vesting period of the award).

On
 January 1, 2007 the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 48, “Accounting for
 Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.” This Interpretation requires the Company to
 recognize in the consolidated financial statements only those tax positions determined to be “more likely than not” of
 being sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the positions.

The
 preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and
 interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the disclosure of contingent
 assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures.

The development of accounting estimates is the
 responsibility of our management.  Our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit
 committee of our

B

oard
 of

D

irectors.
 The audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the SEC. Although we believe the positions
 we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change
 over time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively.

Our
 most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility, inventory
 utilization, future warranty obligations, revenue recognition (percent of completion), income taxes and goodwill and
 indefinite-lived asset analyses. These issues, except for income taxes, which are not allocated to our business segments, affect
 each of our business segments. These issues are evaluated primarily using a combination of historical experience, current
 conditions and relatively short-term forecasting.

Accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic
 circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products, including in certain cases credits for
 returned products.  Accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms,
 whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences, what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible
 and the impact that current and near-term forecast economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with
 specific customers. The returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits.
 At December 31, 200


, our
 allowance for doubtful accounts receivable

was $

10.3

million and our allowance for

sales
 returns and sales credits was $

1.


million,

for a total of $

11.9

million,

or

3.2

%
 of total gross accounts receivable.   This percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables

,

and

the
 timing of write-offs of accounts deemed uncollectible

.

The total allowance at December 31, 200


is $

2.9

million higher than

at

December
 31, 200


and has in

creased

slightly

as

a

percent
 of sales by

.04

%.

We
 regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage, which we determine as a function of historical
 usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. When we use historical
 usage, this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical
 information as an estimate of future usage. Business trends can change rapidly and these events can affect the evaluation of
 inventory balances. At December 31, 200


,
 inventory reserves

for excess and obsolete inventory were $

28.4

million, or

14.0

%
 of gross invent

ory cost. This percentage has in

creased
 from

13.5

%

at

December 31, 200


.

The
 inventory reserve as a percent of gross inventory cost will

continue to

fluctuate
 based upon

specific identification of reserves needed based upon changes in our
 business as well as the physical disposal of our obsolete inventory.

Most
 of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items
 for a specified period after the time of sale, typically 12 months. Future warranty obligations are evaluated using, among other
 factors, historical cost experience, product evolution and customer feedback. At December 31, 200


,
 the reserve for future warranty obligations was $

8.5

million.

Our expense for warranty
 obligations was less than 1% of net sales for each of the

years

ended December 31, 200


,


, and 200


.

Revenues
 related to the use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting are dependent on a comparison of total costs incurred
 compared with total estimated costs for a project. During the

year

ended December 31, 200


,
 we recognized revenue of approximately $

135.5

million using this method, primarily for major turn-key, longer term

toll
 and traffic and

energy projects.  Approximately $

94.8

million
 and $

90.0

million of revenue
 was recognized using this method during the

years

ended December 31, 200


and

December

31,


, respectively.  At
 December 31, 200


,

approximately $

133.6

million of revenue related to unfinished percentage-of-completion contracts had yet to
 be recognized. Contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues

Income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which
 jurisdictions future earnings will occur and how and when cash is repatriated to the United States, combined with other aspects of
 an overall income tax strategy. Additionally, taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain
 items, and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward. Accounting rules require these future effects to be
 evaluated using current laws, rules and regulations, each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner. During

Roper
 accounts for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired.
 Business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being recognized.  Amortization of intangible assets, if
 applicable, occurs over their estimated useful lives.

S

FAS

No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”)

requires
 companies to cease amortizing goodwill that existed at June 30, 2001 and establishes a two-step method for testing goodwill for
 impairment on an annual basis (or an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below
 its carrying value).  Total goodwill includes 22 different business components with individual amounts ranging from zero to
approximately $451 million.  SFAS 142 also requires that an identifiable intangible asset that is determined to
have an indefinite useful economic life not be amortized, but separately tested for impairment using a one-step
fair value based approach.  Roper conducts these reviews for all of its reporting units during the fourth quarter
of the fiscal year.  No impairment resulted from the annual reviews performed in 2007.

 as compared to sales of

$

1.70

billion

for the year ended December 31,



,
 an increase of

23.6

%.  This increase was the result
 of sales from acquired companies and strong internal growth.  Our



results included a full year of sales from

our 2006
 acquisitions of

Sinmed

,

Intellitrans

,

Lumenera

,

AC Controls,

94.4

million or

17.2

% for
 the

year

ended December 31,



over the

year

ended
 December 31,



.

The
 increase was

due primarily to

high market penetration
 for our new radio-frequency integrated water meter at Neptune Technologies, accounting for 6


%
 of the year over year growth.  In addition, sales in our material

s testing businesses were
 up $19

million over the prior year due to increased unit sales

year

ended December 31,



increased by $

172.7

million or

50.3

% over
 the

year

.

Approximately
 $


million

of
 the increase was due

to

full year results from the

2006 acquisitions of AC Controls and Dynisco

, as well as
 partial year results for DJ Instruments, Roda Deaco, and

Dynamic Instruments

.
 Internal growth was ap

proximately $

45 million or 1


%,
 primarily from strength in the oil and gas related businesses

,

which have benefited from the strong global oil and gas market

,

as
 well as improved market penetration in our control valve business

Our
 Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment reported an increase in net sales of $

37.3

million or

%
 for the

year

ended December 31,



over the

year

 The increase was attributable to the

full

-year impact
 of

Sinmed and Lumenera

acquired in



,
 and partial year impact of

JLT

in 200


,

which a

ccounted for approximately $


million of the increase over prior year.

Internal

growth

was

4.2

%,
 which

was related to

increased sales in the electron
 microscopy market due to higher demand from OEM

customers, offset by weakness in our motion
 camera product line and decreased sales of handheld computers

due to supplier issues
 encountered during the year.  The supplier issues have been resolved and we do not expect an adverse impact from these supplier
 issues going into 2008.

In
 our RF Technology segment, net sales for the year ended December 31,



increased by $

96.9

million

or

20.7

%

over the year ended December 31,



.
 The

full

-year results of

Intellitrans

,
 purchased

in April, 2006,

and

four

months from the acquisition

of Black Diamond on September


,

, accounted for approximately $7 million of the increase

.

Internal growth increased

19.3

% due to strong
 performance in

our

traffic

and

business

,
 which

benefited in the current year from a large

Middle

Our Energy Systems and Controls segment gross margins

decreased to

53.6% in 2007 as compared to

29.5

%
 of net sales for the year ended December 31,



from



.8

%
 of net sales for the year ended December 31,

general and administrative expenses

.

Interest
 expense increased $

7.4

million, or

16.5

%,
 for the year ended December 31,



compared to the year ended December 31,



,

primarily
 due to higher average debt balances throughout 2007 related to the

November 30, 2006
 acquisition of

Dynisco,

and

additional borrowing

s

throughout the year for the 2007 acquisitions

offset by
 payments on these balances throughout the year.

The
 change in other income for the year ended December 31,



as compared to the year ended December 31,



was primarily due to

foreign exchange losses at our

non-U.S.
 based

companies on U.S. dollar cash, receivables and payables balances as the U.S. dollar
 weakened against

most currencies in 2007

.

During



,
 our effective income tax rate was 34.8%

versus 3

4.0

%

in 2006.  This increase was due primarily to the expiration of the extraterritorial income inclusion offset somewhat by an increased benefit from
our foreign rate differential.

At
 December 31,



,
 the functional currencies of our European

and Canadian

subsidiaries were

stronger against the U.S. dollar

compared to currency exchange rates at December 31,



.

The
 net result of these changes led to

an increase

in the
 foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $

52.3

million in the

year

period ending December 31,



.
 Approximately $

34.8

million of these adjustments
 related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows.

For
 the entire year of



,

operating

profit

increased
 by

approximately

1%

of sales

due to

fluctuations
 in

non-U.S. currencies.

Year
 Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005

Net
 sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $1.70 billion as compared to sales of $1.45 billion for the year ended December
 31, 2005, an increase of 17.0%.  This increase was the result of sales from acquired companies and strong internal growth.  Our
 2006 results included a full year of sales from Inovonics, CIVCO and MEDTEC acquired during 2005, approximately eight months of
 sales from Sinmed, seven months from Intellitrans, five months from Lumenera and AC Controls, and one month from Dynisco.  Net
 sales of these acquisitions accounted for approximately $101 million of our 2006 net sales increase over 2005 and growth of our
 other business accounted for the remaining $146 million of the increase.

Net sales for our Industrial Technology
 segment increased by $53.9 million or 10.9% for the year ended December 31, 2006 over the year ended December 31, 2005.  The
 increase was due primarily to high market penetration for our new radio-frequency integrated water meter at Neptune Technologies,
 accounting for 68% of the year over year growth.  In addition, sales in our materials testing businesses were up $11 million
 dollars over the prior year due to increased unit sales.

In our Energy Systems and Controls segment, net sales for the
 year ended December 31, 2006 increased by $32.5 million or 10.4% over the year ended December 31, 2005.  Approximately $19
 million, or 6%, of the increase was due to the 2006 acquisitions of AC Controls and Dynisco.  Internal growth was approximately
 $14 million or 4.4%, primarily from strength in the oil and gas related businesses which benefited from the strong global oil and
 gas market, offset by weak sales at Zetec in the first half of 2006.

Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment
 reported an increase in net sales of $89.0 million or 35.6% for the year ended December 31, 2006 over the year ended December 31,
 2005.  The increase was attributable to the full-year impact of CIVCO and MEDTEC acquired in 2005, and partial year impact of
 Sinmed and Lumenera in 2006, which accounted for approximately $65 million of the increase over prior year.  Internal growth was
 9.7%, approximately 50% of which was related to increased sales in the electron microscopy market due to higher demand from OEM
 customers.  Sales of new products in the digital camera businesses accounted for the remainder of the growth.

In our
 RF Technology segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased by $71.6 million or 18.0% over the year ended
 December 31, 2005.  The full-year results of Inovonics, purchased in February 2005, and eight months from the Intellitrans
 acquisition on April 26, 2006, accounted for approximately $17 million of the increase.  Internal growth increased 13.8% due to
 strong performance in the freight matching business and our traffic and tolling business.

Our overall gross profit
 percentage was 50.6% for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 50.0% for the year ended December 31, 2005.  Industrial
 Technology gross margins increased to 47.9% as compared to 47.4% in the prior year.  Our Energy Systems and Controls segment gross
 margins were unchanged at 54.2% in both 2006 and 2005, however, there was a $1.1 million purchase accounting inventory step-up
 charge incurred in 2006.  Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment gross margins were 56.8% in 2006 as compared to 55.6% in
 2005.  There were purchase accounting inventory step-up charges of $1.3 million in 2006 and $2.1 million in 2005.  Excluding these
 charges, our gross margins would have increased in 2006 due to a larger percentage of segment sales in our higher margin medical
 businesses. Our RF Technology segment gross margins were 46.8% in 2006 as compared to 46.4% in 2005.

Selling, general
 and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased to 30.8% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 from 31.8% of net
 sales for the year ended December 31, 2005.  The decrease

was

due
 to leverage from higher sales while making a conscious effort to control general and administrative expenses.

Interest
 expense increased $1.4 million, or 3.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005,
 primarily as a result of borrowings under our revolving credit facility for the Dynisco acquisition on November 30, 2006.  The
 average debt balances and associated interest expense for the remaining 2006 acquisitions were relatively unchanged from the
 average debt balances and associated interest expense related to 2005 acquisitions.

The loss on extinguishment of debt
 for the year ended December 31, 2005 created a $3.9 million non-cash charge related to the expensing of deferred financing costs
 for our senior subordinated convertible notes which were required to be classified as short-term debt, based upon the triggering
 of the conversion feature of the notes due to increases in the trading price of the Company’s stock.

The change
 in other income for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily due to the 2005
 $0.8 million gain on sale of an investment in a previously owned business and proceeds of $0.7 million from a business
 interruption insurance claim due to a fire at a supplier to one of our Imaging segment businesses that did not recur in 2006.

During
 2006, our effective income tax rate was 34.0%.  In 2005, our effective income tax rate was 30.6% which included a $6.6 million
 reduction to tax expense related to the repatriation of foreign sourced earnings under section 965 of the Internal Revenue Code at
 an effective tax rate significantly lower than previously provided on these earnings.

As
 described above,

our tax rate in 2007 increase

d

to

34.9

%
 as the Company continues to have a higher percentage of sales in the U.S. subject to additional state income

tax

.

At
 December 31, 2006, the functional currencies of our European and Canadian subsidiaries were stronger against the U.S. dollar
 compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2005.  The net result of these changes led to an increase in the foreign
 exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $23.6 million in the year period ending December 31, 2006.  Approximately $20.7
 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows.  For the
 entire year of 2006, operating profit increased by 1% of sales due to fluctuations in non-U.S. currencies.

The
 increase in sales orders

was

due to internal growth
 of 12.7% with the remainder from acquisitions.  The Industrial Technology segment net orders strengthened in most markets over the
 prior year and in particular from strong orders for Neptune water meter and RF products, which

was

also
 the primary contributor to the increased backlog in this segment as noted in the table below.  Scientific and Industrial Imaging
 net orders increased from the inclusion of orders from the partial year ownership of Sinmed and Lumenera and also from stronger
 orders in the electron microscopy market, which led to the higher backlog at 2006 in the Scientific and Industrial Imaging
 segment.  The RF Technology segment experienced strong order growth including a significant international project awarded in the
 fourth quarter of 2006 leading to the increased backlog in this segment.

Our $1.


 billion credit facility consists of a $


55 million
 term loan and a $400 million revolving loan, both with five year maturities.

In 2005, the
 Company entered into a fixed rate swap agreement ending

on

March

2008 which
 fixes the interest rate on $250 million of our term notes.  The

weighted average

interest
 rate on the variable portion of our term loan at December 31, 200

In addition, we had $

 non-U.S. businesses.

The Company had $

 thereby reducing its remaining

revolving

credit

capacity

commensurately

.
 We expect that our available borrowing capacity, combined with existing cash balances and cash flows expected to be generated from
 existing businesses, will be sufficient to fund normal operating requirements and finance additional acquisitions

Description
 of Certain Indebtedness

Senior
 Secured Credit Facility

I

n
 December 2004, we entered into a $1.055 billion senior secured credit facility

which

consist

ed

of a five-year $655 million term loan and a five-year $400 million revolving loan.

The credit agreement contained a $300 million term loan accordion which was exercised in December 2007,

thereby

increasing the

term
 loan balance to $955 million and the

credit facility to $1.355 billion.

Our
 credit facility requires us to prepay the term loan and, in certain cases, reduce the commitments under the revolving loan, upon
 the receipt of certain proceeds, including from certain asset sales, the incurrence of certain debt, and up to 75% of our excess
 cash flows unless we meet a consolidated total leverage ratio test.  We are also required to make quarterly principal payments on
 the term loans.

The
 facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur new debt,
 prepay subordinated debt, make certain investments and acquisitions, sell assets and grant liens, make restricted payments
 (including the payment of dividends on our common stock) and capital expenditures, or change our line of business. We also are
 subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated
 interest coverage ratio.

Senior
 Subordinated Convertible Notes

In
 December 2003, we issued $230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes at an original issue discount of 60.498%, resulting
 in an effective yield of 3.75% per year to maturity. Interest on the notes is payable semiannually, beginning July 15, 2004,
 until January 15, 2009. After that date, we will not pay cash interest on the notes prior to maturity unless contingent cash
 interest becomes payable. Instead, after January 15, 2009, interest will be recognized at the effective rate of 3.75% and
 will represent accrual of original issue discount, excluding any contingent cash interest that may become payable.  We will pay
 contingent cash interest to the holders of the notes during any six month period commencing after January 15, 2009 if
 the average trading price of a note for a five trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period
 equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, for such
 note. The contingent cash interest payable per note in respect of any six month period will equal the annual rate of 0.25%.

The
 notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations, rank junior to our existing and future senior secured indebtedness and rank
 equally with our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness.

As originally issued, each $1,000 principal amount of
 the notes will be convertible at the option of the holder into

12.422

shares of our common stock (

giving effect to the 2-for-1
 stock split effective August 26, 2005 and

subject to

further

adjustment),
 if (i) the sale price of our common stock reaches, or the trading price of the notes falls below, specified thresholds, (ii) if
 the notes are called for redemption or (iii) if specified corporate transactions have occurred.  Upon conversion, we

would

have the right to deliver, in lieu of common stock, cash or a combination of cash and common
 stock.  On November 19, 2004, the Company began a consent solicitation to amend the notes such that the Company would pay the same
 conversion value upon conversion of the

n

otes, but
 would change how the conversion value is paid.  In lieu of receiving exclusively shares of common stock or cash upon conversion,
 noteholders would receive cash up to the value of the accreted principal amount of the

n

otes
 converted and, at the Company’s option, any remainder of the conversion value would be paid in cash or shares of common
 stock.  The consent solicitation was successfully completed on December 6, 2004 and the amended conversion provisions were adopted.

Holders
 may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on January 15, 2009, January 15, 2014, January 15, 2019,
 January 15, 2024, and January 15, 2029, at stated prices plus accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash
 interest, if any. We may only pay the purchase price of such notes in cash and not in common stock.

We
 may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes at any time on or after January 15, 2009 at redemption prices equal to the
 sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest,
 if any, on such notes to the applicable redemption date.

As
 of September 30, 2005, the senior subordinated convertible notes were reclassified from long term to short term debt as the notes
 became convertible on October 1, 2005 based upon the Company’s common stock trading above the trigger price for at least 20
 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading-day period ending on September 30, 2005.

In
 accordance with EITF 04-8, “The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings Per Share,” the Company is
 required to include in its diluted weighted-average common share calculation an increase in shares based upon the difference
 between the Company’s average closing stock price for the period and the conversion price of $31.80.  This is calculated
 using the treasury stock method.

We
 have excluded $23 million related to the liability for uncertain tax positions under FIN 48 from the tables as the current portion
 is not material, and we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long term portion of the liability.  See Note 8 to
 the financial statements.

At
 December 31,


,

the Company had

outstanding surety bonds of $

201.6

million.

At
 December 31,


and


,
 we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as
 structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance
 sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.

We
 believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our various credit facilities will be adequate
 to finance normal operating requirements and further acquisition activities. Although we maintain an active acquisition program,
 any further acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such
 acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities, financial condition and results of operations. We may also
 explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources.

We
 anticipate that our recently acquired businesses as well as our other businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating
 activities, and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt

in
 accordance with the repayment schedule

. However, the rate at which we can reduce our debt
 during


(and reduce the associated interest
 expense) will be affected by, among other things, the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the
 financial performance of our existing companies. None of these factors can be predicted with certainty.

Recently
 Issued Accounting Standards

In
 September 2006, the

Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)

issued
 SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements," which clarifies the definition of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring
 fair value and expands the disclosures on fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
 November 15, 2007. In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP 157-2 “Partial Deferral of the Effective Date of Statement 157”
 (FSP 157-2). FSP 157-2 delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157, for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except
 those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually) to
 fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 157 on its
 consolidated financial position and results of operations.

In December 2007, the

FASB

issued
 SFAS 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations” (“SFAS 141(R)”). SFAS 141(R) establishes principles and
 requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and
 any noncontrolling interest (previously referred to as minority interest) in the acquiree. The provisions of SFAS 141(R) are
 effective for business combinations occurring on or after January 1, 2009.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS
 No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements” (SFAS No. 160). SFAS No. 160 establishes
 requirements for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the Company (sometimes called “minority
 interests”) be clearly identified, presented, and disclosed in the consolidated statement of financial position within
 equity, but separate from the parent’s equity. All changes in the parent’s ownership interests are required to be
 accounted for consistently as equity transactions and any noncontrolling equity investments in deconsolidated subsidiaries must be
 measured initially at fair value. SFAS No. 160 is effective, on a prospective basis, for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
 2008. However, presentation and disclosure requirements must be retrospectively applied to comparative financial statements. The
 Company is currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 160 on its consolidated financial position and results of operations.

Information
 About Forward Looking Statements

This
 Annual Report includes and incorporates by reference “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal
 securities laws.  In addition, we, or our executive officers on our behalf, may from time to time make forward-looking statements
 in reports and other documents we file with the SEC or in connection with oral statements made to the press, potential investors
 or others.  All statements that are not historical facts are “forward-looking statements.”  The words “estimate,”
 “project,” “intend,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” and similar expressions
 identify forward-looking statements.  These forward-looking statements include statements regarding our expected financial
 position, business, financing plans, business strategy, business prospects, revenues, working capital, liquidity, capital needs,
 interest costs and income, in each case relating to our company as a whole, as well as statements regarding acquisitions,
 potential acquisitions and the benefits of acquisitions.

Forward-looking statements are estimates and projections
 reflecting our best judgment and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially
 from those suggested by the forward-looking statements.  These statements are based on our management’s beliefs and
 assumptions, which in turn are based on currently available information.  Examples of forward looking statements in this report
 include but are not limited to our expectations regarding our ability to generate operating cash flows and reduce debt and
 associated interest expense and our expectations regarding growth through acquisitions.  Important assumptions relating to the
 forward-looking statements include, among others, assumptions regarding demand for our products, the cost, timing and success of
 product upgrades and new product introductions, raw materials costs, expected pricing levels, the timing and cost of expected
 capital expenditures, expected outcomes of pending litigation, competitive conditions, general economic conditions and expected
 synergies relating to acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances.  These assumptions could prove inaccurate.  Although we believe
 that the estimates and projections reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, our expectations may prove to be
 incorrect.  Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or projections contained in the
 forward-looking statements include:

·

difficulty making acquisitions and successfully integrating acquired businesses;

·

any unforeseen liabilities associated with future acquisitions;

·

limitations on our business imposed by our indebtedness;

·

unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates;

·

difficulties associated with exports;

·

risks and costs associated with our international sales and operations;

·

increased directors and officers liability and other insurance costs;

·

risk of rising interest rates;

·

product liability and insurance risks;

·

increased warranty exposure;

·

future competition;

·

the cyclical nature of

some of

our markets;

·

reduction  of business with large customers;

·

risks associated with government contracts;

·

changes in the supply of, or price for, parts and components;

·

environmental compliance costs and liabilities;

·

risks and costs associated with asbestos-related litigation;

·

potential write-offs of our substantial intangible assets;

·

our ability to successfully develop new products;

·

failure to protect our intellectual property;

·

economic disruptions caused by terrorist attacks, health crises or other unforeseen events; and

·

the factors discussed in Item 1A to this Annual Report under the heading “Risk Factors.”

We
 believe these forward-looking statements are reasonable.  However, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking
 statements, which are based on current expectations.  Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made,
 and we undertake no obligation to publicly

update

any
 of them in light of new information or future events.

ITEM
 7A.     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We
 are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding borrowings, and we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks on our
 transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the
 traded price of our common stock.

At December 31,



,
 we had a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings.  Our $1.


 billion senior credit facility contains $


 million

in

variable
 rate term

loans

and
 a $400 million variable rate revolver.  To reduce the financial risk of future rate increases,

in 2005

the Company entered into

a

$250
 million

fixed rate swap

agreement
 expiring

on

March
 13, 2008

.

At
 December 31, 200


,
 the

weighted average

interest

rate

was
 5.75%

on the variable portion of the term loans

and

4.54%
 on the portion of the term loans covered by the rate swap.

Our
 $230 million senior unsecured convertible notes have a fixed interest rate

of 3.75%

.
 At December 31, 200


,

the

prevailing
 market rates

were between

1.3

%
 and

2.1

%
 higher than the fixed rates on our debt instruments.

At
 December 31, 200


,
 Roper’s outstanding variable-rate borrowings

not covered
 by the interest rate swap

under the $1.


 billion credit facility were $

573.7

million.  An increase in interest rates of 1% would increase our
 annualized interest costs by $

5.7

million

.

Several

of
 our businesses

have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S.
 dollar. Most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros,

Canadian dollars,

British
 pounds, Danish krone or Japanese yen.

Sales by companies whose functional currency was not
 the U.S. dollar were



%
 of our total sales and


% of these sales were by
 companies with a European functional currency. The U.S. dollar

weakened

against

most

currencies during 200


,
 which resulted in a 2% sales increase due to foreign currency exchange. T

he difference
 between 200


operating results for these companies
 translated into U.S. dollars during 200


and these
 operating results translated into U.S. dollars during



was

approximately

1%

.
 If these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout 200


compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our expected net earnings
 would have been approximately $

6.

1 million.

The
 changes in these currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar during 200


compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 200


resulted in a

n

in

crease
 in net assets of $

52.3

million that was reported as a
 component of comprehensive earnings, $

34.8

million of
 which was attributed to goodwill. Goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported
 earnings or cash flows.

The
 trading price of Roper's common stock influences the valuation of stock

award

grants
 and the effects these grants have on

o

u

r
 results of operations

. The stock prices also influence the
 computation of

potentially dilutive common stock which
 includes both stock awards and the premium over the conversion price on senior subordinated convertible notes

to determine diluted earnings per share. The stock price also
 affects our employees' perceptions of various programs that involve our common stock. We believe the quantification of the effects
 of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable.

CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

Index

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders
of Roper Industries, Inc.:

In our opinion,
the consolidated financial statements, listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1), present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Roper Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2007 and
December 31, 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.  In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under
Item 15(a) (2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.  Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in
all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on
criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  The Company's management is responsible for these financial
statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.  Our responsibility is to express
opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal
control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects.  Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
changed the manner in which it accounts for uncertain tax positions in 2007.

As discussed in
Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for
share-based compensation in 2006.

A company’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As described in Management’s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, management has excluded JLT Mobile Computers,
Inc.; Black Diamond Advanced Technology, LLC; DJ Instruments; Dynamic Instruments, Inc.; and Roda Deaco Valve,
Ltd. from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, because they were
acquired by the Company in purchase business combinations during 2007. We have also excluded JLT Mobile
Computers, Inc.; Black Diamond Advanced Technology, LLC; DJ Instruments; Dynamic Instruments, Inc.; and Roda
Deaco Valve, Ltd. from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. JLT Mobile Computers, Inc.; Black
Diamond Advanced Technology, LLC; DJ Instruments; Dynamic Instruments, Inc.; and Roda Deaco Valve, Ltd. are
wholly-owned subsidiaries whose aggregate total assets and aggregate total revenues represent 4.1% and 1.7%,
respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31,
2007.

(1)

Summary of Accounting Policies

Basis of
Presentation

– These financial statements present consolidated information for
Roper Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries ("Roper" or the “Company”). All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Nature of
the Business

– Roper is a diversified growth company that designs, manufactures and
distributes energy systems and controls, scientific and industrial imaging products and
software, industrial technology products and radio frequency (RF) products and services.
 We market these products and services to selected segments of a broad range of markets,
including radio frequency applications, water, energy, research and medical, security and
other niche markets.

Accounts Receivable

-
Accounts receivable were stated net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and sales
allowances of $11.9 million and $9.0 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. Outstanding accounts receivable balances are reviewed periodically, and
allowances are provided at such time that management believes reasonable doubt exists
that such balances will be collected within a reasonable period of time.

Cash and
Cash Equivalents

- Roper considers highly liquid financial instruments with remaining
maturities at acquisition of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Roper had $198
million of cash equivalents at December 31, 2007 and no cash equivalents at December 31,
2006.

Earnings per
Share

– Basic earnings per share were calculated using net earnings and the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the respective year.
Diluted earnings per share were calculated using net earnings and the weighted average
number of shares of common stock and potential common stock outstanding during the
respective year. Potentially dilutive common stock consisted of stock options, restricted
stock awards and the premium over the conversion price on our senior subordinated
convertible notes based upon the trading price of the company’s common stock.  The
effects of potential common stock were determined using the treasury stock method (in
thousands).

Years ended December 31,

As of
and for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, there were 29,000, 79,000, and
8,000 outstanding stock options that were not included in the determination of diluted
earnings per share because doing so would have been antidilutive.

Estimates

– The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair Value
of Financial Instruments

- Roper's short-term debt at December 31, 2007 included $230
million of fixed-rate notes, the interest rate on which was 2.12% less than prevailing
market rates which results in a valuation of approximately $225 million.  Most of Roper's
other borrowings at December 31, 2007 were at various interest rates that adjust
relatively frequently under its $1.355 billion credit facility. The fair value for each
of these borrowings at December 31, 2007 was estimated to be the face value of these
borrowings.

Foreign Currency
Translation

- Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries whose functional currency is not
the U.S. dollar were translated at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date,
and revenues and expenses were translated at average exchange rates for the period in
which those entities were included in Roper's financial results. Translation adjustments
are reflected as a component of other comprehensive earnings.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

– The Company determines whether there has been an impairment of long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and
identifiable intangible assets that are determined to have indefinite useful economic lives, when certain
indicators of impairment are present.  In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the cost of any
long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability would be performed.  If an evaluation is
required, the estimated future gross, undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be compared to the
asset’s carrying amount to determine if a write-down to market value is required.  Future adverse changes in
market conditions or poor operating results of underlying long-lived assets could result in losses or an
inability to recover the carrying value of the long-lived assets that may not be reflected in the assets’
current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future.

Income Taxes

– Roper
is a U.S.-based multinational company and the calculation of its worldwide provision for income taxes requires
analysis of many factors, including income tax systems that vary from country to country, and the United States'
treatment of non-U.S. earnings.  The Company provides income taxes for unremitted earnings of foreign
subsidiaries that are not considered permanently reinvested overseas.  As of December 31, 2007, the approximate
amount of earnings of foreign subsidiaries that the Company considers permanently reinvested and for which
deferred taxes have not been provided was approximately $122 million.  Because of the availability of US foreign
tax credits, it is not practicable to determine the US federal income tax liability that would be payable if such
earnings were not reinvested indefinitely.

On
January 1, 2007 the Company adopted the
provisions of FASB Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an
Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.”  This Interpretation requires the Company to recognize in the consolidated financial
statements only those tax positions determined to be “more likely than not” of being sustained upon
examination based on the technical merits of the positions. As a result of the adoption of FIN 48, the Company
recorded an increase of $3.3 million in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted for as a
decrease to the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings.

Certain assets and liabilities
have different bases for financial reporting and income tax purposes. Deferred income taxes have been provided
for these differences.

Goodwill and Other Intangibles

–Roper accounts for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess of the cost over the fair
value of net assets acquired.  Business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being
recognized.  Amortization of intangible assets, if applicable, occurs over their estimated useful lives.  SFAS
No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”) requires companies to cease
amortizing goodwill that existed at June 30, 2001 and establishes a two-step method for testing goodwill for
impairment on an annual basis (or an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of a
reporting unit below its carrying value).  Total goodwill includes 22 different business components with individual amounts ranging from zero to
approximately $451 million.  SFAS 142 also requires that an identifiable intangible asset that is determined to
have an indefinite useful economic life not be amortized, but separately tested for impairment using a one-step
fair value based approach.  Roper conducts these reviews for all of its reporting units during the fourth quarter
of the fiscal year.  No impairment resulted from the annual reviews performed in 2007.

Inventories

- Inventories
are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method.  The Company
writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or excess inventory equal to the difference between the cost
of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.

Other Comprehensive Earnings

– Comprehensive earnings includes net earnings and all other non-owner sources of changes in a company's net
assets. The differences between net earnings and comprehensive earnings were currency translation adjustments and
the unrealized gain related to an interest rate swap, net of tax.

Property, Plant and Equipment
and Depreciation and Amortization

- Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are provided for using principally the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

Buildings

20-30 years

Machinery

8-12 years

Other equipment

3-5 years

Capitalized Software

–
The Company accounts for capitalized software under Statement of Position (“SOP”) 98-1, “Accounting
for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use.”  Among other provisions, SOP
98-1 requires that entities capitalize certain internal-use software costs once certain criteria are met.  Under
SOP 98-1, overhead, general and administrative and training costs are not capitalized.  Capitalized software was $11.3
million and $9.4 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Recently Released Accounting
Pronouncements

–In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements,"
which clarifies the definition of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands the
disclosures on fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
2007. In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP 157-2 “Partial Deferral of the Effective Date of Statement 157”
(FSP 157-2). FSP 157-2 delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157, for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial
liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a
recurring basis (at least annually) to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company is currently
assessing the impact of SFAS No. 157 on its consolidated financial position and results of operations.

In December 2007, the FASB issued
SFAS 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations” (“SFAS 141(R)”). SFAS 141(R) establishes
principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures the assets
acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest (previously referred to as minority interest) in
the acquiree. The provisions of SFAS 141(R) are effective for business combinations occurring on or after January 1,
2009.

In December 2007, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements” (SFAS No. 160). SFAS No.
160 establishes requirements for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the Company
(sometimes called “minority interests”) be clearly identified, presented, and disclosed in the
consolidated statement of financial position within equity, but separate from the parent’s equity. All
changes in the parent’s ownership interests are required to be accounted for consistently as equity
transactions and any noncontrolling equity investments in deconsolidated subsidiaries must be measured initially
at fair value. SFAS No. 160 is effective, on a prospective basis, for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2008. However, presentation and disclosure requirements must be retrospectively applied to comparative financial
statements. The Company is currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 160 on its consolidated financial position
and results of operations.

Research and development costs include salaries and benefits, rents, supplies, and other costs related to various
products under development. Research and development costs are expensed in the period incurred and totaled $67.9
million, $58.6 million and $53.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Revenue Recognition and
Product Warranties

– The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following criteria are met:

·

persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists

·

delivery has occurred or services have been rendered

·

the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and

·

collectibility is reasonably assured.

In addition, the Company
recognizes revenue from the sale of product when title and risk of loss pass to the customer, which is generally
when product is shipped. The Company recognizes revenue from services rendered upon customer acceptance. Revenues
under certain relatively long-term and relatively large-value construction projects are recognized under the
percentage-of-completion method using the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs as the measure of
performance. The Company recognized revenues of approximately $135.5 million, $94.8 million and $90.0 million for
the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, using this method.  Estimated losses on any
projects are recognized as soon as such losses become known.

The Company sells certain of its
products to customers with a product warranty that provides that customers can return a defective product during
a specified warranty period following the purchase in exchange for a replacement product, repair at no cost to
the customer or the issuance of a credit to the customer.  The Company accrues its estimated exposure to warranty
claims based upon current and historical product sales date, warranty costs incurred and any other related
information known to the Company.

Stock-Based
Compensation

– Effective
January 1, 2006, Roper adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment
(“SFAS 123R”),” which requires recognition of expense for the grant date fair value of its
employee stock option awards. The Company estimates the fair value of its option awards using the Black-Scholes
option valuation model and recognizes the expense of all share-based awards on a straight-line basis over the
employee’s requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the award).

Prior
to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company presented all tax benefits of deductions resulting from the
exercise of stock options as operating cash flows in the Statement of Cash Flows. Effective January 1, 2006
and in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), the Company changed its cash flow presentation so that the cash
flows resulting from the tax benefits arising from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized
for those options (excess tax benefits) are now classified as financing cash flows.

amounts incurred for direct external transaction costs associated with the acquisition.

Roper acquired Dynisco as a
strategic fit for our businesses which determine physical and elemental properties of various liquids and
materials and to gain Dynisco’s base of recurring business, technical and engineering competencies, and
market channels.  The purchase price reflected these factors and Dynisco’s historically strong margins and
operating cash flows, and its future prospects and growth potential.

The allocation of the purchase

Income Taxes

The
Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty
in Income Taxes - an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109,” on January 1, 2007. This Interpretation
requires the Company to recognize in the consolidated financial statements only those tax positions determined to
be “more likely than not” of being sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the
positions. As a result of the adoption of FIN 48, we recorded an increase of $3.3 million in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits,
which was accounted for as a decrease to the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings.

Reconciliation
between the total balance of unrecognized tax benefits at January 1, 2007 and the total
balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2007 is as follows:

The
total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate is $10.2 million. Interest
and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as a component of  income tax expense and totaled $0.4 million in 2007.  Accrued
interest and penalties were $1.7 million at January 31, 2007 and $2.1 million
at December 31, 2007.  The Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits
will significantly increase or decrease within twelve months
of the reporting date.  The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income
tax of multiple state, city and foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s federal income tax returns for 2004
through the current period remain subject to examination and the relevant state, city and foreign statutes vary.
There are no current tax examinations in progress where the Company expects the assessment of any significant
additional tax in excess of amounts reserved.

The deferred income tax balance

financial reporting and tax purposes.

Components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities at
December 31 were as follows (in thousands):

At December 31, 2007, Roper had
approximately $9.0 million of U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards, which will expire in future years,
with the majority of the carryforwards expiring in 2025.  Additionally, Roper had foreign tax credit
carryforwards and research and development credit carryforwards.  Roper has not recognized a valuation allowance
since management has determined that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will
generate sufficient taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets.

On October 22, 2004,
the American Jobs Creation Act (“AJCA”) was signed into law.  The AJCA includes a deduction of 85%
of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated, as defined in the AJCA.  During 2005, the Company
repatriated approximately $82 million of dividends, resulting in a tax benefit of approximately $6.6 million. 
Management obtained the requisite corporate officer and Board of Directors approvals of the domestic
reinvestment plan within the timeframe specified.

The Company provides income taxes for
unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are not considered permanently reinvested overseas.  As of
December 31, 2007, the approximate amount of earnings of foreign subsidiaries that the Company considers
permanently reinvested and for which deferred taxes have not been provided was approximately $122 million.
Because of the availability of U.S. foreign tax credits, it is not practicable to determine the U.S. federal income
tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely.

In December 2007, we exercised an
accordion feature under our current credit agreement.  This allowed us to increase our term loan balance by $300
million, thereby increasing the total credit facility from $1.055 billion to $1.355 billion.

Our principal $1.355 billion
credit facility and our $230 million senior subordinated convertible notes provide substantially all of our daily
external financing requirements.  The credit facility consists of a $955 million term loan and a $400 million
revolving loan, both maturing on December 13, 2009.  The interest rate on the borrowings under the $1.355 billion
credit facility is calculated based upon various recognized indices plus a margin as defined in the credit
agreement.  In 2005, the Company entered into a fixed rate swap agreement ending on March 13, 2008 which fixes
the interest rate on $250 million of our term loans.  At December 31, 2007, the weighted average interest rate on
the variable portion of the term loans was 5.75% and 4.54% on the portion of the term loans covered by the rate
swap.  Our senior subordinated convertible notes are due in 2034.  At December 31, 2007, our debt consisted of
the $230 million in senior subordinated convertible notes and a $823.7 million term loan balance.  In addition,
we had $4.8 million of other debt in the form of capital leases, several smaller facilities that allow for
borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in various foreign locations to support our non-U.S. businesses
and $56.3 million of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2007.  We expect that our available additional
borrowing capacity combined with the cash flows expected to be generated from existing business will be
sufficient to fund normal operating requirements and finance some additional acquisitions.

In December 2003, we issued
through a public offering $230 million of 3.75% subordinated convertible notes due in 2034 at an original issue
discount of 60.498% (the “Convertible Notes”).  The Convertible Notes are subordinated in right of
payment and collateral to all of our existing and future senior debt.  Interest on the notes is payable
semiannually, beginning July 15, 2004, until January 15, 2009. After that date, we will not pay cash
interest on the notes prior to maturity unless contingent cash interest becomes payable. Instead, after January 15,
2009, interest will be recognized at the effective rate of 3.75% and will represent accrual of original issue
discount, excluding any contingent cash interest that may become payable.  We will pay contingent cash interest
to the holders of the notes during any six month period commencing after January 15, 2009 if the
average trading price of a note for a five trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month
period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and accrued cash
interest, if any, for such note. The contingent cash interest payable per note in respect of any six month period
will equal the annual rate of 0.25%.  As originally issued, holders could convert their notes into 12.422 shares
of our common stock (giving effect for the 2-for-1 stock split effective August 26, 2005), subject to adjustment,
only (1) if the sale price of our common stock reaches, or the trading price of the notes falls below, specified
thresholds, (2) if the notes are called for redemption, or (3) if specified corporate transactions have
occurred.  Upon conversion, we would have had the right to deliver, in lieu of our common stock, cash or common
stock or a combination of cash and common stock.  On December 6, 2004, the Company completed a consent
solicitation to amend the notes such that the Company pays the same conversion value upon conversion of the notes,
but changes how the conversion value is paid.  In lieu of receiving exclusively shares of common stock or cash
upon conversion, noteholders would receive cash up to the value of the accreted principal amount of the notes
converted and, at the Company’s option, any remainder of the conversion value would be paid in cash or
shares of common stock.  Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on January 15, 2009
at a price of $395.02 per note, on January 15, 2014 at a price of $475.66 per note, on January 15, 2019 at a
price of $572.76 per note, on January 15, 2024 at a price of $689.68 per note, and on January 15, 2029 at a price
of $830.47 per note, in each case plus accrued cash interest, if any, and accrued contingent cash interest, if
any.  We may only pay the purchase price of such notes in cash and not in common stock.  In addition, if we
experience a change in control, each holder may require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of such holder’s
notes at a price equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount for non-tax purposes,
accrued cash interest, if any, and accrued contingent cash interest, if any, to the date of purchase.

As of September 30, 2005, our
$230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes were reclassified from long term to short term debt as the
notes became convertible on October 1, 2005 based upon the Company’s common stock trading above the trigger
price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading-day periods ending on September 30, 2005.
In addition, deferred financing costs related to the notes of approximately $3.9 million were expensed in 2005.
These expenses were previously being amortized to the first put date of the notes, which is January 15, 2009.

Our credit facility requires us
to prepay the term loan and, in certain cases, reduce the commitments under the revolving loan, upon the receipt
of certain proceeds, including from certain asset sales, the incurrence of certain debt, and up to 75% of our
excess cash flows unless we meet a consolidated total leverage ratio test.  We are also required to make
quarterly principal payments on the term loans.

The facility contains various affirmative and
negative covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur new debt, prepay subordinated debt, make
certain investments and acquisitions, sell assets and grant liens, make restricted payments (including the
payment of dividends on our common stock) and capital expenditures, or change our line of business. We also are
subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a
consolidated interest coverage ratio.  The most restrictive covenant is the consolidated total leverage ratio
which, as defined in the credit agreement, is limited to 3.75 during the year ended December 31, 2007, declining
by 0.25 each year over the remaining term of the agreement.

At December 31, 2007, and 2006, the
Company was in compliance with its restrictive covenants.

Future maturities of long-term
debt during each of the next five years ending December 31 and thereafter were as follows (in thousands):

Retirement and Other Benefit Plans

Roper
maintains four defined contribution retirement plans under the provisions of Section 401(k) of the Internal
Revenue Code covering substantially all U.S. employees not subject to collective bargaining agreements. Roper
partially matches employee contributions. Its costs related to these plans were $10.3 million, $9.9 million and $9.3
million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Roper
also maintains various defined benefit retirement plans covering employees of non-U.S. and certain U.S.
subsidiaries and a plan that supplements certain employees for the contribution ceiling applicable to the Section
401(k) plans. The costs and accumulated benefit obligations associated with each of these plans were not material

Stock-Based Compensation

The Roper Industries, Inc. 2006
Incentive Plan (“2006 Plan”) is a stock-based compensation plan used to grant incentive stock options,
nonqualified stock options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights or equivalent instruments to the Company’s
employees, officers, directors and consultants. The 2006 Plan replaced the Amended and Restated 2000 Incentive
Plan (“2000 Plan”), and no additional grants will be made from the 2000 Plan or the Non-employee
Director Plan.  The number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2006 plan is 3,000,000, plus the 17,000
remaining shares that were available to grant under the 2000 Plan at June 28, 2006, plus any shares underlying
outstanding awards under the 2000 plan that terminate or expire unexercised, or are cancelled, forfeited or lapse
for any reason subsequent to June 28, 2006. At December 31, 2007, 2,059,000 shares were available to grant.

The
Company recognized stock based compensation expense of $20.7 million and $15.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  The total tax effect recognized in net income related to stock based
compensation during 2007 and 2006 was $7.2 million and $5.4 million, respectively.  The tax benefit from option
exercises and restricted stock vesting under all plans totaled approximately $5.7 million and $11.5
million in 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Prior
to January 1, 2006, the Company accounted for its stock option plans under the recognition and measurement
provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,”
and related Interpretations (“APB 25”), as permitted by SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation.” The Company elected to adopt the modified-prospective transition method as
provided by SFAS No. 123(R). Under that transition method, share-based compensation cost recognized in 2007
and 2006 includes: (a) compensation expense for all share-based awards granted prior to, but not yet vested,
as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original
provisions of SFAS No. 123, and (b) compensation expense for all share-based awards granted subsequent
to January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
No. 123(R). Financial statement amounts for the prior periods presented have not been restated to reflect
the fair value method of expensing share based compensation. The following table illustrates the effects on net
earnings and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123
to employee stock based awards under the Company’s stock option plans during 2005:

Stock Options –

Stock
options are typically granted at prices not less than 100% of market value of the underlying stock at the date of
grant. Stock options typically vest over a period of up to three to five years from the grant date and generally
expire seven to ten years after the grant date. The Company recorded $5.1 and $3.7 million of compensation
expense relating to outstanding options during 2007 and 2006, respectively, as a component of corporate general
and administrative expenses.

The
Company estimates the fair value of its option awards using the Black-Scholes option valuation model that uses
the assumptions noted in the following table. The stock volatility for each grant is measured using the weighted
average of historical daily price changes of the Company’s common stock over the most recent period equal to
the expected life of the grant. The expected term of options granted is derived from historical data to estimate
option exercises and employee terminations, and represents the period of time that options granted are expected
to be outstanding. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S.
Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The weighted average fair value of options granted in 2007,
2006 and 2005 were calculated using the following weighted average assumptions:

At December 31, 2007, there was $9.1 million of total unrecognized compensation
expense related to nonvested shares granted to both employees and directors under the Company’s share-based
payment plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years.   The total intrinsic value of
options exercised in 2007 and 2006 was $29.8 million and $34.2 million, respectively.  Cash received from option exercises under all plans in 2007
and 2006 was approximately $15.3 million and $20.7 million, respectively.

Restricted Stock Awards –

During 2007 and 2006, the Company granted 240,000 and 314,000
shares, respectively, of restricted stock to certain employee and director participants under the 2006 Plan. Restricted
 stock awards generally vest over a period of 1 to 3 years. The weighted average fair value of the shares granted in
2007 was $52.63 per share. The Company recorded approximately $15.3 million and $11.5 million of
compensation expense related to outstanding shares of restricted stock held
by employees and directors during 2007 and 2006, respectively.  A summary of the Company’s nonvested shares activity
 for 2007 is as follows:

At December 31, 2007, there was $14.3 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested shares granted to
both employees and directors under the Company’s share-based payment plans. That cost is expected to be
recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years.  There were 231,000 and 177,000 shares that vested during 2007 and
2006, respectively. Unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested shares of restricted stock awards
is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital in shareholder’s equity at December
31, 2007.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan  –

All employees in the U.S. and Canada are eligible
to participate in Roper's stock purchase plan whereby they may designate up to 10% of eligible earnings to
purchase Roper's common stock at a 10% discount to the average closing price of its common stock at the beginning
and end of a quarterly offering period. The common stock sold to the employees may be either treasury stock,
stock purchased on the open market, or newly issued shares.  During 2007,
2006 and 2005, participants of the employee stock purchase plan purchased 33,000, 38,000 and 41,000 shares, respectively, of
Roper's common stock for total consideration of $1.7 million, $1.6 million, and $1.3 million,
respectively.  All of these shares were purchased from Roper's treasury shares. The
Company recorded $250,000, $227,000 and $0 of compensation expense relating to the stock purchase plan during
2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

(12)

Common Stock Transactions

On
July 27, 2005, the Company declared a two-for-one split of its common stock.  The split was effected in the form
of a 100% stock dividend paid on August 26, 2005 to shareholders of record at the end of business on August 12,
2005.  All historical weighted average share and per share amounts and all references to stock compensation data
and market prices of the Company’s common stock for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect this
two-for-one stock split.

At the 2006
Shareholder Meeting, shareholders approved an amendment to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, to
eliminate time phase voting and give all outstanding shares of common stock of the Company one vote on matters
properly submitted to the shareholders of the Company for their vote.  Previously, Roper's restated Certificate
of Incorporation provided that each outstanding share of Roper's common stock entitled the holder thereof to five
votes per share, except that holders of outstanding shares with respect to which there had been a change in
beneficial ownership during the four years immediately preceding the applicable record date would have been
entitled to one vote per share.

On
January 8, 2006, the Roper Shareholder Rights Plan expired.  This plan had provided that one Preferred Stock
Purchase Right (a "Right") accompanied each outstanding share of common stock. Such Rights only became
exercisable, or transferable apart from the common stock, ten business days after a person or group acquires
various specified levels of beneficial ownership.

(13)

Contingencies

Roper,
in the ordinary course of business, is the subject of, or a party to, various pending or threatened legal
actions, including those pertaining to product liability and employment practices. It is vigorously contesting
all lawsuits that, in general, are based upon claims of the kind that have been customary over the past several
years. After analyzing the Company’s contingent liabilities on a gross basis and, based upon past experience
with resolution of its product liability and employment practices claims and the limits of the primary, excess,
and umbrella liability insurance coverages that are available with respect to pending claims, management believes
that adequate provision has been made to cover any potential liability not covered by insurance, and that the
ultimate liability, if any, arising from these actions should not have a material adverse effect on the
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows of Roper.

Over
recent years there has been a significant increase in certain U.S. states in asbestos-related litigation claims
against numerous industrial companies. Roper or its subsidiaries have been named defendants in some such cases.
No significant resources have been required by Roper to respond to these cases and Roper believes it has valid
defenses to such claims and, if required, intends to defend them vigorously.  Given the state of these claims it
is not possible to determine the potential liability, if any

Roper’s rent expense was
approximately $25.4 million, $21.8 million and $17.6 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  Roper's
future minimum lease commitments totaled $100.8 million at December 31, 2007. These commitments included $23.9
million in 2008, $19.6 million in 2009, $16.0 million in 2010, $11.5 million in 2011, $7.8 million in 2012 and $22.0
million thereafter.

Segment and Geographic Area Information

In
2006, Roper consolidated the number of reporting segments from five to four, reflecting the continued
implementation of its market-focus strategy to capture value-creating opportunities around common customers,
market orientation, sales channels and common cost opportunities.  Results from 2005 have been restated to
conform to the current segment presentation.  Roper’s four segments are: Industrial Technology, Energy
Systems and Controls, Scientific and Industrial Imaging and RF Technology.  Products included within the
Industrial Technology segment are industrial pumps, flow measurement and metering equipment, and industrial
valves and controls, and equipment and consumables for materials analysis and industrial leak testing. The Energy
Systems and Controls segment's products include control systems, equipment and consumables for fluid properties
testing, machinery vibration and other non-destructive inspection and measurement products and services. Our
Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment offers high performance digital imaging products and software, patient
positioning products and software in medical applications and handheld and vehicle mounted computers and
software.  The RF Technology segment includes products and systems related to comprehensive toll and traffic
systems, security and access control, mobile asset tracking and water sub-metering and remote temperature
monitoring applications. Roper's management structure and internal reporting are also aligned consistent with
these four segments.

There
were no material transactions between Roper's business segments during 2007, 2006 and 2005. Sales between
geographic areas are primarily of finished products and are accounted for at prices intended to represent
third-party prices. Operating profit by business segment and by geographic area is defined as sales less
operating costs and expenses. These costs and expenses do not include unallocated corporate administrative
expenses. Items below income from operations on Roper's statement of earnings are not allocated to business
segments.

Identifiable
assets are those assets used primarily in the operations of each business segment or geographic area. Corporate
assets were principally comprised of cash, recoverable insurance claims, deferred compensation assets,
unamortized deferred financing costs and property and equipment.

Selected
financial information by business segment for 2007, 2006 and 2005 follows (in thousands):

Summarized data for Roper's U.S.
and foreign operations (principally in Canada, Europe and Japan) for 2007, 2006 and 2005, based upon the country
of origin of the Roper entity making the sale, were as follows:

Export
sales from the United States during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $359 million, $234
million and $232 million, respectively. In the year ended December 31, 2007, these exports were shipped primarily
to Europe (25%), Middle East (19%), Canada (13%), China (9%), Japan (7%), South America (6%), rest of Asia (14%),
and other (7%).

Sales
to customers outside the United States accounted for a significant portion of Roper's revenues. Sales are
attributed to geographic areas based upon the location where the product is ultimately shipped. Roper's net sales
for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 are shown below by region, except for Canada, which is the
only country in which we have had greater than 5% of our total sales for any of the three years presented.

(15)

Concentration of Risk

Financial instruments which
potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and trade receivables.

The
Company maintains cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions.  Cash equivalents include
investments in commercial paper of companies with high credit ratings, investments in money market securities and
securities backed by the U.S. Government.  At times such amounts may exceed the F.D.I.C. limits.  The Company
limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution and believes that no significant
concentration of credit risk exists with respect to cash investments.

Trade receivables subject the
company to the potential for credit risk with customers.  To reduce credit risk, the Company performs ongoing
evaluations of its customers’ financial condition.
