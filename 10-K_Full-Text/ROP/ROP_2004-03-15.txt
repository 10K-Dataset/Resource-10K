PART I

ITEM 1.
BUSINESS

Our Business

We are a diversified
industrial company that designs, manufactures and distributes energy systems and
controls, scientific and industrial imaging products and software, industrial
technology products and instrumentation products and services. We market these
products and services to selected segments of a broad range of markets including
water and wastewater, oil and gas, research, power generation, medical,
semiconductor, refrigeration, automotive, and general industry.

We pursue consistent and
sustainable growth in sales and earnings by emphasizing continuous improvement
in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other
carefully selected businesses that offer high value-added, engineered products
and solutions and are capable of achieving growth and maintaining high margins.
We compete in many niche markets and are the market leader or the competitive
alternative to the market leader in the majority of these markets.

In August 2003, we
changed our fiscal year-end from October 31 to December 31. However, unless
otherwise indicated, references to 2003, 2002 and 2001 in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K (“Annual Report”) refer to the twelve months ended December 31, 2003,
twelve months ended October 31, 2002, and twelve months ended October 31, 2001.

We continued our growth
in 2003 from organic growth and the full-year contributions from businesses
acquired during 2002, in particular Zetec and QImaging, offsetting declines in
our business with OAO Gazprom. Our 2003 acquisition, Neptune Technology Group
Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“NTGH”) effective on December 29, was
purchased for cash and financed through borrowings under our credit agreements
and proceeds from our December 2003 public offerings of our common stock and
convertible debentures. As the NTGH businesses were closed for the year-end holiday
period following the acquisition there are no operating results attributable to these operations in our
fiscal 2003 results. However, the assets and liabilities of the operations are
consolidated in our balance sheet as of December 31, 2003.

The company makes available
free of charge on our website (

www.roperind.com

), our annual report on
Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and
amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or
15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we
electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and
Exchange Commission.

Market Share, Market Expansion,
and Product Development

Leadership with Engineered Content for Niche
Markets.

We have developed and maintained a leading position in many of our
markets. We believe our market positions are attributable to the technical
sophistication of our products, the applications expertise used to create our
advanced products and systems and our service capabilities. Our operating units grow their businesses through new
product development and development of new applications and services for
existing products to satisfy customer needs. In addition, our operating units
continue to grow our customer base by expanding our distribution, selling other
products through our existing channels and exploring adjacent markets.

Diversified End
Markets and Geographic Reach.

Over the past decade, we have strategically
expanded the number of end markets we serve to increase revenue and business
stability and expand our opportunities for growth. During that same period, we
grew our global presence to the degree that our sales of products manufactured
and exported from the U.S. and manufactured abroad and sold to customers outside
the U.S. accounted for $378 million for 2003, up from $361 million in 2002. Our
net sales outside the U.S. were 58% and 59% of our total net sales for fiscal
2003 and 2002, respectively. The primary focus of the NTGH businesses in U.S.
markets will reduce the percentage of our net sales outside the U.S. in 2004.
Information regarding our international operations is set forth in Note 14 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”).

Research and
Development.

We conduct applied research and development to improve the
quality and performance of our products and to develop new technologies and
products to enter new markets. Our research and development spending increased
to $32.6 million in 2003, which represented 5.0% of our 2003 net sales. In the
years ended October 31, 2002 and 2001, we spent $29.6 million (4.8% of net
sales), and $26.0 million (4.6% of net sales), respectively, on research and
development activities.

The NTGH Acquisition and Related
Recapitalization Transactions

On December 29, 2003, we
acquired NTGH, comprising Neptune Technology, a leader in the water management
market, DAP Technologies, a leading fully rugged computer provider, and DB
Microware, providing various software products for utility markets. NTGH was
acquired for a cash purchase price of approximately $482 million (net of cash
acquired and outstanding debt). In connection with our acquisition of NTGH, we
also purchased the remaining one-third interest in DAP Technologies that NTGH
did not own for total consideration of approximately $9 million.

We also completed a public
offering of 4,200,000 shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of
approximately $202 million and a public offering of senior subordinated
convertible notes for gross proceeds of approximately $230 million, including
exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment for the convertible notes offering.
Concurrently with the closing of the offerings, we also entered into a new $625
million senior secured credit facility consisting of a $400 million five-year
term loan and a $225 million three-year revolving credit facility. We used the
proceeds from the common stock offering, together with borrowings under our new
senior secured credit facility, to pay for the acquisition, repay a portion of
our existing credit facility and pay related fees and expenses. We used the
proceeds from the notes offering to redeem our outstanding senior notes and to
repay the remaining portion of our existing credit facility. An underwriters’
overallotment of 630,000 shares of common stock was subsequently exercised and
closed in January 2004 for gross proceeds of approximately $30 million.

Our Business
Segments

In early 2003, we
realigned our operations into four market-focused segments to capture
value-creating opportunities around common customers, market orientation, sales
channels and common cost opportunities. The four segments are: Instrumentation,
Industrial Technology, Energy Systems and Controls, and Scientific and
Industrial Imaging. We are in the process of integrating NTGH’s businesses into our Industrial
Technology and Scientific and Industrial Imaging segments. Financial information
about our business segments is presented in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Instrumentation

Our Instrumentation
segment principally offers equipment and consumables for materials analysis,
fluid properties testing and industrial leak testing. These products and
solutions are provided through three U.S.-based and two European-based operating
units. For 2003, this segment had net sales of $181.3 million, representing
27.6% of our total net sales.

Materials Analysis
Equipment and Consumables.

We manufacture and sell equipment and supply
various types of consumables necessary to extract and shape certain materials
for production and to prepare materials samples for testing and analysis. These
products are used mostly within the academic, government research, electronics,
biological and material science end-user markets.

Fluid Properties
Testing Equipment.

We manufacture and sell automated and manual test
equipment to determine physical and elemental properties, such as sulfur and
nitrogen content, flash point, viscosity, freeze point and distillation, of
liquids and gasses for the petroleum and other industries.

Industrial Leak
Testing Equipment.

We manufacture and sell products and systems to test for
leaks and confirm the integrity of assemblies and sub-assemblies in automotive,
medical, industrial and consumer products applications.

The following table sets
forth information regarding each class of products within the Instrumentation

The following chart shows
the breakdown of the Instrumentation segment’s sales by end market for the year
ended December 31, 2003:

Backlog.

Our Instrumentation companies have lead times of up to several months on
many of their product sales, although standard products are typically shipped
within four weeks of receipt of order. One of our businesses has considerable
sales of consumables that are typically shipped overnight. Blanket purchase
orders are placed by certain end-users, with continuing requirements for
fulfillment over specified periods of time. This segment’s backlog of firm
unfilled orders, including blanket purchase orders, totaled $17.1 million at
December 31, 2003 compared to $18.9 million at December 31, 2002.

Distribution and
Sales.

Distribution and sales are achieved through a combination of
manufacturers’ representatives, agents, distributors and direct sales offices in
both the U.S. and various other countries.

Customers.

None of this segment’s customers accounted for as much as 10% of its net sales
for 2003. Each of the operating units in the Instrumentation segment sells to a
variety of customers worldwide, with certain major customers in the automotive
and medical diagnostics industries having operations globally. Some of the
operating units have sales to one or a few customers that represent a
significant portion of their respective sales, and we expect the relative
importance of such a concentrated customer base for these operating units to
continue.

Industrial
Technology

Our Industrial Technology
segment produces industrial pumps, flow measurement and metering equipment,
industrial valves and controls, and following the NTGH acquisition, water
meter and automatic meter reading (AMR) products and systems. These products and solutions are provided
through six U.S.-based and two European-based operating units. For 2003, this
segment had net sales of $170.3 million, representing 25.9% of our total net
sales. None of this segment’s 2003 net sales was attributable to Neptune Technology.

Industrial Pumps.

We manufacture and distribute a wide variety of pumps. These pumps vary
significantly in complexity and in pumping method employed, which allows for the
movement and application of a diverse range of liquids and solids including low
and high viscosity liquids, high solids content slurries and chemicals. Our
pumps are used in large and diverse sets of end markets such as oil and gas,
agricultural, water and wastewater, medical, chemical and general industrial.

Industrial Valves and
Controls.

We manufacture and distribute a variety of valves, sensors, switches and control
products used on engines, compressors, turbines and other powered equipment for
the oil and gas, pipeline, power generation, refrigeration, marine engine and
general industrial markets. Many of these products are designed for use in
hazardous environments.

Flow Measurement
Equipment.

We manufacture and distribute turbine and positive displacement flow meters,
emissions measurement equipment and flow meter calibration products for
aerospace, automotive, power generation and other industrial applications.

Water Meter and
Automatic Meter Reading (AMR) Products and Systems.

Our newest
acquisition, Neptune Technology, manufactures and distributes several lines of
water meter products serving the residential, and certain commercial and
industrial water management markets, and several lines of automatic meter
reading products and systems serving these markets. The substantial majority of
these products and services are currently for residential applications.

Backlog.

The Industrial Technology operating units’ sales also reflect a combination
of standard products and specifically engineered, application-specific products.
Standard products are typically shipped within two weeks of receipt of order,
with certain valve and pump products shipped on an immediate basis.
Application-specific products typically ship within 6 to 12 weeks following
receipt of order. However, larger project orders and blanket purchase orders for
certain original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, may extend shipment for
longer periods. This segment’s backlog of firm unfilled orders, including
blanket purchase orders, totaled $58.0 million at December 31, 2003, as compared
to $25.6 million at December 31, 2002. Within this increase $33.9 million was
attributable to Neptune Technology.

Distribution and
Sales.

Distribution and sales occur through direct sales personnel,
manufacturers’ representatives and distributors. Neptune Technology sells to a
variety of customers through multiple sales and distribution channels. Its water
meter and AMR products are sold to the water utility market via direct sales and
independent distributors in North America.

Customers.

No customer was responsible for as much as 10% of this segment’s net sales
for 2003 and none of Neptune Technology’s customers accounted for more than 10%
of its net sales for 2003.

Energy Systems
and Controls

Our Energy Systems and
Controls segment principally produces control systems, machinery vibration and
other non-destructive inspection and measurement products and solutions, which
are provided through three U.S.-based operating units. For 2003, this segment
had net sales of $139.0 million, representing 21.1% of our total net sales.

Control Systems.

We manufacture control systems and panels and provide related engineering
and commissioning services for turbomachinery applications, predominately in
energy markets.

Non-destructive
Inspection and Measurement Instrumentation.

We manufacture non-destructive
inspection and measurement solutions including measurement probes, robotics, and
machinery vibration sensors, switches and transmitters. These solutions are
applied principally in energy markets but also in aerospace and broader
industrial markets. Many of these products are designed for use in hazardous
environments.

The following chart shows
the breakdown of sales by end market for the Energy Systems and Controls segment
during the year ended December 31, 2003:

Backlog.

The majority of this segment’s business consists of larger engineered projects
with lead times of three to nine months. As such, backlog typically fluctuates
significantly depending upon the timing of large project awards. Standard
products generally ship within two weeks of receipt of order. This segment’s
backlog of firm unfilled orders totaled $31.0 million at December 31, 2003
compared to $25.9 million at December 31, 2002.

Distribution and
Sales.

Distribution and sales occur through direct sales offices,
manufacturers’ representatives and distributors.

Customers.

Each of the Energy Systems and Controls segment’s business units sell to a
variety of customers worldwide. OAO Gazprom, a Russian enterprise that is the
world’s largest gas provider, continued to be the largest single customer in
this segment for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2003, accounting for
approximately 16.4% of its sales, compared to 40.7% for the twelve month period
ended December 31, 2002. The continuation of this business with Gazprom is
subject to numerous risks, many of which are beyond our control, including, but
not limited to, increased competition, availability of acceptable financing and
customer delays in commissioning and start-up of installations. No other
customer accounts for as much as 10% of this segment’s net sales for 2003.

Scientific and Industrial
Imaging

Our Scientific and
Industrial Imaging segment principally offers high performance digital imaging
products and software, and following the NTGH acquisition, handheld computers
and software. These products and solutions are provided through five U.S-based
and two Canadian-based operating units. These include the DAP Technologies
handheld computer business based in Quebec, Canada, and the DB Microware
software unit based in Dallas, Texas, both of which were included in the NTGH
acquisition. For 2003, this segment had net sales of $166.7 million,
representing 25.4% of our total net sales, none of which were contributed by DAP
Technologies or DB Microware.

Digital Imaging
Products and Software.

We manufacture and sell extremely sensitive,
high-performance charge-coupled device cameras, detectors and related software
for a variety of scientific and industrial uses, which require high resolution
and/or high speed digital video, including transmission electron microscopy and
spectroscopy applications. We principally sell these products for use within
academic, government research, semiconductor, automotive, and other end-user
markets such as ballistic, biological and material science. They are frequently
incorporated into products by OEMs.

Handheld Computers and
Software.

We manufacture and sell fully rugged handheld computers for
utility, principally water management, and non utility markets and we develop
and sell software to assist in utility meter reading and service order
management.

The following table sets
forth information regarding each class of products within the Scientific and
Industrial Imaging segment that accounted for at least 10% of our total net
sales in any of the periods presented (in thousands):

The following chart shows
the breakdown of the Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment’s sales by end
market for the year ended December 31, 2003:

Backlog.

Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment companies typically have lead
times of up to several months on many of their product sales, although standard
products are often shipped within two weeks of receipt of order. Blanket
purchase orders are placed by certain OEMs and end-users, with continuing
requirements for fulfillment over specified periods of time. The segment’s
backlog of firm unfilled orders, including blanket purchase orders, totaled
$42.5 million at December 31, 2003, as compared to $47.0 million at December 31,
2002. Within the December 2003 backlog, $5.5 million is attributable to handheld
computer and software backlog associated with the NTGH acquisition.

Distribution and
Sales.

Distribution and sales occur through direct sales personnel,
manufacturers’ representatives, value added resellers, or VARs, OEMs and
distributors.

Customers.

No customer was responsible for as much as 10% of this segment’s net sales for
2003. One of the Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment’s operating units has
sales to a few customers that represent a significant portion of that operating
unit’s sales and the relative importance of such a concentrated customer base
for this operating unit is expected to continue.

Materials and
Suppliers

We believe that most
materials and supplies used by us are readily available from numerous sources
and suppliers throughout the world. However, some of our components and
sub-assemblies are currently available from a limited number of suppliers. Some
high-performance components for digital imaging products can be in short supply
and/or suppliers have occasional difficulty manufacturing such components to our
specifications. We regularly investigate and identify alternative sources where
possible, and we believe that these conditions equally affect our competitors.
Thus far, supply shortages have not had a significant adverse effect on Roper’s
sales although delays in shipments have occurred following such supply
interruptions. In the past, DAP Technologies has incurred lost orders or
shipment delays due to the inability of its VARs to design and install
application-specific software on a timely basis.

Environmental
Matters and Other Governmental Regulation

Our operations and
properties and those recently acquired from NTGH are subject to laws and
regulations relating to environmental protection, including laws and regulations
governing air emissions, water discharges, waste management and workplace
safety. We use, generate and dispose of hazardous substances and waste in our
operations and, as a result, could be subject to potentially material
liabilities relating to the investigation and clean-up of contaminated
properties and to claims alleging personal injury. We are required continually
to conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory
requirements in all countries as these requirements change. We have experienced,
and expect to continue to experience, modest costs relating to our compliance
with environmental laws and regulations. In connection with our acquisitions, we
may assume significant environmental liabilities, some of which we may not be
aware of, or may not be quantifiable, at the time of acquisition. In addition,
new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations,
the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new
clean-up requirements could increase our environmental compliance costs or
subject us to new or increased liabilities.

Competition

Generally, our products
and solutions face significant competition, usually from a limited number of
competitors. Although we believe that we are a leader in most of our markets, no
single company competes with us over a significant number of product lines.
Competitors might be large or small in size, often depending on the life cycle
and maturity of the technology employed. We compete primarily on product
quality, performance, innovation, price, applications expertise, distribution
channel access and customer service capabilities.

Patents and
Trademarks

In addition to trade
secrets, unpatented know-how, and other intellectual property rights, we own the
rights under a number of patents, trademarks and copyrights relating to certain
of our products and businesses. We also employ various methods, including
confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with employees, to protect our
trade secrets and know-how. While we believe that none of our operating units is
substantially dependent on any single patent, trademark, copyright, or other
item of intellectual property or group of patents, trademarks or copyrights, the
product development and market activities of Compressor Controls, Gatan, Neptune
Technology and Roper Scientific, in particular, have been planned and conducted
in conjunction with continuing patent strategies. While we have not
significantly licensed patents, trademarks, trade secrets and similar
proprietary rights to and from third parties in the past, we may do so in the
future.

Employees

As of December 31, 2003,
we had approximately 3,700 total employees, of whom approximately 2,440 were
located in the United States. Fewer than 80 of our employees are subject to
collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any work stoppages and
consider our relations with employees to be good.

ITEM 2.
PROPERTIES

In early January 2003, we
relocated our corporate office from Bogart, Georgia where we leased
approximately 10,000 square feet of office space to the Atlanta area where we
lease approximately 13,800 square feet of office space. We have established
sales and service locations around the world to support our operations. The

ITEM 3. LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS

We are defendants in
various lawsuits involving product liability, employment practices and other
matters, none of which we believe will have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated financial position or results of operations. The majority of such
claims are subject to insurance coverage.

We and/or one of our
subsidiaries are named as defendants, along with many other companies, in
asbestos-related personal injury or wrongful death actions. The allegations in
these actions are vague, general and speculative, and the actions are in their
early stages. Given the state of these claims, it is not possible to determine
the potential liability, if any.

Dividends.

Roper has declared a cash
dividend in each fiscal quarter since our February 1992 initial public offering
and we have also annually increased our dividend rate since our initial public
offering. In November 2003, our board of directors increased the quarterly
dividend to be paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 to $0.09625 per share,
an increase of 10% from the prior rate. However, the timing, declaration and
payment of future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our board of
directors and will depend upon our profitability, financial condition, capital
needs, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by our board of
directors. Therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount, if any, of
cash dividends that will be declared in the future.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

You should read the
following discussion in conjunction with “Selected Financial Data” and our
Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this
Annual Report. In August 2003, we changed our fiscal year-end from October 31 to
December 31 effective as of January 1, 2003, with the two months ended December
31, 2002 being the Transition Period.

We filed an amendment to
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2002 on
November 3, 2003 to restate our Consolidated Financial Statements as of October
31, 2001 and 2002 and for the three years ended October 31, 2002 to reflect the
discontinued operations of our Petrotech operation and the realignment of our
operations into four new segments.

Overview

We are a diversified
industrial company that designs, manufactures and distributes energy systems and
controls, scientific and industrial imaging products and software, industrial
technology products and instrumentation products and services. We market these
products and services to selected segments of a broad range of markets including
water and wastewater, oil and gas, research, power generation, medical,
semiconductor, refrigeration, automotive, and general industry.

We pursue consistent and
sustainable growth in earnings by emphasizing continuous improvement in the
operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other
carefully selected businesses. Our acquisitions have represented both financial
bolt-ons and new strategic platforms. We strive for high cash and earnings
returns from our acquisition investments. On December 29, 2003, we acquired
NTGH, comprising Neptune Technology, a leader in the meter management market,
DAP Technologies, a leading fully rugged computer provider, and DB Microware,
providing various software products for utility markets. As these businesses
were closed for the year-end holiday period following the acquisition there are no operating results attributable to
these operations in our fiscal 2003 results. However, the assets and liabilities
of the operations are consolidated in our balance sheet as of December 31, 2003.
In connection with this acquisition we retired our existing debt, completed a
public offering of 4,200,000 shares of our common stock, entered into a new $625
million credit agreement, and issued $230 million of senior subordinated
convertible notes. An underwriters’ overallotment of 630,000 shares of our
common stock was subsequently exercised and closed in January 2004.

During the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2003, our results of operations benefited from five
acquisitions made during the last six months of the fiscal year 2002:

1. Zetec, reported in our Energy Systems and Controls segment

2. AI Qualitek, reported in our Instrumentation segment

3. QImaging, reported in our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment

4. Duncan Technologies, reported in our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment

5. Definitive Imaging, reported in our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment

Our largest customer is OAO Gazprom.
Gazprom has been a customer over the past eleven years through a number of its
procurement affiliates. In late 2002, Gazprom assigned a new procurement
affiliate to negotiate with us, and during the second calendar quarter of 2003
we secured a new supply agreement. Orders received under this agreement have
been received on a delayed basis and at lower levels than initially indicated by
the procurement affiliate and consequently have resulted in lower activity
levels than in comparative prior year periods. New orders received under this
agreement during the year ended December 31, 2003 totaled $25.2 million or 3.9%
of total new orders. Net sales to Gazprom were $22.8 million during the year
ended December 31, 2003 as compared to $56.5 million during the year ended
October 31, 2002.

During the Transition
Period ended December 31, 2002, we began reporting our operations under a new
segment structure. This structure has realigned our operations into four
market-focused groups to capture value-creating opportunities around common
customers, market orientation, sales channels and common cost opportunities.
Having recruited and reassigned new managers to lead these realigned groups in
the first quarter, we commenced cascading leadership through these segments with
the hiring of several key managers from established growth companies to provide
enhanced functional and business expertise.

Following the segment
realignment, we started a number of restructuring activities. We have completed
the integration of our Acton Research and Integrated Design business units, the
integration of AI Qualitek into the Uson business unit and the integration of
production operations of our Redlake business unit into other Imaging segment
facilities. In addition, we have opened a new production facility in Mexico as a
result of which we closed the U.S. production operations of the Dynamco business
unit and commenced the movement of manufacturing of certain other Industrial
Technology product lines into this facility. We opened a new production facility
in China to better serve customers in that growing market. During the third
quarter, we completed our relocation of Struers manufacturing, engineering and
administrative support activities into a new facility. Final actions to be
completed in the first half of 2004 include the move of the U.S. production
operations of the Amot Controls business unit to other facilities and a
restructuring of the Compressor Controls business unit to adjust to lower levels
of Gazprom business. All of these actions are planned to lower costs and enhance
margins.

In February 2003, we
launched a new motion imaging product line in our Scientific and Industrial
Imaging segment. Extensive development of this product line commenced during the
second quarter of fiscal 2002 and was completed during February 2003. During the
development period our customers deferred ordering our existing products in
anticipation of significant benefits from our new technology cameras and
systems.

The weakening of the U.S.
dollar during fiscal 2003, particularly against the euro, the Danish krone and
the British pound, had a mixed impact on our reported results. Without the
currency changes, reported net sales and net orders would have been reduced by
$26.2 million and $25.6 million respectively as compared to the prior calendar
year. However, the potentially favorable effects on profits from these currency
translation efforts were substantially offset by the impact of selling products
in the U.S. that we produced in countries with now increased euro-denominated
costs.

Application of
Critical Accounting Policies

Our Consolidated Financial
Statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States, or GAAP. A discussion of our significant
accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our Consolidated Financial
Statements for the year ended December 31, 2003 included elsewhere in this
Annual Report.

GAAP offers acceptable
alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial
results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long-lived assets,
recognizing revenues and issuing stock options to employees. We have not changed
the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates
affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a
manner that had a material effect on our financial statements, except for the
adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” as discussed below.

The preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates,
assumptions, judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures.

The development of
accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. Our management
discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit
committee of our board of directors. The audit committee has reviewed all
financial disclosures in our annual filings with the SEC. Although we believe
the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others
might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more
information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects
are accounted for prospectively.

Our most significant
accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable
collectibility, inventory utilization, future warranty obligations, revenue
recognition (percent of completion), income taxes and goodwill analysis. These
issues, except for income taxes, which are not allocated to our business
segments, affect each of our business segments. These issues are evaluated
primarily using a combination of historical experience, current conditions and
relatively short-term forecasting.

Accounts receivable
collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits
given to customers after shipment of products, including in certain cases,
credits for returned products. Accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to
determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms, whether these
amounts are consistent with past experiences, what historical experience has
been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that current and near-term
forecast economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and
with specific customers. The returns and other sales credits histories are
analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits. At December 31,
2003, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, sales returns and sales
credits was $4.5 million, or 3% of total gross accounts receivable. This
percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables and
has remained constant as a percent of sales as compared to the October 31, 2002
levels and the Transition Period ended December 31, 2002.

We regularly compare
inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage, which we
determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific
items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. When we use
historical usage, this information is also qualitatively compared to business
trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an
estimate of future usage. Business trends can change rapidly and these events
can affect the evaluation of inventory balances. At December 31, 2003, inventory
reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were $23.6 million, or 18% of gross
first-in, first-out inventory cost. This percentage has remained constant with
both the fiscal year ended October 31, 2002 and the Transition Period ended
December 31, 2002.

Most of our sales are
covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or
replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time
of sale, typically 12 months. Future warranty obligations are evaluated using,
among other factors, historical cost experience, product evolution and customer
feedback. At December 31, 2003, the accrual for future warranty obligations was
$5.0 million or 0.6% of annualized fourth quarter fiscal 2003 sales. This
calculation is based upon both Roper’s and NTGH’s annualized fourth quarter 2003
sales. The warranty reserve for the NTGH entities is at a similar level to the
existing Roper entities. Our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1%
of net sales for each of the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2003,
October 31, 2002 and October 31, 2001.

Revenues related to the use
of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting are dependent on a
comparison of total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a
project. During the twelve month period ended December 31, 2003, we recognized
revenue of approximately $31.4 million using this method due primarily to two of
our businesses carrying out major energy and water/wastewater projects of a
turn-key, longer term nature. No material amount of revenue was recognized using
this method during the two month period ended December 31, 2002. Approximately
$2.4 million and $2.3 million of revenue was recognized using this method during
the twelve months ended October 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. At December 31,
2003 approximately $12.6 million of revenue related to unfinished
percentage-of-completion contracts had yet to be recognized. Contracts accounted
for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability
from revenues accounted for under other methods.

Income taxes can be
affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings
will occur and how and when cash is repatriated to the United States, combined
with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy. Additionally, taxing
jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain
items, and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward.
Accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current
laws, rules and regulations, each of which can change at any time and in an
unpredictable manner. During fiscal 2003, our effective income tax rate was
reduced to 27.5% as compared to 30% for the two month period ended December 31,
2002 and 31% for the twelve month period ended October 31, 2002. The primary
reasons for the decline for the current fiscal year are the marginal rate impact
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 of certain expenses related to the NTGH
acquisition and related financing and the demonstrated ability to avoid
repatriation of certain foreign sourced earnings. We are not expecting
to incur in 2004 the one-time costs that created this abnormally low tax rate.

We adopted SFAS No. 142
effective November 1, 2001 - the beginning of our fiscal year ended October 31,
2002. The evaluation of goodwill under SFAS 142 requires valuations of each
applicable underlying business. These valuations can be significantly affected
by estimates of future performance and discount rates over a relatively long
period of time, market price valuation multiples and marketplace transactions in
related markets. These estimates will likely change over time. Some of our
businesses operate in cyclical industries and the valuation of these businesses
can be expected to fluctuate as a result of this cyclicality. The transitional
business valuation reviews required by SFAS 142 indicated a reduction of the
carrying value of goodwill for three business units (Redlake, Petrotech and
Dynamco). This goodwill reduction was reported as a change in accounting
principle retroactive to the beginning of our fiscal year ended October 31, 2002
and resulted in a transitional charge to earnings of approximately $26 million.
SFAS 142 requires goodwill to be evaluated annually. If this annual review
indicates further impairment of goodwill balances, that entire impairment will
be recorded immediately and reported as a component of current operations. Our
annual reviews undertaken during fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 did not indicate
that any further impairment to the goodwill balances was necessary. Our
acquisitions have generally included a large goodwill component and we expect
this to continue with future acquisitions.

Prior to adopting SFAS 142,
goodwill was amortized over periods not exceeding 40 years. With the adoption of
this standard, goodwill is not amortized. It is periodically reviewed for
impairment as discussed above. SFAS 142 does not permit retroactive application
to years prior to adoption. Therefore, earnings beginning in fiscal 2002 tend to
be higher than earlier periods as a result of this accounting change, except for
the effects of any impairment provision on current results. Note 5 to our
Consolidated Financial Statements includes a reconciliation comparing earnings
of pre-adoption periods to earnings of current periods for those periods
presented. Goodwill amortization prior to the adoption of SFAS 142 was largest
in the Instrumentation segment. We are unable to conclude whether the likelihood
of any impairment charge resulting from subsequent annual reviews is more likely
in any business segment compared to another segment.

At December 31, 2003,
Roper’s total assets included $711.2 million of goodwill. Goodwill was allocated
$224.0 million to our Instrumentation segment, $282.8 million to our Industrial
Technology segment, $81.5 million to our Energy Systems and Controls segment and
$122.9 million to our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment. Total goodwill
was allocated to 25 different business units with individual amounts ranging
from less than $1 million to approximately $202 million.

Year Ended
December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended October 31, 2002

Net sales for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2003 were $657.4 million as compared to sales of
$617.5 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2002, an increase of
6.5%. A significant part of the increase was the full year impact of our fiscal
2002 acquisitions, Zetec, AI Qualitek and QImaging. We had a significant
decrease in sales to Gazprom ($33.7 million or 59.7% decline from the prior
period) as a result of the change in their procurement processes noted
previously. This significant decline was offset by sales increases in materials
analysis equipment and consumables, imaging sales into electron microscopy
markets, water/wastewater projects and other oil and gas sector sales.

In our Instrumentation
segment, net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 increased by $5.8
million or 3.3% over the twelve months ended October 31, 2002. The increase was
attributable to the full-year impact of AI Qualitek (acquired in fiscal 2002)
and strong results from our European-based Struers operation which was partially
offset by continued depressed business conditions in telecommunications markets.

Net sales for our
Industrial Technology segment increased by $6.2 million or 3.8% for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2003 over the twelve months ended October 31, 2002.
The increase was the result of strength in our industrial pumps companies which
experienced increased sales in the larger municipal water/wastewater projects.

In our Energy Systems and
Controls segment, net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 increased
by $12.3 million or 9.7% over the twelve months ended October 31, 2002. The
increase was due to the full-year impact of Zetec acquired in fiscal 2002,
offset by the expected lower sales levels to Gazprom. We also had improved sales
of our machinery vibration sensor equipment in the current twelve month period.

Our Scientific and
Industrial Imaging segment reported an increase in net sales of $15.6 million or
10.3% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 over the twelve months ended
October 31, 2002. The increase was attributable to both the full-year impact of
QImaging acquired in fiscal 2002 and the increased sales for electron microscopy
products.

Our overall gross profit
percentage was 52.7% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 as compared
to 54.1% for the twelve months ended October 31, 2002. Instrumentation segment
gross margins were roughly flat period over period at 58.3% as compared to
58.6%. Industrial Technology gross margins decreased to 45.6% due to an erosion
in part of our industrial valves and controls business that is being addressed
by moving production to lower cost environments. Our Energy Systems and Controls
segment reported margins of 52.8% in fiscal 2003 as compared to 59.8% in fiscal
2002. A decrease was expected this year from the full year inclusion of Zetec
whose gross margins are lower than the segment average. Additionally there were
lower margins from the significantly lower levels of Gazprom sales in this
segment in the current period. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment
gross margins were 53.6% in fiscal 2003 as compared to 52.3% in fiscal 2002 as
we experienced a rebound in motion imaging equipment sales and a higher
percentage of the segment sales in higher margin product.

Selling, general and
administrative (SG&A) expenses increased to 36.2% of net sales for the
twelve months ended December 31, 2003 from 35.2% of net sales for the twelve
months ended October 31, 2002, primarily from $5.9 million of restructuring
expenses (0.9% of net sales) incurred in the current fiscal year to reduce excess manufacturing
capacity, move certain operations to lower-cost locations and reduce fixed
costs.

Interest expense decreased
$2.1 million, or 11.5%, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 compared
to the twelve months ended October 31, 2002, as a result of lower debt levels in
the current period. The company used its cash flows generated from operating
activities to reduce debt levels prior to the NTGH transaction.

Income taxes were 27.5% of
pretax earnings in fiscal 2003 compared to 31% in fiscal 2002. The primary
factors for the decrease were the marginal rate impact in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2003 of certain expenses related to the NTGH acquisition and related
financing transactions and the demonstrated ability to avoid repatriation of
certain foreign sourced earnings.

At December 31, 2003, the
functional currencies of our European subsidiaries were stronger against the
U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at both October 31, 2002 and
December 31, 2002. This strengthening resulted in an increase in the foreign
exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $6.8 million in the two month
period ending December 31, 2002 and of $36.3 million in the twelve month period
ending December 31, 2003. Approximately $33.6 million of these adjustments
related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future
cash flows. Fiscal 2003 operating results also benefited from the stronger
non-U.S. currencies. The net benefits were approximately 2% of operating
earnings. Foreign exchange differences related to our other non-U.S.
subsidiaries were immaterial to fiscal 2003 financial performance.

Instrumentation segment net
orders improved due to the full year bookings of AI Qualitek, continued strength
for oil and gas desulfurization applications and higher orders for our materials
analysis equipment. Industrial Technology segment net orders strengthened over
most markets after a soft fiscal 2002. Energy Systems and Controls net orders
rose on the strength of a full year of Zetec orders and strength in non-Gazprom
oil and gas sectors, offset by significantly lower Gazprom orders. Scientific
and Industrial Imaging net orders benefited from the full year of QImaging
orders offset by the timing of orders for electron microscopy products (sales
increased in the period) and weaker research market demand for high-end digital
cameras.

The increase in backlog was
primarily due to the inclusion of the NTGH entities at December 31, 2003. The
decline in the Instrumentation segment backlog is the result of continued softness in
our telecommunications business.

Two Months
Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to Two Months Ended December 31, 2001

Net sales for the two month
period ended December 31, 2002 were $83.9 million as compared to $86.9 million
in the two month period ended December 31, 2001. This decrease was primarily
attributable to lower sales to Gazprom and the absence of motion imaging sales
in the Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment, partially offset by the
contributions from our fiscal 2002 acquisitions.

In our Instrumentation
segment, net sales decreased by 7.2% as compared to the prior-year period
primarily as a result of surplus used equipment flooding the weak
telecommunications capital equipment markets for our Logitech unit and lower
capital spending in the semi-conductor market. Elsewhere softness in oil &
gas refinery capital spending offset the benefits of the AI Qualitek
acquisition. Gross margins moved from 61.7% in the prior year period to 57.7% in
the current period largely from the adverse leverage at our Logitech unit and
semi-conductor businesses. SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales were 2.4%
higher at 41.8% due to lower sales volume explained above and higher medical
insurance expenditures. Overall the segment reported operating profit margins of
15.9% as compared to 22.3% in the prior-year period.

In our Industrial
Technology segment, net sales were comparable to the same period in 2001. Gross
margins decreased to 43.9% in the period from 45.0% in the prior-year; however,
SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales were 1.1% lower at 29.5% offsetting
the reduction in gross margin allowing the operating profit margin to remain
constant at 14.4%. The lower SG&A expense level is primarily the result of
headcount reductions.

Net sales in our Energy
Systems & Controls segment increased by 19.5% during the two months ended
December 31, 2002 as sales contributed by Zetec and higher control systems sales
to oil and gas customers more than offset the lower sales to Gazprom. Gross
margins decreased from 40.7% to 38.7% as a result of the adverse sales leverage
from the deferred Gazprom sales and the seasonal low sales at Zetec with reduced
power generation inspection activity during the peak heating season. This
adverse leverage also resulted in an increase in SG&A expenses as a
percentage of sales from 48.0% in the prior-year period to 59.9% in the current
year period. As a result, operating losses increased from 7.3% in the prior-year
period to 21.2%. Management does not anticipate that the confluence of these
events giving rise to such operating margins will recur in the future.

Our Scientific &
Industrial Imaging segment net sales decreased by 12.0% due primarily to the
absence of motion imaging product sales which was partially offset by net sales
contributed by the contributions from the QImaging and Definitive Imaging
acquisitions. Gross margins decreased from 51.3% in 2002 to 50.6% due to the
increased manufacturing costs in the period for TEM imaging equipment. SG&A
expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 45.0% in the period from 35.6% in
the prior-year period as a result of additional costs associated with the
development of the new motion imaging products and additional costs associated
with foreign sales subsidiaries. Overall, the segment reported operating profits
margins of 5.6% as compared to 15.7% with the bulk of the decline attributable
to the repositioning of our motion imaging business.

Corporate expenses
decreased by $1.0 million and reduced as a percentage of sales from 2.9% to 1.9%
due primarily to reduced variable compensation costs.

Interest expense held
constant at $2.9 million for the two month period ended December 31, 2002
compared to the two month period ended December 31, 2001, as lower effective
interest rates offset increased borrowing levels.

Other income was $0.2
million in the two month period ended December 31, 2002 as compared to $0.7
million in the equivalent prior-year period from reduced realized foreign
exchange gains.

Income taxes were 30.0% of
pretax earnings in the current year period as compared to 35.0% in the
equivalent prior-year period principally driven by improved expectations for our
utilization of all available foreign income tax credits.

At December 31, 2002, the
functional currencies of our European subsidiaries were stronger against the
U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at October 31, 2002 and December
31, 2001. This strengthening resulted in a gain of $6.8 million in the foreign
exchange component of comprehensive earnings for the two month period ended
December 31, 2002. Approximately $5.4 million of the total adjustment related to
goodwill and is not expected to directly affect our expected future cash flows.
Operating results in the two month period also benefited from the weakening of
the US dollar, primarily against the euro. The difference between the operating
results for these companies for the two month period ending December 31, 2002,
translated into U.S. dollars at average currency exchange rates experienced
during the two month period and these operating results translated into U.S.
dollars at average currency exchange rates experienced during the comparable two
month period in 2001 was not material. If the impact of selling European sourced
product in the U.S. is also considered, the impact of currency movements was
negligible.

Net orders, booked for
continuing operations, were $95.3 million for the period, 8% higher than the
same period of 2001 net order intake of $88.0 million. This increase was due to
the additional net orders booked of $10.6 million from our fiscal 2002
acquisitions, which was somewhat offset by delays in blanket order releases and
other industrial market softness for our Industrial Technology segment. Overall,
our order backlog at December 31, 2002 increased by $6.6 million as compared to
December 31, 2001. This increase was due to new acquisitions having $6.9 million
in backlog at December 31, 2002, partially offset by softness in the Industrial
Technology segment.

Year Ended
October 31, 2002 Compared to Year Ended October 31, 2001

Net sales for fiscal 2002
were $617.5 million as compared to sales of $563.0 million in fiscal 2001, an
increase of 9.7%. $87.8 million of the sales increase was attributable to
acquisitions during fiscal 2002 (Zetec, QImaging, Duncan Technologies,
Definitive Imaging and AI Qualitek) and the full-year impact of acquisitions
made during fiscal 2001 (Struers, Logitech, Media Cybernetics and Dynamco).
Excluding this impact net sales declined by 2.7%, to $529.7 million primarily
attributable to declines in the semiconductor market and the downturn in oil and
gas exploration and certain industrial markets. The impact of these difficult
market conditions was somewhat mitigated by a 15% increase in sales to Gazprom
and an 8% increase in sales in our fluid properties testing businesses as their
products help customers respond to stricter environmental controls regarding
sulfur content in petroleum products.

In our Instrumentation
segment, fiscal 2002 net sales increased by $50.1 million or 40% over fiscal
2001. The increase was primarily attributable to a year-on-year sales increase
of $64.6 million from acquisitions (AI Qualitek acquired in fiscal 2002 and the
full-year impact of our fiscal 2001 acquisitions Struers and Logitech).
Excluding this impact of acquisitions, net sales declined 0.6% (to $110.9
million) as a result of severely depressed business conditions in semiconductor
markets.

Net sales for our
Industrial Technology segment declined by $6.7 million or 3.9% from fiscal 2001
to fiscal 2002, primarily from weakness in industrial pump and oil & gas
exploration markets. The full-year impact of the fiscal 2001 acquisition of
Dynamco slightly mitigated this decrease.

In our Energy Systems and
Controls segment, net sales increased by $19.7 million or 18.4% with $13.1
million of the increase being attributable to the fiscal 2002 acquisition of
Zetec. Excluding the impact of Zetec, net sales increased 6.1% (to $113.6
million) due to gains in sales of oil & gas control system applications,
including those sold to Gazprom.

Our Scientific and
Industrial Imaging segment reported a decrease in net sales in fiscal 2002 as
compared to fiscal 2001 of $8.6 million or 5.4%. The decrease resulted
principally from lower motion product sales due to the pending release of a new
generation of products that began shipping during the first quarter of fiscal
2003. Fiscal 2002 acquisitions (QImaging, Definitive Imaging and Duncan
Technologies) and the full-year increase of a fiscal 2001 acquisition (Media
Cybernetics) mitigated the decline by $8.8 million. Excluding the impact of
these acquisitions net sales declined by 11.1% (to $139.2 million).

Our overall gross profit
percentage was 54.1% in fiscal 2002 and the same as in fiscal 2001.
Instrumentation segment gross margins were roughly flat in fiscal 2002 at 58.6%
as compared to 58.4% in fiscal 2001. Industrial Technology gross margins
decreased to 46.2% in fiscal 2002 as compared to 46.8% in fiscal 2001 as a
result of adverse volume leverage in our industrial pumps businesses. Our Energy
Systems and Controls segment reported margins of 59.8% in fiscal 2002 as
compared to 62.8% in fiscal 2001, attributable to lower gross margins at Zetec
as compared to the segment average. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging
segments gross margins were 52.3% in fiscal 2002 as compared to 52.8% in fiscal
2001 as margins declined for motion imaging equipment with the significant
reduction in sales.

Excluding the effects from
the accounting changes related to goodwill and the related amortization charges
expensed in fiscal 2001 of $15.3 million, selling, general & administrative
(“SG&A”) expenses increased to 35.2% of net sales in fiscal 2002 from 33.5%
of net sales in fiscal 2001. This increase is attributable to higher SG&A
expense levels at newly acquired businesses. SG&A expenses for companies
included in all of both 2002 and 2001 declined 2% in 2002 despite significantly
increased R&D and other engineering expenses in our Scientific and
Industrial Imaging segment, most notably Redlake MASD. There was also an
increase in corporate SG&A due primarily to an increase in medical insurance
costs and salaries and related employee relocation costs. As a percentage of net
sales, SG&A expenses also increased in 2002 compared to 2001 for each of our
four business segments by between 1% and 2%.

Interest expense increased
$2.6 million, or 16%, for the year ended October 31, 2002 compared to the year
ended October 31, 2001. Average borrowing levels were approximately 36% higher
during fiscal 2002 compared to the prior year due to acquisitions and effective
interest rates were approximately 14% lower during fiscal 2002 compared to
fiscal 2001.

A euro debt foreign
exchange loss of $4.1 million arose from euro-denominated debt that was carried
in the U.S. and the strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar during the
third quarter of fiscal 2002. This debt matured near July 31, 2002 and was
replaced with U.S. dollar denominated debt.

Income taxes were 31% of
pretax earnings in fiscal 2002 compared to 35% in fiscal 2001. Two of the key
factors related to the reduced rate were the change in accounting for goodwill
amortization and our expected utilization of all available foreign income tax
credits associated with European tax structures.

During fiscal 2002, we
completed a transition review for goodwill impairment under SFAS 142 as of
November 1, 2001. This review initially compared the fair value of each
previously acquired reporting unit to its carrying value. If an impairment was
indicated, the amount was then determined by comparing the implied fair value of
goodwill to its carrying amount. This impairment was reported as a change in
accounting principle, was a non-cash charge and was related to the Redlake,
Petrotech and Dynamco units.

At October 31, 2002, the
functional currencies of our European subsidiaries were stronger against the
U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at October 31, 2001. This
strengthening resulted in a gain of $13.7 million in the foreign exchange
component of comprehensive earnings for fiscal 2002. Approximately $11 million
of this adjustment related to goodwill and is not expected to directly affect
our expected future cash flows. Fiscal 2002’s operating results also benefited
slightly from the stronger non-U.S. currencies. The benefits were less than 2%
of operating earnings. Foreign exchange differences related to our other
non-U.S. subsidiaries were immaterial to fiscal 2002’s financial information.

(dollar amounts in thousands).

Instrumentation segment net
orders improved due largely to 2001 and 2002 acquisitions and higher orders for
oil and gas desulfurization applications, offset somewhat by lower orders for
semiconductor capital equipment markets. Industrial Technology segment net
orders declined on weak industrial and oil and gas exploration markets. Energy
Systems and Controls net orders rose because of higher demand for the Company’s
turbomachinery control systems, as well as the 2002 acquisition of Zetec, with
the year-to-year comparison adversely affected by a $20 million supplemental
order from Gazprom in 2001. Scientific and Industrial Imaging net orders fell as
the benefit from 2002 and 2001 acquisitions was more than offset by weak
semiconductor markets and lower motion imaging product activity.

A significant impact on the
decreased sales order backlog at October 31, 2002 compared to October 31, 2001
was the $11.5 million residual one-time supplemental Gazprom order which is
included in the prior year backlog for Energy Systems and Controls. Excluding
this order, total Company backlog increased 6% from $100.3 million to $106.6
million. Declines in Instrumentation and Industrial Technology were attributable
to weak semiconductor and oil exploration markets, respectively.

Financial
Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources

Net cash provided by
operating activities was $71.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31,
2003, $86.8 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2002 and $102.4
million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2001. Excluding the one time
write-off of debt extinguishment costs related to the recapitalization of the
Company of $24.4 million, net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal
2003 was $95.7 million, an increase of $8.9 million over fiscal 2002. This
increase reflected stronger earnings from operations and reduced inventories.
Most of the decrease in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was attributed to
the one-time supplemental order for Gazprom, partially offset by improved cash
generation from assets. We expect our net cash provided by operating activities
for fiscal 2004 to be higher than the levels experienced in the prior three
fiscal years due to the NTGH acquisition completed on December 29, 2003. Cash
flows used in investing activities during each of fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001
were primarily business acquisition costs. Cash flows from financing activities
during each of these years were largely the borrowing activities associated with
the business acquisitions and the debt reductions from our other net positive
cash flows. Financing activities in fiscal 2003 also included replacing our
existing $275 million credit agreement and $125 million senior notes with our
current $625 million credit agreement and $230 million senior subordinated
convertible notes.

Net working capital
(current assets, excluding cash, less total current liabilities, excluding debt)
was $170.4 million at December 31, 2003 compared to $126.7 million at October
31, 2002. We acquired approximately $70.2 million of net current assets through
business acquisitions during fiscal 2003. Total debt was $651.1 million at
December 31, 2003 (49.8% of total capital) compared to $332.1 million at October
31, 2002 (47% of total capital). Our increased debt at December 31, 2003
compared to October 31, 2002 was due to borrowings incurred at the end of the
current fiscal year to fund the NTGH acquisition and replace the previous credit
agreement and senior notes.

Our principal $625 million
credit facility with a group of banks and our $230 million senior subordinated
convertible notes will provide most of our daily external financing requirements. The
credit facility consists of a $400 million term loan with a five year maturity
and a $225 million revolving loan with a three year maturity. Our senior
subordinated convertible notes are due in 2034. At December 31, 2003, our debt
consisted of the $230 million in senior subordinated convertible notes, a $400
million term loan and $20 million drawn against the revolver. The Company also
had $14.5 million of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2003. We
expect that our available additional borrowing capacity combined with the cash
flows expected to be generated from existing business will be sufficient to fund
normal operating requirements and finance some additional acquisitions.
Additionally, on January 6, 2004 we received approximately $30 million from the
exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment in connection with our public offering of common shares. We also have
several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters
of credit in various foreign locations to support our non-U.S. businesses. In
total, these smaller facilities do not represent a significant source of credit
for us.

We were in compliance with
all debt covenants related to our credit facilities throughout the year ended
December 31, 2003.

Capital expenditures of
$10.4 million, $7.7 million and $7.4 million were incurred during fiscal 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively. We expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2004 to be
slightly higher as a percentage of sales due to the current higher capital
expenditure requirements of the newly acquired Neptune Technology business.

In November 2003, Roper’s
Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend paid on our outstanding
common stock to $0.09625 per share from $0.0875 per share, an increase of 10%.
This represents the eleventh consecutive year in which the quarterly dividend
has been increased since Roper’s 1992 initial public offering. Our board of
directors has declared a dividend payable on January 31, 2004. Payment of any
additional dividends requires further action by the board of directors.

Description of Certain
Indebtedness

New Senior Secured Credit
Facility

Concurrently with the closing of the
NTGH acquisition and the common stock and debt offerings in December 2003, we entered into
a new $625 million senior secured credit facility. The new credit facility consists of a
five-year $400 million term loan and a three-year $225 million revolving loan.

Our new credit facility requires us
to prepay our term loan and, in certain cases, reduce our commitments under our revolving
loan, upon the receipt of certain proceeds, including from certain asset sales, the
incurrence of certain debt, and up to 75% of our excess cash flows, unless we meet a
consolidated senior leverage ratio test. We are also required to make quarterly principal
payments on the term loans.

The facility contains various
affirmative and negative covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur
new debt, prepay subordinated debt, make certain investments and acquisitions, sell assets
and grant liens, make restricted payments (including the payment of dividends on our
common stock) and capital expenditures, or change our line of business. We also are
subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage
ratio and consolidated senior leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest
coverage ratio.

Senior Subordinated
Convertible Notes

In December 2003, we also issued $230
million of senior subordinated convertible notes at an original issue discount of 60.498%,
resulting in an effective yield of 3.75% per year to maturity. Interest on the notes is
payable semiannually, beginning July 15, 2004, until January 15, 2009. After that
date, we will not pay cash interest on the notes prior to maturity unless contingent cash
interest becomes payable. Instead, after January 15, 2009, interest will be
recognized at the effective rate of 3.75% and will represent accrual of original issue
discount, excluding any contingent cash interest that may become payable. We will pay
contingent cash interest to the holders of the notes during any six month period
commencing after January 15, 2009 if the average trading price of a note for a five
trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals 120%
or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and accrued cash
interest, if any, for such note. The contingent cash interest payable per note in respect
of any six month period will equal the annual rate of 0.25%.

The notes are unsecured senior
subordinated obligations, rank junior to our existing and future senior indebtedness and
rank equally with our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness.

Each $1,000
principal amount of the notes will be convertible at the option of the holder into 6.211
shares of our common stock (subject to adjustment), if (i) the sale price of our common
stock reaches, or the trading price of the notes falls below, specified thresholds, (ii)
if the notes are called for redemption or (iii) if specified corporate transactions have
occurred. Upon conversion, we will have the right to deliver, in lieu of common stock,
cash or a combination of cash and common stock.

Holders may require us to
purchase all or a portion of their notes on January 15, 2009, January 15, 2014,
January 15, 2019, January 15, 2024, and January 15, 2029, at stated prices plus
accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any. We may only pay
the purchase price of such notes in cash and not in common stock.

We may redeem for cash all or a
portion of the notes for cash at any time on or after January 15, 2009 at redemption
prices equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount and
accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any, on such notes
to the applicable redemption date.

At December 31, 2003 and
October 31, 2002, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities
or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured
finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the
purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually
narrow or limited purposes.

We believe that internally
generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our various credit
facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and further
acquisition activities. Although we maintain an active acquisition program, any
further acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not
feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and
what the impact will be on our activities, financial condition and results of
operations. We may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital
resources.

We anticipate that our
recently acquired companies as well as our other companies will generate
positive cash flows from operating activities, and that these cash flows will
permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt at a high rate. However, the
rate at which we can reduce our debt during fiscal 2004 (and reduce the
associated interest expense) will be affected by, among other things, the
financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial
performance of our existing companies; and none of these factors can be
predicted with certainty.

Recently Issued
Accounting Standards

The Company adopted
Statement of Accounting Financial Standard, SFAS No. 143 - “Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations” as of November 1, 2002. There was no material impact to
the company related to this new statement.

The Company adopted FASB
Interpretation No. 45 - “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” as of
January 1, 2003. This Interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by
a guarantor in its financial statements about obligations under certain
guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to
recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of
the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The Company has no new
guarantees after December 31, 2002 requiring the measurement provisions of this
Interpretation.

In January 2003, the FASB
issued FASB Interpretation No. 46(“FIN 46”), “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities.” An entity is subject to the consolidation rules of FIN 46 and is
referred to as a variable interest entity (“VIE”) if the entity’s equity
investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not
have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its operations without
additional financial support. FIN 46 applies immediately to all VIEs created after January
31, 2003 and is effective as of December 31, 2003 for any VIEs deemed to be special purpose
 entities (“SPEs”) created prior to February 1, 2003.  The FASB issued a revision
to FIN 46 (“FIN 46-R”) in December 2003.  FIN 46-R is effective for the interim period
 ending March 31, 2004 for all new or existing VIEs.  The Company is not required to adopt
FIN 46 since it has no SPEs.  The Company will implement the provisions of FIN 46-R in the first
 quarter of fiscal year 2004, and is evaluating the effect this Interpretation will have on the Company’s
financial statements.

The FASB issued SFAS No.
148 - “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure, an
amendment of FASB Statement No. 123” which provides alternative methods of
transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting
for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, this statement amends
certain disclosure requirements of Statement 123. Currently, Roper has chosen
not to adopt the accounting provisions of SFAS 123; however, as permitted by
SFAS 123, the Company continues to apply intrinsic value accounting for its
stock option plans under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (“APB 25”),
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.”

In April 2003, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 149, “Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities,” which amends and clarifies the accounting for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 149 is
effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, with some
exceptions for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. The
adoption of SFAS 149 on July 1, 2003 had no impact on the consolidated financial
statements.

In May 2003, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity,” which modifies the accounting
for certain financial instruments. SFAS No. 150 requires that these financial
instruments be classified as liabilities and applied immediately for financial
instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is
effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15,
2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 150 on July 1, 2003 had no impact on the
consolidated financial statements.

In December 2003, the FASB
revised SFAS No. 132, “Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions and Other
Postretirement Benefits.” The new SFAS No. 132 requires additional disclosures
about the assets, obligations, cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of
defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans, of
which certain disclosures are not required until 2004. The Company has adopted
the disclosure requirements that were effective for 2003.

In January 2004, the FASB
issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 106-1 (“FSP 106-1”) “Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement
and Modernization Act of 2003,” which provides temporary guidance concerning the
recently enacted Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act
of 2003 (the “Act”). SFAS No. 106, “Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions,” requires presently enacted changes in laws that
will take effect in future periods to be taken into account in measuring current
period postretirement benefit cost and the accumulated projected benefit
obligation (“APBO”). FSP 106-1 allows companies that sponsor affected
postretirement benefit plans to elect to defer recognizing the effects of the
Act on postretirement benefit expense and on the APBO pursuant to SFAS No. 106.
The Company has elected to defer accounting for the effects of the Act until
2004.

In November 2002, the EITF
issued a final consensus on EITF Issue No. 00-21, “Accounting for Revenue
Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables,” which addresses how to account for
arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products,
services, and/or rights to use assets. EITF Issue No. 00-21 is effective
prospectively for arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after
June 15, 2003. Companies may also elect to apply the provisions of EITF Issue
No. 00-21 to existing arrangements and record the income statement impact as the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The Company has adopted
EITF Issue No. 00-21 prospectively for contracts beginning after June 30, 2003.

In December 2003, the SEC
issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, “Revenue Recognition,” which clarifies
existing SEC guidance regarding revenues for contracts that contain multiple
deliverables to make it consistent with EITF Issue No. 00-21. The adoption of
SAB 104 did not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position,
operations, or cash flows.

This Annual Report includes
and incorporates by reference “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of
the federal securities laws. In addition, we, or our executive officers on our
behalf, may from time to time make forward-looking statements in reports and
other documents we file with the SEC or in connection with oral statements made
to the press, potential investors or others. All statements that are not
historical facts are “forward-looking statements.” The words “estimate,”
“project,” “intend,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” and similar expressions
identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include
statements regarding our expected financial position, business, financing plans,
business strategy, business prospects, revenues, working capital, liquidity,
capital needs, interest costs and income, in each case relating to our company
as a whole, as well as statements regarding acquisitions, potential acquisitions
and the benefits of acquisitions, including with respect to the NTGH
acquisition.

Forward-looking statements
are estimates and projections reflecting our best judgment and involve a number
of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially
from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. These statements are
based on our management’s beliefs and assumptions, which in turn are based on
currently available information. Examples of forward looking statements in this
report include but are not limited to our expectations regarding our ability to
generate operating cash flows and reduce debt and associated interest expense
and our expectations regarding growth through acquisitions. Important
assumptions relating to the forward-looking statements include, among others,
assumptions regarding demand for our products, the cost, timing and success of
product upgrades and new product introductions, raw materials costs, expected
pricing levels, the timing and cost of expected capital expenditures, expected
outcomes of pending litigation, competitive conditions, general economic
conditions and expected synergies relating to acquisitions, joint ventures and
alliances. These assumptions could prove inaccurate. Although we believe that
the estimates and projections reflected in the forward-looking statements are
reasonable, our expectations may prove to be incorrect. Important factors that
could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or projections
contained in the forward-looking statements include:

our ability to integrate the NTGH acquisition businesses into our operations;

any unforeseen liabilities associated with the NTGH businesses or future acquisitions;

limitations on our business imposed by our indebtedness;

reductions in our business with Gazprom;

the success of our restructuring activities in reducing costs;

unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates;

difficulties associated with exports;

risks and costs associated with our international sales and operations;

difficulty making acquisitions and successfully integrating acquired businesses;

increased product liability and insurance costs;

increased directors and officers liability and other insurance costs;

product liability and insurance risks;

increased warranty exposure;

future competition;

the cyclical nature of our markets;

changes in the supply of, or price for, parts and components;

environmental compliance costs and liabilities;

risks and costs associated with asbestos-related litigation;

potential write-offs of our substantial intangible assets;

our ability to successfully develop new products;

failure to protect our technology;

trade tariffs that may be applied due to the U.S. government’s delay in complying with certain WTO directives;

terrorist attacks;

future health crises; and

the factors discussed in Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report under the heading “Risk
Factors.”

We believe these
forward-looking statements are reasonable. However, you should not place undue
reliance on any forward-looking statements, which are based on current
expectations. Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they
are made, and we undertake no obligation to update publicly any of them in light
of new information or future events.

ITEM 7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to interest
rate risks on our outstanding borrowings, and we are exposed to foreign currency
exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S.
dollar. We are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded
price of our common stock.

At December 31, 2003 we had
a combination of fixed-rate borrowings (primarily our $230 million senior
subordinated convertible notes) and relatively variable rate borrowings under
the $625 million credit facility. Our $400 million 5-year term note under this
credit facility was variable at a spread over LIBOR. Any borrowings under the
$225 million revolver have a fixed rate, but the terms of these individual
borrowings are generally only 1-3 months. Subsequent to year end, we fixed the
interest rate at 4.108% on $100 million of the term note for a period of two
years. At December 31, 2003, there was no material difference between prevailing
market rates and the fixed rate on our debt instruments.

At December 31, 2003,
Roper’s outstanding variable-rate borrowings under the $625 million credit
facility were $420 million. An increase in interest rates of 1% would increase
our annualized interest costs by $3.2 million.

Several Roper companies
have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S.
dollar. Most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, British
pounds, Danish krone or Japanese yen. Sales by companies whose functional
currency was not the U.S. dollar were 27% of our total sales and 77% of these
sales were by companies with a European functional currency. The U.S. dollar
weakened against these European currencies during fiscal 2003 and was relatively
stable compared to other currencies. The difference between fiscal 2003’s
operating results for these companies translated into U.S. dollars at average
currency exchange rates experienced during fiscal 2003 and these operating
results translated into U.S. dollars at average currency exchange rates
experienced during fiscal 2002 was not material. If these currency exchange
rates had been 10% different throughout fiscal 2003 compared to currency
exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our expected net earnings
would have been approximately $1.4 million.

The changes in these
currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2003 compared
to currency exchange rates at October 31, 2002 resulted in an increase in net
assets of $43.0 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive
earnings, $33.6 million of which was attributed to goodwill. Goodwill changes
from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings
or cash flows.

The trading price of
Roper’s common stock influences the valuation of stock option grants and the
effects these grants have on pro forma earnings disclosed in our financial
statements. The stock prices also influence the computation of the dilutive
effect of outstanding stock options to determine diluted earnings per share. The
stock price also affects our employees’ perceptions of various programs that
involve our common stock. We believe the quantification of the effects of these
changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily
determinable.

REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To the
Shareholders

of Roper Industries, Inc.:

In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Roper Industries,
Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for the twelve month periods
ended December 31, 2003, October 31, 2002 and October 31, 2001 and the two month
period ended December 31, 2002 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements
 are the responsibility of the Company’s
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted
our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards generally accepted in
the United States of America, which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 1 to
the consolidated financial statements, Roper Industries, Inc. changed the manner
in which it accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets as of November 1,
2001.

and
the 12 months ended October 31, 2002, and 2001

(1)            Summary
of Accounting Policies

Basis
of Presentation

- These financial statements present consolidated information for
Roper Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Roper” or the “Company”). All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Reclassifications

- - Certain reclassifications of prior year information were made to conform with the
current presentation.

Nature
of the Business

- Roper is a diversified industrial company that designs,
manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls, scientific and industrial
imaging products and software, industrial technology products and instrumentation
products and services. These products and services are marketed to selected
segments of a broad range of markets including water and wastewater, oil and
gas, research, power generation, medical, semiconductor, refrigeration, automotive
and general industry.

Discontinued
Operations

- During the first quarter of the fiscal year ended October 31,
2003, the Company decided to offer for sale the Petrotech operation. The
accompanying financial statements have been restated to conform to discontinued
operations treatment for all periods presented. See footnote 16 for additional
disclosure.

Accounts
Receivable

- Accounts receivable were stated net of an allowance for doubtful
accounts of $4,498,000 and $3,829,000 at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Outstanding accounts receivable balances are reviewed periodically,
and allowances are provided at such time that management believes reasonable doubt
exists that such balances will be collected within a reasonable period of time.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

- Roper considers highly liquid financial
instruments with remaining maturities at acquisition of three months or less
to be cash equivalents. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, Roper had no cash
equivalents.

Earnings per Share

- Basic earnings per share were calculated using net earnings and the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the respective
year. Diluted earnings per share were calculated using net earnings and the
weighted average number of shares of common stock and dilutive common stock
equivalents outstanding during the respective year. Common stock equivalents
consisted of stock options, and the effects of common stock equivalents were
 determined using the treasury stock method.

As of and for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2003, the two month
 period ended December 31, 2002, and the twelve month periods ended October
 31, 2002 and 2001, there were 634,000, 672,000, 345,000 and 107,000
 outstanding stock options that were not included in the determination of
 diluted earnings per share because doing so would have been antidilutive.

Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

- Roper’s long-term debt at December 31,
2003 included $230 million of fixed-rate term notes which were not materially
different than prevailing market rates. Most of Roper’s other borrowings at
December 31, 2003 were at various interest rates that adjust relatively frequently
under its $625 million credit facility. The fair value for each of these borrowings
at December 31, 2003 was estimated to be the face value of these borrowings.

Foreign Currency Translation

- Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries whose functional
currency is not the U.S. dollar were translated at the exchange rate in effect at
the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses were translated at average
exchange rates for the period in which those entities were included in Roper’s
financial results. Translation adjustments are reflected as a component of other
 comprehensive earnings.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

- The company determines  whether there has been an
impairment of long-lived assets, excluding  goodwill and identifiable intangible
assets that are determined to have  indefinite useful economic lives, when certain
indicators of impairment  are present. In the event that facts and circumstances
indicate that the  cost of any long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of
 recoverability would be performed. If an evaluation is required, the
 estimated future gross, undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset
 would be compared to the asset’s carrying amount to determine if a  write-down
to market value is required. Future adverse changes in market  conditions or poor
operating results of underlying long-lived assets could  result in losses or an
inability to recover the carrying value of the  long-lived assets that may not be
reflected in the assets’ current  carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an
impairment charge in the future.

Income Taxes

- Roper is a U.S.-based multinational company  and the calculation of its
worldwide provision for income taxes requires  analysis of many factors, including
income tax structures that vary from  country to country, and the United States’ treatment
of non-U.S. earnings.  Roper has provided for U.S. income taxes for deferred taxes
on  undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries that are not expected to
 be permanently reinvested in such companies. There has been no provision  for
U.S. income taxes for the remaining undistributed earnings of  approximately $18
million at December 31, 2003, because Roper intends to  reinvest these earnings
indefinitely in operations outside the United  States. If such earnings were
distributed, incremental U.S. taxes of  approximately $6 million would accrue after
utilization of U.S. tax  credits.

Certain
 assets and liabilities have different bases for financial reporting and
 income tax purposes. Deferred income taxes have been provided for these
 differences.

Goodwill and Other Intangibles

- Prior to Roper’s adoption  of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 142, “Goodwill and Other  Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”),
goodwill was amortized on a straight-line  basis over periods that ranged from 5 to
40 years. Roper accounts for  goodwill in a purchase business combination as the
excess of the cost over  the fair value of net assets acquired. Business
combinations can also  result in other intangible assets being recognized.
Amortization of  intangible assets, if applicable, occurs over their estimated
useful  lives. SFAS 142 requires companies to cease amortizing goodwill that
 existed at June 30, 2001 and establishes a two-step method for testing
 goodwill for impairment on an annual basis (or an interim basis if an  event
occurs that might reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below  its carrying
value). Roper conducts this review for all of its reporting  units during the fourth
quarter of the fiscal year. The transitional  impairment that resulted from Roper’s
adoption of this standard on  November 1, 2002 has been reported as a change in
accounting principle - see Note 5. No impairment resulted from the annual review
performed in  2003. SFAS 142 also requires that an identifiable intangible asset
that is  determined to have an indefinite useful economic life not be amortized,
 but separately tested for impairment using a one-step fair value based
 approach.

Inventories

- Inventories
are valued at the lower of cost or  market. Cost is determined using either the
first-in, first-out method or  the last-in, first-out method (“LIFO”). Inventories
valued at LIFO cost  comprised 9% and 11% of consolidated inventories at December 31,
2003  and 2002, respectively.

Any LIFO  decrements recorded during any of the periods ended December 31, 2003 were
 immaterial to Roper’s Consolidated Financial Statements for that  period.

Other Comprehensive Earnings

- Comprehensive earnings includes net earnings  and
all other non-owner sources of changes in a company’s net assets. The  differences
between net earnings and comprehensive earnings for Roper  during the twelve month
period ended December 31, 2003, the two month  period ended December 31, 2002, and
the twelve month periods ended October  31, 2002 and 2001were currency translation
adjustments. Income taxes have  not been provided on currency translation
adjustments.

Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation and  Amortization

- Property, plant and
equipment is stated at cost less  accumulated depreciation and amortization.
Depreciation and amortization  are provided for using principally the straight-line
method over the  estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

Buildings

20-30 years

Machinery

8-12 years

Other equipment

3-5 years

Capitalized Software

- Effective January 1, 1999, the  Company adopted Statement of Position
(“SOP”) 98-1, “Accounting for the  Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained
for Internal Use.” Among  other provisions, SOP 98-1 requires that entities
capitalize certain  internal-use software costs once certain criteria are met. Under
SOP 98-1,  overhead, general and administrative and training costs are not
 capitalized.

Recently Released Accounting Pronouncements

- The Company  adopted SFAS No. 143 - “Accounting
for Asset Retirement Obligations” as of  November 1, 2002. There was no material
impact to the company related to  this new statement.

The
 Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 45 - “Guarantor’s Accounting and
 Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
 Indebtedness of Others” as of January 1, 2003. This Interpretation  elaborates
on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial  statements about
obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued.  It also clarifies that a
guarantor is required to recognize, at the  inception of a guarantee, a liability
for the fair value of the obligation  undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The
Company has no new guarantees  after December 31, 2002 requiring the measurement
provisions of this  Interpretation.

In
 January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 (“FIN 46”),  “Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities.” An entity is subject to the  consolidation rules of
FIN 46 and is referred to as a variable interest  entity (“VIE”) if the entity’s
equity investors lack the characteristics  of a controlling financial interest or do
not have sufficient equity at  risk for the entity to finance its operations without
additional financial  support. FIN 46 applies immediately to all VIEs created after January
31, 2003 and is effective as of December 31, 2003 for any VIEs deemed to be special purpose
 entities (“SPEs”) created prior to February 1, 2003.  The FASB issued a revision
to FIN 46 (“FIN 46-R”) in December 2003.  FIN 46-R is effective for the interim period
 ending March 31, 2004 for all new or existing VIEs.  The Company is not required to adopt
FIN 46 since it has no SPEs.  The Company will implement the provisions of FIN 46-R in the first
 quarter of fiscal year 2004, and is evaluating the effect this Interpretation will have on the Company’s
financial statements.

The
FASB  issued SFAS No. 148 - “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition
and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123” which  provides alternative
methods of transition for a voluntary change to the  fair value based method of
accounting for stock-based employee  compensation. In addition, this statement
amends certain disclosure  requirements of Statement 123. Currently, Roper has
chosen not to adopt  the accounting provisions of SFAS 123; however, as permitted by
SFAS 123,  the Company continues to apply intrinsic value accounting for its stock
 option plans under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (“APB 25”),  “Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees.”

In
April  2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, “Amendment of Statement 133 on
 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” which amends and clarifies
 the accounting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative
 instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under
 SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 149 is effective for contracts entered into or
 modified after June 30, 2003, with some exceptions for hedging  relationships
designated after June 30, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 149 on  July 1, 2003 had no
impact on the consolidated financial statements.

In
May  2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial
 Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity,” which
 modifies the accounting for certain financial instruments. SFAS No. 150
 requires that these financial instruments be classified as liabilities and
 applies immediately for financial instruments entered into or modified  after
May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the  first interim
period beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of SFAS  No. 150 on July 1, 2003
had no impact on the consolidated financial  statements.

In
 December 2003, the FASB revised SFAS No. 132, “Employers’ Disclosures  about
Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits.” The new SFAS No. 132  requires
additional disclosures about the assets, obligations, cash flows  and net periodic
benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other  defined benefit
postretirement plans, of which certain disclosures are not  required until 2004. The
Company has adopted the disclosure requirements  that were effective for 2003.

In
 January 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 106-1 (“FSP  106-1”)
“Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare  Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003,” which  provides temporary guidance
concerning the recently enacted Medicare  Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003 (the “Act”).  SFAS No. 106, “Employers’ Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other  Than Pensions,” requires presently enacted changes in
laws that will take  effect in future periods to be taken into account in measuring
current  period postretirement benefit cost and the accumulated projected benefit
 obligation (“APBO”). FSP 106-1 allows companies that sponsor affected
 postretirement benefit plans to elect to defer recognizing the effects of  the
Act on postretirement benefit expense and on the APBO pursuant to SFAS  No. 106. The
Company has elected to defer accounting for the effects of  the Act until 2004.

In
 November 2002, the EITF issued a final consensus on EITF Issue No. 00-21,  “Accounting
for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables,” which  addresses how to
account for arrangements that may involve the delivery or  performance of multiple
products, services, and/or rights to use assets.  EITF Issue No. 00-21 is effective
prospectively for arrangements entered  into in fiscal periods beginning after June
15, 2003. Companies may also  elect to apply the provisions of EITF Issue No. 00-21
to existing  arrangements and record the income statement impact as the cumulative
 effect of a change in accounting principle. The Company has adopted EITF
 Issue No. 00-21 prospectively for contracts beginning after June 30,  2003.

In
 December 2003, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, “Revenue
 Recognition,” which clarifies existing SEC guidance regarding revenues for
 contracts that contain multiple deliverables to make it consistent with  EITF
Issue No. 00-21. The adoption of SAB 104 did not have a material  effect on the
Company’s financial position, operations, or cash  flows.

Research and Development

- Research and development costs  include salaries and benefits,
rents, supplies, and other costs related to  various products under development.
Research and development costs are  expensed in the period incurred and totaled
$32.6 million, $29.6 million  and $26.0 million for the 12 month periods ended
December 31, 2003,  October 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Research and
development  costs for the two months ended December 31, 2002 were $5.7million.

Revenue Recognition

- The Company recognizes revenue from  the sale of product when
title and risk of loss pass to the customer,  which is generally when product is
shipped. The Company recognizes revenue  from services rendered upon customer
acceptance. Revenues under certain  relatively long-term and relatively large-value
construction projects are  recognized under the percentage-of-completion method
using the ratio of  costs incurred to total estimated costs as the measure of
performance. The Company  recognized revenues of approximately $31.4 million, $2.4
million and $2.3  million for the 12 month periods ended December 31, 2003, October 31,
 2002 and 2001, respectively using this method. Estimated losses on any
 projects are recognized as soon as such losses become   known.

Product Warranties

- The Company sells certain of its  products to customers with a
product warranty that provides that customers  can return a defective product during
a specified warranty period  following the purchase in exchange for a replacement
product, repair at no  cost to the customer or the issuance of a credit to the
customer. The  Company accrues its estimated exposure to warranty claims based upon
 current and historical product sales date, warranty costs incurred and any
 other related information known to the Company.

Stock Options

- Roper accounts for stock-based compensation under the
 provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25 - “Accounting for  Stock
Issued to Employees.” Stock-based compensation is measured at its  fair value at the
grant date in accordance with an option-pricing model.  SFAS 123 - “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation,” provides that the  related expense may be recorded in the
basic financial statements or the  pro forma effect on earnings may be disclosed in
the financial statements.  Roper provides the pro forma disclosures.

Non-employee
directors of Roper are eligible to receive stock  options for its common stock.
These stock options are accounted for the  same as stock options granted to
employees. Roper has never issued stock  options other than those issued to
employees or its non-employee  directors.

Business Acquisitions

On
 December 29, 2003, the company acquired all the outstanding shares of  Neptune
Technology Group Holdings, Inc. (“NTGH”), a leader in the water  management market.
In connection with our acquisition of NTGH, we also  purchased the remaining
one-third interest in DAP Technologies, a Canadian  company that manufactures
fully-rugged handheld computers, that NTGH did  not own. NTGH’s principal facilities
are located in Tallassee, Alabama,  Mississauga, Ontario and Quebec City, Quebec.
The operations of NTGH will  be reported in both the Industrial Technology and
Scientific and  Industrial Imaging segments in fiscal 2004. There were no sales
related to  NTGH in our results for fiscal 2003.

The
 aggregate purchase price of the NTGH acquisition was approximately $482
 million of cash and includes amounts paid to sellers, amounts incurred for
 due diligence and other direct external costs associated with the
 acquisition. We also paid approximately $9.1 million for the remaining
 one-third interest in DAP Technologies consisting of cash consideration of
 $7.5 million and 34,000 shares of our common stock.

The
 following table (in thousands) summarizes the estimated fair values of the
 assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition. The
 allocation includes estimates that were not finalized at December 31,  2003.
Purchase price adjustments following the closing are also customary.  The
adjustments that were pending at December 31, 2003 were not  significant.

Of
the  $261.1 million of acquired intangible assets, $35.9 million was assigned
 to trade names that are not subject to amortization. The remaining $225.2
 million of acquired intangible assets have a weighted-average useful life  of
approximately 22 years. The intangible assets that make up that amount  include
customer relationships of $206.2 million (23 year weighted-average  useful life),
technology of $10.0 million (10-year weighted-average useful  life), and software of
$9.0 million (8-year weighted-average useful life).

The
majority of the $216.1 million of goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax
purposes.

On
July  31, 2002, the company acquired all the outstanding shares of Zetec, Inc.
 (“Zetec”). Zetec supplies non-destructive inspection solutions using eddy
 current technology and related consumables, primarily for use in power
 generating facilities and is included in the Energy Systems and Controls
 segment of the business. Zetec’s principal facility is located near  Seattle,
Washington. The results of Zetec’s operations have been included  in the
Consolidated Financial Statements since the acquisition date. The  aggregate
purchase price of the acquisition was $57.2 million of cash and  includes amounts
paid to sellers, amounts incurred for due diligence and  other direct external costs
associated with the   acquisition.

The
 following table (in thousands) summarizes the estimated fair values of the
 assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition. The

Of
the  $7.1 million of acquired intangible assets, $2.1 million was assigned to
 trade names that are not subject to amortization. The remaining $5.0  million
of acquired intangible assets have a weighted-average useful life  of approximately
6 years. The intangible assets that make up that amount  include trade secrets of
$3.0 million (6 year weighted-average useful  life), technology of $1.8 million
(5-year weighted-average useful life),  and patents of $0.2 million (15-year
weighted-average usefullife).

The
$40.6 million of goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

In
 addition, in fiscal 2002, the company acquired the following four entities
 for a total cost of $18.0 million, which was paid in   cash:

•

Acquired in
August 2002, Quantitative Imaging Corporation, (QImaging), based in  Vancouver, Canada
provides innovative, high-performance digital cameras  for scientific and industrial
imaging applications, complementing Roper’s  digital imaging business within the
Scientific and Industrial Imaging  segment.

•

Acquired in
July 2002, AiCambridge Ltd. (“Qualitek”), based in Cambridge, England,  is a
designer and manufacturer of leak detection equipment and systems for  medical,
pharmaceutical, food, packaging and automotive industries,  primarily in Europe. It is
reported in our Instrumentation segment.

•

Acquired in
July 2002, Duncan Technologies, based in Sacramento, California, is an  innovative
designer and manufacturer of high-quality digital cameras for a  variety of markets
including machine vision, remote sensing and traffic  monitoring. It is reported in our
Scientific and Industrial Imaging  segment.

•

Acquired in
September 2002, Definitive Imaging, based in Cleveland, Ohio, provides  image analysis
software and specialized knowledge for metallographic and  science quality control. It is
reported in our Scientific and Industrial  Imaging segment.

Goodwill
 recognized in those transactions amounted to $12.9 million and of that  amount
approximately $0.8 million is expected to be fully deductible for  tax purposes. The
intangible assets acquired in these transactions are  being amortized over a life of
4 to 7 years.

On
 September 5, 2001, the company acquired all the outstanding shares of  Struers
and Logitech. Struers develops, manufactures and markets materials  analysis
preparation equipment and consumables used in quality inspection,  failure analysis
and research of solid materials. Logitech develops,  manufactures and markets
high-precision material-shaping equipment used  primarily in the production of
advanced materials for the semiconductor  and opto-electronics markets. Struers is
headquartered near Copenhagen,  Denmark and Logitech is headquartered near Glasgow,
Scotland. Both  companies also share sales and service locations in the U.S.,
France,  Germany and Japan. The results of these operations have been included in
 the Consolidated Financial Statements since the acquisition date in our
 Instrumentation segment.

The
 aggregate purchase price of the acquisition was $150.9 million of cash and
 includes amounts paid to sellers, amounts incurred for due diligence and
 other direct external costs associated with the   acquisition.

The
 following table (in thousands) summarizes the fair values of the assets
 acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of   acquisition.

Of
the  $20.7 million of acquired intangible assets, $4.9 million was assigned to
 trade names that are not subject to amortization. The remaining $15.8  million
of acquired intangible assets have a weighted-average useful life  of approximately
10 years. The intangible assets that make up that amount  include an existing
customer base of $15.1 million (10-year useful life),  and backlog of $0.7 million
(1-year useful life).

The $107.0 million
of goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

In
 addition, in fiscal 2001, the company acquired the following two entities  for
a total of cost of $23.2 million, which was paid in   cash:

•

Acquired
in July 2001, Media Cybernetics, L.P. (“Media”), located in Silver  Springs,
Maryland, is a leading image processing software developer for  scientific and industrial
applications and is included in the Scientific  and Industrial Imaging segment.

•

Acquired
in May 2001, Dynamco, Inc. (“Dynamco”) manufactures high quality pneumatic
 valves, solenoids, relays and related products that are sold to the  semiconductor,
packing, HVAC and medical industries. Located in McKinney,  Texas, Dynamco is included in
the Industrial Technology segment.

Goodwill
 recognized in those transactions amounted to $14.2 million and that amount  is expected
to be fully deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill was assigned  to the Scientific and
Industrial Imaging and Industrial Technology  segments in the amounts of $8.9 million and
$5.2 million,  respectively,

The
 deferred income tax balance sheet accounts arise from temporary  differences between the
amount of assets and liabilities recognized for  financial reporting and tax purposes.

Components
of the deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31 were as follows (in thousands):

On
 December 31, 2003, Roper had $56.9 million of U.S. federal net operating  loss
carryforwards, which will expire in future years, with the majority  of the carryforwards
expiring in 2023. A substantial amount of the loss  carryforwards were acquired in an
acquisition by the Company in 2003.  Therefore, the utilization of these tax attributes
is subject to an annual  limitation imposed by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue   Code.

Roper
 has not recognized a valuation allowance since management has determined  that it is
more likely than not that the results of future operations will  generate sufficient
taxable income to realize all deferred tax  assets.

Our
 principal $625 million credit facility with a group of banks and our $230  million
senior subordinated convertible notes provide most of our daily  external financing
requirements. The credit facility consists of a $400  million term loan with a five year
maturity and a $225 million revolving  loan with a three year maturity. The interest rate on
 the borrowings under the $625 million credit facility is calculated based upon various
recognized indices plus a margin as defined in the credit agreement.  Our senior
subordinated convertible notes  are due in 2034. At December 31, 2003, our debt consisted
of the $230  million in senior subordinated convertible notes, $400 million term loan
 and $20 million drawn against the revolver. The company also had $14.5  million of
outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2003. We expect  that our available
additional borrowing capacity combined with the cash  flows expected to be generated from
existing business will be sufficient  to fund normal operating requirements and finance
some additional  acquisitions. We also have several smaller facilities that allow for
 borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in various foreign  locations to support
our non-U.S. businesses. In total, these smaller  facilities do not represent a
significant source of credit for     us.

Concurrent
with the credit facility transaction, we issued through  a public offering $230 million
of 3.75% subordinated convertible  notes due  2034 at an original issue discount of 60.498%
 (the “Convertible Notes”). The
Convertible Notes are subordinated in  right of payment and collateral to all of our existing and future
senior debt.
Interest on the notes is payable semiannually,
beginning July 15, 2004, until January 15, 2009. After that date,
we will not pay cash interest on the notes prior to maturity unless contingent cash interest becomes payable.
Instead, after January 15, 2009, interest will be recognized at the effective rate of 3.75% and will represent
accrual of original issue discount, excluding any contingent cash interest that may become payable.  We will pay
contingent cash interest to the holders of the notes during any six month period commencing after January 15,
2009 if the average trading price of a note for a five trading day measurement period preceding the applicable
six month period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and accrued
cash interest, if any, for such note. The contingent cash interest payable per note in respect of any six month
period will equal the annual rate of 0.25%.  Holders may
convert their notes into 6.211 shares of our  common stock, subject to adjustment, only
(1) if the sale price of our  common stock reaches, or the trading price of the notes
falls below,  specified thresholds, (2) if the notes are called for redemption, or (3)
 if specified corporate transactions have occurred. Upon conversion, we  will have the
right to deliver, in lieu of our common stock, cash or  common stock or a combination of
cash and common stock. Holders may  require us to purchase all or a portion of their
notes on January 15, 2009  at a price of $395.02 per note, on January 15, 2014 at a price
of $475.66  per note, on January 15, 2019 at a price of $572.76 per note, on January  15,
2024 at a price of $689.68 per note, and on January 15, 2029 at a  price of $830.47 per
note, in each case plus accrued cash interest, if  any, and accrued contingent cash
interest, if any. We may only pay the  purchase price of such notes in cash and not in
common stock. In addition,  if we experience a change in control, each holder may require
us to  purchase for cash all or a portion of such holder’s notes at a price equal  to the
sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount for  non-tax purposes,
accrued cash interest, if any, and accrued contingent  cash interest, if any, to the date
of purchase.

We
used  all of the net proceeds from the Convertible Notes offering to redeem our
outstanding  senior notes and to repay amounts outstanding under our existing credit
 agreement.

At
December 31, 2002, and 2003, the Company was in compliance with its restrictive
covenants.

Retirement and Other Benefit Plans

Roper
 maintains two defined contribution retirement plans under the provisions  of Section
401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code covering substantially all  U.S. employees not
subject to collective bargaining agreements. Roper  partially matches employee
contributions. Its costs related to these two  plans were $5,156,000, $883,000,
$4,549,000, and $4,126,000 for the twelve  month period ended December 31, 2003, the two
month period ended December  31, 2002, and the twelve month periods ended October 31,
2002 and 2001,  respectively.

Roper
 also maintains various defined benefit retirement plans covering employees  of non-U.S.
subsidiaries and a plan that supplements certain employees for  the contribution ceiling
applicable to the Section 401(k) plans. The costs  and accumulated benefit obligations
associated with each of these plans  were not material.

Pursuant
 to the fiscal 1999 Petroleum Analyzer acquisition, Roper agreed to assume  a defined
benefit pension plan covering certain U.S. employees subject to  a collective bargaining
agreement. Roper obtained the necessary regulatory  approvals to terminate this plan
during fiscal 2002 and all plan assets  were distributed during fiscal 2002.

Pursuant
 to the fiscal 2002 Zetec acquisition, Roper agreed to assume a defined  benefit pension
plan covering certain U.S. employees. Roper has obtained  the necessary regulatory
approvals to terminate the plan and all plan  assets will be distributed during fiscal
2004.

All
U.S.  employees are eligible to participate in Roper’s stock purchase plan  whereby they
may designate up to 10% of eligible earnings to purchase  Roper’s common stock at a 10%
discount to the average closing price of its  common stock at the beginning and end of a
quarterly offering period. The  common stock sold to the employees may be either treasury
stock, stock  purchased on the open market, or newly issued shares. During the twelve
 month period ended December 31, 2003, and the twelve month periods ended  October 31,
2002 and 2001, participants of the employee stock purchase  plan purchased 11,000, 11,000
and 8,000 shares, respectively, of Roper’s  common stock for total consideration of
$378,000, $437,000 and $257,000,  respectively. There were no purchases during the two
month period ended  December 31, 2002. All of these shares were purchased from Roper’s
 treasury shares.

(11)

Common Stock Transactions

Roper’s
 restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that each outstanding share  of Roper’s
common stock entitles the holder thereof to five votes per  share, except that holders of
outstanding shares with respect to which  there has been a change in beneficial ownership
during the four years  immediately preceding the applicable record date will be entitled
to one  vote per share.

Roper
 has a Shareholder Rights Plan whereby one Preferred Stock Purchase Right  (a “Right”)
accompanies each outstanding share of common stock. Such  Rights only become exercisable,
or transferable apart from the common  stock, ten business days after a person or group
acquires various  specified levels of beneficial ownership, with or without the Board’s
 consent. Each Right may be exercised to acquire one one-thousandth of a  newly issued
share of Roper’s Series A Preferred Stock, at an exercise  price of $170, subject to
adjustment. Alternatively, upon the occurrence  of certain specified events, the Rights
allow holders to purchase Roper’s  common stock having a market value at such time of
twice the Right’s  exercise price. The Rights may be redeemed by Roper at a redemption
price  of $0.01 per Right at any time until the tenth business day following  public
announcement that a 20% position has been acquired or 10 business  days after
commencement of a tender or exchange offer. The Rights expire  on January 8, 2006.

Roper
 periodically enters into agreements with the management of newly-acquired  companies for
the issuance of Roper’s common stock based on the  achievement of specified goals. A
similar agreement was made with a  corporate executive during fiscal 1996 that matured
during fiscal 2002.  During fiscal 2002, 20,000 shares of common stock were issued under
such  agreements. At December 31, 2003, there were no such agreements  outstanding.

Concurrent
with the NTGH acquisition, the Company completed a  public offering of 4,200,000 shares
of common stock for gross proceeds  of approximately $201.6 million. In connection
with our acquisition of  NTGH, we also purchased the remaining one-third interest in DAP
 Technologies that NTGH did not own. Part of the consideration for this  one-third
interest consisted of 34,000 shares of the Company’s treasury  shares.  In January 2004,
an underwriters’ overallotment of 630,000 shares of common stock was exercised and closed, providing the Company
with gross proceeds of approximately $30.2 million before expenses.

(12)

Stock Options

Roper
 has two stock incentive plans (the “1991 Plan” and the “2000 Plan”) which  authorize the
issuance of shares of common stock to certain directors, key  employees, and consultants
of Roper as incentive and/or nonqualified stock  options, stock appreciation rights or
equivalent instruments. Stock  options under both plans must be granted at prices not
less than 100% of  market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant. Stock
options typically vest over a period of up to five years.  Stock options expire ten
 years from the date of grant. Options may no longer be granted under the  1991 Plan. A
total of 2,500,000 shares have been reserved in the 2000 Plan  for issuance as incentive
equity stock awards. The 2000 Plan has no expiration date for the granting of options and
had the capacity to grant an additional 1,677,000 and 708,000 options or equivalent
instruments at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Roper
 also has a stock option plan for non-employee directors (the “Non-employee
 Director Plan”). The Non-employee Director Plan provides for each  non-employee
director appointed or elected to the Board initial options to  purchase 4,000 shares of
Roper’s common stock and thereafter options to  purchase an additional 4,000 shares
each year under terms and conditions  similar to the above-mentioned stock option plans,
except that following  their grant, all options become fully vested at the time of the
Annual  Meeting of Shareholders following the grant date and are exercisable  ratably
over five years following the date of grant. Stock options expire  ten years from the
date of grant. At December 31, 2003, and 2002, respectively, the Non-Employee Director
Plan had the capacity to grant an additional 64,000 and 92,000 options.

options outstanding at December 31, 2003 are shown  below:

The
 disclosed pro forma effects on earnings do not include the effects of  stock options
granted prior to fiscal 1996 (affecting fiscal 2000) since  the provisions of SFAS 123
are not applicable to stock options for this  purpose. The pro forma effects of applying
SFAS 123 to fiscal 2003, 2002  and 2001 may not be representative of the pro forma
effects in future  years. Based on the vesting schedule of Roper’s stock option grants,
the  pro forma effects on earnings are most pronounced in the early years  following each
grant. The timing and magnitude of any future grants is at  the discretion of Roper’s
Board of Directors and cannot be     assured.

(13)

Contingencies

Roper,
 in the ordinary course of business, is the subject of, or a party to,  various pending
or threatened legal actions, including those pertaining to  product liability and
employment practices. It is vigorously contesting  all lawsuits that, in general, are
based upon claims of the kind that have  been customary over the past several years.
Based upon Roper’s past  experience with resolution of its product liability and
employment  practices claims and the limits of the primary, excess, and umbrella
 liability insurance coverages that are available with respect to pending  claims,
management believes that adequate provision has been made to cover  any potential
liability not covered by insurance, and that the ultimate  liability, if any, arising
from these actions should not have a material  adverse effect on the consolidated
financial position, results of  operations or cash flows of Roper. Included in other
noncurrent assets at  December 31, 2003 are estimated insurable settlements receivable
from  insurance companies of approximately $2.6 million, which is consistent  with the
amount recorded at October 31, 2002.

Over
recent years there  has been a significant increase in certain U.S. states in
 asbestos-related litigation claims against numerous industrial companies.  Roper or its
subsidiaries have been named defendants in some such cases.  No significant resources
have been required by Roper to respond to these  cases and Roper believes it has valid
defenses to such claims and, if  required, intends to defend them vigorously. Given the
state of these  claims it is not possible to determine the potential liability, if  any.

Roper’s
 rent expense was approximately $11.6 million, $10.7 million and $9.3  million for fiscal
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Roper’s future  minimum lease commitments totaled
$62.3 million at December 31, 2003.  These commitments included $11.8 million in fiscal
2004, $9.7 million in  fiscal 2005, $7.1 million in fiscal 2006, $5.3 million in fiscal
2007,  $4.5 million in fiscal 2008 and $23.9 million   thereafter.

Segment and Geographic Area Information

During
 the quarter ended January 31, 2003, Roper realigned its operations into  four
market-focused segments to capture value-creating opportunities  around common customers,
market orientation, sales channels and common  cost opportunities. The four new segments
are: Instrumentation; Industrial  Technology; Energy Systems and Controls; and Scientific
and Industrial  Imaging. Our Instrumentation segment offers equipment and consumables for
 materials analysis, fluid properties testing and industrial leak  testing. Products
 included within the Industrial Technology segment are industrial pumps,  flow
measurement and metering equipment, and industrial valves and  controls. The Energy
Systems and Controls segment’s products include  control systems, machinery vibration and
other non-destructive inspection  and measurement products and solutions. Our Scientific
and Industrial Imaging segment  offers high performance digital imaging products and
softwareand following the  NTHG acquisition, handheld computers and software. Roper’s
 management structure and internal reporting are also aligned consistent  with these four
segments.

There
 were no material transactions between Roper’s business segments during any  of the
twelve month period ended December 31, 2003, the two month period  ended December 31,
2002, and the twelve month periods ended October 31,  2002 and 2001. Sales between
geographic areas are primarily of finished  products and are accounted for at prices
intended to represent third-party  prices. Operating profit by business segment and by
geographic area is  defined as sales less operating costs and expenses. These costs and
 expenses do not include unallocated corporate administrative expenses.  Items below
income from operations on Roper’s statement of earnings are  not allocated to business
segments.

Identifiable
assets are those assets used primarily in the  operations of each business segment or
geographic area. Corporate assets  were principally comprised of cash, recoverable
insurance claims, deferred  compensation assets, unamortized deferred financing costs and
property and  equipment.

Selected
 financial information by business segment for twelve month period ended  December 31,
2003, the two month period ended December 31, 2002, and the  twelve month periods ended
October 31, 2002 and 2001 follows (in  thousands):

Summarized
data for Roper’s U.S. and foreign operations  (principally in Europe and Japan) for the
twelve month period ended  December 31, 2003, the two month period ended December 31,
2002, and the  twelve month periods ended October 31, 2002 and 2001 were as follows (in
 thousands):

Export
 sales from the United States during the twelve month period ended December  31, 2003,
the two month period ended December 31, 2002, and the twelve  month periods ended October
31, 2002 and 2001 were $216 million, $19  million, $223 million and $238 million,
respectively. In the year ended  December 31, 2003, these exports were shipped primarily
to Russia (14%),  elsewhere in Europe (30%), Japan (11%), elsewhere in Asia excluding the
 Middle East (12%), Latin America (3%) and other (30%).

Sales
to  customers outside the United States accounted for a significant portion of  Roper’s
revenues. Sales are attributed to geographic areas based upon the  location where the
product is ultimately shipped. Foreign countries that  accounted for at least 5% of Roper’s
net sales in any of the twelve month  period ended December 31, 2003, the two month
period ended December 31,  2002, and the twelve month periods ended October 31, 2002 and
2001 have  been individually identified in the following table (in thousands). Other
 countries have been grouped by region.

(15)

Restructuring Activities

In
 conjunction with segment realignment described in Management’s Discussion  and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Roper has  commenced certain
restructuring activities designed to reduce excess  manufacturing capacity, move certain
operations to lower-cost locations  and transform activities to have lower fixed costs
associated with those  activities. Costs incurred to date have been as follows (amounts
in  thousands):

Roper
expects these activities to continue through the first half of calendar 2004.

During
 the three months ended April 30, 2001, Roper recorded $509,000 of  expenses, reported as
part of selling, general and administrative  expenses, related to activities to
consolidate certain operating  facilities. All significant restructuring activities were
completed by  October 31, 2001. In addition, $2,050,000 of restructuring activities were
 incurred in fiscal 2001 at our Petrotech unit which has been restated to  discontinued
operations.

(16)

Discontinued Operations

In
 connection with the realignment of our businesses during the first quarter  of fiscal
2003, the Company formalized its decision to offer for sale the  Petrotech operation.
Accordingly, related operating results reported as  discontinued operations for all
periods presented are outlined as follows  (amounts in thousands):

The
 Petrotech operation was previously reported in the Company’s Industrial  Controls
segment prior to the segment realignment. The accompanying  financial statements have
been restated to conform to discontinued  operations treatment for all historical periods
presented. Petrotech was  sold on August 31, 2003.

(17)

Concentration of Risk

Financial
instruments which potentially subject the Company to  credit risk consist primarily of
cash, cash equivalents and trade  receivables.

The
 Company maintains cash and cash equivalents with various major financial  institutions.
Cash equivalents include investments in commercial paper of  companies with high credit
ratings, investments in money market securities  and securities backed by the U.S.
Government. At times such amounts may  exceed the F.D.I.C. limits. The Company limits the
amount of credit  exposure with any one financial institution and believes that no
 significant concentration of credit risk exists with respect to cash  investments.

Trade
 receivables subject the company to the potential for credit risk with  customers. To
reduce credit risk, the Company performs ongoing evaluations  of its customers’ financial
condition.

(18)

Subsequent Event

In
 January 2004, an underwriters’ overallotment of 630,000 shares of common  stock was
exercised and closed, providing the Company with gross proceeds  of approximately $30.2
million before expenses.

ITEM 9. CHANGES
IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

On May 14, 2002, Roper
terminated its relationship with Arthur Andersen LLP (“Arthur Andersen”) as our
independent public accountants and engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our
independent public accountants. The decision to change independent public
accountants was recommended by the audit committee and approved by our board of
directors.

In connection with the
audits of our Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the two fiscal
years ended October 31, 2001, and with respect to the subsequent period through
May 14, 2002, (i) there were no disagreements with Arthur Andersen on any matter
of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or
auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements, if not resolved to Arthur
Andersen’s satisfaction, would have caused them to make reference in connection
with their report on our Consolidated Financial Statements to the subject matter
of the disagreement and (ii) Arthur Andersen has not advised Roper of any reportable
 events as defined in paragraphs (A) through (D) of Regulations S-K Item 304
(a)(l)(v).

Arthur Andersen’s reports
on our Consolidated Financial Statements for the past two years ended October
31, 2001 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were
they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting
principles.

ITEM 9A.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

As required by Securities and
Exchange Commission rules, we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered
by this annual report. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer. Based on this evaluation, these officers have concluded that the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. There were
no changes to our internal controls during the period covered by this annual report that
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls
over financial reporting.

Disclosure controls and procedures
are our controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls
and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act are accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.
