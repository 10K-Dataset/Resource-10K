ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Our Business

Roper
Industries, Inc. (“Roper” or the “Company”) was incorporated on
December 17, 1981 under the laws of the State of Delaware. We are a diversified industrial
company that designs, manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls, scientific
and industrial imaging products and software, industrial technology products and
instrumentation products and services. We market these products and services to selected
segments of a broad range of markets including radio frequency (RF) applications, water
and wastewater, oil and gas, research, power generation, general industry and 15 other
niche markets.

We
pursue consistent and sustainable growth in sales and earnings by emphasizing continuous
improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other
carefully selected businesses that offer high value-added, engineered products and
solutions and are capable of achieving growth and maintaining high margins. We compete in
many niche markets and believe that we are the market leader or a competitive alternative
to the market leader in the majority of these markets.

In
August 2003, we changed our fiscal year-end from October 31 to December 31. However,
unless otherwise indicated, references to 2004, 2003 and 2002 in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K (“Annual Report”) refer to the twelve months ended December 31, 2004,
twelve months ended December 31, 2003, and twelve months ended October 31, 2002.

We
continued our growth in 2004 from internal growth and the full-year contributions from the
Neptune Technology Group Holdings, Inc. (“NTGH”) businesses acquired on December
29, 2003. Our 2004 acquisitions of the Power Generation business of R/D Tech on June 7,
2004 and TransCore Holdings, Inc. (“TransCore”) effective on December 13, 2004
were purchased for cash and financed through borrowings under our credit agreements and
proceeds from our December 2004 public offering of our common stock.

The Company makes available free of
charge on our website (

www.roperind.com

), our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly
reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed
or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), as soon as reasonably practicable after we
electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”). These filings are also accessible on the SEC’s website
at

www.sec.gov

.

The annual certification of
Roper’s Chief Executive Officer required to be furnished to the New York Stock
Exchange pursuant to Section 303A 12(a) of the NYSE Listed Company Manual was previously
filed with the New York Stock Exchange on June 18, 2004.

Market
Share, Market Expansion, and Product Development

Leadership
with Engineered Content for Niche Markets.

We have developed and maintained a leading
position in many of our markets. We believe our market positions are attributable to the
technical sophistication of our products, the applications expertise used to create our
advanced products and systems and our service capabilities. Our operating units grow their
businesses through new product development and development of new applications and
services for existing products to satisfy customer needs. In addition, our operating units
continue to grow our customer base by expanding our distribution, selling other products
through our existing channels and entering adjacent markets.

Diversified
End Markets and Geographic Reach.

Over the past decade, we have strategically expanded
the number of end markets we serve to increase revenue and business stability and expand
our opportunities for growth. During that same period, we grew our global presence to the
degree that our sales of products manufactured and exported from the U.S. and manufactured
abroad and sold to customers outside the U.S. accounted for $459 million for 2004, up from
$378 million in 2003

.

Information regarding our international operations is set
forth in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in
this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”).

Research
and Development.

We conduct applied research and development to improve the quality
and performance of our products and to develop new technologies and products to enter new
markets. Our research and development spending increased to $38.7 million in 2004 as
compared to $32.6 million in 2003 and $29.6 million in 2002. We expect the amount spent on
research and development activities to continue to rise in 2005 as a result of the
acquisition of TransCore in December 2004.

The
TransCore Acquisition and Related Recapitalization Transactions

On December 13, 2004, we acquired
TransCore which is a leading provider of radio frequency identification (“RFID”)
and satellite-based communication technologies and related services that are used by
customers to automate and enhance business processes, increase asset productivity and
improve security, largely for transportation-related applications in North America.
TransCore was acquired for a cash purchase price of approximately $597 million (net of
cash acquired and outstanding debt and prior to amounts incurred for due diligence and
 other direct external costs related to the acquisition).

We also completed a public offering
of 5,000,000 shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $300.5
million. Concurrently with the closing of the offerings, we also entered into an amended
and restated $1.055 billion five-year senior secured credit facility consisting of a $655
million term loan and a $400 million revolving credit facility. We used the proceeds from
the common stock offering, together with borrowings under our senior secured credit
facility, to pay for the acquisition, repay our existing credit facility and pay related
fees and expenses. An underwriters’ overallotment of 115,000 shares of common stock
was subsequently exercised and closed on December 28, 2004 for additional gross proceeds
of approximately $6.9 million.

the timing of large project awards. Standard products ship within two weeks of receipt of
order. This segment’s backlog of firm unfilled orders totaled $183.7 million at
December 31, 2004.

Materials and Suppliers

We
believe that most materials and supplies used by us are readily available from numerous
sources and suppliers throughout the world. However, some of our components and
sub-assemblies are currently available from a limited number of suppliers. Some
high-performance components for digital imaging products can be in short supply and/or
suppliers have occasional difficulty manufacturing such components to our specifications.
We regularly investigate and identify alternative sources where possible, and we believe
that these conditions equally affect our competitors. Thus far, supply shortages have not
had a significant adverse effect on Roper’s sales although delays in shipments have
occurred following such supply interruptions.

Environmental Matters
and Other Governmental Regulation

Our
operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental
protection, including laws and regulations governing air emissions, water discharges,
waste management and workplace safety. We use, generate and dispose of hazardous
substances and waste in our operations and, as a result, could be subject to potentially
material liabilities relating to the investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties
and to claims alleging personal injury. We are required continually to conform our
operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all
countries as these requirements change. We have experienced, and expect to continue to
experience, modest costs relating to our compliance with environmental laws and
regulations. In connection with our acquisitions, we may assume significant environmental
liabilities, some of which we may not be aware of, or may not be quantifiable, at the time
of acquisition. In addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing
laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition
of new clean-up requirements could increase our environmental compliance costs or subject
us to new or increased liabilities.

Competition

Generally,
our products and solutions face significant competition, usually from a limited number of
competitors. We believe that we are a leader in most of our markets, and no single company
competes with us over a significant number of product lines. Competitors might be large or
small in size, often depending on the life cycle and maturity of the technology employed.
We compete primarily on product quality, performance, innovation, technology, price,
applications expertise, distribution channel access and customer service capabilities.

Patents and Trademarks

In
addition to trade secrets, unpatented know-how, and other intellectual property rights, we
own the rights under a number of patents, trademarks and copyrights relating to certain of
our products and businesses. We also employ various methods, including confidentiality and
non-disclosure agreements with employees, to protect our trade secrets and know-how. While
we believe that none of our operating units are substantially dependent on any single
patent, trademark, copyright, or other item of intellectual property or group of patents,
trademarks or copyrights, the product development and market activities of Compressor
Controls, Gatan, Neptune Technology and Roper Scientific, in particular, have been planned
and conducted in conjunction with continuing patent strategies. Our recent TransCore
acquisition has developed a portfolio of RFID and satellite-based communication products,
supported by over 100 patents. While we have not significantly licensed patents,
trademarks, trade secrets and similar proprietary rights to and from third parties in the
past, we may do so in the future.

Employees

As
of December 31, 2004, we had approximately 5,600 total employees, of whom approximately
4,150 were located in the United States. Fewer than 50 of our employees are subject to
collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider
our relations with employees to be good.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

Roper’s
corporate offices, consisting of 13,800 square feet of leased space, are located near
Atlanta, Georgia. We have established manufacturing, sales and service locations around
the world to support our operations. The following table sets forth our principal

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We
are defendants in various lawsuits involving product liability, employment practices and
other matters, none of which we believe will have a material adverse effect on our
consolidated financial position or results of operations. The majority of such claims are
subject to insurance coverage.

We
and/or one of our subsidiaries are named as defendants, along with many other companies,
in asbestos-related personal injury or wrongful death actions. The allegations in these
actions are vague, general and speculative, and the actions are in their early stages.
Given the state of these claims, it is not possible to determine the potential liability,
if any.

ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

You should read the following
discussion in conjunction with “Selected Financial Data” and our Consolidated
Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. In August
2003, we changed our fiscal year-end from October 31 to December 31 effective as of
January 1, 2003, with the two months ended December 31, 2002 being the Transition Period.

Overview

We are a diversified industrial
company that designs, manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls, scientific
and industrial imaging products and software, industrial technology products,
instrumentation products and services and radio frequency identification and
satellite-based communication technologies and related services. We market these products
and services to selected segments of a broad range of markets including radio frequency
(RF) applications, water and wastewater, oil and gas, research, power generation, general
industry and 15 other niche markets.

We pursue consistent and sustainable
growth in earnings by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of
our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses. Our
acquisitions have represented both bolt-ons and new strategic platforms. We strive for
high cash and earnings returns from our acquisition investments. On June 7, 2004, we
purchased the power generation business of R/D Tech which was combined with our existing
Zetec business in the area of non-destructive evaluation. On December 13, 2004, we
acquired TransCore a provider of technologies and related services in areas such as radio
frequency identification (RFID), satellite-based communication, mobile asset tracking,
security applications and comprehensive toll system and processing services. In connection
with this acquisition we replaced our existing $625 million credit agreement, completed a
public offering of 5,000,000 shares of our common stock, and entered into an amended and
restated $1.055 billion credit agreement. An underwriters’ overallotment of 115,000
shares of our common stock was subsequently exercised and closed on December 28, 2004.

During the year ended December 31,
2004, our results of operations benefited from the NTGH acquisition made on December 29,
2003 and the partial year activities of the power generation business of R/D Tech
purchased on June 7, 2004.

During the Transition Period ended
December 31, 2002, we began reporting our operations under a new segment structure. This
structure includes four market-focused groups intended to capture value-creating
opportunities around common customers, market orientation, sales channels, technologies
and common cost opportunities.

Following the segment realignment, we
started a number of restructuring activities that were completed in the first quarter of
2004. During 2003, we completed the integration of our Acton Research and Integrated
Design business units, the integration of AI Qualitek into the Uson business unit, the
integration of production operations of our Redlake business unit into other Imaging
segment facilities and the relocation of Struers manufacturing, engineering and
administrative support into a new facility. In 2003 we also opened new production
facilities in Mexico and China. During 2004 we moved the U.S. production operations of the
Amot Controls business unit to other facilities and completed a restructuring of the
Compressor Controls business unit to adjust to lower levels of OAO Gazprom business. All
of these actions were planned to lower costs and enhance profit margins.

Application of Critical
Accounting Policies

Our Consolidated Financial Statements
are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States, or GAAP. A discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in
the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2004
included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

GAAP offers acceptable alternative
methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results, such as
determining inventory cost, depreciating long-lived assets, recognizing revenues and
issuing stock options to employees. We have not changed the application of acceptable
accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these
principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial
statements, except for the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or
SFAS, No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” as discussed below.

The preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments
and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental
disclosures.

The development of accounting
estimates is the responsibility of our management. Our management discusses those areas
that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors. The
audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the SEC.
Although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are
reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over
time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects
are accounted for prospectively.

Our most significant accounting
uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility,
inventory utilization, future warranty obligations, revenue recognition (percent of
completion), income taxes and goodwill and indefinite-lived asset analyses. These issues,
except for income taxes, which are not allocated to our business segments, affect each of
our business segments. These issues are evaluated primarily using a combination of
historical experience, current conditions and relatively short-term forecasting.

Accounts receivable collectibility is
based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after
shipment of products, including in certain cases credits for returned products. Accounts
receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed
upon terms, whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences, what historical
experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that current and
near-term forecast economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and
with specific customers. The returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to
determine likely future rates for such credits. At December 31, 2004, our allowance for
doubtful accounts receivable, sales returns and sales credits was $7.8 million, or 3.1% of
total gross accounts receivable. This percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the
underlying receivables and is not significantly different as a percent of sales as
compared to the December 31, 2003 level.

We regularly compare inventory
quantities on hand against anticipated future usage, which we determine as a function of
historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence
and excessive quantities. When we use historical usage, this information is also
qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using
historical information as an estimate of future usage. Business trends can change rapidly
and these events can affect the evaluation of inventory balances. At December 31, 2004,
inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were $25.6 million, or 16.1% of gross
first-in, first-out inventory cost. This percentage has decreased from 18.0% in the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2003. We expect this percentage to continue to decrease over time.

Most of our sales are covered by
warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying
defective items for a specified period after the time of sale, typically 12 months. Future
warranty obligations are evaluated using, among other factors, historical cost experience,
product evolution and customer feedback. At December 31, 2004, the reserve for future
warranty obligations was $6.4 million. Our expense for warranty obligations was less than
1% of net sales for each of the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2004, December 31,
2003, and October 31, 2002.

Revenues related to the use of the
percentage-of-completion method of accounting are dependent on a comparison of total costs
incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project. During the twelve month period
ended December 31, 2004, we recognized revenue of approximately $16.8 million using this
method, primarily for major turn-key, longer term energy projects. No material amount of
revenue was recognized using this method during the two month period ended December 31,
2002. Approximately $31.4 million and $2.4 million of revenue was recognized using this
method during the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 and October 31, 2002,
respectively. At December 31, 2004 approximately $58.3 million of revenue related to
unfinished percentage-of-completion contracts had yet to be recognized. Contracts
accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability
from revenues accounted for under other methods. We expect a significant increase in
revenue related to the use of percentage-of-completion accounting in 2005 as TransCore has
several longer term projects related to toll and traffic systems that require use of this
method.

Income taxes can be affected by
estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and how and
when cash is repatriated to the United States, combined with other aspects of an overall
income tax strategy. Additionally, taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with
our tax treatment of certain items, and some historical transactions have income tax
effects going forward. Accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using
current laws, rules and regulations, each of which can change at any time and in an
unpredictable manner. During 2004, our effective income tax rate was 29.8%, which included
a $0.9 million additional R&D credit, as compared to 27.5% for 2003. Our 2003 rate was
abnormally low due to the marginal rate impact in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 of
certain expenses related to the NTGH acquisition and related financing and the
demonstrated ability to avoid repatriation of certain foreign sourced earnings. We expect
our tax rate in 2005 to increase to approximately 32.5% due primarily to TransCore’s
higher effective rate.

We adopted SFAS No. 142 effective
November 1, 2001 – the beginning of our fiscal year ended October 31, 2002. The
evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets under SFAS 142 requires
valuations of each applicable underlying business. These valuations can be significantly
affected by estimates of future performance and discount rates over a relatively long
period of time, market price valuation multiples and marketplace transactions in related
markets. These estimates will likely change over time. Some of our businesses operate in
somewhat cyclical industries and the valuation of these businesses can be expected to
fluctuate as a result of this cyclicality. The transitional business valuation reviews
required by SFAS 142 indicated a reduction of the carrying value of goodwill for three
business units (Redlake, Petrotech and Dynamco). This goodwill reduction was reported as a
change in accounting principle retroactive to the beginning of our fiscal year ended
October 31, 2002 and resulted in a transitional charge to earnings of approximately $26
million. SFAS 142 requires goodwill to be evaluated annually. If this annual review
indicates further impairment of goodwill balances, that entire impairment will be recorded
immediately and reported as a component of current operations. Our annual reviews
undertaken during 2004 and 2003 did not indicate that any further impairment to the
goodwill balances was necessary. Our acquisitions have generally included a large goodwill
component and we expect this to continue with future acquisitions.

Prior to adopting SFAS 142, goodwill
was amortized over periods not exceeding 40 years. With the adoption of this standard,
goodwill is not amortized. It is periodically reviewed for impairment as discussed above.
We are unable to conclude whether the likelihood of any impairment charge resulting from
subsequent annual reviews is more likely in any business segment compared to another
segment.

Results of Operations

General

The following tables set forth
selected information for the years indicated. Dollar amounts are in thousands and
percentages are of net sales.

(1)

Includes results of NTGH acquisition from December 29, 2003.

(2)

Includes results of Zetec from August 2002, and the power generation business of R/D Tech from June 7, 2004.

(3)

Includes results of NTGH acquisition from December 29, 2003 and several smaller business acquired during the years presented.

(4)

Includes results of TransCore from December 13, 2004.

Year Ended December 31,
2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003

Net sales for the year ended December
31, 2004 were $969.8 million as compared to sales of $657.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003, an increase of 47.5%. This increase was the result of sales from
acquired companies and strong internal growth. Our 2004 results included a full year of
sales from the NTGH acquisition, six months of sales from the power generation business of
R/D Tech and two weeks of sales from the TransCore acquisition.

In our Instrumentation segment, net
sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased by $32.4 million or 17.9% over the
year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was attributable to improved distribution, new
product introductions, favorable market conditions, and changes in exchange rates.

Net sales for our Industrial
Technology segment increased by $226.3 million or 132.9% for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2004 over the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. The increase primarily
resulted from the NTGH acquisition, and also included stronger sales into industrial,
energy, and commercial refrigeration end markets.

In our Energy Systems and Controls
segment, net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 increased by $17.3
million or 12.4% over the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. The increase was due to
the partial-year impact of the power generation business of R/D Tech acquired in 2004 as
well as higher system and product sales of energy applications, substantially offset by lower
sales to Gazprom.

Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging
segment reported an increase in net sales of $21.2 million or 12.7% for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2004 over the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. The increase was
attributable to the full-year impact of NTGH acquired in 2003.

Our RF Technology segment was
established in the fourth quarter of 2004 with the acquisition of TransCore on December
13, 2004 and includes two weeks of sales in 2004.

Our overall gross profit percentage
was 50.0% for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to 52.7% for the year ended
December 31, 2003. Instrumentation segment gross margins decreased to 57.8% as compared to
58.3% in the prior year. The margins were impacted by increased sales of third party
sourced products that carried a lower gross profit margin, but good operating profit
margins. As expected, Industrial Technology gross margins decreased, to 42.6% as compared
to 45.6% in the prior year, because NTGH gross margins are lower than the segment average.
Our Energy Systems and Controls segment gross margins were 52.3% in 2004 as compared to
52.8% in 2003. This was due to a margin decrease in our turbomachinery controls business
offset by an increase in margins in our non-destructive testing business. Our Scientific
and Industrial Imaging segment gross margins were 55.7% in 2004 as compared to 53.6% in
2003. This increase is due to improved margins in our high-performance digital imaging
cameras and electron microscopes, much of which was achieved through the restructuring
efforts undertaken in 2003.

Selling, general and administrative
(SG&A) expenses decreased to 32.4% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2004
from 36.2% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease is due to
 leverage from higher sales levels and the
reductions in restructuring expenses that were incurred in the prior year. This was offset
with increased expenses related to compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

Interest expense increased $12.5
million, or 76.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2003, as a result of higher debt levels incurred due to the NTGH acquisition
in December 2003.

Income taxes were 29.8% of pretax
earnings in 2004 compared to 27.5% for 2003. Our 2003 rate was low due to the marginal
rate impact in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 of certain expenses related to the NTGH
acquisition and related financing. Our 2004 rate also included an additional $0.9 million
credit related to a R&D study completed during the year. We expect our tax rate in
2005 to increase to approximately 32.5% due primarily to TransCore’s higher effective
rate.

At December 31, 2004, the functional
currencies of our European subsidiaries were stronger against the U.S. dollar compared to
currency exchange rates at December 31, 2003. This strengthening resulted in an increase
in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $27.3 million in the twelve
month period ending December 31, 2004. Approximately $19.5 million of these adjustments
related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash
flows. 2004 operating earnings benefited 1.9% from stronger non-U.S. currencies. Foreign
exchange differences related to our other non-U.S. subsidiaries were immaterial to 2004
financial performance.

net sales order information for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 (dollar amounts
in thousands).

Instrumentation segment net orders
improved due to continued strength for oil and gas desulfurization applications and higher orders for our materials
analysis equipment. In addition, approximately 5.1% of the increase was due to the stronger European and Asian
 currencies against the dollar.  Industrial Technology segment net orders strengthened over all markets
from the prior year and also benefited from the orders for Neptune which were not included
in the prior year. Energy Systems and Controls net orders rose due to strength in the
non-destructive testing markets as well as the inclusion of the orders of the power
generation business of R/D Tech which is included for almost seven months of the current
year. In addition, there was continued strength in non-Gazprom oil and gas sectors, offset
by significantly lower Gazprom orders. Scientific and Industrial Imaging net orders
increased from strong orders for electron microscopy products.

The following table summarizes sales
order backlog information at December 31, 2004 and 2003 (dollar amounts in thousands).
Roper’s policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within
twelve months.

Year Ended December 31,
2003 Compared to Year Ended October 31, 2002

Net sales for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2003 were $657.4 million as compared to sales of $617.5 million for the
twelve months ended October 31, 2002, an increase of 6.5%. A significant part of the
increase was the full year impact of our fiscal 2002 acquisitions, Zetec, AI Qualitek and
QImaging. We had a significant decrease in sales to Gazprom ($33.7 million or 59.7%
decline from the prior period) as a result of the change in their procurement processes.
This significant decline was offset by sales increases in materials analysis equipment and
consumables, imaging sales into electron microscopy markets, water/wastewater projects and
other oil and gas sector sales.

In our Instrumentation segment, net
sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 increased by $5.8 million or 3.3% over
the twelve months ended October 31, 2002. The increase was attributable to the full-year
impact of AI Qualitek (acquired in fiscal 2002) and strong results from our European-based
Struers operation which was partially offset by continued depressed business conditions in
telecommunications markets.

Net sales for our Industrial
Technology segment increased by $6.2 million or 3.8% for the twelve months ended December
31, 2003 over the twelve months ended October 31, 2002. The increase was the result of
strength in our industrial pumps companies which experienced increased sales in the larger
municipal water/wastewater projects.

In our Energy Systems and Controls
segment, net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 increased by $12.3
million or 9.7% over the twelve months ended October 31, 2002. The increase was due to the
full-year impact of Zetec acquired in fiscal 2002, offset by the expected lower sales
levels to Gazprom. We also had improved sales of our machinery vibration sensor equipment
in the current twelve month period.

Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging
segment reported an increase in net sales of $15.6 million or 10.3% for the twelve months
ended December 31, 2003 over the twelve months ended October 31, 2002. The increase was
attributable to both the full-year impact of QImaging acquired in fiscal 2002 and the
increased sales for electron microscopy products.

Our overall gross profit percentage
was 52.7% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 as compared to 54.1% for the
twelve months ended October 31, 2002. Instrumentation segment gross margins were roughly
flat period over period at 58.3% as compared to 58.6%. Industrial Technology gross margins
decreased to 45.6% due to an erosion in part of our industrial valves and controls
business that was addressed by moving production to lower cost environments. Our Energy
Systems and Controls segment reported margins of 52.8% in fiscal 2003 as compared to 59.8%
in fiscal 2002. A decrease was expected this year from the full year inclusion of Zetec
whose gross margins are lower than the segment average. Additionally there were lower
margins from the significantly lower levels of Gazprom sales in this segment in the
current period. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment gross margins were 53.6% in
fiscal 2003 as compared to 52.3% in fiscal 2002 as we experienced a rebound in motion
imaging equipment sales and a higher percentage of the segment sales in higher margin
product.

Selling, general and administrative
(SG&A) expenses increased to 36.2% of net sales for the twelve months ended December
31, 2003 from 35.2% of net sales for the twelve months ended October 31, 2002, primarily
from $5.9 million of restructuring expenses (0.9% of net sales) incurred in the current
fiscal year to reduce excess manufacturing capacity, move certain operations to lower-cost
locations and reduce fixed costs.

Interest expense decreased $2.1
million, or 11.5%, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 compared to the twelve
months ended October 31, 2002, as a result of lower debt levels in the current period. The
company used its cash flows generated from operating activities to reduce debt levels
prior to the NTGH transaction.

Income taxes were 27.5% of pretax
earnings in fiscal 2003 compared to 31% in fiscal 2002. The primary factors for the
decrease were the marginal rate impact in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 of certain
expenses related to the NTGH acquisition and related financing transactions and the
demonstrated ability to avoid repatriation of certain foreign sourced earnings.

At December 31, 2003, the functional
currencies of our European subsidiaries were stronger against the U.S. dollar compared to
currency exchange rates at both October 31, 2002 and December 31, 2002. This strengthening
resulted in an increase in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of
$6.8 million in the two month period ending December 31, 2002 and of $36.3 million in the
twelve month period ending December 31, 2003. Approximately $33.6 million of these
adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected
future cash flows. Fiscal 2003 operating results also benefited from the stronger non-U.S.
currencies. The net benefits were approximately 2% of operating earnings. Foreign exchange
differences related to our other non-U.S. subsidiaries were immaterial to fiscal 2003
financial performance.

The following table summarizes our
net sales order information for the years ended December 31, 2003 and October 31, 2002
(dollar amounts in thousands).

Instrumentation segment net orders
improved due to the full year bookings of AI Qualitek, continued strength for oil and gas
desulfurization applications and higher orders for our materials analysis equipment.
Industrial Technology segment net orders strengthened over most markets after a soft
fiscal 2002. Energy Systems and Controls net orders rose on the strength of a full year of
Zetec orders and strength in non-Gazprom oil and gas sectors, offset by significantly
lower Gazprom orders. Scientific and Industrial Imaging net orders benefited from the full
year of QImaging orders offset by the timing of orders for electron microscopy products
(sales increased in the period) and weaker research market demand for high-end digital
cameras.

The increase in backlog was primarily
due to the inclusion of the NTGH entities at December 31, 2003. The decline in the
Instrumentation backlog is the result of continued softness in our telecommunications
business.

Two Months Ended
December 31, 2002 Compared to Two Months Ended December 31, 2001

Net sales for the two month period
ended December 31, 2002 were $83.9 million as compared to $86.9 million in the two month
period ended December 31, 2001. This decrease was primarily attributable to lower sales to
Gazprom and the absence of motion imaging sales in the Scientific and Industrial Imaging
segment, partially offset by the contributions from our fiscal 2002 acquisitions.

In our Instrumentation segment, net
sales decreased by 7.2% as compared to the prior-year period primarily as a result of
surplus used equipment flooding the weak telecommunications capital equipment markets for
our Logitech unit and lower capital spending in the semi-conductor market. Elsewhere
softness in oil & gas refinery capital spending offset the benefits of the AI Qualitek
acquisition. Gross margins moved from 61.7% in the prior year period to 57.7% in the
current period largely from the adverse leverage at our Logitech unit and semi-conductor
businesses. SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales were 2.4% higher at 41.8% due to
lower sales volume explained above and higher medical insurance expenditures. Overall the
segment reported operating profit margins of 15.9% as compared to 22.3% in the prior-year
period.

In our Industrial Technology segment,
net sales were comparable to the same period in 2001. Gross margins decreased to 43.9% in
the period from 45.0% in the prior-year; however, SG&A expenses as a percentage of
sales were 1.1% lower at 29.5% offsetting the reduction in gross margin allowing the
operating profit margin to remain constant at 14.4%. The lower SG&A expense level is
primarily the result of headcount reductions.

Net sales in our Energy Systems &
Controls segment increased by 19.5% during the two months ended December 31, 2002 as sales
contributed by Zetec and higher control systems sales to oil and gas customers more than
offset the lower sales to Gazprom. Gross margins decreased from 40.7% to 38.7% as a result
of the adverse sales leverage from the deferred Gazprom sales and the seasonal low sales
at Zetec with reduced power generation inspection activity during the peak heating season.
This adverse leverage also resulted in an increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of
sales from 48.0% in the prior-year period to 59.9% in the current year period. As a
result, operating losses increased from 7.3% in the prior-year period to 21.2%. Management
does not anticipate that the confluence of these events giving rise to such operating
margins will recur in the future.

Our Scientific & Industrial
Imaging segment net sales decreased by 12.0% due primarily to the absence of motion
imaging product sales which was partially offset by net sales contributed by the
contributions from the QImaging and Definitive Imaging acquisitions. Gross margins
decreased from 51.3% in 2002 to 50.6% due to the increased manufacturing costs in the
period for TEM imaging equipment. SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales increased to
45.0% in the period from 35.6% in the prior-year period as a result of additional costs
associated with the development of the new motion imaging products and additional costs
associated with foreign sales subsidiaries. Overall, the segment reported operating
profits margins of 5.6% as compared to 15.7% with the bulk of the decline attributable to
the repositioning of our motion imaging business.

Corporate expenses decreased by $1.0
million and reduced as a percentage of sales from 2.9% to 1.9% due primarily to reduced
variable compensation costs.

Interest expense held constant at
$2.9 million for the two month period ended December 31, 2002 compared to the two month
period ended December 31, 2001, as lower effective interest rates offset increased
borrowing levels.

Other income was $0.2 million in the
two month period ended December 31, 2002 as compared to $0.7 million in the equivalent
prior-year period from reduced realized foreign exchange gains.

Income taxes were 30.0% of pretax
earnings in the current year period as compared to 35.0% in the equivalent prior-year
period principally driven by improved expectations for our utilization of all available
foreign income tax credits.

At December 31, 2002, the functional
currencies of our European subsidiaries were stronger against the U.S. dollar compared to
currency exchange rates at October 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001. This strengthening
resulted in a gain of $6.8 million in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive
earnings for the two month period ended December 31, 2002. Approximately $5.4 million of
the total adjustment related to goodwill and is not expected to directly affect our
expected future cash flows. Operating results in the two month period also benefited from
the weakening of the US dollar, primarily against the euro. The difference between the
operating results for these companies for the two month period ending December 31, 2002,
translated into U.S. dollars at average currency exchange rates experienced during the two
month period and these operating results translated into U.S. dollars at average currency
exchange rates experienced during the comparable two month period in 2001 was not
material. If the impact of selling European sourced product in the U.S. is also
considered, the impact of currency movements was negligible.

Net orders, booked for continuing
operations, were $95.3 million for the period, 8% higher than the same period of 2001 net
order intake of $88.0 million. This increase was due to the additional net orders booked
of $10.6 million from our fiscal 2002 acquisitions, which was somewhat offset by delays in
blanket order releases and other industrial market softness for our Industrial Technology
segment. Overall, our order backlog at December 31, 2002 increased by $6.6 million as
compared to December 31, 2001. This increase was due to new acquisitions having $6.9
million in backlog at December 31, 2002, partially offset by softness in the Industrial
Technology segment.

Financial Condition,
Liquidity and Capital Resources

Net cash provided by operating
activities was $164.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, $71.3 million
for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, and $86.8 million for the twelve months
ended October 31, 2002. 2003 results include a $24.4 million write-off of debt extinguishment
costs related to the recapitalization of the Company.  The increase in 2004 over 2003 reflected stronger earnings from
operations due to the inclusion of NTGH in 2004, strong internal growth, the non-recurrence of debt extinguishment cash cost
 and low cash tax
payments due to the utilization of certain domestic net operating losses for tax purposes.
Cash flows used in investing activities during each of fiscal 2004, 2003, and 2002 were
primarily business acquisition costs. Cash flows from financing activities during each of
these years were largely debt repayments and borrowings for acquisitions. Financing
activities in 2004 also included amending and restating our previous $625 million credit
agreement with our current $1.055 billion credit agreement to increase capacity, lower
borrowing costs, and improve other terms and conditions.

Net working capital (current assets,
excluding cash, less total current liabilities, excluding debt) was $209.7 million at
December 31, 2004 compared to $170.4 million at December 31, 2003. We acquired
approximately $53.2 million of net current assets through business acquisitions during
2004.

Total debt was $891.9 million at
December 31, 2004 (44.4% of total capital) compared to $651.1 million at December 31, 2003
(49.8% of total capital). Our increased debt at December 31, 2004 compared to December 31,
2003 was due to borrowings incurred at the end of the current year to fund the TransCore
acquisition and replace the previous credit facility.

Our $1.055 billion credit facility
consists of a $655 million term loan and a $400 million revolving loan, both with five
year maturities. At December 31, 2004, our debt consisted of $230 million in senior
subordinated convertible notes due in 2034, and the $655 million term loan. The Company
had $47.3 million of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2004. $45 million of
the letters of credit were issued via the revolving loan, thereby reducing its remaining
capacity to $355 million. We expect that our available borrowing capacity, combined with
existing cash balances and cash flows expected to be generated from existing businesses,
will be sufficient to fund normal operating requirements and finance additional
acquisitions. We also have several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the
issuance of letters of credit in various foreign locations to support our non-U.S.
businesses. In total, these smaller facilities do not represent a significant source of
credit for us.

We were in compliance with all debt
covenants related to our credit facilities throughout the year ended December 31, 2004.

Capital expenditures of $12.1
million, $10.4 million and $7.7 million were incurred during 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. We expect capital expenditures in 2005 to be slightly higher due to the
higher capital expenditure requirements of the newly acquired TransCore business.

Description of Certain
Indebtedness

Senior Secured Credit
Facility

Concurrently with the closing of the
TransCore acquisition and the common stock and debt offerings in December 2004, we entered
into a $1.055 billion senior secured credit facility. This credit facility consists of a
five-year $655 million term loan and a five-year $400 million revolving loan.

Our credit facility requires us to
prepay the term loan and, in certain cases, reduce the commitments under the revolving
loan, upon the receipt of certain proceeds, including from certain asset sales, the
incurrence of certain debt, and up to 75% of our excess cash flows unless we meet a
consolidated total leverage ratio test. We are also required to make quarterly principal
payments on the term loans. The facility contains various affirmative and negative
covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur new debt, prepay
subordinated debt, make certain investments and acquisitions, sell assets and grant liens,
make restricted payments (including the payment of dividends on our common stock) and
capital expenditures, or change our line of business. We also are subject to financial
covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain
a consolidated interest coverage ratio.

Senior Subordinated
Convertible Notes

In December 2003, we issued $230
million of senior subordinated convertible notes at an original issue discount of 60.498%,
resulting in an effective yield of 3.75% per year to maturity. Interest on the notes is
payable semiannually, beginning July 15, 2004, until January 15, 2009. After
that date, we will not pay cash interest on the notes prior to maturity unless contingent
cash interest becomes payable. Instead, after January 15, 2009, interest will be
recognized at the effective rate of 3.75% and will represent accrual of original issue
discount, excluding any contingent cash interest that may become payable. We will pay
contingent cash interest to the holders of the notes during any six month period
commencing after January 15, 2009 if the average trading price of a note for a five
trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals 120%
or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and accrued cash
interest, if any, for such note. The contingent cash interest payable per note in respect
of any six month period will equal the annual rate of 0.25%.

The notes are unsecured senior
subordinated obligations, rank junior to our existing and future senior secured
indebtedness and rank equally with our existing and future senior subordinated
indebtedness.

As originally issued, each $1,000 principal amount of the notes will be
convertible at the option of the holder into 6.211 shares of our common stock (subject to
adjustment), if (i) the sale price of our common stock reaches, or the trading price of
the notes falls below, specified thresholds, (ii) if the notes are called for redemption
or (iii) if specified corporate transactions have occurred. Upon conversion, we will have
the right to deliver, in lieu of common stock, cash or a combination of cash and common
stock. On November 19, 2004, the Company began a consent solicitation to amend the notes
such that the Company would pay the same conversion value upon conversion of the Notes,
but would change how the conversion value is paid. In lieu of receiving exclusively shares
of common stock or cash upon conversion, noteholders would receive cash up to the value of
the accreted principal amount of the Notes converted and, at the Company’s option,
any remainder of the conversion value would be paid in cash or shares of common stock. The
consent solicitation was successfully completed on December 6, 2004 and the amended
conversion provisions were adopted.

Holders may require us to purchase
all or a portion of their notes on January 15, 2009, January 15, 2014,
January 15, 2019, January 15, 2024, and January 15, 2029, at stated prices
plus accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any. We may
only pay the purchase price of such notes in cash and not in common stock.

We may redeem for cash all or a
portion of the notes for cash at any time on or after January 15, 2009 at redemption
prices equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount and
accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any, on such notes
to the applicable redemption date.

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, we did
not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as
entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would
have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or
other contractually narrow or limited purposes.

We believe that internally generated
cash flows and the remaining availability under our various credit facilities will be
adequate to finance normal operating requirements and further acquisition activities.
Although we maintain an active acquisition program, any further acquisitions will be
dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any
such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities, financial
condition and results of operations. We may also explore alternatives to attract
additional capital resources.

We anticipate that our recently
acquired businesses as well as our other businesses will generate positive cash flows from
operating activities, and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently
outstanding debt at a high rate. However, the rate at which we can reduce our debt during
2005 (and reduce the associated interest expense) will be affected by, among other things,
the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial
performance of our existing companies. None of these factors can be predicted with
certainty.

Recently Issued
Accounting Standards

In January 2004, the FASB issued FASB
Staff Position No. FAS 106-1 (“FSP 106-1”) “Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act
of 2003,” which provides temporary guidance concerning the recently enacted Medicare
Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. SFAS No. 106,
“Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions,”
requires presently enacted changes in laws that will take effect in future periods to be
taken into account in measuring current period postretirement benefit cost and the
accumulated projected benefit obligation. The implementation of FSP 106-1 had no material
impact on the Company.

The Emerging Issues Task Force issued
EITF 03-6, “Participating Securities and the Two-Class Method under FASB Statement
No. 128, Earnings per Share,” effective for periods ending after March 31, 2004,
regarding the computation of earnings per share by companies that have issued securities
other than common stock that contractually entitle the holder to participate in dividends
and earnings of the company when, and if, it declares dividends on its common stock. The
Company does not have securities subject to the provisions of EITF 03-6 and, as such, the
implementation of EITF 03-6 had no material impact on the Company’s financial
statements.

The EITF reached final consensus on
EITF 04-8, “The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per
Share,” which would require convertible debt with a market price contingency to be
included in diluted EPS calculations. The consensus should be applied to reporting periods
ending after December 15, 2004. During December 2004, management completed a consent
solicitation to modify the conversion provisions on the company’s convertible notes
with the effect that they will not be required to be included in diluted EPS calculations
pursuant to EITF 04-8.

In November 2004, the FASB issued FAS
151, “Inventory Costs-An Amendment of ARB No. 43” to clarify the accounting for
abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and material waste.
The standard requires that abnormal amounts of these items be recognized as current period
charges. FAS 151 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The
implementation of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the
Company’s Financial Statements.

In December, 2004, the FASB issued
FAS 123R, “Share-Based Payment” (revised 2004) effective for interim or annual
reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2005. This standard requires unvested equity
awards outstanding at the effective date to continue to be measured and charged to expense
over the remaining requisite service (vesting) period as required by FAS 123. The Company
will implement this standard effective July 1, 2005 and is currently evaluating the impact
of this statement.

The FASB issued FSP 109-1 and 109-2
related to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. FSP 109-1 provides guidance related to
the accounting for special tax deductions on “qualified production activities
income” FSP 109-2 provides companies with additional time to complete assessment of
repatriation plans related to the one time deduction on certain repatriated foreign
earnings as provided in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The FSPs were effective
upon issuance on December 21, 2004. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the
new FSPs.

Information About
Forward Looking Statements

This Annual Report includes and
incorporates by reference “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the
federal securities laws. In addition, we, or our executive officers on our behalf, may
from time to time make forward-looking statements in reports and other documents we file
with the SEC or in connection with oral statements made to the press, potential investors
or others. All statements that are not historical facts are “forward-looking
statements.” The words “estimate,” “project,” “intend,”
“expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” and similar expressions
identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include statements
regarding our expected financial position, business, financing plans, business strategy,
business prospects, revenues, working capital, liquidity, capital needs, interest costs
and income, in each case relating to our company as a whole, as well as statements
regarding acquisitions, potential acquisitions and the benefits of acquisitions, including
with respect to the TransCore acquisition.

Forward-looking statements are
estimates and projections reflecting our best judgment and involve a number of risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by
the forward-looking statements. These statements are based on our management’s
beliefs and assumptions, which in turn are based on currently available information.
Examples of forward looking statements in this report include but are not limited to our
expectations regarding our ability to generate operating cash flows and reduce debt and
associated interest expense and our expectations regarding growth through acquisitions.
Important assumptions relating to the forward-looking statements include, among others,
assumptions regarding demand for our products, the cost, timing and success of product
upgrades and new product introductions, raw materials costs, expected pricing levels, the
timing and cost of expected capital expenditures, expected outcomes of pending litigation,
competitive conditions, general economic conditions and expected synergies relating to
acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances. These assumptions could prove inaccurate.
Although we believe that the estimates and projections reflected in the forward-looking
statements are reasonable, our expectations may prove to be incorrect. Important factors
that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or projections
contained in the forward-looking statements include:

our ability to integrate the TransCore acquisition businesses into our operations;

any unforeseen liabilities associated with the TransCore businesses or future acquisitions;

limitations on our business imposed by our indebtedness;

reductions in our business with Gazprom;

the success of our restructuring activities in reducing costs;

unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates;

difficulties associated with exports;

risks and costs associated with our international sales and operations;

difficulty making acquisitions and successfully integrating acquired businesses;

increased directors and officers liability and other insurance costs;

risk of rising interest rates;

product liability and insurance risks;

increased warranty exposure;

future competition;

the cyclical nature of our markets;

reduction  of business with large customers;

risks associated with government contracts;

changes in the supply of, or price for, parts and components;

environmental compliance costs and liabilities;

risks and costs associated with asbestos-related litigation;

potential write-offs of our substantial intangible assets;

our ability to successfully develop new products;

failure to protect our technology;

trade tariffs that may be applied due to the U.S. government’s delay in complying with certain WTO directives;

terrorist attacks;

future health crises; and

the factors discussed in Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report under the heading “Risk
Factors.”

We
believe these forward-looking statements are reasonable. However, you should not place
undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations.
Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we
undertake no obligation to update publicly any of them in light of new information or
future events.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to interest rate risks
on our outstanding borrowings, and we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks on
our transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are also exposed
to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock.

At December 31, 2004, we had a
combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. Our $1.055 billion senior credit
facility contains $655 million variable rate term notes and a $400 million variable rate
revolver. To reduce the financial risk of future rate increases, the Company entered into
fixed rate swap agreements, including a $100 million agreement expiring January 6, 2006,
and, subsequent to year end, a $250 million agreement expiring March 13, 2008. Our $230
million senior unsecured convertible notes have a fixed interest rate. At December 31,
2004, there was no material difference between prevailing market rates and the fixed rate
on our debt instruments.

At December 31, 2004, Roper’s
outstanding variable-rate borrowings under the $1.055 billion credit facility were $555
million. An increase in interest rates of 1% would increase our annualized interest costs
by $5.6 million (before accounting for the $250 million fixed rate swap agreement which we
entered into subsequent to year end).

Several Roper companies have
transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of
these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, British pounds, Danish krone or
Japanese yen. Sales by companies whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar were
36% of our total sales and 77% of these sales were by companies with a European functional
currency. The U.S. dollar weakened against these European currencies during 2004 and was
relatively stable compared to other currencies. The difference between 2004 operating
results for these companies translated into U.S. dollars during 2004 and these operating
results translated into U.S. dollars during 2003 was not material. If these currency
exchange rates had been 10% different throughout 2004 compared to currency exchange rates
actually experienced, the impact on our expected net earnings would have been
approximately $2.9 million.

The changes in these currency
exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar during 2004 compared to currency exchange rates
at December 31, 2003 resulted in an increase in net assets of $27.3 million that was
reported as a component of comprehensive earnings, $19.5 million of which was attributed
to goodwill. Goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect
our reported earnings or cash flows.

The trading price of Roper’s
common stock influences the valuation of stock option grants and the effects these grants
have on pro forma earnings disclosed in our financial statements. The stock prices also
influence the computation of the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options to determine
diluted earnings per share. The stock price also affects our employees’ perceptions
of various programs that involve our common stock. We believe the quantification of the
effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily
determinable.

STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

Index

Report of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders

of Roper
Industries, Inc.:

We have completed an integrated audit
of Roper Industries, Inc.‘s 2004 consolidated financial statements and of its
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 and audits of its 2003
and 2002 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are
presented below.

Consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule

In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Roper Industries, Inc. and its
subsidiaries (the “Company”) at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the twelve months ended December 31,
2004, December 31, 2003 and October 31, 2002 and the two month period ended December 31,
2002 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in Item 15
(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when
read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial
statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

Internal control over
financial reporting

Also, in our opinion,
management’s assessment, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 based on criteria
established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in

Internal Control –
Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s management is responsible
for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is
to express opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted
our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An
audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls, and
performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As described in Scope of
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item
9A, management has excluded R/D Tech and TransCore Holdings, Inc. from its assessment of
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 because they were
acquired by the Company in purchase business combinations during 2004. We have also
excluded R/D Tech and TransCore Holdings, Inc. from our audit of internal control over
financial reporting. R/D Tech and TransCore Holdings, Inc. are wholly-owned subsidiaries
whose total assets represent 2% and 30%, respectively, and whose total revenues represent
1% and 2%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Summary of Accounting Policies

Basis
of Presentation

– These financial statements present consolidated information
for Roper Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Roper” or the “Company”).
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Nature
of the Business

– Roper is a diversified industrial company that designs,
manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls, scientific and industrial
imaging products and software, industrial technology products and instrumentation and RF
products and services. We market these products and services to selected segments of a
broad range of markets, including radio frequency (RF) applications, water and
wastewater, oil and gas, research, power generation, general industry, and fifteen other
niche markets.

Discontinued
Operations

– During the first quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company decided to
offer for sale the Petrotech operation. The accompanying financial statements have been
restated to conform to discontinued operations treatment for all periods presented. See
footnote 15 for additional disclosure.

Accounts
Receivable

— Accounts receivable were stated net of an allowance for doubtful
accounts of $7,838,000 and $4,498,000 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Outstanding accounts receivable balances are reviewed periodically, and allowances are
provided at such time that management believes reasonable doubt exists that such balances
will be collected within a reasonable period of time.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

— Roper considers highly liquid financial instruments with
remaining maturities at acquisition of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At
December 31, 2004 had $44.0 million in cash equivalents, and none at December 31, 2003.

Earnings
per Share

– Basic earnings per share were calculated using net earnings and the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the respective year.
Diluted earnings per share were calculated using net earnings and the weighted average
number of shares of common stock and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during
the respective year. Common stock equivalents consisted of stock options, and the effects
of common stock equivalents were determined using the treasury stock method.

As
of and for the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the two month
period ended December 31, 2002, and the twelve month periods ended October 31, 2002,
there were 81,000, 634,000, 672,000 and 345,000 outstanding stock options that were not
included in the determination of diluted earnings per share because doing so would have
been antidilutive.

Estimates

– The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

— Roper’s long-term debt at December 31,
2004 included $230 million of fixed-rate term notes which were not materially different
than prevailing market rates. Most of Roper’s other borrowings at December 31, 2004
were at various interest rates that adjust relatively frequently under its $1.055 billion
credit facility. The fair value for each of these borrowings at December 31, 2004 was
estimated to be the face value of these borrowings.

Foreign
Currency Translation

— Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries whose functional
currency is not the U.S. dollar were translated at the exchange rate in effect at the
balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses were translated at average exchange rates
for the period in which those entities were included in Roper’s financial results.
Translation adjustments are reflected as a component of other comprehensive earnings.

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets

– The Company determines whether there has been an
impairment of long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and identifiable intangible assets
that are determined to have indefinite useful economic lives, when certain indicators of
impairment are present. In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the cost
of any long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability would be
performed. If an evaluation is required, the estimated future gross, undiscounted cash
flows associated with the asset would be compared to the asset’s carrying amount to
determine if a write-down to market value is required. Future adverse changes in market
conditions or poor operating results of underlying long-lived assets could result in
losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the long-lived assets that may
not be reflected in the assets’ current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring
an impairment charge in the future.

Income
Taxes

– Roper is a U.S.-based multinational company and the calculation of its
worldwide provision for income taxes requires analysis of many factors, including income
tax structures that vary from country to country, and the United States’ treatment
of non-U.S. earnings. Roper has provided for U.S. income taxes for deferred taxes on
undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries that are not expected to be permanently
reinvested in such companies. There has been no provision for U.S. income taxes for the
remaining undistributed earnings of approximately $30.5 million at December 31, 2004,
because Roper intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in operations outside the
United States. If such earnings were distributed, incremental U.S. taxes of approximately
$10.7 million would accrue after utilization of U.S. tax credits.

Certain
assets and liabilities have different bases for financial reporting and income tax
purposes. Deferred income taxes have been provided for these differences.

Goodwill
and Other Intangibles

– Prior to Roper’s adoption of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS
142”), goodwill was amortized on a straight-line basis over periods that ranged from
5 to 40 years. Roper accounts for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the
excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired. Business combinations can
also result in other intangible assets being recognized. Amortization of intangible
assets, if applicable, occurs over their estimated useful lives. SFAS 142 requires
companies to cease amortizing goodwill that existed at June 30, 2001 and establishes a
two-step method for testing goodwill for impairment on an annual basis (or an interim
basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its
carrying value). Roper conducts this review for all of its reporting units during the
fourth quarter of the fiscal year. The transitional impairment that resulted from Roper’s
adoption of this standard on November 1, 2002 has been reported as a change in accounting
principle – see Note 5. No impairment resulted from the annual review performed in
2004. SFAS 142 also requires that an identifiable intangible asset that is determined to
have an indefinite useful economic life not be amortized, but separately tested for
impairment using a one-step fair value based approach. Total goodwill includes 21
different business units with individual amounts ranging from less than $1 million to
approximately $383 million.

Inventories

— Inventories
are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using either the first-in,
first-out method or the last-in, first-out method (“LIFO”). Inventories valued
at LIFO cost comprised 8% and 9% of consolidated inventories at December 31, 2004
and 2003, respectively. There were no LIFO decrements recorded during any of the periods
ended December 31, 2004.

Other
Comprehensive Earnings

– Comprehensive earnings includes net earnings and all
other non-owner sources of changes in a company’s net assets. The differences
between net earnings and comprehensive earnings for Roper during the twelve month periods
ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the two month period ended December 31, 2002, and the
twelve month period ended October 31, 2002 were currency translation adjustments. Income
taxes have not been provided on currency translation adjustments.

Property,
Plant and Equipment and Depreciation and Amortization

— Property, plant and
equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation
and amortization are provided for using principally the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

Buildings

20-30 years

Machinery

8-12 years

Other equipment

3-5 years

Capitalized
Software

– Effective January 1, 1999, the Company adopted Statement of Position (“SOP”)
98-1, “Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for
Internal Use.” Among other provisions, SOP 98-1 requires that entities capitalize
certain internal-use software costs once certain criteria are met. Under SOP 98-1,
overhead, general and administrative and training costs are not capitalized.

Recently
Released Accounting Pronouncements

— In January 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff
Position No. FAS 106-1 (“FSP 106-1”) “Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act
of 2003,” which provides temporary guidance concerning the recently enacted Medicare
Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. SFAS No. 106, “Employers’ Accounting
for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions,”requires presently enacted changes
in laws that will take effect in future periods to be taken into account in measuring
current period postretirement benefit cost and the accumulated projected benefit
obligation. The implementation of FSP 106-1 had no material impact on the Company.

The
Emerging Issues Task Force issued EITF 03-6, “Participating Securities and the
Two-Class Method under FASB Statement No. 128, Earnings per Share,” effective for
periods ending after March 31, 2004, regarding the computation of earnings per share by
companies that have issued securities other than common stock that contractually entitle
the holder to participate in dividends and earnings of the company when, and if, it
declares dividends on its common stock. The Company does not have securities subject to
the provisions of EITF 03-6 and, as such, the implementation of EITF 03-6 had no material
impact on the Company’s financial statements.

The
EITF reached final consensus on EITF 04-8, “The Effect of Contingently Convertible
Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share,” which would require convertible debt with a
market price contingency to be included in diluted EPS calculations. The consensus should
be applied to reporting periods ending after December 15, 2004. During December 2004,
management completed a consent solicitation to modify the conversion provisions on the
company’s convertible notes with the effect that they will not be required to be
included in diluted EPS calculations pursuant to EITF 04-8.

In
November 2004, the FASB issued FAS 151, “Inventory Costs-An Amendment of ARB No. 43” to
clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling
costs, and material waste. The standard requires that abnormal amounts of these items be
recognized as current period charges. FAS 151 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after June 15, 2005. The implementation of this standard is not expected to have a
material impact on the Company’s financial statements.

In
December, 2004, the FASB issued FAS 123R, “Share-Based Payment” (revised 2004)
effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2005. This
standard requires unvested equity awards outstanding at the effective date to continue to
be measured and charged to expense over the remaining requisite service (vesting) period
as required by FAS 123. The Company will implement this standard effective July 1, 2005
and is currently evaluating the impact of this statement.

The
FASB issued FSP 109-1 and 109-2 related to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. FSP
109-1 provides guidance related to the accounting for special tax deductions on “qualified
production activities income” FSP 109-2 provides companies with additional time to
complete assessment of repatriation plans related to the one time deduction on certain
repatriated foreign earnings as provided in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The
FSPs were effective upon issuance on December 21, 2004. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of the new FSPs.

Research
and Development

— Research and development costs include salaries and benefits,
rents, supplies, and other costs related to various products under development. Research
and development costs are expensed in the period incurred and totaled $38.7 million,
$32.6 million and $29.6 million for the 12 month periods ended December 31, 2004 and 2003
and October 31, 2002, respectively. Research and development costs for the two
months ended December 31, 2002 were $5.7 million.

Revenue
Recognition and Product Warranties

– The Company recognizes revenue when all of
the following criteria are met:

persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists

delivery has occurred or services have been rendered

the seller's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and

collectibility is reasonably assured.

In
addition, the Company recognizes revenue from the sale of product when title and risk of
loss pass to the customer, which is generally when product is shipped. The Company
recognizes revenue from services rendered upon customer acceptance. Revenues under
certain relatively long-term and relatively large-value construction projects are
recognized under the percentage-of-completion method using the ratio of costs incurred to
total estimated costs as the measure of performance. The Company recognized revenues of
approximately $16.8 million, $31.4 million and $2.4 million for the 12 month periods
ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, and October 31, 2002, respectively, using this
method. Estimated losses on any projects are recognized as soon as such losses become
known.

The
Company sells certain of its products to customers with a product warranty that provides
that customers can return a defective product during a specified warranty period
following the purchase in exchange for a replacement product, repair at no cost to the
customer or the issuance of a credit to the customer. The Company accrues its estimated
exposure to warranty claims based upon current and historical product sales date,
warranty costs incurred and any other related information known to the Company.

Stock-Based
Compensation

– Roper accounts for stock-based compensation under the provisions
of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 – “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees.” Stock-based compensation is measured at its fair value at the grant date
in accordance with an option-pricing model. SFAS 123 – “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation,” provides that the related expense may be recorded in the
basic financial statements or the pro forma effect on earnings may be disclosed in the
financial statements. Roper provides the pro forma disclosures.

Non-employee
directors of Roper are eligible to receive stock options for its common stock. These
stock options are accounted for the same as stock options granted to employees. Roper has
never issued stock options other than those issued to employees or its non-employee
directors.

Roper
has two stock incentive plans (the “1991 Plan” and the “2000 Plan”)
which authorize the issuance of shares of common stock to certain directors, key
employees, and consultants of Roper as incentive and/or nonqualified stock options,
restricted stock, stock appreciation rights or equivalent instruments. Stock options
under both plans are typically granted at prices not less than 100% of market value of
the underlying stock at the date of grant. Stock options typically vest over a period of
up to five years. Options may no longer be granted under the 1991 Plan. A total of
2,500,000 shares have been reserved in the 2000 Plan for issuance as incentive equity
stock awards. The 2000 Plan has no expiration date for the granting of options and had
the capacity to grant an additional 932,000 and 1,677,000 options or equivalent
instruments at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Roper
also has a stock compensation plan for non-employee directors (the “Non-employee
Director Plan”). In 2003 and 2004, the Plan provided 2,000 restricted or deferred
stock awards to each non-employee director. The restrictions on 50% of the restricted and
deferred stock awards lapse upon continuous service for six months following the grant,
and the restrictions on the remaining 50% lapse upon continuous service for one year
following the award. In prior years, the Non-employee Director Plan provided for each
non-employee director appointed or elected to the Board initial options to purchase 4,000
shares of Roper’s common stock and thereafter options to purchase an additional
4,000 shares each year under terms and conditions similar to the above-mentioned stock
option plans, except that following their grant, all options become fully vested at the
time of the Annual Meeting of Shareholders following the grant date and are exercisable
ratably over five years following the date of grant. Stock options expire ten years from
the date of grant. At December 31, 2004, and 2003, respectively, the Non-Employee
Director Plan had the capacity to grant an additional 45,000 and 64,000 options or grants.

A
summary of stock option transactions under these plans and information about stock
options outstanding at December 31, 2004 are shown below:

All
stock options granted during the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2004 and 2003,
the two month period ended December 31, 2002, and the twelve month period ended October
31, 2002 were at exercise prices equal to the market price of Roper’s common stock
when granted except for stock options related to the acquisition of TransCore that had a
strike price below the market price at date of issuance to replace options held by
certain TransCore employees.

Business Acquisitions

On
December 13, 2004, the Company acquired all the outstanding shares of TransCore Holdings,
Inc. (“TransCore”), a leader in tolling and traffic management systems.
TransCore’s principal facilities are located in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Dallas,
Texas, Albuquerque, New Mexico, Portland, Oregon and Mississauga, Ontario. The operations
of TransCore will be reported in the new RF Technology segment. There were only 18 days
of sales related to TransCore in our results for 2004.

The
aggregate gross purchase price of the TransCore acquisition was approximately $608 million of
cash and includes amounts incurred for due diligence and other direct external costs
associated with the acquisition.

The
following table (in thousands) summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition. The allocation includes
estimates that were not finalized at December 31, 2004. Purchase price adjustments
following the closing are also customary. The adjustments that were pending at December
31, 2004 were not significant.

Of
the $193.0 million of acquired intangible assets, $40 million was assigned to trade names
that are not subject to amortization. The remaining $153 million of acquired intangible
assets have a weighted-average useful life of approximately 10 years. The intangible
assets that make up that amount include customer relationships of $106 million (11 year
weighted-average useful life), technology of $27 million (10 year weighted-average useful
life), backlog of $13 million (4 year weighted-average useful life) and other of $7
million (9 year weighted-average useful life).

The
majority of the $383 million of goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax
purposes.

future results.

On
June 7, 2004, the Company purchased the assets of the power generation business of R/D
Tech which became part of our Zetec business unit which supplies non-destructive
evaluation testing, primarily for use in power generating facilities. These operations
are included in the Energy Systems and Controls segment of the business. The aggregate
purchase price of the acquisition was $39.9 million of cash and includes amounts paid to
sellers, amounts incurred for due diligence and other direct external costs associated
with the acquisition. The total assets acquired was $43.2 million, which includes $27.4
million of goodwill and the liabilities assumed were $3.3 million.

On
December 29, 2003, the company acquired all the outstanding shares of Neptune Technology
Group Holdings, Inc. (“NTGH”), a leader in the water management market. In
connection with our acquisition of NTGH, we also purchased the remaining one-third
interest in DAP Technologies, a Canadian company that manufactures fully-rugged handheld
computers, that NTGH did not own. NTGH’s principal facilities are located in
Tallassee, Alabama, Mississauga, Ontario and Quebec City, Quebec. The operations of NTGH
are reported in both the Industrial Technology and Scientific and Industrial Imaging
segments in 2004. There were no sales related to NTGH in our results for 2003.

The
aggregate purchase price of the NTGH acquisition was approximately $482 million of cash
and includes amounts paid to sellers, amounts incurred for due diligence and other direct
external costs associated with the acquisition. We also paid approximately $9.1 million
for the remaining one-third interest in DAP Technologies consisting of cash consideration
of $7.5 million and 34,000 shares of our common stock.

The
following table (in thousands) summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition. The allocation includes
estimates that were not finalized at December 31, 2003. Purchase price adjustments
following the closing are also customary. The adjustments that were required in 2004
resulted in a decrease to goodwill of $751.

Of
the $261.1 million of acquired intangible assets, $35.9 million was assigned to trade
names that are not subject to amortization. The remaining $225.2 million of acquired
intangible assets have a weighted-average useful life of approximately 22 years. The
intangible assets that make up that amount include customer relationships of $206.2
million (23 year weighted-average useful life), technology of $10.0 million (10-year
weighted-average useful life), and software of $9.0 million (8-year weighted-average

On
July 31, 2002, the company acquired all the outstanding shares of Zetec, Inc. (“Zetec”).
Zetec supplies non-destructive inspection solutions using eddy current technology and
related consumables, primarily for use in power generating facilities and is included in
the Energy Systems and Controls segment of the business. Zetec’s principal facility
is located near Seattle, Washington. The results of Zetec’s operations have been
included in the Consolidated Financial Statements since the acquisition date. The
aggregate purchase price of the acquisition was $57.2 million of cash and includes
amounts paid to sellers, amounts incurred for due diligence and other direct external
costs associated with the acquisition.

Of
the $7.1 million of acquired intangible assets, $2.1 million was assigned to trade names
that are not subject to amortization. The remaining $5.0 million of acquired intangible
assets have a weighted-average useful life of approximately 6 years. The intangible
assets that make up that amount include trade secrets of $3.0 million (6 year
weighted-average useful life), technology of $1.8 million (5-year weighted-average useful
life), and patents of $0.2 million (15-year weighted-average useful life).

The
$40.6 million of goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

In
addition, in fiscal 2002, the company acquired the following four entities for a total
cost of $18.0 million, which was paid in cash:

•

Acquired in
August 2002, Quantitative Imaging Corporation, (QImaging), based in  Vancouver, Canada
provides innovative, high-performance digital cameras  for scientific and industrial
imaging applications, complementing Roper’s  digital imaging business within the
Scientific and Industrial Imaging  segment.

•

Acquired in
July 2002, AiCambridge Ltd. (“Qualitek”), based in Cambridge, England,  is a
designer and manufacturer of leak detection equipment and systems for  medical,
pharmaceutical, food, packaging and automotive industries,  primarily in Europe. It is
reported in our Instrumentation segment.

•

Acquired in
July 2002, Duncan Technologies, based in Sacramento, California, is an  innovative
designer and manufacturer of high-quality digital cameras for a  variety of markets
including machine vision, remote sensing and traffic  monitoring. It is reported in our
Scientific and Industrial Imaging  segment.

•

Acquired in
September 2002, Definitive Imaging, based in Cleveland, Ohio, provides  image analysis
software and specialized knowledge for metallographic and  science quality control. It is
reported in our Scientific and Industrial  Imaging segment.

Goodwill
recognized in those transactions amounted to $12.9 million and of that amount
approximately $0.8 million is expected to be fully deductible for tax purposes. The
intangible assets acquired in these transactions are being amortized over a life of 4 to
7 years.

The
deferred income tax balance sheet accounts arise from temporary differences between the
amount of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting and tax purposes.

Components
of the deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31 were as follows (in thousands):

On
December 31, 2004, Roper had $50 million of U.S. federal net operating loss
carryforwards, which will expire in future years, with the majority of the carryforwards
expiring in 2024. Additionally, Roper had foreign tax credit carryforwards and research
and development credit carryforwards. A substantial portion of these attributes were
acquired in acquisitions by the Company in 2003 and 2004. The utilization of these tax
attributes is subject to certain limitations imposed by Section 382 and 383 of the
Internal Revenue Code. Roper has not recognized a valuation allowance since management
has determined that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will
generate sufficient taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets.

On
October 22, 2004, the President of the United States signed the American Jobs Creation
Act of 2004 (the “Act”). The Act creates a temporary incentive for U.S.
corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent
dividend received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations.
The deduction is subject to a number of limitations and, as of today, uncertainty remains
as how to interpret numerous provisions of the Act. As such, we are not yet in a position
to decide on whether, and to what extent, we might repatriate foreign earnings that have
not yet been remitted to the U. S. Based on our analysis to date, however, it is
reasonably possible that we may repatriate some amount between $0 and $200 million. A
repatriation of foreign earnings under the Act could result in the recognition of a tax
benefit that could be as high as $12.5 million or could result in the recognition of
additional tax expense that could be as high as $8.5 million. We expect to be in a
position to finalize our assessment by June 30, 2005.

$

$

Our
principal $1.055 billion credit facility and our $230 million senior subordinated
convertible notes provide most of our daily external financing requirements. The credit
facility consists of a $655 million term loan and a $400 million revolving loan, both
maturing on December 13, 2009. The interest rate on the borrowings under the $1.055
billion credit facility is calculated based upon various recognized indices plus a margin
as defined in the credit agreement. The interest rate on our variable rate term loan at
December 31, 2004 was 3.72%. Our senior subordinated convertible notes are due in 2034.
At December 31, 2004, our debt consisted of the $230 million in senior subordinated
convertible notes and a $655 million term loan. The company also had $47.3 million of
outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2004. We expect that our available
additional borrowing capacity combined with the cash flows expected to be generated from
existing business will be sufficient to fund normal operating requirements and finance
some additional acquisitions. We also have several smaller facilities that allow for
borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in various foreign locations to support
our non-U.S. businesses. In total, these smaller facilities do not represent a
significant source of credit for us.

In
December 2004, the Company amended and restated its previous $625 million credit
agreement to the current $1.055 billion credit agreement to increase capacity, lower
borrowing costs, and improve other terms and conditions. Due to this amendment, the
Company incurred a $8.2 million non-cash debt extinguishment cost related to prepaid
financing costs for the previous credit agreement.

In
December 2003, we issued through a public offering $230 million of 3.75% subordinated
convertible notes due 2034 at an original issue discount of 60.498% (the “Convertible
Notes”). The Convertible Notes are subordinated in right of payment and collateral
to all of our existing and future senior debt. Interest on the notes is payable
semiannually, beginning July 15, 2004, until January 15, 2009. After that date,
we will not pay cash interest on the notes prior to maturity unless contingent cash
interest becomes payable. Instead, after January 15, 2009, interest will be
recognized at the effective rate of 3.75% and will represent accrual of original issue
discount, excluding any contingent cash interest that may become payable. We will pay
contingent cash interest to the holders of the notes during any six month period
commencing after January 15, 2009 if the average trading price of a note for a five
trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals 120%
or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and accrued cash
interest, if any, for such note. The contingent cash interest payable per note in respect
of any six month period will equal the annual rate of 0.25%. As originally issued,
holders could convert their notes into 6.211 shares of our common stock, subject to
adjustment, only (1) if the sale price of our common stock reaches, or the trading price
of the notes falls below, specified thresholds, (2) if the notes are called for
redemption, or (3) if specified corporate transactions have occurred. Upon conversion, we
would have the right to deliver, in lieu of our common stock, cash or common stock or a
combination of cash and common stock. On November 19, 2004, the Company began a consent
solicitation to amend the notes such that the Company would pay the same conversion value
upon conversion of the Notes, but would change how the conversion value is paid. In lieu
of receiving exclusively shares of common stock or cash upon conversion, noteholders
would receive cash up to the value of the accreted principal amount of the Notes
converted and, at the Company’s option, any remainder of the conversion value would
be paid in cash or shares of common stock. The consent solicitation was successfully
completed on December 6, 2004 and the amended conversion provisions were adopted. Holders
may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on January 15, 2009 at a price
of $395.02 per note, on January 15, 2014 at a price of $475.66 per note, on January 15,
2019 at a price of $572.76 per note, on January 15, 2024 at a price of $689.68 per note,
and on January 15, 2029 at a price of $830.47 per note, in each case plus accrued cash
interest, if any, and accrued contingent cash interest, if any. We may pay the purchase
price of such notes in cash and not in common stock. In addition, if we experience a
change in control, each holder may require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of
such holder’s notes at a price equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued
original issue discount for non-tax purposes, accrued cash interest, if any, and accrued
contingent cash interest, if any, to the date of purchase.

Our
credit facility requires us to prepay the term loan and, in certain cases, reduce the
commitments under the revolving loan, upon the receipt of certain proceeds, including
from certain asset sales, the incurrence of certain debt, and up to 75% of our excess
cash flows unless we meet a consolidated total leverage ratio test. We are also required
to make quarterly principal payments on the term loans.

The
facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants which, among other things,
limit our ability to incur new debt, prepay subordinated debt, make certain investments
and acquisitions, sell assets and grant liens, make restricted payments (including the
payment of dividends on our common stock) and capital expenditures, or change our line of
business. We also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our
consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio.

At
December 31, 2004, and 2003, management believes the Company was in compliance with its
restrictive covenants.

Retirement
and Other Benefit Plans

Roper
maintains four defined contribution retirement plans under the provisions of Section
401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code covering substantially all U.S. employees not subject
to collective bargaining agreements. Roper partially matches employee contributions. Its
costs related to these plans were $7,548,000, $5,156,000, $883,000, and $4,549,000 for
the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the two month period ended
December 31, 2002, and the twelve month period ended October 31, 2002, respectively.

Roper
also maintains various defined benefit retirement plans covering employees of non-U.S.
subsidiaries and a plan that supplements certain employees for the contribution ceiling
applicable to the Section 401(k) plans. The costs and accumulated benefit obligations
associated with each of these plans were not material.

Pursuant
to the fiscal 2002 Zetec acquisition, Roper agreed to assume a defined benefit pension
plan covering certain U.S. employees. Roper has obtained the necessary regulatory
approvals to terminate the plan and all plan assets were distributed during 2004.

All
U.S. and Canada employees are eligible to participate in Roper’s stock purchase plan
whereby they may designate up to 10% of eligible earnings to purchase Roper’s common
stock at a 10% discount to the average closing price of its common stock at the beginning
and end of a quarterly offering period. The common stock sold to the employees may be
either treasury stock, stock purchased on the open market, or newly issued shares. During
the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the twelve month period
ended October 31, 2002, participants of the employee stock purchase plan purchased
17,000, 11,000 and 11,000 shares, respectively, of Roper’s common stock for total
consideration of $826,000, $378,000 and $437,000, respectively. There were no purchases
during the two month period ended December 31, 2002. All of these shares were purchased
from Roper’s treasury shares.

(11)

Common
Stock Transactions

Roper’s
restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that each outstanding share of Roper’s
common stock entitles the holder thereof to five votes per share, except that holders of
outstanding shares with respect to which there has been a change in beneficial ownership
during the four years immediately preceding the applicable record date will be entitled
to one vote per share.

Roper
has a Shareholder Rights Plan whereby one Preferred Stock Purchase Right (a “Right”)
accompanies each outstanding share of common stock. Such Rights only become exercisable,
or transferable apart from the common stock, ten business days after a person or group
acquires various specified levels of beneficial ownership, with or without the Board’s
consent. Each Right may be exercised to acquire one one-thousandth of a newly issued
share of Roper’s Series A Preferred Stock, at an exercise price of $170, subject to
adjustment. Alternatively, upon the occurrence of certain specified events, the Rights
allow holders to purchase Roper’s common stock having a market value at such time of
twice the Right’s exercise price. The Rights may be redeemed by Roper at a
redemption price of $0.01 per Right at any time until the tenth business day following
public announcement that a 20% position has been acquired or 10 business days after
commencement of a tender or exchange offer. The Rights expire on January 8, 2006.

Roper
periodically enters into agreements with the management of newly-acquired companies for
the issuance of Roper’s common stock based on the achievement of specified goals. A
similar agreement was made with a corporate executive during fiscal 1996 that matured
during fiscal 2002. During fiscal 2002, 20,000 shares of common stock were issued under
such agreements. At December 31, 2004, there were no such agreements outstanding.

Concurrent
with the TransCore Holdings, Inc. acquisition in December 2004, the Company completed a
public offering of 5,000,000 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately
$300.5 million. On December 28, 2004, an underwriters’ overallotment of 115,000
shares of common stock was exercised and closed, providing the Company with gross
proceeds of approximately $6.9 million before expenses.

Concurrent
with the NTGH acquisition in December 2003, the Company completed a public offering of
4,200,000 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $201.6 million. In
connection with our acquisition of NTGH, we also purchased the remaining one-third
interest in DAP Technologies that NTGH did not own. Part of the consideration for this
one-third interest consisted of 34,000 shares of the Company’s treasury shares. In
January 2004, an underwriters’ overallotment of 630,000 shares of common stock was
exercised and closed, providing the Company with gross proceeds of approximately $30.2
million before expenses.

(12)

Contingencies

Roper,
in the ordinary course of business, is the subject of, or a party to, various pending or
threatened legal actions, including those pertaining to product liability and employment
practices. It is vigorously contesting all lawsuits that, in general, are based upon
claims of the kind that have been customary over the past several years. After analyzing
the Company’s contingent liabilities on a gross basis and, based upon past
experience with resolution of its product liability and employment practices claims and
the limits of the primary, excess, and umbrella liability insurance coverages that are
available with respect to pending claims, management believes that adequate provision has
been made to cover any potential liability not covered by insurance, and that the
ultimate liability, if any, arising from these actions should not have a material adverse
effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows of
Roper.

Over
recent years there has been a significant increase in certain U.S. states in
asbestos-related litigation claims against numerous industrial companies. Roper or its
subsidiaries have been named defendants in some such cases. No significant resources have
been required by Roper to respond to these cases and Roper believes it has valid defenses
to such claims and, if required, intends to defend them vigorously. Given the state of
these claims it is not possible to determine the potential liability, if any.

Roper’s
rent expense was approximately $15.2 million, $11.6 million and $10.7 million for fiscal
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Roper’s future minimum lease commitments totaled
$89.1 million at December 31, 2004. These commitments included $25.7 million in fiscal
2005, $20.9 million in fiscal 2006, $14.2 million in fiscal 2007, $8.6 million in fiscal
2008, $5.8 million in fiscal 2009 and $13.9 million thereafter.

Segment
and Geographic Area Information

Roper
operations are aligned into five market-focused segments to capture value-creating
opportunities around common customers, market orientation, sales channels and common cost
opportunities. The five segments are: Instrumentation; Industrial Technology; Energy
Systems and Controls, Scientific and Industrial Imaging, and RF Technology. Our
Instrumentation segment offers equipment and consumables for materials analysis, fluid
properties testing and industrial leak testing. Products included within the Industrial
Technology segment are industrial pumps, flow measurement and metering equipment, and
industrial valves and controls. The Energy Systems and Controls segment’s products
include control systems, machinery vibration and other non-destructive inspection and
measurement products and services. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment offers
high performance digital imaging products and software, and handheld computers and
software. The RF Technology segment includes products and systems related to
comprehensive toll and traffic systems, security and access control, freight movement
services and mobile asset tracking. Roper’s management structure and internal
reporting are also aligned consistent with these five segments.

There
were no material transactions between Roper’s business segments during any of the
twelve month periods ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the two month period ended
December 31, 2002, and the twelve month period ended October 31, 2002. Sales between
geographic areas are primarily of finished products and are accounted for at prices
intended to represent third-party prices. Operating profit by business segment and by
geographic area is defined as sales less operating costs and expenses. These costs and
expenses do not include unallocated corporate administrative expenses. Items below income
from operations on Roper’s statement of earnings are not allocated to business
segments.

Identifiable
assets are those assets used primarily in the operations of each business segment or
geographic area. Corporate assets were principally comprised of cash, recoverable
insurance claims, deferred compensation assets, unamortized deferred financing costs and
property and equipment.

Selected
financial information by business segment for twelve month periods ended December 31,
2004 and 2003, the two month period ended December 31, 2002, and the twelve month period
ended October 31, 2002 follows (in thousands):

Summarized
data for Roper’s U.S. and foreign operations (principally in Europe and Japan) for
the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the two month period ended
December 31, 2002, and the twelve month period ended October 31, 2002, based upon the
country of origin of the Roper entity making the sale, were as follows (in thousands):

Export
sales from the United States during the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2004 and
2003, the two month period ended December 31, 2002, and the twelve month period ended
October 31, 2002 were $188 million, $216 million, $19 million, and $223 million,
respectively. In the year ended December 31, 2004, these exports were shipped primarily
to Russia (11%), elsewhere in Europe (19%), Japan (8%), elsewhere in Asia excluding the
Middle East (26%), Latin America (3%) and other (33%).

Sales
to customers outside the United States accounted for a significant portion of Roper’s
revenues. Sales are attributed to geographic areas based upon the location where the
product is ultimately shipped. Foreign countries that accounted for at least 5% of Roper’s
net sales in any of the twelve month period ended December 31, 2003, the two month period
ended December 31, 2002, and the twelve month periods ended October 31, 2002 and 2001
have been individually identified in the following table (in thousands). Other countries
have been grouped by region.

Restructuring
Activities

In
conjunction with the segment realignment undertaken during the transition period ended
December 31, 2002, Roper performed certain restructuring activities designed to reduce
excess manufacturing capacity, move certain operations to lower-cost locations and
transform activities to have lower fixed costs associated with those activities. Costs
incurred were as follows (amounts in thousands):

(16)

Concentration
of Risk

Financial
instruments which potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist primarily of
cash, cash equivalents and trade receivables.

The
Company maintains cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions.
Cash equivalents include investments in commercial paper of companies with high credit
ratings, investments in money market securities and securities backed by the U.S.
Government. At times such amounts may exceed the F.D.I.C. limits. The Company limits the
amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution and believes that no
significant concentration of credit risk exists with respect to cash investments.

Trade
receivables subject the company to the potential for credit risk with customers. To
reduce credit risk, the Company performs ongoing evaluations of its customers’ financial
condition.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES

Management’s Report
on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate control over financial reporting, as such term is
defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control-Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in

Internal Control-Integrated
Framework

, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting
was effective as of December 31, 2004. Our management’s assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 has
been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting
firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.

Management excluded R/D Tech and
TransCore from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2004 because they were acquired by the Company in purchase business combinations
during 2004. R/D Tech and TransCore are wholly-owned subsidiaries whose total assets
represent 2% and 30%, respectively, and whose total revenues represent 1% and 2%,
respectively , of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2004.

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures

As of the end of the period covered
by this report, the management of the Company, under the supervision and with the
participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls
and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act. Based on that
evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective so as to enable the
Company to record, process, summarize and report in a timely manner the information that
the Company is required to disclose in its Exchange Act reports.

Changes in Internal
Control over Financial Reporting

There was no change in the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth
quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
