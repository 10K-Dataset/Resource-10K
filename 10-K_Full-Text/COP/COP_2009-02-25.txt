Items 1 and 2. BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES

CORPORATE STRUCTURE

ConocoPhillips is an international, integrated energy company. ConocoPhillips was incorporated in
the state of Delaware on November 16, 2001, in connection with, and in anticipation of, the merger
between Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Company. The merger between Conoco and Phillips was
consummated on August 30, 2002.

Our business is organized into six operating segments:

•

Exploration and Production (E&P)—

This segment primarily explores for, produces,
transports and markets crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis.

•

Midstream—

This segment gathers, processes and markets natural gas produced by
ConocoPhillips and others, and fractionates and markets natural gas liquids, predominantly
in the United States and Trinidad. The Midstream segment primarily consists of our 50
percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, LLC.

•

Refining and Marketing (R&M)—

This segment purchases, refines, markets and transports
crude oil and petroleum products, mainly in the United States, Europe and Asia.

•

LUKOIL Investment—

This segment consists of our equity investment in the ordinary shares
of OAO LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia.
At December 31, 2008, our ownership interest was 20 percent based on issued shares and
20.06 percent based on estimated shares outstanding.

•

Chemicals—

This segment manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a
worldwide basis. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in
Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC.

•

Emerging Businesses—

This segment represents our investment in new technologies or
businesses outside our normal scope of operations.

At December 31, 2008, ConocoPhillips employed approximately 33,800 people.

SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

For operating segment and geographic information, see Note 26—Segment Disclosures and Related
Information, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by
reference.



EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION (E&P)

At December 31, 2008, our E&P segment represented 67 percent of ConocoPhillips’ total assets. This
segment explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas
liquids on a worldwide basis. It also mines deposits of oil sands in Canada to extract bitumen and
upgrade it into a synthetic crude oil. Operations to liquefy natural gas and transport the resulting liquefied natural gas (LNG) are also
included in the E&P segment. At December 31, 2008, our E&P operations were producing in the United
States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Ecuador, Australia, offshore Timor-Leste in the Timor
Sea, Indonesia, China, Vietnam, Libya, Nigeria, Algeria and Russia.

In October 2008, we closed on a transaction with Origin Energy to further enhance our long-term
Australasian natural gas business. The 50/50 joint venture, named Australia Pacific LNG, will
focus on coalbed methane production from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia, and
LNG processing and export sales.

The E&P segment does not include the financial results or statistics from our equity investment in
the ordinary shares of LUKOIL, which are reported in our LUKOIL Investment segment. As a result,
references to results, production, prices and other statistics throughout the E&P segment
discussion exclude amounts related to our investment in LUKOIL. However, our share of LUKOIL is
included in the supplemental oil and gas operations disclosures on pages 147 through 166, as well
as in the net proved reserves table shown below.

The information listed below appears in the supplemental oil and gas operations disclosures and is
incorporated herein by reference:

•

Proved worldwide crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves.

•

Net production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids.

•

Average sales prices of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids.

•

Average production costs per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE).

•

Net wells completed, wells in progress and productive wells.

•

Developed and undeveloped acreage.

The following table is a summary of the proved reserves information included in the supplemental
oil and gas operations disclosures. Natural gas reserves are converted to BOE based on a 6:1
ratio: six thousand cubic feet of natural gas converts to one BOE.

In 2008, E&P’s worldwide production, including its share of equity affiliates’ production other
than LUKOIL, averaged 1,767,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOED), compared with the
1,857,000 averaged in 2007. During 2008, 775,000 BOED were produced in the United States, a
decrease from 843,000 in 2007. Production from our international E&P operations averaged 992,000
BOED in 2008, a decrease compared with 1,014,000 in 2007. In addition, our Canadian Syncrude mining operations had net production of 22,000 barrels
per day in 2008, compared with 23,000 in 2007. The change in worldwide production was primarily
due to field decline and the expropriation of our Venezuelan oil interests, partially offset by
production from new developments primarily in the United Kingdom, Indonesia, Russia, Norway and
Canada.

E&P’s worldwide annual average crude oil sales price increased 39 percent, from $67.11 per barrel
in 2007 to $93.12 in 2008. E&P’s average annual worldwide natural gas sales price increased 32
percent, from $6.26 per thousand cubic feet in 2007 to $8.27 in 2008.

E&P—UNITED STATES

In 2008, U.S. E&P operations contributed 44 percent of E&P’s worldwide liquids production and 43
percent of natural gas production, compared with 46 percent and 45 percent in 2007, respectively.

Alaska

Greater Prudhoe Area

The Greater Prudhoe Area is composed of the Prudhoe Bay field and five satellite fields, as well as
the Greater Point McIntyre Area fields. Prudhoe Bay, the largest oil field on Alaska’s North
Slope, is the site of a large waterflood and enhanced oil recovery operation, as well as a gas
processing plant that processes and re-injects natural gas into the reservoir. Prudhoe Bay’s
satellites include Aurora, Borealis, Polaris, Midnight Sun and Orion, while the Point McIntyre,
Niakuk, Raven and Lisburne fields are part of the Greater Point McIntyre Area. We have a 36.1
percent nonoperator interest in all fields within the Greater Prudhoe Area. Net oil production
from the Greater Prudhoe Area averaged 106,000 barrels per day in 2008, compared with 107,000 in
2007, while natural gas liquids production averaged 17,000 barrels per day in 2008, compared with
19,000 in 2007.

Greater Kuparuk Area

We operate the Greater Kuparuk Area, composed of the Kuparuk field and four satellite fields: Tarn,
Tabasco, Meltwater and West Sak. Kuparuk is located about 40 miles west of Prudhoe Bay. Our
ownership interest in the area is approximately 55 percent. Field installations include three
central production facilities that separate oil, natural gas and water. The natural gas is either
used for fuel or compressed for re-injection. Net oil production from the area averaged 67,000
barrels per day in 2008, compared with 74,000 in 2007.

Western North Slope

The Alpine field and its satellite fields, located west of the Kuparuk field, produced at a net
rate of 70,000 barrels of oil per day in 2008, compared with 80,000 in 2007. We operate and hold a
78 percent interest in Alpine and its three satellites, the Nanuq, Fiord and Qannik fields. The
Qannik field began production in July 2008.

Cook Inlet Area

Our assets include the North Cook Inlet field, the Beluga River field, and the Kenai LNG facility,
all of which we operate. We have a 100 percent interest in the North Cook Inlet field, while we
own 33.3 percent of the Beluga River field. Net production in 2008 from the Cook Inlet Area
averaged 88 million cubic feet per day of natural gas, compared with 101 million in 2007.
Production from the North Cook Inlet field is used primarily to supply our share of gas to the
Kenai LNG plant and also as a backup supply to local utilities, while gas from the Beluga River
field is primarily sold to local utilities and is used as backup supply to the Kenai LNG plant.

We have a 70 percent interest in the Kenai LNG plant, which supplies LNG to two utility companies
in Japan. We sold 27 net billion cubic feet in 2008, compared with 31 billion in 2007. In June
2008, the U.S.



Department of Energy announced its approval of a two-year extension of the plant’s
export license, extending it through March 2011.

Exploration

We were the successful bidder on 98 blocks totaling $506 million in the February 2008 Chukchi Sea
lease sale. During 2008, our primary area of exploratory drilling activity was in the National
Petroleum Reserve-Alaska on the Western North Slope. Three wells were drilled in the area, and all
three encountered hydrocarbons. One of the wells was expensed as a dry hole, and we are evaluating
the potential for future development of the other two discoveries.

Transportation

We transport the petroleum liquids produced on the North Slope to south-central Alaska through an
800-mile pipeline that is part of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS). We have a 28.3 percent
ownership interest in TAPS, and we also have ownership interests in the Alpine, Kuparuk and Oliktok
pipelines on the North Slope.

Our wholly owned subsidiary Polar Tankers, Inc. manages the marine transportation of our North
Slope production, using five company-owned double-hulled tankers in addition to chartering
third-party vessels as necessary.

During the second quarter of 2008, ConocoPhillips and BP plc formed a limited liability company to
progress the pipeline project named Denali—The Alaska Gas Pipeline. The project, which would move
approximately 4 billion cubic feet per day of Alaska natural gas to North American markets, would
consist of a gas treatment plant on Alaska’s North Slope and a large-diameter pipeline through
Alaska to Alberta, Canada. Should a new pipeline be required to transport gas from Alberta, the
project also could include a large-diameter pipeline from Alberta to the U.S. Lower 48.

Denali announced plans to reach the first major project milestone before year-end 2010. This
milestone is an open season, a process during which the pipeline company seeks customers to make
long-term firm transportation commitments to the project. We expect Denali would seek
certification from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the Canadian National Energy
Board if the open season is successful, and thereafter move forward with project construction.
Summer fieldwork related to the project began in late May 2008, primarily in eastern Alaska, and
involved route reconnaissance and environmental studies. In late June 2008, the Denali project was
approved to use FERC’s prefiling process. There is a pipeline project competing with Denali that
is structured under the Alaska Gasline Inducement Act.

U.S. Lower 48

Gulf of Mexico

At year-end 2008, our portfolio of producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico mainly consisted of
one operated field and three fields operated by co-venturers, including:

•

75 percent operator interest in the Magnolia field in Garden Banks Blocks 783 and 784.

•

16 percent nonoperator interest in the unitized Ursa field located in the Mississippi
Canyon area.

•

16 percent nonoperator interest in the Princess field, a northern, subsalt extension of
the Ursa field.

•

12.4 percent nonoperator interest in the unitized K2 field, comprised of seven blocks in
the Green Canyon area.

Net production from our Gulf of Mexico properties averaged 18,000 barrels per day of liquids and 24
million cubic feet per day of natural gas in 2008, compared with 25,000 barrels per day and 36
million cubic feet per day in 2007.

Onshore

Our 2008 onshore production principally consisted of natural gas, with the majority of production
located in the San Juan Basin, Permian Basin, Lobo Trend, Bossier Trend, and panhandles of Texas
and Oklahoma. We also have operations in the Wind River, Anadarko and Fort Worth basins, as well
as in East Texas and northern



and southern Louisiana. Other onshore ownership includes properties
in the Williston Basin, the Piceance Basin and the Cedar Creek Anticline.

The San Juan Basin, located in northwestern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado, includes the
majority of our coalbed methane (CBM) production. Additionally, we continue to pursue development
opportunities in three conventional formations in the San Juan Basin. Net production from San Juan
averaged 48,000 barrels per day of liquids and 863 million cubic feet per day of natural gas in
2008, compared with 50,000 barrels per day and 971 million cubic feet per day in 2007.

In addition to our CBM production from the San Juan Basin, we also hold CBM acreage positions in
the Uinta Basin in Utah, the Black Warrior Basin in Alabama, and the Piceance Basin in Colorado.

Onshore activities in 2008 were mostly centered on continued optimization and development of
existing assets. Combined production from all Lower 48 onshore fields in 2008 averaged a net 1,970
million cubic feet per day of natural gas and 147,000 barrels per day of liquids, compared with
2,146 million cubic feet per day and 157,000 barrels per day in 2007.

Transportation

In 2006, we acquired a 24 percent interest in West2East Pipeline LLC, a company holding a 100
percent interest in Rockies Express Pipeline LLC. Rockies Express is completing construction of a
1,679-mile natural gas pipeline from Colorado to Ohio that is expected to have an approximate
capacity of 1.8 billion cubic feet per day. A section of the pipeline extending from Colorado to
Missouri was placed in service in May 2008, and construction continues on the remaining portion of
the pipeline project. Full pipeline service extending to Lebanon, Ohio, is expected by June 2009,
while service to the final destination of Clarington, Ohio, is scheduled to begin by year-end 2009.

Exploration

During 2008, we completed 122 gross onshore exploration wells. Most of the wells were located in
the Bakken play in the Williston Basin, the Bossier Trend, and the Fort Worth Basin Barnett play,
all of which are company focus areas. Other areas with active exploration drilling programs
included the Anadarko Basin, Wyoming, Colorado and South Texas.

Gulf of Mexico deepwater leasehold acreage was expanded by successful bidding at federal offshore
lease sales in March and August 2008, with high bids totaling $334 million, adding 22 new blocks.
At year end we had interests in 267 lease blocks totaling 1.1 million net acres. During 2008, we
completed two successful appraisal wells and participated in four deepwater exploration wells.
Three of the exploration wells were expensed as dry holes, and operations on one well continued
into 2009.

E&P—EUROPE

In 2008, E&P operations in Europe contributed 24 percent of E&P’s worldwide liquids production,
compared with 22 percent in 2007. European operations contributed 20 percent of natural gas
production in 2008, compared with 19 percent in 2007. Our European assets are principally located
in the Norwegian and U.K. sectors of the North Sea.

Norway

We operate and hold a 35.1 percent interest in the Greater Ekofisk Area, located approximately 200
miles offshore Norway in the center of the North Sea. The Greater Ekofisk Area is composed of four
producing fields: Ekofisk, Eldfisk, Embla and Tor. Net production in 2008 from the Greater Ekofisk
Area was 99,000 barrels of liquids per day and 100 million cubic feet of natural gas per day,
compared with 103,000 barrels per day and 103 million cubic feet per day in 2007.



We also have varying ownership interests in other producing fields in the Norwegian sector of the
North Sea and in the Norwegian Sea, including:

•

24.3 percent interest in the Heidrun field.

•

20 percent interest in the Alvheim field.

•

10.3 percent interest in the Statfjord field.

•

23.3 percent interest in the Huldra field.

•

1.6 percent interest in the Troll field.

•

9.1 percent interest in the Visund field.

•

6.4 percent interest in the Grane field.

•

2.4 percent interest in the Oseberg area.

Net production from these and other fields in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea and the
Norwegian Sea averaged 68,000 barrels of liquids per day and 139 million cubic feet of natural gas
per day in 2008, compared with 67,000 barrels per day and 133 million cubic feet per day in 2007.

The Alvheim North Sea development achieved first production in June 2008 through a floating
production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel and subsea installations. At year-end 2008,
Alvheim was producing at a net rate of 16,000 barrels per day of liquids and 7 million cubic feet
per day of natural gas. Net peak production of 18,000 barrels per day of liquids and 9 million
cubic feet per day of natural gas is expected in the second quarter of 2009.

Transportation

We have interests in the transportation and processing infrastructure in the Norwegian sector of
the North Sea, including interests in the Norpipe Oil Pipeline System and in Gassled, which owns
most of the Norwegian gas transportation system.

Exploration

We participated in seven exploration wells during 2008, with five of the wells encountering
hydrocarbons. Two gas discoveries were made in the PL218 license, and two others were made in the
Oseberg area. A discovery was also made on the East Flank of the Visund field, and operations in
this well continued into 2009. In late 2008, we were awarded two Norway exploration licenses, both
in the central North Sea.

United Kingdom

In addition to our 58.7 percent interest in the Britannia natural gas and condensate field, we own
50 percent of Britannia Operator Limited, the operator of the field. Net production from Britannia
and its satellite fields averaged 277 million cubic feet of natural gas per day and 24,000 barrels
of liquids per day in 2008, compared with 252 million cubic feet per day and 10,000 barrels per day
in 2007. We achieved first production from two Britannia satellites, Callanish and Brodgar, in
June and July 2008, respectively. We have a respective 83.5 percent interest and a 75 percent
interest in these satellite fields.

We operate and hold a 36.5 percent interest in the Judy/Joanne fields, which together make up
J-Block. Additionally, our operated Jade field, in which we hold a 32.5 percent interest, produces
from a wellhead platform and pipeline tied to J-Block facilities. Together, these fields produced
a net 13,000 barrels of liquids per day and 88 million cubic feet of natural gas per day in 2008,
compared with 14,000 barrels per day and 94 million cubic feet per day in 2007.

Our various ownership interests in 18 producing gas fields in the Rotliegendes and Carboniferous
areas of the southern North Sea yielded average net production in 2008 of 241 million cubic feet
per day of natural gas, compared with 276 million in 2007.



We also have ownership interests in several other producing fields in the U.K. sector of the North
Sea, including:

•

23.4 percent interest in the Alba field.

•

40 percent interest in the MacCulloch field.

•

4.8 percent interest in the Statfjord field.

Production from these and other remaining fields in the U.K. sector of the North Sea averaged a net
17,000 barrels of liquids per day and 14 million cubic feet of natural gas per day in 2008,
compared with 20,000 barrels per day and 15 million cubic feet per day in 2007.

In the Atlantic Margin, we have a 24 percent interest in the Clair field. Net production in 2008
averaged 11,000 barrels of liquids per day, compared with 7,000 in 2007.

The Millom, Dalton and Calder fields in the East Irish Sea, in which we have a 100 percent
ownership interest, are operated on our behalf by a third party. Net production in 2008 averaged
43 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, compared with 36 million in 2007.

Transportation

The Interconnector pipeline, linking the United Kingdom and Belgium, facilitates marketing natural
gas produced in the United Kingdom throughout Europe. Our 10 percent equity share allows us to
ship approximately 200 million cubic feet of natural gas per day to markets in continental Europe,
and our reverse-flow rights provide an 85 million cubic feet per day import capability into the
United Kingdom.

We operate the Teesside oil and Theddlethorpe gas terminals, in which we have 29.3 percent and 50
percent ownerships, respectively. We also have a 100 percent ownership interest in the Rivers Gas
Terminal, operated by a third party, in the United Kingdom.

Exploration

During 2008 we were awarded interests in three exploration licenses: two in the central North Sea
and one in the West of Shetland region. We also participated in three appraisal wells and three
exploration wells in the Southern Gas Basin, central North Sea and the West of Shetland region,
with four of the wells encountering hydrocarbons. Three of these six wells were drilled in the
proximity of the Jasmine discovery and confirmed the viability of that project.

Netherlands

Our varying nonoperator production interests in the Dutch sector of the North Sea, as well as
interests in offshore pipelines and an onshore gas plant and terminal at Den Helder, were sold in
December 2008. Net production in 2008 averaged 50 million cubic feet of natural gas per day,
compared with 52 million in 2007.

E&P—CANADA

In 2008, E&P operations in Canada contributed 8 percent of E&P’s worldwide liquids production
(excluding Syncrude production), compared with 7 percent in 2007. Canadian operations contributed
22 percent of E&P’s worldwide natural gas production in 2008 and 2007.

Oil and Gas Operations

Western Canada

Operations in western Canada encompass properties throughout Alberta, northeastern British
Columbia, and southern Saskatchewan. Net production from these oil and gas operations in western
Canada averaged 44,000 barrels per day of liquids and 1,054 million cubic feet per day of natural
gas in 2008, compared with 46,000 barrels per day and 1,106 million cubic feet per day in 2007.



Surmont

We operate and have a 50 percent interest in the Surmont oil sands lease, located approximately 35
miles south of Fort McMurray, Alberta. The Surmont project uses an enhanced thermal oil recovery
method called steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD). Steam injection began in the second quarter
of 2007, and first production was achieved in the fourth quarter of 2007. Average net production
of bitumen from Surmont during 2008 was 6,000 barrels per day, and the 2008 average sales price was
$46.85 per barrel. Net peak production of 13,000 barrels per day is expected in 2013.

FCCL

On January 3, 2007, we closed on a business venture with EnCana Corporation to create an integrated
North American heavy oil business. The venture consists of two 50/50 business ventures: a Canadian
upstream general partnership, the FCCL Oil Sands Partnership, and a U.S. downstream limited
liability company, WRB Refining LLC. FCCL’s operating assets consist of the Foster Creek and
Christina Lake SAGD bitumen projects, both located in the eastern flank of the Athabasca oil sands
in northeastern Alberta. EnCana is the operator and managing partner of FCCL. With Christina Lake
phase 1B becoming operational in mid-2008 and the continuing ramp-up of Foster Creek phase C, our
share of FCCL’s production increased to 30,000 barrels per day in 2008, compared with 27,000 in
2007. Foster Creek phases D and E are expected to add additional production of more than 20,000
net barrels per day combined and are expected to become operational in early 2009. The average
sales price realized on FCCL’s 2008 production was $58.54 per barrel. See the Refining and
Marketing (R&M) section for information on WRB.

Parsons Lake/Mackenzie Gas Project

We are working with three other energy companies, as members of the Mackenzie Delta Producers’
Group, on the development of the Mackenzie Valley pipeline and gathering system, which is proposed
to transport onshore gas production from the Mackenzie Delta in northern Canada to established
markets in North America. We have a 75 percent interest in the Parsons Lake gas field, one of the
primary fields in the Mackenzie Delta that would anchor the pipeline development. The Joint Review
Panel (JRP), an independent body appointed by the Minister of Environment to evaluate the potential
impacts of the project on the environment and lives of the people in the project area, completed
public hearings in November 2007. The JRP issued a press release in December 2008, indicating a
report assessing the environmental and socio-economic impact of the proposed project would be
released in December 2009. The pipeline project awaits the JRP report and will continue to
progress toward regulatory authorizations, but it has deferred detailed engineering work pending
resolution with the federal government on the fiscal and commercial framework.

Exploration

We hold exploration acreage in four areas of Canada: western Canada, offshore eastern Canada, the
Mackenzie Delta/Beaufort Sea region, and the Arctic Islands. In 2008, the company added 62,000
acres in the Horn River play in western Canada and acquired two additional Beaufort licenses.
Within western Canada, we participated in 43 exploratory wells.

Syncrude Canada Ltd.

We own a 9 percent interest in the Syncrude Canada Ltd. (SCL) joint venture, created for the
purpose of mining shallow deposits of oil sands, extracting the bitumen, and upgrading it into a
light sweet crude oil called Syncrude. The primary plant and facilities are located at Mildred
Lake, about 25 miles north of Fort McMurray, Alberta. SCL, as operator of the joint venture, holds
eight oil sands leases and the associated surface rights, of which our share is approximately
22,400 net acres. Net production averaged 22,000 barrels per day in 2008, compared with 23,000 in
2007.

U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regulations currently in effect define the Syncrude project
as mining-related and not part of conventional oil and gas operations. As such, Syncrude
operations are not included in our proved oil and gas reserves or production as reported in our
supplemental oil and gas information.



E&P—SOUTH AMERICA

In 2008, E&P operations in South America contributed 1 percent of E&P’s worldwide liquids
production, compared with 5 percent in 2007.

Venezuela

Petrozuata, Hamaca and Corocoro

On June 26, 2007, we announced we had been unable to reach agreement with respect to our migration
to an

empresa mixta

structure mandated by the Venezuelan government’s Nationalization Decree. In
response, Venezuela’s national oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), or its affiliates
directly assumed the activities associated with and control over ConocoPhillips’ interests in the Petrozuata and Hamaca
heavy oil ventures and the offshore Corocoro development project.

Plataforma Deltana Block 2

We have a 40 percent nonoperated interest in Plataforma Deltana Block 2 which holds a gas discovery
made by PDVSA. Several critical components required to progress an investment decision have not
yet been defined by the govenment.

Peru

At year-end 2008, we held ownership interests in five exploration blocks in Peru. Two 2D seismic
programs were carried out during the year in Blocks 39 and 104, and the sale of Block 57 was
completed in the second quarter of the year. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we completed an
appraisal well in Block 39, but the well did not confirm a stand-alone commercial hydrocarbon
accumulation. The appraisal well and suspended discovery well were expensed as dry holes.

Ecuador

In Ecuador, we own a 42.5 percent interest in Block 7 and a 46.3 percent interest in Block 21. Net
production in 2008 averaged 9,000 barrels of crude oil per day, compared with 10,000 in 2007.

Argentina

We sold our assets in Argentina in September 2008.

E&P—ASIA PACIFIC

In 2008, E&P operations in the Asia Pacific region contributed 11 percent of E&P’s worldwide
liquids production and 13 percent of natural gas production, compared with 10 percent and 11
percent in 2007, respectively.

Australia and Timor Sea

Australia Pacific LNG

In October 2008, we closed on a transaction with Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy
company, to further enhance our long-term Australasian natural gas business. The 50/50 joint
venture, named Australia Pacific LNG, will focus on coalbed methane (CBM) production from the Bowen
and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia, and LNG processing and export sales. With this
transaction, we gained access to CBM resources in Australia and will enhance our LNG position with
the expected creation of an additional LNG hub targeting Asia Pacific markets. Four LNG trains are
anticipated, each currently expected to process an estimated 3.5 million gross tons of LNG per
year. An estimated 20,500 gross wells are ultimately envisioned to supply both the domestic gas
market and the LNG development. Drilling and production operations will be supported by gas
gathering systems and centralized gas processing and compression stations, as well as by dewatering
and water treatment facilities.

Our share of the joint venture’s year-end production rate was 68 million cubic feet per day.
Current production is sold into the Australian domestic market. CBM field development work is
ongoing in parallel with front-end engineering associated with the planned LNG processing
facilities.



Bayu-Undan

We operate and hold a 57.2 percent ownership interest in the Bayu-Undan field located in the Timor
Sea. The field averaged a net production rate of 36,000 barrels of liquids per day in 2008,
compared with 34,000 in 2007. Our share of natural gas production was 210 million cubic feet per
day in 2008, compared with 189 million in 2007. Produced natural gas is used to supply the Darwin
LNG plant, of which we own a 57.2 percent interest. In 2008, we sold 159 billion gross cubic feet
of LNG to utility customers in Japan, compared with 140 billion in 2007.

Greater Sunrise

We have a 30 percent interest in the Greater Sunrise gas and condensate field located in the Timor
Sea. Although agreement has been reached between the governments of Australia and Timor-Leste
concerning sharing of revenues from the anticipated development of Greater Sunrise, key challenges
to be resolved before significant funding commitments can be made include ensuring the reservoir is
adequately appraised, gaining co-venturer and government alignment on the development concept, and
establishing fiscal stability arrangements. Immediate activity is focused on reprocessing seismic
data and integrating the results of an appraisal well to define the remaining appraisal program, as
well as advancing the development concept screening phase.

Western Australia

In 2008, our share of production from the Athena/Perseus (WA-17-L) gas field, located offshore
Western Australia, was 35 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, compared with 34 million in
2007.

Exploration

In November 2008, we acquired 50 percent interests in two permits in the Arafura Basin, offshore
Northern Territory. In the Bonaparte Basin, we drilled one successful appraisal well at the
Sunrise field. Additionally, seismic processing from the NT/P69 and the NT/P61 permits was
completed, and interpretation of this data is currently under way to further evaluate the Caldita
and Barossa discoveries.

The company also operates the WA-314-P, WA-315-P and WA-398-P permits in the Browse Basin. During
2008, acquisition and processing of seismic data in WA-398-P was completed. An exploration
drilling campaign will be conducted in these permits during 2009.

Indonesia

We operate seven production sharing contracts (PSCs) in Indonesia. Production from Indonesia in
2008 averaged a net 343 million cubic feet per day of natural gas and 15,000 barrels per day of
oil, compared with 330 million cubic feet per day and 12,000 barrels per day in 2007. Our assets
are concentrated in two core areas: the West Natuna Sea and onshore South Sumatra.

We operate four offshore PSCs: South Natuna Sea Block B, Amborip VI, Kuma and Arafura Sea. The
South Natuna Sea Block B PSC, in which we have a 40 percent interest, has two producing oil fields
and 16 gas fields in various stages of development.

We operate three onshore PSCs. Corridor and South Jambi B are in South Sumatra, and Warim is in
Papua. As part of the Corridor PSC, in which we have a 54 percent interest, we operate six oil
fields and six natural gas fields, and supply natural gas from the Grissik and Suban gas processing
plants to the Duri steamflood in central Sumatra and to markets in Singapore, Batam and West Java.
We have a 45 percent interest in the South Jambi B PSC, a shallow gas project that supplies natural
gas to Singapore.

Transportation

We are a 35 percent owner of a consortium company that has a 40 percent ownership in PT
Transportasi Gas Indonesia, which owns and operates the Grissik to Duri and Grissik to Singapore
natural gas pipelines.

Exploration

In
November 2008, we acquired the Arafura Sea Block, and a 2D seismic survey was completed on the
block by year end. One appraisal well was drilled at the South Belut field, and one appraisal well
and one exploration well were drilled at the North Belut field.



China

Production related to our 49 percent share of the Peng Lai 19-3 field in Bohai Bay Block 11-05
averaged 14,000 barrels of oil per day in 2008, compared with 10,000 in 2007. We also hold a 49
percent interest in the nearby Peng Lai 25-6 field. An FPSO vessel to accommodate production from
both fields is expected to be installed in early 2009. Concurrent development of both fields
continues.

The Xijiang development consists of two fields located approximately 80 miles south of Hong Kong in
the South China Sea. Our ownership in these fields ranges from 12.3 percent to 24.5 percent.
Facilities include two manned platforms and an FPSO vessel. Combined net production of oil from the Xijiang fields averaged
7,000 barrels per day in 2008, compared with 8,000 in 2007.

We have a 24.5 percent interest in the offshore Panyu field, also located in the South China Sea,
which produced 12,000 net barrels of oil per day in 2008 and 13,000 in 2007. In July 2008, we sold
our 100 percent interest in the onshore Ba Jiao Chang natural gas field.

Vietnam

Our ownership interest in Vietnam is centered around the Cuu Long Basin in the South China Sea and
consists of two primarily oil-producing blocks, four exploration blocks, and one gas pipeline
transportation system.

We have a 23.3 percent interest in Block 15-1 in the Cuu Long Basin. Net production in 2008 was
13,000 barrels of oil per day, compared with 14,000 in 2007. The oil is processed through a
1-million-barrel FPSO vessel and through the Su Tu Vang central processing platform and new
floating storage and offloading (FSO) vessel. First oil production from the Su Tu Vang satellite
field was achieved in October 2008.

Also in the Cuu Long Basin, we have a 36 percent interest in the Rang Dong field in Block 15-2.
All wellhead platforms produce into an FSO vessel. Net production in 2008 was 9,000 barrels per
day of liquids and 16 million cubic feet per day of natural gas, compared with 8,000 barrels per
day and 15 million cubic feet per day in 2007.

Transportation

We own a 16.3 percent interest in the Nam Con Son natural gas pipeline. This 244-mile
transportation system links gas supplies from the Nam Con Son Basin to gas markets in southern
Vietnam.

Exploration

In 2008, we drilled one exploration well in Block 15-1 that was expensed as a dry hole.

Malaysia

We have interests in three deepwater PSCs located off the eastern Malaysian state of Sabah: Block
G, Block J, and the Kebabangan Cluster. Development of the Gumusut discovery in Block J continues.

Exploration

In 2008, we completed two successful appraisal wells in Block G to evaluate the prior Ubah and
Petai discoveries. Kebabangan and Malikai, a Block G discovery, are moving toward field
development.

E&P—MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA

During 2008, E&P operations in the Middle East and Africa contributed 8 percent of E&P’s worldwide
liquids production and 2 percent of natural gas production, the same as in 2007.

Qatar

Qatargas 3 is an integrated project jointly owned by Qatar Petroleum (68.5 percent), ConocoPhillips
(30 percent) and Mitsui & Co., Ltd. (1.5 percent). The project comprises upstream natural gas
production facilities to produce approximately 1.4 billion gross cubic feet per day of natural gas
from Qatar’s North field. The project also includes a 7.8-million-gross-ton-per-year LNG facility,
from which LNG will be shipped in



new LNG
carriers destined for sale in the United States and other markets. The first LNG cargoes are expected to be
loaded in the fourth quarter of 2010.

In order to capture cost savings, Qatargas 3 is executing the development of the onshore and
offshore assets as a single integrated project with Qatargas 4, a joint venture between Qatar
Petroleum and Royal Dutch Shell plc. This includes the joint development of offshore facilities
situated in a common offshore block in the North field, as well as the construction of two
identical LNG process trains and associated gas treating facilities for both the Qatargas 3 and
Qatargas 4 joint ventures. Upon completion of the Qatargas 3 and Qatargas 4 projects, production
from the LNG plant and associated facilities will be combined and shared.

We have a 12.4 percent ownership interest in the Golden Pass LNG regasification facility and
associated pipeline. The facilities are currently being constructed on the Sabine-Neches
Industrial Ship Channel northwest of Sabine Pass, Texas. Subject to the negotiation of definitive
agreements, ConocoPhillips will also secure capacity rights in the regasification terminal and
pipeline to manage the LNG we will purchase from Qatargas 3. In addition to the United States,
other market alternatives for Qatargas 3 LNG production are being pursued. Despite sustaining some
damage during Hurricane Ike, the Golden Pass LNG terminal is expected to be operational in time to
receive the first cargoes of Qatargas 3 production.

Libya

ConocoPhillips holds a 16.3 percent interest in the Waha concessions in Libya, which encompass
nearly 13 million gross acres. Net oil production averaged 47,000 barrels per day in 2008 and
2007.

Nigeria

During 2008, we produced from four onshore Oil Mining Leases (OMLs), in which we have a 20 percent
nonoperator interest. Net production from these leases was 21,000 barrels of liquids per day and
105 million cubic feet of natural gas per day in 2008, compared with 19,000 barrels per day and 117
million cubic feet per day in 2007.

We have a 20 percent interest in a 480-megawatt gas-fired power plant in Kwale, Nigeria, which
supplies electricity to Nigeria’s national electricity supplier. In 2008, the plant consumed 11
million net cubic feet per day of natural gas sourced from our proved reserves in the OMLs.

We have a 17 percent equity interest in Brass LNG Limited, which plans to construct an LNG facility
in the Niger Delta.

Exploration

We drilled an exploration well in block OPL214 that did not confirm commercial quantities of
hydrocarbons and was expensed as a dry hole. Development planning activities for the prior Uge
discovery in the same block continue. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we assigned our interest in
OPL248 to a co-venturer. This assignment was formally acknowledged by the Nigerian government in
the third quarter of 2008.

Abu Dhabi

In July 2008, we signed an Interim Agreement with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) to
develop the Shah gas field in Abu Dhabi. This large-scale project involves the development of
natural gas condensate reservoirs within the onshore Shah gas field, the construction of a new
1-billion-cubic-feet-per-day natural gas processing plant at Shah, new natural gas and liquid
pipelines, and sulfur-exporting facilities at Ruwais. ADNOC would have a 60 percent interest and
we would have a 40 percent interest in the project. We are currently working on final project
agreements with ADNOC.

Algeria

We have interests in three fields in Block 405a: the Menzel Lejmat North field, the Ourhoud field,
and the development stage El Merk (EMK) oil field unit. Net production from these fields averaged
13,000 barrels of oil per day in 2008, compared with 11,000 in 2007.



E&P—RUSSIA AND CASPIAN

Russia

Polar Lights

We have a 50 percent equity interest in Polar Lights Company, an entity created to develop fields
in the Timan-Pechora Basin in northern Russia. Net production averaged 11,000 barrels of oil per
day in 2008, compared with 12,000 in 2007.

NMNG

We have a 30 percent ownership interest with a 50 percent governance interest in OOO
Naryanmarneftegaz (NMNG), a joint venture with LUKOIL. NMNG is working to develop resources in the
northern part of Russia’s Timan-Pechora province, including the Yuzhno Khylchuyu (YK) field.
Initial production from YK was achieved in June 2008, with the field producing at a net rate of
24,000 barrels of oil per day at year end. Net peak production of 45,000 barrels per day is
expected to be reached in the second quarter of 2009. Production from the NMNG joint venture
fields is transported via pipeline to LUKOIL’s terminal at Varandey Bay on the Barents Sea and then
shipped via tanker to international markets. Late in the second quarter of 2008, LUKOIL completed
an expansion of the terminal’s gross oil-throughput capacity from 30,000 barrels per day to 240,000
barrels per day to accommodate production from the YK field.

Caspian

In the Caspian Sea, we have an interest in the Republic of Kazakhstan’s North Caspian Sea
Production Sharing Agreement (NCSPSA), which includes the Kashagan field. The first phase of field
development currently being executed includes construction of artificial drilling islands with
processing facilities and living quarters, and pipelines to carry production onshore. First
production is expected in the latter part of 2012. The initial production phase of the contract is
for 20 years, with options to extend the agreement an additional 20 years.

In 2004, the Republic of Kazakhstan approved the submitted development plan and budget relating to
the Kashagan oil field development and, in 2007, triggered dispute proceedings under the NCSPSA
following submission of a revised development plan and budget reflecting Kashagan cost increases
and schedule delays. Definitive agreements were signed October 31, 2008, resolving the Kashagan
field development dispute and allowing Kazakhstan’s state-owned energy company, JSC National
Company KazMunayGas, to increase its ownership interest from 8.33 percent to 16.81 percent. As a
result, our interest in the NCSPSA was reduced from 9.26 percent to 8.40 percent, effective January
1, 2008. We will receive our share of the purchase price plus accrued interest in three annual
installments beginning from the date of first commercial production. In addition, a new joint
operating company, with significant involvement from the owners, was established and will operate
future phases of Kashagan. We will have seconded employees in the joint operating company.

Transportation

We have a 2.5 percent interest in the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline, which transports crude
oil from the Caspian region through Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey for tanker loadings at the port
of Ceyhan.

Exploration

In October 2008, we signed a Memorandum of Understanding to negotiate terms for the exploration and
development of the N Block, located offshore Kazakhstan,
under a new subsoil use contract. Subsequently, in December 2008, we
signed a Heads of Agreement that would give us a 24.5 percent
interest in the exploration and development of the N Block. In
addition, development studies continue for the next phase of Kashagan and the satellite fields of
Kalamkas, Kairan and Aktote.

E&P—OTHER

LNG

We have a long-term agreement with Freeport LNG Development, L.P. to use 0.9 billion cubic feet per
day of regasification capacity at Freeport’s 1.5-billion-cubic-feet-per-day LNG receiving terminal
in Quintana, Texas. The terminal became operational late in the second quarter of 2008. In order
to deliver natural gas from the Freeport terminal to market, we constructed a 32-mile, 42-inch
pipeline from the Freeport terminal to a point near Iowa Colony, Texas. Construction was completed
in the second quarter of 2008 to coincide with the



Freeport terminal startup. Due to present
market conditions, which favor the flow of LNG to European and Asian markets, our near-to-mid-term
utilization of the Freeport terminal is expected to be limited. We are responsible for monthly
process-or-pay payments to Freeport irrespective of whether we utilize the terminal for
regasification. The financial impact of this capacity underutilization is not expected to be
material to our future earnings or cash flows.

We received planning permission in 2008 for an LNG regasification facility and combined heat and
power plant at the existing Norsea Pipeline Limited oil terminal site at Teesside, United Kingdom.

Commercial

Our Commercial organization optimizes the commodity flows of our E&P segment. This group markets
our crude oil and natural gas production, using commodity buyers, traders and marketers in offices
in the United States, the United Kingdom, Singapore, Canada and Dubai.

E&P—RESERVES

We have not filed any information with any other federal authority or agency with respect to our
estimated total proved reserves at December 31, 2008. No difference exists between our estimated
total proved reserves for year-end 2007 and year-end 2006, which are shown in this filing, and
estimates of these reserves shown in a filing with another federal agency in 2008.

DELIVERY COMMITMENTS

We sell crude oil and natural gas from our E&P producing operations under a variety of contractual
arrangements, some of which specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity. Our
Commercial organization also enters into natural gas sales contracts where the source of the
natural gas used to fulfill the contract can be the spot market or a combination of our reserves
and the spot market. Worldwide, we are contractually committed to deliver approximately 6 trillion
cubic feet of natural gas and 119 million barrels of crude oil in the future, including
approximately 800 billion cubic feet related to the minority interests of consolidated
subsidiaries. These contracts have various expiration dates through the year 2025. We expect to
fulfill the majority of these delivery commitments with proved developed reserves. In addition, we
anticipate using proved undeveloped reserves and spot market purchases to fulfill these
commitments. See the disclosure on “Proved Undeveloped Reserves” in Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for information on the development of
proved undeveloped reserves.



MIDSTREAM

At December 31, 2008, our Midstream segment represented 1 percent of ConocoPhillips’ total assets.
Our Midstream business is primarily conducted through our 50 percent equity investment in DCP
Midstream, LLC, a joint venture with Spectra Energy.

The Midstream business purchases raw natural gas from producers and gathers natural gas through
extensive pipeline gathering systems. The gathered natural gas is then processed to extract
natural gas liquids. The remaining “residue” gas is marketed to electrical utilities, industrial
users and gas marketing companies. Most of the natural gas liquids are fractionated—separated
into individual components like ethane, butane and propane—and marketed as chemical feedstock,
fuel or blendstock. Total natural gas liquids extracted in 2008, including our share of DCP
Midstream, were 188,000 barrels per day, compared with 211,000 in 2007.

DCP Midstream markets a portion of its natural gas liquids to ConocoPhillips and Chevron Phillips
Chemical Company LLC under a supply agreement that continues until December 31, 2014. This
purchase commitment is on an “if-produced, will-purchase” basis and so has no fixed production
schedule, but has had, and is expected over the remaining term of the contract to have, a
relatively stable purchase pattern. Under the agreement, natural gas liquids are purchased at
various published market index prices, less transportation and fractionation fees.

DCP Midstream is headquartered in Denver, Colorado. At December 31, 2008, DCP Midstream owned or
operated 53 natural gas liquids extraction and 10 natural gas liquids fractionation plants, and its
gathering and transmission systems included approximately 60,000 miles of pipeline. In 2008, DCP
Midstream’s raw natural gas throughput averaged 6.2 billion cubic feet per day, and natural gas
liquids extraction averaged 360,000 barrels per day, compared with 5.9 billion cubic feet per day
and 363,000 barrels per day in 2007. DCP Midstream’s assets are primarily located in the following
producing regions of the United States: Rocky Mountains, Midcontinent, Permian, East Texas/North
Louisiana, South Texas, Central Texas, and Gulf Coast.

Outside of DCP Midstream, our U.S. natural gas liquids business included the following as of
year-end 2008:

•

A 25,000-barrel-per-day capacity natural gas liquids fractionation plant in Gallup, New
Mexico.

•

A 22.5 percent equity interest in Gulf Coast Fractionators, which owns a natural gas
liquids fractionation plant in Mont Belvieu, Texas (with our net share of capacity at
25,000 barrels per day).

•

A 40 percent interest in a fractionation plant in Conway, Kansas (with our net share of
capacity at 42,000 barrels per day).

•

A 12.5 percent equity interest in a fractionation plant in Mont Belvieu, Texas (with our
net share of capacity at 26,000 barrels per day).

We also own a 39 percent equity interest in Phoenix Park Gas Processors Limited, a joint venture
principally with the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited. Phoenix Park processes
natural gas in Trinidad and markets natural gas liquids in the Caribbean, Central America and the
U.S. Gulf Coast. Its facilities include a 1.35-billion-cubic-feet-per-day gas processing plant and
a 70,000-barrel-per-day natural gas liquids fractionator. A third gas processing train is
currently under construction and, when complete in 2009, will bring Phoenix Park’s total processing
capacity to 2 billion cubic feet per day. Our share of natural gas liquids extracted averaged
8,000 barrels per day in 2008 and 2007. Our share of fractionated liquids averaged 14,000 barrels
per day in 2008, compared with 13,000 in 2007.



REFINING AND MARKETING (R&M)

At December 31, 2008, our R&M segment represented 24 percent of ConocoPhillips’ total assets. R&M
operations encompass refining crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products (such as
gasolines, distillates and aviation fuels); buying, selling and transporting crude oil; and buying,
transporting, distributing and marketing petroleum products. R&M has operations in the United
States, Europe and the Asia Pacific region. The R&M segment does not include the results or
statistics from our equity investment in LUKOIL, which are reported in our LUKOIL Investment
segment.

Our Commercial organization optimizes the commodity flows of our R&M segment. This organization
procures feedstocks for R&M’s refineries, facilitates supplying a portion of the gas and power
needs of the R&M facilities, supplies petroleum products to our marketing operations, and markets
petroleum products directly to third parties. Commercial has buyers, traders and marketers in
offices in the United States, the United Kingdom, Singapore, Canada and Dubai.

Represents our proportionate share as of January 1, 2009. In 2008, our share of Borger was 72
MBD gasolines and 36 MBD distillates.

**

Includes specialty coke.

MSLP

ConocoPhillips has a 50 percent interest in Merey Sweeny, L.P. (MSLP), a limited partnership that
owns a 70,000-barrel-per-day delayed coker and related facilities at the Sweeny refinery that
produce fuel-grade petroleum coke. Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), which owns the other 50
percent interest, supplies the refinery with heavy, high-sulfur crude oil. We are the operator and
managing partner. Late in 2008, PDVSA notified us that January 2009 nominated crude oil supplies
for MSLP would not be delivered due to Venezuelan government-ordered production reductions.
Similar notifications have been received for nominated supplies for February and March. We
processed alternative crude oils at MSLP during January. Late in January, MSLP entered into a
planned turnaround, which will continue into March 2009.



WRB

On January 3, 2007, we closed on a business venture with EnCana Corporation to create an integrated
North American heavy oil business. The venture consists of two 50/50 business ventures: a Canadian
upstream general partnership, the FCCL Oil Sands Partnership, and a U.S. downstream limited
liability company, WRB Refining LLC. WRB consists of the Wood River and Borger refineries, located
in Roxana, Illinois, and Borger, Texas, respectively. We are the operator and managing partner of
WRB. For the Wood River refinery, operating results are shared 50/50. For the Borger refinery, we
were entitled to 65 percent of the operating results in 2008, with our share decreasing to 50
percent in all years thereafter. See the Exploration and Production (E&P) section for additional
information on FCCL.

Since formation, the joint venture has expanded the processing capability of heavy Canadian crude
to 95,000 barrels per day from 60,000 barrels per day with the startup of a coker at Borger in
2007. In addition, during 2008, the final permit was received and plans were progressed to expand
the Wood River refinery, including the installation of a coker. With the completion of this
project, anticipated in 2011, total processing capability of heavy Canadian or similar crudes at
Wood River will increase to 225,000 barrels per day, and existing asphalt production at the
refinery will be replaced with production of upgraded products.

Capital Projects

In 2008, capital was directed toward projects to meet environmental and air emission standards and
to further improve the operating reliability, safety and energy efficiency of processing units. In
addition, capital was spent for small projects that are expected to yield an incremental return
through providing improvements in overall transportation fuel yields and product mix.

Significant projects during 2008 included progressing an expansion of a hydrocracker at the Rodeo
facility of our San Francisco refinery. When complete in 2009, this project is expected to
increase clean product yield at the refinery. We also installed wet gas scrubbers at our Los
Angeles and Ponca City refineries in order to improve air emissions from those plants. Another
project completed during the year was a coker upgrade at our Los Angeles refinery, which improved
the yield of transportation fuels.

Marketing

In the United States as of December 31, 2008, R&M marketed gasoline, diesel and aviation fuel
through approximately 8,340 outlets in 49 states. The majority of these sites utilize the

Phillips

,

Conoco

or


brands.

Wholesale

At December 31, 2008, our wholesale operations utilized a network of marketers operating
approximately 7,270 outlets that provided refined product offtake from our refineries, including
Borger and Wood River. A strong emphasis is placed on the wholesale channel of trade because of
its lower capital requirements. We also buy and sell petroleum products in the spot market. Our
refined products are marketed on both a branded and unbranded basis.

In addition to automotive gasoline and diesel, we produce and market aviation gasoline, which is
used by smaller, piston engine aircraft. At December 31, 2008, aviation gasoline and jet fuel were
sold through independent marketers at approximately 630

Phillips 66

-branded locations in the United
States.

Retail

At December 31, 2008, our retail operations consisted of approximately 330 owned and operated sites
under the

Conoco

,

Phillips 66

and


brands. Company-operated retail operations were focused in 10
states, mainly in the Midcontinent, Rocky Mountain and West Coast regions. Most of these outlets
marketed merchandise through the

Kicks

or

Circle K

brand convenience stores.

At December 31, 2008, CFJ Properties, our 50/50 joint venture with Flying J, owned and operated
approximately 110 truck travel plazas that carry the

Conoco

,

Flying J

or both brands. Flying J
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December 2008. Flying J continues to operate the CFJ
properties jointly owned with ConocoPhillips.



In December 2006, we announced our U.S. company-owned and company-operated retail outlets and our
U.S. company-owned and dealer-operated retail outlets would be divested to new or existing
wholesale marketers. Approximately 830 sites were included in the held for sale plans. About 620 sites have been sold,
including approximately 390 outlets sold in January 2009. The remaining sites included in the
original disposition plan are also expected to be sold in 2009.

Transportation

We distribute refined products to our customers via company-owned and common-carrier pipeline,
barge, railcar and truck.

Pipelines and Terminals

At December 31, 2008, R&M had approximately 28,000 miles of common-carrier crude oil, raw natural
gas liquids, and petroleum products pipeline systems in the United States, including those
partially owned or operated by affiliates. We also owned or operated 48 finished product
terminals, seven liquefied petroleum gas terminals, five crude oil terminals and one coke exporting
facility.

In December 2007, we acquired a 50 percent equity interest in four Keystone pipeline entities
(Keystone), to create a joint venture with TransCanada Corporation. In October 2008, we elected to
exercise an option to reduce our equity interest from 50 percent to 20.01 percent. The change in
equity will occur through a dilution mechanism, which is expected to gradually lower our ownership
interest until it reaches 20.01 percent by the third quarter of 2009. At December 31, 2008, our
ownership interest was 38.7 percent. Keystone’s first phase, a 2,148-mile, 590,000-barrel-per-day
crude oil pipeline from Alberta to delivery points in Illinois and Oklahoma, is expected to be
mechanically complete in late 2009. A second phase is expected to carry up to 700,000 barrels per
day to refineries on the Gulf Coast. We anticipate utilizing the Keystone pipeline to transport
our Canadian crude oil production to market, including as a source of supply to our U.S.
refineries.

Tankers

During 2008, we disposed of our international marine operations consisting of leasehold interests
in six double-hulled crude oil tankers and replaced the disposed operations with long-term charter
agreements. At December 31, 2008, we had 17 double-hulled crude oil tankers, with capacities
ranging in size from 700,000 to 2,100,000 barrels, which are under charter primarily to transport
feedstocks to certain of our U.S. refineries. In addition, we had under charter five double-hulled
product tankers utilized to transport our heavy and clean products. The tankers discussed here
exclude the operations of the company’s subsidiary, Polar Tankers, Inc., which are discussed in the
E&P segment, as well as an owned tanker on lease to a third party for use in the North Sea.

Specialty Businesses

We manufacture and sell a variety of specialty products including petroleum cokes, lubes (such as
automotive and industrial lubricants), solvents and pipeline flow improvers. Our lubes are
marketed under the

Phillips 66

,

Conoco

,


and

Kendall

brands. We also manufacture and market
high-quality graphite and anode-grade petroleum cokes in the United States and Europe for use in
the global steel and aluminum industries.

The company’s 50-percent-owned Excel Paralubes joint venture owns a hydrocracked lubricant base oil
manufacturing plant located adjacent to the Lake Charles refinery. The facility produces
approximately 20,000 barrels per day of high-quality, clear hydrocracked base oils.

In January 2008, we sold our 50 percent interest in Penreco, which manufactured and marketed highly
refined specialty petroleum products.

We operate a crude oil and products storage complex consisting of 7.5 million barrels of storage
capacity and an offshore mooring buoy, located about 80 miles southwest of the Whitegate refinery
in Bantry Bay, Ireland.

During 2008, we continued to progress our plans to upgrade the Wilhelmshaven refinery in Germany.
Our future capital budget incorporates funds to economically improve the operation of the refinery,
enabling it to process heavier, higher-sulfur crude oil and produce predominantly low-sulfur
diesel.

In late 2007, we and our co-venturers sanctioned a project for the expansion of the Melaka refinery
to be completed during 2010. This project is intended to increase crude oil, conversion and
treating unit capacities.

In May 2006, we signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Saudi Aramco to conduct a detailed
evaluation of the proposed development of a 400,000-barrel-per-day, full-conversion refinery in
Yanbu, Saudi Arabia. The refinery would be designed to process Arabian heavy crude oil and produce
high-quality, ultra-low-sulfur refined products. In November 2008, we agreed to delay the bidding
process associated with the refinery’s construction due to uncertainties in the contracting and
financial markets. The originally scheduled bidding process requested bids be submitted in
December 2008. Instead, project bidding is now scheduled to begin in 2009.

Marketing

At December 31, 2008, R&M had marketing operations in five European countries. R&M’s European
marketing strategy is to sell primarily through owned, leased or joint venture retail sites using a
low-cost, high-volume strategy. We use the

JET

brand name to market retail and wholesale products
in Austria, Germany and the United Kingdom. In addition, a joint venture in which we have an
equity interest markets products in Switzerland under the

Coop

brand name. We also market aviation
fuels, liquid petroleum gases, heating oils, transportation fuels and marine bunkers to commercial
customers and into the bulk or spot market in the aforementioned countries and Ireland.

As of December 31, 2008, R&M had approximately 1,260 marketing outlets in its European operations,
of which approximately 860 were company-owned and 400 were dealer-owned. Through our joint venture
operations in Switzerland, we also have interests in 200 additional sites. In October 2008, we
sold our 274 fueling stations in Norway, Sweden and Denmark to Statoil.

LUKOIL INVESTMENT

At December 31, 2008, our LUKOIL Investment segment represented 4 percent of ConocoPhillips’ total
assets. In 2004, we became a strategic equity investor in OAO LUKOIL, an international, integrated
oil and gas company headquartered in Russia. Under the Shareholder Agreement between the two
companies, we have representation on the LUKOIL Board of Directors, and LUKOIL’s corporate charter
requires unanimous Board consent for certain key decisions. At year-end 2008, we had a 20 percent
ownership interest in LUKOIL based on authorized and issued shares. Based on estimated shares
outstanding at year end, our ownership was 20.06 percent. We use the equity method of accounting
for our investment in LUKOIL. See Note 7—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.

As reported in LUKOIL’s
publicly available 2007 annual report, the majority of its 2007 upstream oil production was
sourced within Russia, with 62 percent from the western Siberia region, 15 percent from the
Timan-Pechora province and 12 percent from the Urals region. Outside of Russia, LUKOIL had 2007
oil production in Kazakhstan, Egypt and Azerbaijan, and gas production in Uzbekistan. Eighty-eight
percent of LUKOIL’s natural gas production was sourced within Russia. In addition, LUKOIL has an
active exploration program focused in Russia but also encompassing several international countries.
Downstream, LUKOIL has seven refineries with a net crude oil throughput capacity of approximately
1.2 million barrels per day. LUKOIL also has a marketing network extending to 24 countries, with
the majority of wholesale and retail sales in Russia, the United States and Europe.



CHEMICALS

At December 31, 2008, our Chemicals segment represented 2 percent of ConocoPhillips’ total assets.
The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical
Company LLC (CPChem), a joint venture with Chevron Corporation, headquartered in The Woodlands,
Texas.

CPChem’s business is structured around two primary operating segments: Olefins & Polyolefins and
Specialties, Aromatics & Styrenics. The Olefins & Polyolefins segment produces and markets
ethylene, propylene, and other olefin products, which are primarily consumed within CPChem for the
production of polyethylene, normal alpha olefins, polypropylene, and polyethylene pipe. The
Specialties, Aromatics & Styrenics segment manufactures and markets aromatics products, such as
benzene, styrene, paraxylene and cyclohexane. This segment also manufactures and markets
polystyrene, as well as styrene-butadiene copolymers. Furthermore, this segment manufactures and
markets a variety of specialty chemical products including organosulfur chemicals, solvents,
catalysts, drilling chemicals, mining chemicals and high-performance engineering plastics and
compounds.

CPChem’s domestic facilities are located in California, Connecticut, Illinois, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Ohio and Texas. International facilities are located in Belgium, Brazil, China,
Columbia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and South Korea.

CPChem owns a 49 percent interest in Qatar Chemical Company Ltd. (Q-Chem), a joint venture that
owns a major olefins and polyolefins complex in Mesaieed, Qatar. CPChem also owns a 49 percent
interest in Qatar Chemical Company II Ltd. (Q-Chem II), a joint venture that began construction of
a second complex in Mesaieed in 2005. This Q-Chem II facility is designed to produce polyethylene
and normal alpha olefins on a site adjacent to the Q-Chem complex. In connection with this
project, CPChem entered into a separate agreement establishing a joint venture to develop an
ethylene cracker in Ras Laffan Industrial City, Qatar. Operational startup of the Q-Chem II
project is anticipated in late 2009.

In 2003, CPChem formed a 50-percent-owned joint venture company to develop an integrated styrene
facility in Al Jubail, Saudi Arabia. The facility is being built adjacent to the existing
aromatics complex owned by Saudi Chevron Phillips Company (SCP), another 50-percent-owned CPChem
joint venture. Construction of the facility, which began in the fourth quarter of 2004, is in
conjunction with an expansion of SCP’s existing benzene plant, together called the “JCP Project.”
Operational startup occurred in the third quarter of 2008, while project completion is anticipated
during the first quarter of 2009.

In 2007, CPChem formed a 50-percent-owned joint venture, Saudi Polymers Company (SPC), to construct
and operate an integrated petrochemicals complex at Al Jubail, Saudi Arabia. Construction began in
January 2008, and commercial production is scheduled to begin in late 2011. Prior to project
completion, based on a planned initial public offering of shares in CPChem’s joint venture
partner’s company and a corresponding increase in the partner’s ownership interest in SPC, CPChem’s
ownership is expected to decline to 35 percent.

In 2007, CPChem and the Dow Chemical Company signed a nonbinding Memorandum of Understanding
relating to the formation of a joint venture involving assets from their polystyrene and styrene
monomer businesses. Joint venture operations commenced in May 2008, with CPChem contributing two
domestic plants and Dow contributing four domestic and two international plants.

EMERGING BUSINESSES

At December 31, 2008, our Emerging Businesses segment represented 1 percent of ConocoPhillips’
total assets. The segment encompasses the development of new technologies and businesses outside
our normal scope of operations. Activities within this segment are currently focused on power
generation and innovation of new technologies, such as those related to conventional and
nonconventional hydrocarbon recovery (including heavy oil), refining, alternative energy, biofuels
and the environment.



The focus of our power business is on developing projects to support our E&P and R&M strategies.
While projects primarily in place to enable these strategies are included within their respective
segments, projects with a significant merchant component are included in the Emerging Businesses
segment.

The Immingham combined heat and power plant (CHP), a wholly owned 730-megawatt facility in the
United Kingdom, provides steam and electricity to the Humber refinery and steam to a neighboring
refinery, as well as merchant power into the U.K. market. In October 2006, we announced we would
expand capacity at Immingham to 1,180 megawatts. Development work on Immingham phase 2 began with
the award of a contract for front-end engineering and securing of additional connection
availability to the U.K. grid. Commercial operation of the expansion is expected to start in
mid-2009.

We also own a gas-fired cogeneration plant in Orange, Texas, as well as a 50 percent operating
interest in Sweeny Cogeneration LP, a joint venture near the Sweeny refinery complex.

Our Technology group focuses on developing new business opportunities designed to provide future
growth prospects for ConocoPhillips. Areas of interest include advanced hydrocarbon processes,
energy conversion technologies, new petroleum-based products, renewable fuels and carbon capture
technology. We have commercialized production of renewable diesel, a new type of renewable fuel
that utilizes existing infrastructure. In 2007, we formed a research relationship with Iowa State
University to develop new methods for producing second-generation biofuels. In addition, we have
formed alliances with Tyson Foods and Archer Daniels Midland to produce and market the next
generation of renewable transportation fuels. We have also formed an internal group that is
evaluating wind, solar and geothermal investment opportunities.

We are working with General Electric Company to develop a technology center in Qatar to research
water sustainability solutions for petroleum, petrochemical, municipal and agricultural
applications. The Qatar center will examine ways of treating and using by-product water from oil
production and refining operations, as well as other projects relating to industrial and municipal
water sustainability. In conjunction with the Interim Agreement to develop the Shah field with the
Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, we are planning to develop a technology center in Abu Dhabi that
will conduct research and provide technical service in areas including reservoir management and
development of sour gas fields; safe and efficient processing of gas with high hydrogen sulfide and
carbon dioxide concentrations; and sour gas sequestration. Both centers are expected to open in
2009.

We offer a gasification technology (E-Gas) that uses petroleum coke, coal, and other low-value
hydrocarbons as feedstock, resulting in high-value synthesis gas used for a slate of products,
including power, hydrogen and chemicals. In 2008, we completed a feasibility study and submitted
applications for all required environmental permits related to a proposed coal-to-substitute
natural gas (SNG) facility, which would have a capacity of 60 billion to 70 billion cubic feet per
year and be located in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky. We also became a founding member of the
Western Kentucky Carbon Storage Foundation, which is funding evaluation of carbon storage in deep
underground formations through a test well project directed by the Kentucky Geologic Survey.

A conceptual engineering study was completed in 2008 for a project at our Sweeny refinery in Texas
that would utilize E-Gas technology to convert petroleum coke to low-carbon power or SNG and
hydrogen. To minimize carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the facility, the proposed design allows
CO2 to be captured, transported and safely stored in nearby geological formations. This project
would increase clean energy supply while establishing critical carbon capture and storage
infrastructure in the Texas Gulf Coast region. A more detailed feasibility study is expected in
2009.

COMPETITION

We compete with private, public and state-owned companies in all facets of the petroleum and
chemicals businesses. Some of our competitors are larger and have greater resources. Each of our
segments is highly competitive. No single competitor, or small group of competitors, dominates any
of our business lines.



Upstream, our E&P segment competes with numerous other companies in the industry to locate and
obtain new sources of supply and to produce oil and natural gas in an efficient, cost-effective
manner. Based on publicly available year-end 2007 reserves statistics, we had the sixth-largest total of worldwide proved
reserves of nongovernment-controlled companies. We deliver our oil and natural gas production into
the worldwide oil and natural gas commodity markets. Principal methods of competing include
geological, geophysical and engineering research and technology; experience and expertise; economic
analysis in connection with property acquisitions; and operating efficient oil and gas producing
properties.

The Midstream segment, through our equity investment in DCP Midstream and our consolidated
operations, competes with numerous other integrated petroleum companies, as well as natural gas
transmission and distribution companies, to deliver components of natural gas to end users in the
commodity natural gas markets. DCP Midstream is a large producer of natural gas liquids in the
United States. Principal methods of competing include economically securing the right to purchase
raw natural gas into gathering systems, managing the pressure of those systems, operating efficient
natural gas liquids processing plants, and securing markets for the products produced.

Downstream, our R&M segment competes primarily in the United States, Europe and the Asia Pacific
region. Based on the statistics published in the December 22, 2008, issue of the

Oil & Gas
Journal

, our R&M segment had the second-largest U.S. refining capacity of 18 large refiners of
petroleum products. Worldwide, our refining capacity ranked fourth among nongovernment-controlled
companies. In the Chemicals segment, CPChem generally ranked within the top 10 producers of many
of its major product lines, based on average 2008 production capacity, as published by industry
sources. Petroleum products, petrochemicals and plastics are delivered into the worldwide
commodity markets. Elements of competition for both our R&M and Chemicals segments include product
improvement, new product development, low-cost structures, and improved manufacturing and
distribution systems. In the marketing portion of the business, competitive factors include
product properties and processibility, reliability of supply, customer service, price and credit
terms, advertising and sales promotion, and development of customer loyalty to ConocoPhillips’ or
CPChem’s branded products.

GENERAL

At the end of 2008, we held a total of 1,464 active patents in 81 countries worldwide, including
556 active U.S. patents. During 2008, we received 39 patents in the United States and 58 foreign
patents. Our products and processes generated licensing revenues of $38 million in 2008. The
overall profitability of any business segment is not dependent on any single patent, trademark,
license, franchise or concession.

Company-sponsored research and development activities charged against earnings were $209 million,
$160 million, and $117 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS

You should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information
included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Each of these risk factors could adversely affect our
business, operating results and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an
investment in our common stock.

Our operating results, our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets are exposed
to the effects of changing commodity prices and refining margins.

Our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices we
receive for our crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and refined products. The factors
influencing the prices of crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and refined products are
beyond our control. Lower crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and refined products prices
may reduce the amount of these commodities we can produce economically, which may have a material
adverse effect on our revenues, operating income and cash flows.

Unless we successfully add to our existing proved reserves, our future crude oil and natural gas
production will decline, resulting in harm to our business.

The rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are
depleted. Except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration and development activities,
or, through engineering studies, identify additional or secondary recovery reserves, our proved
reserves will decline materially as we produce crude oil and natural gas. Accordingly, to the
extent we are unsuccessful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas we produce with good
prospects for future production, our business will suffer reduced cash flows and results of
operations.

Any material change in the factors and assumptions underlying our estimates of crude oil and
natural gas reserves could impair the quantity and value of those reserves.

Our proved crude oil and natural gas reserve information included in this annual report has been
derived from engineering estimates prepared or reviewed by our personnel. Any significant future
price changes will have a material effect on the quantity and present value of our proved reserves.
Future reserve revisions could also result from changes in, among other things, governmental
regulation. Reserve estimation is a subjective process that involves estimating volumes to be
recovered from underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas that cannot be directly
measured. As a result, different petroleum engineers, each using industry-accepted geologic and
engineering practices and scientific methods, may produce different estimates of reserves and
future net cash flows based on the same available data. Any changes in the factors and assumptions
underlying our estimates of these items could result in a material negative impact to the volume of
reserves reported.

We expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of
our compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations. Likewise, future
environmental laws and regulations may impact or limit our current business plans and reduce demand
for our products.

Our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the
environment. These laws and regulations continue to increase in both number and complexity and
affect our operations with respect to, among other things:

•

The discharge of pollutants into the environment.

•

Emissions into the atmosphere (such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and mercury
emissions, or potential future control of greenhouse gas emissions).



•

The handling, use, storage, transportation, disposal and clean up of hazardous materials and
hazardous and nonhazardous wastes.

•

The dismantlement, abandonment and restoration of our properties and facilities at the
end of their useful lives.

We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and
remediation expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations. To the extent these
expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and
services, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future periods
could be materially adversely affected.

Domestic and worldwide political and economic developments could damage our operations and
materially reduce our profitability and cash flows.

Actions of the U.S., state and local governments through tax and other legislation, executive order
and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability both in the United States and
abroad. The U.S. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries.
These restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate
in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries. Actions by both the United States and
host governments have affected operations significantly in the past, such as the expropriation of
our oil assets by the Venezuelan government, and will continue to do so in the future.

Local political and economic factors in international markets could have a material adverse effect
on us. Approximately 56 percent of our crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production
in 2008 was derived from production outside the United States, and 62 percent of our proved
reserves, as of December 31, 2008, were located outside the United States. We are subject to risks
associated with operations in international markets, including changes in foreign governmental
policies relating to crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids or refined product pricing and
taxation, other political, economic or diplomatic developments, changing political conditions and
international monetary fluctuations.

The
current financial crisis could have a material adverse affect on our
financial strength and that of our business co-venturers.

Recent disruptions in the credit markets and concerns about global economic growth have had a
significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices, both of which have
contributed to a decline in our stock price and corresponding market capitalization. A lower level
of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our
revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. Decreased returns on
pension fund assets may also materially increase our pension funding requirements. Likewise, the
capital and credit markets have become increasingly volatile as a result of adverse conditions. If
the capital and credit markets continue to experience volatility and the availability of funds
remains limited, we, and third parties with whom we do business, may incur increased costs
associated with issuing commercial paper and/or other debt instruments and this, in turn, could
adversely affect our ability to advance our strategic plans as currently contemplated. In this
context, changes in our debt rating could have a material adverse effect on our interest costs and
financing sources.

Changes in governmental regulations may impose price controls and limitations on production of
crude oil and natural gas.

Our operations are subject to extensive governmental regulations. From time to time, regulatory
agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow
of crude oil and natural gas wells below actual production capacity in order to conserve supplies
of crude oil and natural gas. Because legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to
interpretation, we cannot predict the effect of these requirements.



Our investments in joint ventures decrease our ability to manage risk.

We conduct many of our operations through joint ventures in which we may share control with our
joint venture participants. There is a risk that our joint venture participants may at any time
have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with those of the joint
venture or us, or that our joint venture participants may be unable to meet their economic or other
obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. Failure by us, or an entity
in which we have a joint venture interest, to adequately manage the risks associated with any
acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or
results of operations of our joint ventures and, in turn, our business and operations.

Our operations are inherently dangerous and require significant and continuous oversight.

The scope and nature of our operations present a variety of operational hazards and risks that must
be managed through continual oversight and control. These risks are present throughout the process
of extraction, transportation, refinement and storage of the hydrocarbons we produce. Failure to
manage these risks could result in injury or loss of life, environmental damage, loss of revenues
and damage to our reputation.

Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

None.

Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The following is a description of reportable legal proceedings, including those involving
governmental authorities under federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials
into the environment for this reporting period. The following proceedings include those matters
that arose during the fourth quarter of 2008, as well as matters previously reported in our 2007
Form 10-K and our first-, second- and third-quarter 2008 Form 10-Qs that were not resolved prior to
the fourth quarter of 2008. Material developments to the previously-reported matters have been
included in the descriptions below. While it is not possible to accurately predict the final
outcome of these pending proceedings, if any one or more of such proceedings was decided adversely
to ConocoPhillips, we expect there would be no material effect on our consolidated financial
position. Nevertheless, such proceedings are reported pursuant to the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission’s regulations.

Our U.S. refineries are implementing two separate consent decrees, regarding alleged violations of
the Federal Clean Air Act, with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), six states and one
local air pollution agency. Some of the requirements and limitations contained in the decree
provide for stipulated penalties for violations. Stipulated penalties under the decrees are not
automatic, but must be requested by one of the agency signatories. As part of periodic reports
under the decree and/or other reports required by permits or regulations, we occasionally report
matters which could be subject to a request for stipulated penalties. If a specific request for
stipulated penalties meeting the reporting threshold set forth in U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission rules is made pursuant to these decrees based on a given reported exceedance, we will
separately report that matter and the amount of the proposed penalty.

New Matters

On October 23, 2008, ConocoPhillips received a demand from the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality
Control Board (LARWQCB) to settle multiple alleged exceedances of National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System Permit effluent limits at its Los Angeles Lubricants plant dating back to 2000.
The amount of the demand is $174,000. We will work with the LARWQCB to resolve these allegations.



On December 15, 2008, the Trainer refinery received Citations and a Notification of Penalty
(Citation) from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for 26 alleged violations
noted during the OSHA National Emphasis Program review of the refinery. The Citation seeks
$115,500 in penalties for a variety of alleged Process Safety Management violations. We are
working with OSHA to resolve this matter.

Matters Previously Reported

The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) conducted an audit of the Los Angeles
refinery in 2007 to assess compliance with applicable local, state, and federal regulations related
to fugitive emissions. As a result of the audit, SCAQMD issued three Notices of Violations (NOVs)
alleging multiple counts of noncompliance. We resolved two of the three NOVs for a total payment
of $42,500 in the third quarter of 2008 and reached an agreement with SCAQMD to resolve the third
NOV for $12,500 in the fourth quarter of 2008.

SCAQMD conducted an audit of the Los Angeles refinery in August 2008 to assess compliance with
applicable local, state and federal regulations related to fugitive emissions. As a result of the
audit, on August 28, 2008, SCAQMD issued five NOVs alleging noncompliance. SCAQMD has not yet
specified a penalty for these alleged violations. We are working with SCAQMD to resolve these NOVs.

On July 16, 2008, ConocoPhillips received a demand from the Bay Area Air Quality Management
District (BAAQMD) to settle 24 NOVs issued in late 2006 and 2007 for alleged violations of air
pollution-control regulations at the San Francisco refinery. The amount of the settlement demand
is $304,500. On December 29, 2008, BAAQMD added an additional seven NOVs issued in 2008 and a
corresponding additional $340,500 to its settlement demand. We are working with BAAQMD to resolve
these NOVs.

On June 2, 2008, the Billings refinery received a Violation Letter from the Montana Department of
Environmental Quality (MDEQ) for opacity and nickel emissions, which occurred during startup of the
catalytic cracker in April 2007. The letter also alleged certain monitoring quality
assurance/quality control violations. The letter requests a penalty of $604,000. We intend to
work with the MDEQ to resolve this matter.

On March 27, 2008, the Trainer refinery received a proposed Consent Assessment of Civil Penalty
from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) for alleged air quality
violations that occurred from 2002 to 2007. The assessment covers several categories of alleged
air quality violations including emission events, air emissions inventory reporting, and violation
of permit conditions. We paid $129,424 in the fourth quarter of 2008 to resolve this matter.

On March 27, 2008, the Sweeny refinery received a Notice of Enforcement (NOE) from the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) for an emissions event related to flaring that occurred
on January 28, 2008. A penalty of $32,000 was submitted to the TCEQ in September 2008. This
matter is subject to formal approval by the TCEQ Commissioners. We expect consideration of
approval to occur in the first quarter of 2009.

On February 11, 2008, ConocoPhillips Alaska, Inc. (CPAI) received an NOV from the North Slope
Borough (NSB) in relation to its Alpine facility on the North Slope of Alaska. The NOV alleges
that three fuel tanks at the Alpine facility lacked adequate containment and/or setbacks from water
bodies. There was no environmental impact due to these alleged violations. The NOV proposed
penalties of $207,000, which was later reduced to $128,000. CPAI paid the reduced penalty under
protest in accordance with the payment demands in the NOV. On March 11, 2008, CPAI filed an appeal
with the NSB Planning Commission challenging the alleged violations and penalties in the NOV. We
will continue to work with the NSB to resolve this matter.



In
October 2003, the District Attorney’s Office in Sacramento, California, filed a complaint in
Superior Court for alleged methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) contamination in groundwater. On
April 4, 2008, the District Attorney’s Office filed an amended complaint that included alleged
violations of state regulations relating to operation or maintenance of underground storage tanks.
There are numerous defendants named in the suit in addition to ConocoPhillips. We intend to
continue to contest this lawsuit.

In October 2007, we received a Complaint from the U.S. EPA alleging violations of the Clean Water
Act related to a 2006 oil spill at our Bayway refinery and proposing a penalty of $156,000. We are
working with the EPA and the U.S. Coast Guard to resolve this matter.

On December 16, 2005, the Bayway refinery experienced a hydrocarbon spill to the Rahway River and
Arthur Kill. On August 26, 2006, we signed an Order on Consent with the state of New York pursuant
to which we paid a penalty of $50,000 and conducted a beach cleanup. Also in December 2008, we
paid a total of $106,578 for natural resource damages and other costs to the New Jersey Department
of Environmental Protection, the U.S. Department of the Interior and the U.S. Department of Commerce.
This matter is resolved.

In March 2005, ConocoPhillips Pipe Line Company (CPPL) received a Notice of Probable Violation and
Proposed Civil Penalty from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous
Materials Safety Administration (DOT) alleging violation of DOT operation and safety regulations at
certain facilities in Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Wyoming and Nebraska. DOT is proposing
penalties in the amount of $184,500. An information hearing was held on September 24, 2007. CPPL
has provided additional information in support of its position. We are currently awaiting a ruling
from DOT.

The U.S. Coast Guard and Washington State Department of Ecology investigated the possible sources
of an oil spill in Puget Sound. In November 2004, the U.S. Attorney and the U.S. Coast Guard
offices in Seattle, Washington, issued subpoenas to Polar Tankers, Inc., a subsidiary of
ConocoPhillips Company, for records related to the vessel Polar Texas. On December 23, 2004, the
governor of the state of Washington and the U.S. Coast Guard publicly announced they believed the
Polar Texas was the source of the spill. The company fully cooperated with the investigations.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Seattle declined prosecution of the company. As previously reported,
Polar Tankers, ConocoPhillips and the state of Washington settled the matter, with payment of civil
penalties and response costs. The settlement did not include any admission of liability. The
company and the authorities remain in settlement negotiations regarding the natural resource damage
assessment.

In April 2004, in response to several historical spills at the Albuquerque Products Terminal, we
received an Administrative Compliance Order from the New Mexico Environment Department. The order
does not propose a penalty assessment, but rather attempts to impose specific design, construction
and operational changes. We have been in negotiations with the agency and in June 2007 proposed a
settlement offer of $100,000. We will continue to work with the agency to resolve this matter.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

ConocoPhillips is an international, integrated energy company. We are the third-largest integrated
energy company in the United States, based on market capitalization. We have approximately 33,800
employees worldwide, and at year-end 2008 had assets of $143 billion. Our stock is listed on the
New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “COP.”

Our business is organized into six operating segments:

•

Exploration and Production (E&P)

—This segment primarily explores for, produces,
transports and markets crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis.

•

Midstream

—This segment gathers, processes and markets natural gas produced by
ConocoPhillips and others, and fractionates and markets natural gas liquids, predominantly
in the United States and Trinidad. The Midstream segment primarily consists of our 50
percent equity investment in DCP Midstream, LLC.

•

Refining and Marketing (R&M)

—This segment purchases, refines, markets and transports
crude oil and petroleum products, mainly in the United States, Europe and Asia.

•

LUKOIL Investment

—This segment consists of our equity investment in the ordinary shares
of OAO LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia.
At December 31, 2008, our ownership interest was 20 percent based on issued shares and
20.06 percent based on estimated shares outstanding.

•

Chemicals

—This segment manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a
worldwide basis. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in
Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem).

•

Emerging Businesses

—This segment represents our investment in new technologies or
businesses outside our normal scope of operations.



In 2008, the energy industry was characterized by extreme volatility. Forecasts of worldwide
economic growth and increasingly scarce supply, a weakening U.S. dollar, and other factors helped
drive crude oil prices to record highs. This was followed by an abrupt shift into a severe global
financial recession, which reduced current and forecasted demand for petroleum products. Because
of this, crude oil prices fell rapidly and refining margins also significantly weakened.

As a result of the significant drop in global equity markets during the fourth quarter of 2008, we
recorded two individually significant impairments in 2008 that were primarily linked to market
capitalizations—a $25.4 billion write-down of our E&P segment’s recorded goodwill, and a $7.4
billion reduction in the carrying value of our LUKOIL investment. These impairments contributed to
a net loss in 2008 of $17.0 billion, compared with net income in 2007 of $11.9 billion, which
includes the impact of a $4.5 billion impairment due to
expropriation of our Venezuelan assets.
Since these 2008 and 2007 impairment charges were noncash, they did not impact our cash provided by
operating activities, which was $22.7 billion in 2008, compared with $24.6 billion in 2007.

Crude oil and natural gas prices, along with refining margins, are the most significant factors in
our profitability, and are driven by market factors over which we have no control. However, from a
competitive perspective, there are other important factors we must manage well to be successful,
including:

•

Operating our producing properties and refining and marketing operations safely,
consistently and in an environmentally sound manner.

Safety is
our first priority, and
we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our
operations and the communities in which we operate. Maintaining high utilization rates at
our refineries and minimizing downtime in producing fields enable us to capture the value
available in the market in terms of prices and margins. During 2008, our worldwide
refining capacity utilization rate was 90 percent, compared with 94 percent in 2007. The
lower rate primarily reflects reduced throughput at our Wilhelmshaven, Germany, refinery
due to economic conditions, as well as higher unplanned downtime including impacts from
hurricanes in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. Concerning the environment, we strive to conduct
our operations in a manner consistent with our environmental stewardship principles.

•

Adding to our proved reserve base.

We primarily add to our proved reserve base
in three ways:

•

Successful exploration and development of new fields.

•

Acquisition of existing fields.

•

Applying new technologies and processes to improve recovery from existing fields.

Through a combination of all three methods listed above, we have been successful in the past
in maintaining or adding to our production and proved reserve base. Although it cannot be
assured, we anticipate being able to do so in the future. In the three years ending
December 31, 2008, our reserve replacement was 124 percent, including the impacts of the
Burlington Resources acquisition, additional equity investments in LUKOIL, the FCCL Oil
Sands Partnership with EnCana, the Australia Pacific LNG joint venture with Origin Energy,
and the expropriation of our Venezuelan oil assets.

Access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is
prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make
projects uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from
national oil companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or
other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such,
the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to
replace our production over subsequent years.

•

Controlling costs and expenses.

Since we cannot control the prices of the
commodity products we sell, controlling operating and overhead costs, within the context of
our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, are high priorities. We monitor
these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly, on
both an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit basis. Because managing operating and overhead
costs is critical to maintaining competitive positions in our



industries, cost control is a component of our variable compensation programs. In response
to the current depressed market environment, we expect to reduce our work force in 2009,
reduce the headcount of contractors, and continue to emphasize cost discipline throughout
our operations.

With the rise in commodity prices over the last several years and through the first half of
2008, and the subsequent increase in industry-wide spending on capital and major maintenance
programs, we and other energy companies experienced inflation for the costs of certain goods
and services in excess of general worldwide inflationary trends. Such costs included rates
for drilling rigs, steel and other raw materials, as well as costs for skilled labor. With
the weakening of the economy and the decline in commodity prices, our industry began to see
some relief from this upward cost pressure in late 2008 and into early 2009.

•

Selecting the appropriate projects in which to invest our capital dollars.

We
participate in capital-intensive industries. As a result, we must often invest significant
capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields, develop newly discovered fields,
maintain existing fields, or continue to maintain and improve our refinery complexes. We
invest in those projects that are expected to provide an adequate financial return on
invested dollars. However, there are often long lead times from the time we make an
investment to the time that investment is operational and begins generating financial
returns.

In October 2008, we formed Australia Pacific LNG, a 50/50 joint venture with Origin Energy
for the development of coalbed natural gas in Australia, and the subsequent liquefaction and
transport of the liquefied natural gas targeting Asia Pacific markets. In January 2007, we entered
into two 50/50 business ventures with EnCana to create an integrated North American heavy
oil business, consisting of the upstream FCCL Oil Sands Partnership in Canada and the
downstream WRB Refining LLC in the United States.

Our capital expenditures and investments in 2008 totaled $19.1 billion, and we anticipate
capital expenditures and investments to be approximately $11.7 billion in 2009. The reduced
capital budget in 2009 reflects the impact of the Origin transaction on the 2008 totals, and
a planned reduction in response to current market conditions. In addition to our capital
program, we paid dividends on our common stock of $2.9 billion in 2008, and repurchased $8.2
billion of our common stock.

•

Managing our asset portfolio.

We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire
assets that will contribute to future growth at competitive prices. The 2006 Burlington
Resources acquisition, the 2007 EnCana business ventures, and the 2008 Origin Energy joint
venture are examples of such activity. We also continually assess our assets to determine
if any no longer fit our strategic plans and should be sold or otherwise disposed. This
management of our asset portfolio is important to ensuring our long-term growth and
maintaining adequate financial returns. In 2008, we completed the disposition of our
retail marketing assets in Norway, Sweden and Denmark, and we also sold all of our E&P
properties in Argentina and the Netherlands. We closed on the sale of a large part of our
U.S. retail marketing assets in January 2009.

•

Developing and retaining a talented work force.

We strive to attract, train,
develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business
strategy and who support our values and ethics. Throughout the company, we focus on the
continued learning, development and technical training of our employees. Professional new
hires participate in structured development programs designed to accelerate their technical
and functional skills.

Our key performance indicators are shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the
operating segment sections that follow. These include crude oil, natural gas and natural gas
liquids prices and production, refining capacity utilization, and refinery output.



Other significant factors that can affect our profitability include:

•

Impairments.

As mentioned above, we participate in capital-intensive
industries. At times, our investments become impaired when our reserve estimates are
revised downward, when crude oil or natural gas prices, or refinery margins decline
significantly for long periods of time, or when a decision to dispose of an asset leads to
a write-down to its fair market value. We may also invest large amounts of money in
exploration blocks which, if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to a
material impairment of leasehold values. Before-tax impairments in 2008, excluding the
goodwill impairment discussed below and a $7.4 billion impairment related to our LUKOIL
investment, totaled $1.7 billion. This amount compares with $0.4 billion of impairments,
excluding the impairment of expropriated assets (discussed below), in 2007.

•

Goodwill.

At year-end 2008, we had $3.8 billion of goodwill on our balance
sheet, compared with $29.3 billion at year-end 2007. In 2008, we recorded a $25.4 billion
complete impairment of our E&P segment goodwill, primarily as a function of decreased
year-end commodity prices and the decline in our market capitalization. For additional
information, see Note 9—Goodwill and Intangibles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. Deterioration of market conditions in the future could lead to other goodwill
impairments that may have a substantial negative, though noncash, effect on our
profitability.

•

Effective tax rate.

Our operations are located in countries with different tax
rates and fiscal structures. Accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and
fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly
between periods based on the “mix” of pretax earnings within our global operations.

•

Fiscal and regulatory environment.

As commodity prices and refining margins
fluctuated upward over the last several years, certain governments have responded with
changes to their fiscal take. These changes have generally negatively impacted our results
of operations, and further changes to government fiscal take could have a negative impact
on future operations. In June 2007, our Venezuelan oil projects were expropriated, and we
recorded a $4.5 billion after-tax impairment (see the “Expropriated Assets” section of Note
10—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The company was also
negatively impacted by increased production taxes enacted by the state of Alaska in the
fourth quarter of 2007. In October 2007, the government of Ecuador increased the tax rate
of the Windfall Profits Tax Law implemented in 2006, increasing the amount of government
royalty entitlement on crude oil production to 99 percent of any increase in the price of
crude oil above a contractual reference price. In Canada, the Alberta provincial
government changed the royalty structure for Crown lands, effective January 1, 2009, so
that a component of the new royalty rate is tied to prevailing prices. In October 2008, we
and our co-venturers signed definitive agreements for the proportional dilution of our
equity interests in the Republic of Kazakhstan’s North Caspian Sea Production Sharing
Agreement, which includes the Kashagan field, to allow the state-owned energy company to
increase its ownership percentage effective January 1, 2008. Partially offsetting the
above fiscal take increases were lower corporate income tax rates enacted by Canada and
Germany during 2007. These tax rate reductions applied to all corporations and were not
exclusive to the oil and gas industry.



Segment Analysis

The E&P segment’s results are most closely linked to crude oil and natural gas prices. These are
commodity products, the prices of which are subject to factors external to our company and over
which we have no control. Industry crude oil prices for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) were higher
in 2008, compared with 2007, averaging $99.56 per barrel in 2008, an increase of 38 percent. The
increase was driven by concerns during the first half of 2008 of adequate supplies given the strong
oil demand growth in developing Asia and the Middle East. The average annual price for WTI
moderated due to the economic crisis in the second half of 2008 that impacted demand from all
regions of the world. Industry natural gas prices for Henry Hub increased 32 percent during 2008
to an average price of $9.04 per million British thermal units (MMBTU), primarily due to increased
demand from the industrial and electric power sector during the first half of 2008 and higher oil
prices. These factors were moderated by higher domestic production and lower demand, which led to
higher storage in the second half of 2008.

The Midstream segment’s results are most closely linked to natural gas liquids prices. The most
important factor on the profitability of this segment is the results from our 50 percent equity
investment in DCP Midstream. DCP Midstream’s natural gas liquids prices increased 11 percent in
2008.

Refining margins, refinery utilization, cost control and marketing margins primarily drive the R&M
segment’s results. Refining margins are subject to movements in the cost of crude oil and other
feedstocks, and the sales prices for refined products, both of which are subject to market factors
over which we have no control. Industry refining margins in the United States were lower overall
in comparison with 2007. The primary factor contributing to the reduced refining margins in 2008
was a decrease in gasoline demand.

The LUKOIL Investment segment consists of our investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL. At
December 31, 2008, our ownership interest in LUKOIL was 20 percent based on issued shares and 20.06
percent based on estimated shares outstanding. LUKOIL’s results are subject to factors similar to
those of our E&P and R&M segments. LUKOIL’s upstream results are closely linked to Russian (Urals)
crude oil prices and are heavily impacted by extraction tax rates. Refining margins are
significant factors on LUKOIL’s downstream results. Export tariff rates for crude oil and refined
products also have a significant impact on both upstream and downstream results.

The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in CPChem. The chemicals and plastics
industry is mainly a commodity-based industry where the margins for key products are based on
market factors over which CPChem has little or no control. CPChem is investing in
feedstock-advantaged areas in the Middle East with access to large, growing markets, such as Asia.

The Emerging Businesses segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside
our normal scope of operations. Activities within this segment are currently focused on power
generation and innovation of new technologies, such as those related to conventional and
nonconventional hydrocarbon recovery (including heavy oil), refining, alternative energy, biofuels
and the environment. Some of these technologies have the potential to become important drivers of
profitability in future years.

2008 vs. 2007

The lower results in 2008 were primarily the result of:

•

A $25,443 million before- and after-tax goodwill impairment of all E&P segment goodwill.
This impairment was recorded during the fourth quarter.

•

A $7,410 million before- and after-tax impairment of our LUKOIL investment taken during
the fourth quarter.

•

Lower U.S. refining margins in our R&M segment.

•

An increase in other asset impairments, predominantly in our E&P and R&M segments.

These items were partially offset by:

•

Higher crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, benefiting our E&P,
Midstream and LUKOIL Investment segments. Commodity price benefits were somewhat
counteracted by increased production taxes.

•

A 2007 complete impairment ($4,588 million before-tax, $4,512 million after-tax) of our
oil interests in Venezuela, resulting from their expropriation on June 26, 2007.

2007 vs. 2006

The lower results in 2007 were primarily the result of:

•

The complete impairment of our oil interests in Venezuela.

•

Lower crude oil production in the E&P segment.

•

Higher production and operating expenses, higher production taxes, and higher
depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in the E&P segment.

These items were partially offset by:

•

The net benefit of asset rationalization efforts in the E&P and R&M segments.

•

Higher realized crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids prices in the E&P
segment.

•

Higher realized worldwide refining margins, including the benefit of planned inventory
reductions, in the R&M segment.

•

Increased equity earnings from our investment in LUKOIL due to higher estimated
commodity prices and volumes, and an increase in our average equity ownership percentage.



Statement of Operations Analysis

2008 vs. 2007

Sales and other operating revenues

increased 28 percent in 2008, while

purchased crude
oil, natural gas and products

increased 37 percent. These increases were mainly the result of
higher petroleum product prices and higher prices for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas
liquids.

Equity in earnings of affiliates

decreased 16 percent in 2008, reflecting:

•

Lower results from WRB Refining LLC, due to lower margins and a decline in equity
ownership in accordance with the designed formation of the venture.

•

Lower results from CPChem, due to higher operating costs, lower specialties, aromatics
and styrenics margins, and lower olefins and polyolefins volumes.

•

The absence of earnings from our heavy oil joint ventures expropriated by Venezuela in
2007.

•

Increased losses related to our Naryanmarneftegaz (NMNG) joint venture as a result of
higher production taxes and increased depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) costs
during the startup and early production phase of the Yuzhno Khylchuyu (YK) field.

These negative results were somewhat offset by improved results from the FCCL Oil Sands
Partnership, DCP Midstream, LUKOIL (excluding the investment impairment), and CFJ Properties.

Other income

decreased 45 percent during 2008, mainly due to a lower net benefit from asset
rationalization efforts, the release in 2007 of escrowed funds associated with our Hamaca joint
venture in Venezuela, and the settlement of retroactive adjustments for crude oil quality
differentials on Trans-Alaska Pipeline System shipments (Quality Bank) in 2007.

Exploration expenses

increased 33 percent during 2008, reflecting increased dry hole costs
and higher expenses for post-discovery feasibility and development planning studies.

Impairments

increased from $5,030 million in 2007 to $34,539 million in 2008. This
increase reflects a $25,443 million goodwill impairment recorded during 2008 in our E&P segment.
Also contributing to the increase was a $7,410 million impairment of our LUKOIL investment taken
during 2008. These 2008 impairments were partially offset by a 2007 impairment of $4,588 million
related to the expropriation of our oil interests in Venezuela.

Other impairments increased $1,244 million during 2008 primarily due to property impairments taken
in response to a significantly diminished outlook for crude oil and natural gas prices, refining
margins and power spreads, as well as in response to revised capital spending plans. For
additional information, see Note 7—Investments, Loans, and Long-Term Receivables, Note 9—Goodwill
and Intangibles, and Note 10—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Interest and debt expense

decreased 25 percent in 2008, primarily due to lower average
interest rates, as well as the absence of 2007 interest expense related to the Alaska Quality Bank
settlements.

Foreign currency transaction losses

incurred during 2008 totaled $117 million, compared
with foreign currency transaction gains of $201 million in 2007. This change occurred as the
Canadian dollar, Russian rouble, British pound, and euro all weakened against the U.S. dollar
during 2008, compared with the strengthening of these currencies against the U.S. dollar in 2007.

See Note 21—Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information
regarding our

income tax expense

and effective tax rate.



2007 vs. 2006

Equity in earnings of affiliates

increased 21 percent in 2007. The increase reflects
earnings from WRB and FCCL, our downstream and upstream business ventures with EnCana, formed in
January 2007. Also, we had improved results from LUKOIL, reflecting higher estimated commodity
prices and volumes, and an increase in our average equity ownership percentage. These increases
were partially offset by lower earnings from Hamaca and Petrozuata, our heavy oil joint ventures
expropriated by Venezuela in the second quarter of 2007. Additionally, CPChem reported lower
earnings, primarily due to lower olefins and polyolefins margins.

Other income

increased 188 percent during 2007, primarily due to:

•

Higher net gains on asset dispositions associated with asset rationalization efforts.

•

The release in 2007 of escrowed funds related to the extinguishment of Hamaca project
financing.

•

The Alaska Quality Bank settlements in 2007.

These increases were partially offset by the recognition in 2006 of recoveries on business
interruption insurance claims attributable to losses sustained from hurricanes in 2005.

Exploration expenses

increased 21 percent during 2007, primarily reflecting the
amortization of unproved North American leaseholds obtained in the Burlington Resources acquisition
and the impairment of an international exploration license. The increase also reflects higher
geological and geophysical expenses and higher dry hole costs.

Depreciation, depletion and amortization

increased 14 percent during 2007, primarily
resulting from the addition of Burlington Resources’ assets in the E&P segment’s depreciable asset
base for a full year in 2007 versus only nine months in 2006.

Impairments

reflects an impairment of $4,588 million related to the expropriation of our
oil interests in Venezuela recorded in the second quarter of 2007. Impairments unrelated to the
expropriation decreased 35 percent during 2007, primarily due to impairments recorded in 2006 of
certain assets held for sale in the R&M segment, comprised of properties, plants and equipment,
trademark intangibles and goodwill.

Interest and debt expense

increased 15 percent during 2007, primarily due to the interest
expense component of the Alaska Quality Bank settlements, as well as higher expense associated with
the funding requirements for the business venture with EnCana.

Foreign currency transaction gains

during 2007 primarily reflect the strengthening of the
Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar.

The E&P segment explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, natural gas and natural
gas liquids on a worldwide basis. It also mines deposits of oil sands in Canada to extract the
bitumen and upgrade it into a synthetic crude oil. At December 31, 2008, our E&P operations were
producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Ecuador, Australia, offshore
Timor-Leste in the Timor Sea, Indonesia, China, Vietnam, Libya, Nigeria, Algeria and Russia.

2008 vs. 2007

The E&P segment recorded a net loss of $13,479 million during 2008. This amount includes a $25,443
million before- and after-tax complete impairment of E&P segment goodwill. In 2007, the E&P
segment had net income of $4,615 million, which includes the impact of a $4,588 million before-tax
impairment ($4,512 million after-tax) related to the expropriation of our oil interests in
Venezuela. For additional information, see the “Goodwill Impairment” section of Note 9—Goodwill
and Intangibles, and the “Expropriated Assets” section of Note 10—Impairments, in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, which are incorporated herein by reference.

The decrease in net income was attributed to the goodwill impairment, higher taxes other than
income (mainly in Alaska), lower production volumes, higher operating and exploration costs,
increased impairments and depreciation expense, and the absence of a 2007 benefit related to
release of escrowed funds associated with our Hamaca joint venture in Venezuela. The decrease was
partially offset by the absence of the 2007 Venezuela impairment, as well as higher crude oil,
natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. During 2008, our E&P segment recognized property
impairment charges totaling $511 million after-tax, mostly due to revised capital spending plans as
a result of current project economics, as well as a significantly diminished outlook for commodity
prices. A large portion of these impairments relate to fields in the U.S. Lower 48 and Canada.

E&P’s results for 2008 reflect an average realized worldwide selling price of $93.12 per barrel of
crude oil. In contrast, our average realized worldwide crude oil price per barrel in December 2008
was $37.23. If average crude oil prices in 2009 do not increase appreciably from the low levels at
year-end 2008, we would expect E&P’s 2009 results to be negatively impacted.

Proved reserves at year-end 2008 were 8.08 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with
8.72 billion at year-end 2007. This excludes the estimated 1,893 million BOE and 1,838 million BOE
included in the LUKOIL Investment segment at year-end 2008 and 2007, respectively. Also excluded
is our share of Canadian Syncrude, which was 249 million barrels at year-end 2008, compared with
221 million at year-end 2007.

U.S. E&P

Net income from our U.S. E&P operations increased 17 percent, primarily due to higher crude oil,
natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. The increase was partially offset by higher production
taxes (mainly in Alaska), lower volumes, an increase in impairments of properties in the Lower 48,
and higher operating costs.

E&P production on a BOE basis averaged 775,000 per day in 2008, a decrease of 8 percent from
843,000 in 2007. The production decrease was primarily due to field decline and unplanned downtime
in the Lower 48 reflecting the impact of hurricane disruptions.

International E&P

Net income from our international E&P operations increased from $367 million in 2007 to $6,976
million in 2008. The increase was attributed to the impact of the
Venezuelan impairment on our
prior-year results and higher crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. The increase
was partially offset by higher depreciation expense due to increased rates and new assets being
placed in service, increased taxes other than income, higher operating costs, and the absence of a
2007 benefit related to release of escrowed funds associated with our Hamaca joint venture in
Venezuela.

International E&P production averaged 992,000 BOE per day in 2008, a decrease of 2 percent from
1,014,000 in 2007. Decreases in production were caused by field decline and the expropriation of
our Venezuelan oil interests. These decreases were mostly offset by increased production from new
developments



in the United Kingdom, Indonesia, Russia, Norway and Canada. Our Syncrude mining operations
produced 22,000 barrels per day in 2008, compared with 23,000 barrels per day in 2007.

In regards to our Venezuelan assets expropriated during 2007, we filed a request for international
arbitration on November 2, 2007, with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment
Disputes (ICSID), an arm of the World Bank. The request was registered by ICSID on December 13,
2007. The tribunal of three arbitrators is constituted, and the arbitration proceeding is under
way.

In October 2007, the government of Ecuador increased the tax rate of the Windfall Profits Tax Law
implemented in 2006, increasing the amount of government royalty entitlement on crude oil
production to 99 percent of any increase in the price of crude oil above a contractual reference
price. In April 2008, we initiated arbitration with ICSID against The Republic of Ecuador and
PetroEcuador as a result of the government’s confiscatory fiscal measures enacted in 2006 and 2007,
as well as the government-mandated renegotiation of our production sharing contracts into service
agreements with inferior fiscal and legal terms. The arbitration has been registered by ICSID, the
arbitration tribunal is fully constituted and the case is proceeding.

In Canada, the Alberta provincial government changed the royalty structure for Crown lands,
effective January 1, 2009. A component of the new royalty rate calculation for each well will be
based on prevailing prices, and therefore we expect that our reported production and reserve
volumes will move inversely with changes in commodity prices. This change will impact both our
conventional western Canada natural gas and oil business and our oil sands operations.

2007 vs. 2006

Net income from the E&P segment decreased 53 percent in 2007. In the second quarter of 2007, we
recorded a noncash impairment of $4,588 million before-tax ($4,512 million after-tax) related to
the expropriation of our oil interests in Venezuela. The decrease in net income during 2007
reflects this impairment, as well as lower crude oil production, higher production taxes and
operating costs, and higher DD&A expense. These decreases were partially offset by:

•

Higher realized crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas prices.

•

A net benefit from asset rationalization efforts.

•

A benefit related to the release of escrowed funds in connection with the extinguishment
of the Hamaca project financing.

•

The Alaska Quality Bank settlements.

Proved reserves at year-end 2007 were 8.72 billion BOE, compared with 9.36 billion at year-end
2006. This excludes the estimated 1,838 million BOE and 1,805 million BOE included in the LUKOIL
Investment segment at year-end 2007 and 2006, respectively. Also excluded is our share of Canadian
Syncrude, which was 221 million barrels at year-end 2007, compared with 243 million at year-end
2006.

U.S. E&P

Net income from our U.S. E&P operations decreased 2 percent, primarily due to higher production
taxes in Alaska, higher operating costs and DD&A expense, and lower crude oil production. These
decreases were mostly offset by:

•

Higher crude oil and natural gas liquids prices, and higher natural gas and natural gas
liquids production.

•

The Alaska Quality Bank settlements.

•

Gains on the sale of assets in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico.

In December 2007, the state of Alaska enacted new production tax legislation, with retroactive
provisions, which results in a higher production tax structure for ConocoPhillips.



U.S. E&P production averaged 843,000 BOE per day in 2007, an increase of 4 percent from 808,000 in
2006. Production was impacted by the inclusion of the Burlington Resources assets for the full
year of 2007, offset slightly by field decline.

International E&P

Net income from our international E&P operations decreased 93 percent, primarily due to the
impairment of expropriated assets in Venezuela, lower crude oil production, higher DD&A expense,
and higher operating costs. These decreases were partially offset by higher crude oil and natural
gas prices, a net benefit from asset rationalization efforts, and the benefit from the release of
the escrowed funds related to the Hamaca project.
International E&P production averaged 1,014,000 BOE per day in 2007, a decrease of 10 percent from
1,128,000 in 2006. Production was impacted by the expropriation of our Venezuelan oil projects,
planned and unplanned downtime in Australia and the North Sea, production sharing contract impacts
in Australia, our exit from Dubai, and the effect of asset dispositions. These decreases were
slightly offset by new production volumes from our FCCL upstream business venture with EnCana, as
well as inclusion of the Burlington Resources assets for the full year of 2007. Our Syncrude
mining operations produced 23,000 barrels per day in 2007, compared with 21,000 in 2006.

During 2006, significant tax legislation was enacted in the United Kingdom and in Canada. The
United Kingdom increased income tax rates on upstream income, resulting in a negative earnings
impact of $470 million to adjust 2006 taxes and restate deferred tax liabilities. In Canada, an
overall rate reduction in 2006 resulted in a favorable earnings impact of $401 million to restate
deferred tax liabilities.

Excludes DCP Midstream.

The Midstream segment purchases raw natural gas from producers and gathers natural gas through an
extensive network of pipeline gathering systems. The natural gas is then processed to extract
natural gas liquids from the raw gas stream. The remaining “residue” gas is marketed to electrical
utilities, industrial users, and gas marketing companies. Most of the natural gas liquids are
fractionated—separated into individual components like ethane, butane and propane—and marketed as
chemical feedstock, fuel or blendstock. The Midstream segment consists of our 50 percent equity
investment in DCP Midstream, as well as our other natural gas gathering and processing operations,
and natural gas liquids fractionation and marketing businesses, primarily in the United States and
Trinidad.



2008 vs. 2007

Net income from the Midstream segment increased 19 percent in 2008. The increase was primarily due
to higher realized natural gas liquids prices, partially offset by higher operating costs and
higher depreciation expense.

2007 vs. 2006

Net income from the Midstream segment decreased 5 percent in 2007, reflecting a shift in natural
gas purchase contract terms that are more favorable to natural gas producers. In addition,
earnings from DCP Midstream were lower, primarily due to increased operating costs, mainly repairs,
maintenance and asset integrity work. The results also reflect a positive tax adjustment included
in the 2006 results. These decreases were partially offset by higher natural gas liquids prices.

Weighted-average crude oil capacity for the periods. Actual capacity at year-end 2007 and 2006 was 2,037,000 and 2,208,000 barrels per day, respectively, for
our domestic refineries, and 669,000 and 693,000 barrels per day, respectively, for our international refineries.

The R&M segment’s operations encompass refining crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum
products (such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels); buying, selling and transporting crude
oil; and buying, transporting, distributing and marketing petroleum products. R&M has operations
mainly in the United States, Europe and the Asia Pacific region.



2008 vs. 2007

Net income from the R&M segment decreased 61 percent in 2008. The results were lower due to
decreases in U.S. refining margins and volumes, increased property impairments, higher operating
costs, a reduced benefit from asset rationalization efforts, and lower international marketing and
refining volumes due to asset sales. During 2008, our R&M segment had property impairments
totaling $511 million after-tax, mostly due to a significantly diminished outlook for refining
margins. These R&M decreases were partially offset by higher international marketing margins.

During 2008, our worldwide refining capacity utilization rate was 90 percent, compared with 94
percent in 2007. We expect our 2009 rate to be similar to our rate in 2008.

U.S. R&M

Net income from our U.S. R&M operations decreased 67 percent in 2008. The decrease was primarily
the result of lower refining margins and, to a lesser extent, lower refining volumes and higher
turnaround and utility costs. In addition, property impairments increased in 2008, including an
impairment related to one of our U.S. refineries.

Our U.S. refining capacity utilization rate was 92 percent in 2008, compared with 96 percent in
2007. The decline in the current-year rate resulted mainly from refinery optimization and
unplanned downtime including impacts from hurricanes on our U.S. Gulf Coast refineries.

International R&M

Net income from our international R&M operations decreased 40 percent in 2008. Contributing to the
decrease were higher property impairments, including impacts from a 2008 impairment of a refinery
in Europe and the absence of a 2007 benefit related to an increase in the fair value of previously
impaired assets held for sale. Net income for 2008 was also impacted by a reduced net benefit from
asset rationalization efforts, negative foreign currency exchange impacts, the absence of a $141
million 2007 German tax legislation benefit, and lower refining and marketing volumes due to asset
sales. Higher international refining and marketing margins partially offset these decreases.

Our international refining capacity utilization rate was 85 percent in 2008, compared with 90
percent during the previous year. The utilization rate was primarily impacted by reduced crude
throughput at our Wilhelmshaven refinery due to economic conditions and planned maintenance.

2007 vs. 2006

Net income from the R&M segment increased 32 percent in 2007. The increase resulted primarily
from:

•

The net benefit of asset rationalization efforts.

•

Higher realized worldwide refining margins, reflecting in part the impact of planned
inventory reductions, including a benefit of $260 million from the liquidation of
prior-year layers under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.

•

Higher U.S. Gulf and East Coast refining volumes due to lower planned maintenance and
less weather-related downtime.

•

A 2007 deferred tax benefit related to tax legislation in Germany.

These increases were partially offset by the net impact of our contribution of assets to WRB
Refining LLC, foreign currency impacts, and lower marketing sales volumes due to asset sales.

U.S. R&M

Net income from our U.S. R&M operations increased 18 percent in 2007, primarily due to:

•

Higher refining volumes at our Gulf and East Coast refineries.

•

Higher realized refining and marketing margins, due in part to the benefit of planned
inventory reductions.



These items were partially offset by the net impact of our contribution of the Wood River and
Borger refineries to WRB, and the impact of business interruption insurance recoveries on our 2006
results. Our U.S. refining capacity utilization rate was 96 percent in 2007, compared with 92
percent in 2006, primarily reflecting lower planned maintenance and less weather-related downtime.

International R&M

Net income from our international R&M operations increased 131 percent in 2007, due primarily to:

•

The net benefit of asset rationalization efforts.

•

The deferred tax benefit related to the tax legislation in Germany.

•

Higher realized refining margins.

These increases were partially offset by foreign currency impacts and lower marketing volumes due
to the asset sales. Our international refining capacity utilization rate was 90 percent in 2007,
compared with 91 percent in 2006. The 2007 utilization rate was affected by a temporary idling of
the Wilhelmshaven refinery in Germany during the month of August due to economic conditions.

Represents our net share of our estimate of LUKOIL’s production and processing.

This segment represents our investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL, an international,
integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia, which we account for under the equity
method. At December 31, 2008, our ownership interest in LUKOIL was 20 percent based on authorized
and issued shares. Our ownership interest based on estimated shares outstanding, used for
equity method accounting, was 20.06 percent at that date.

Because LUKOIL’s accounting cycle close and preparation of U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles financial statements occur subsequent to our reporting deadline, our equity earnings and
statistics for our LUKOIL investment are estimated based on current market indicators, publicly
available LUKOIL information, and other objective data. Once the difference between actual and
estimated results is known, an adjustment is recorded. This estimate-to-actual adjustment will be
a recurring component of future-period results. In addition to our estimated equity share of
LUKOIL’s earnings, this segment reflects the amortization of the basis difference between our
equity interest in the net assets of LUKOIL and the book value of our investment. The segment also
includes the costs associated with our employees seconded to LUKOIL.



2008 vs. 2007

The LUKOIL Investment segment had a $5,488 million net loss during 2008, compared with
$1,818 million of net income in 2007. The 2008 results include a $7,410 million noncash, before-
and after-tax impairment of our LUKOIL investment taken during the fourth quarter. For additional
information, see the “LUKOIL” section of Note 7—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Excluding the impact of the impairment, income from the LUKOIL Investment segment increased 6
percent in 2008. This increase was primarily due to higher estimated realized prices of both
refined product and crude oil sales. Partially offsetting these positive impacts were higher
estimated extraction taxes and higher estimated crude and refined product export tariff rates, as
well as higher estimated operating costs and lower estimated crude volumes.

The adjustment to estimated results for the fourth quarter of 2007, recorded in 2008, decreased net
income $16 million, compared with a $19 million decrease to net income recorded in 2007 to adjust
the estimated results for the fourth quarter of 2006.

2007 vs. 2006

Net income from the LUKOIL Investment segment increased 28 percent during 2007, primarily due to
higher estimated realized prices, higher estimated volumes, and an increase in our average equity
ownership. The increase was partially offset by higher estimated taxes and operating costs, as
well as the net impact from the alignment of estimated net income to reported results. The
adjustment to estimated results for the fourth quarter of 2006, recorded in 2007, decreased net
income $19 million, compared with a $71 million increase to net income recorded in 2006 to adjust
the estimated results for the fourth quarter of 2005.

Chemicals

The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC
(CPChem), which we account for under the equity method. CPChem uses natural gas liquids and other
feedstocks to produce petrochemicals. These products are then marketed and sold, or used as
feedstocks to produce plastics and commodity chemicals.

2008 vs. 2007

Net income from the Chemicals segment decreased 69 percent in 2008 due to higher utilities and
other operating costs, the absence of 2007 one-time tax benefits, lower specialties, aromatics and
styrenics margins, and lower olefins and polyolefins volumes. Increases in olefins and polyolefins
margins somewhat offset these negative effects. Business conditions in the chemicals and plastics
industry are expected to remain challenging in the near term.

2007 vs. 2006

Net income from the Chemicals segment decreased 27 percent during 2007, primarily due to lower
olefins and polyolefins margins and higher turnaround and weather-related repair costs, offset
partially by a capital-loss tax benefit of $65 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2007.

The Emerging Businesses segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside
our normal scope of operations. Activities within this segment are currently focused on power
generation and innovation of new technologies, such as those related to conventional and
nonconventional hydrocarbon recovery (including heavy oil), refining, alternative energy, biofuels,
and the environment.

2008 vs. 2007

Emerging Businesses reported net income of $30 million in 2008, compared with a net loss of $8
million in 2007. The increase primarily reflects improved international power generation results,
including the impact of higher spark spreads. These benefits were partially offset by an $85
million after-tax impairment of a U.S. cogeneration power plant, as well as by lower domestic power
results.

2007 vs. 2006

The Emerging Businesses segment had a net loss of $8 million in 2007, compared with net income of
$15 million in 2006. The decrease reflects lower margins from the Immingham power plant in the
United Kingdom, as well as higher spending associated with alternative energy programs. These
decreases were slightly offset by the inclusion of a write-down of a damaged gas turbine at a
domestic power plant in 2006 results.

Net interest consists of interest and financing expense, net of interest income and capitalized
interest, as well as premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt. In 2008, net interest
decreased 32 percent primarily due to lower average interest rates and a higher effective tax rate.
Corporate general and administrative expenses increased 15 percent in 2008, mainly as a result of
increased charitable contributions. Acquisition-related costs in 2007 included transition costs
associated with the Burlington Resources acquisition. The category “Other” includes certain
foreign currency transaction gains and losses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer
in operation, and other costs not directly associated with an operating segment. “Other” expenses
increased in 2008 due to various tax-related adjustments, partially offset by lower foreign
currency losses.



2007 vs. 2006

Net interest decreased 6 percent in 2007, primarily due to higher amounts of interest being
capitalized, partially offset by a premium on the early retirement of debt. Corporate general and
administrative expenses increased 32 percent in 2007, primarily due to higher benefit-related
expenses. Acquisition-related costs in 2007 included transition costs associated with the
Burlington Resources acquisition. Results from “Other” were primarily impacted by foreign currency
losses in 2007.

Capital includes total debt, minority interests and common stockholders’ equity.

To meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources.
Cash generated from operating activities is the primary source of funding. In addition, during
2008 we raised $1,640 million in proceeds from asset dispositions. During 2008, available cash was
used to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments program, repurchase shares of our
common stock, provide loan financing to certain equity affiliates, pay dividends, and meet the
funding requirements to FCCL Oil Sands Partnership. Total dividends paid on our common stock during
the year were $2,854 million. During 2008, cash and cash equivalents decreased $701 million to
$755 million.

In addition to cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from asset sales, we rely on our
commercial paper and credit facility programs, and our shelf registration statements to support our
short- and long-term liquidity requirements. The credit markets, including the commercial paper
markets in the United States, have recently experienced adverse conditions. Although we have not
been materially impacted by these conditions, continuing volatility in the credit markets may
increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments due to increased
spreads over relevant interest rate benchmarks. Such volatility may also affect our ability, or
the ability of third parties with whom we seek to do business, to access those credit markets.
Notwithstanding these adverse market conditions, we believe current cash and short-term investment
balances and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as
described below in the “Significant Sources of Capital” section, will be sufficient to meet our
funding requirements in the near- and long-term, including our capital spending program, dividend
payments, required debt payments and the funding requirements to FCCL.

Significant Sources of Capital

Operating Activities

During 2008, cash of $22,658 million was provided by operating activities, an 8 percent decrease
from cash from operations of $24,550 million in 2007. Contributing to the decrease were lower U.S.
refining margins and volumetric inventory builds in our R&M segment in 2008, versus reductions in
2007. These factors were partially offset by higher commodity prices in our E&P segment.



During 2007, cash flow from operations increased $3,034 million to $24,550 million. Contributing
to the improvement over 2006 results was a planned inventory reduction in the 2007 period,
partially related to the formation of the WRB downstream business venture; the impact of the
Burlington Resources acquisition late in the first quarter of 2006; and higher worldwide crude oil
prices in 2007. These positive factors were partially offset by the absence of dividends from our
Venezuelan operations in 2007.

While the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity
and the effects of upstream and downstream integration, our short- and long-term operating cash
flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, as well
as refining and marketing margins. During 2008 and 2007, we benefited from favorable crude oil and
natural gas prices, although these prices deteriorated significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008.
Prices and margins are driven by market conditions over which we have no control. Absent other
mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change
in our operating cash flows.

The level of our production volumes of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids also impacts
our cash flows. These production levels are impacted by such factors as acquisitions and
dispositions of fields, field production decline rates, new technologies, operating efficiency,
weather conditions, the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success, and the timely and
cost-effective development of those proved reserves. While we actively manage these factors,
production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although historically this variability has
not been as significant as that caused by commodity prices.

Our production for 2008, including our share of production from equity affiliates, averaged 2.21
million BOE per day. Future production is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, among
others, the volatile crude oil and natural gas price environment, which may impact project
investment decisions; the price effect of production sharing contracts; changes in fiscal terms of
projects; project delays; and weather-related disruptions. Although actual year-to-year production
levels will vary, based on our current outlook and planning assumptions, we project no material
change in annual production levels from 2008 through 2013.

To maintain or grow our production volumes, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base.
Our reserve replacement in 2008, including equity affiliates, was 31 percent. The 2008 reserve
replacement was adversely impacted by low year-end commodity prices, which resulted in significant
negative reserve revisions. Our 2008 reserve replacement from consolidated operations and from our
equity affiliates was a negative 23 percent and a positive 224 percent, respectively. Over the
three-year period ending December 31, 2008, our reserve replacement was 124 percent. This was
comprised of a reserve replacement from consolidated operations of 115 percent and from equity
affiliates of 153 percent. The purchase of reserves in place was a significant factor in replacing
our reserves over the past three-year period, partially offset by the expropriation of our
Venezuelan oil assets. Significant purchases during this three-year period included reserves added
as part of the 2008 Origin Energy joint venture, the 2007 EnCana business venture, and the 2006
acquisition of Burlington Resources, as well as proved reserves added through our investments in
LUKOIL in 2006. The reserve replacement amounts above were based on the sum of our net additions
(revisions, improved recovery, purchases, extensions and discoveries, and sales) divided by our
production, as shown in our reserve table disclosures in the “Oil and Gas Operations” section of
this report.

We are developing and pursuing projects we anticipate will allow us to add to our reserve base.
However, access to additional resources has become increasingly difficult as direct investment is
prohibited in some nations, while fiscal and other terms in other countries can make projects
uneconomic or unattractive. In addition, political instability, competition from national oil
companies, and lack of access to high-potential areas due to environmental or other regulation may
negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base. As such, the timing and level at which
we add to our reserve base may, or may not, allow us to replace our production over subsequent
years.

As discussed in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section, engineering estimates of proved
reserves are imprecise, and therefore, each year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to
the impact of changes in oil and gas prices or as more technical data becomes available on
reservoirs. In 2008 and 2006, revisions decreased our reserves, while in 2007 revisions increased
reserves. It is not possible to reliably predict how



revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future. See the “Capital Spending” section for an
analysis of proved undeveloped reserves.

In addition, the level and quality of output from our refineries impacts our cash flows. The
output at our refineries is impacted by such factors as operating efficiency, maintenance
turnarounds, feedstock availability and weather conditions. We actively manage the operations of
our refineries and, typically, any variability in their operations has not been as significant to
cash flows as that caused by refining margins.

In 2006, we received approximately $1.1 billion in distributions from two heavy-oil projects in
Venezuela. The majority of these distributions represented operating results from previous years.
We did not receive an operating distribution related to these projects in 2007 or 2008.

Asset Sales

Proceeds from asset sales in 2008 were $1,640 million, compared with $3,572 million in 2007. The
amounts for both periods are mainly due to asset rationalization efforts related to the program we
announced in April 2006 to dispose of assets that no longer fit into our strategic plans or those
that could bring more value by being monetized in the near term. We do not expect any material
asset dispositions in 2009 beyond the sale of our U.S. retail marketing assets. In January 2009,
we closed on the sale of a large part of these assets, which included seller financing in the form
of a $370 million five-year note and letters of credit totaling $54 million.

Commercial Paper and Credit Facilities

At December 31, 2008, we had two revolving credit facilities totaling $9.85 billion, consisting of
a $7.35 billion facility, expiring in September 2012, and a $2.5 billion facility scheduled to
expire in September 2009 (terminated in early 2009, see the
“Shelf Registrations” section below).
The $7.35 billion facility was reduced from $7.5 billion during the third quarter of 2008 due to
the bankruptcy of Lehman Commercial Paper Inc., one of the revolver participants. The $2.5 billion
facility is a 364-day bank facility entered into during October 2008 to provide additional support
of a temporary expansion of our commercial paper program. We expanded our commercial paper program
to ensure adequate liquidity after the initial funding of our transaction with Origin Energy. For
additional information on the Origin transaction, see Note 7—Investments, Loans and Long-Term
Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our revolving credit facilities may be used as direct bank borrowings, as support for issuances of
letters of credit totaling up to $750 million, as support for our commercial paper programs, or as
support of up to $250 million on commercial paper issued by TransCanada Keystone Pipeline LP, a
Keystone pipeline joint venture entity. The revolving credit facilities are broadly syndicated
among financial institutions and do not contain any material adverse change provisions or any
covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or ratings. The facility agreements
contain a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other
debt obligations of $200 million or more by ConocoPhillips, or by any of its consolidated
subsidiaries.

Our primary funding source for short-term working capital needs is the ConocoPhillips $8.1 billion
commercial paper program. Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. We also
have the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $1.5 billion commercial paper program, which is used to
fund commitments relating to the Qatargas 3 project. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had no
direct outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facilities, but $40 million and $41
million, respectively, in letters of credit had been issued. In addition, under both commercial
paper programs, there was $6,933 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2008,
compared with $725 million at December 31, 2007. Since we had $6,933 million of commercial paper
outstanding, had issued $40 million of letters of credit and had up to a $250 million guarantee on
commercial paper issued by Keystone, we had access to $2.6 billion in borrowing capacity under our
revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2008.

Shelf Registrations

We have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and
sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. Under this shelf
registration, in May 2008 we issued notes consisting of $400 million of 4.40% Notes due 2013, $500
million of 5.20% Notes due 2018 and



$600 million of 5.90% Notes due 2038. The proceeds from the offering were used at that time to
reduce commercial paper and for general corporate purposes.

Also under this shelf registration, in early 2009 we issued $1.5 billion of 4.75% Notes due 2014,
$2.25 billion of 5.75% Notes due 2019, and $2.25 billion of 6.50% Notes due 2039. The proceeds of
the notes were primarily used to reduce outstanding commercial paper balances. Under the terms of
the $2.5 billion, 364-day revolving credit facility noted above, the receipt of the proceeds from
this bond offering terminated this revolving credit facility.

Our senior long-term debt is rated “A1” by Moody’s Investor Service and “A” by both Standard and
Poors’ Rating Service and Fitch, unchanged from December 31, 2008. We do not have any ratings
triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default, and thereby impact our
access to liquidity, in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating. In the event our credit
rating deteriorates to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would
still be able to access funds under our $7.35 billion revolving credit facility.

We also have on file with the SEC a shelf registration statement under which ConocoPhillips Canada
Funding Company I and ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company II, both wholly owned subsidiaries,
could issue an indeterminate amount of senior debt securities, fully and unconditionally guaranteed
by ConocoPhillips and ConocoPhillips Company.

Minority Interests

At December 31, 2008, we had outstanding $1,100 million of equity in less than wholly owned
consolidated subsidiaries held by minority interest owners, including a minority interest of
$507 million in Ashford Energy Capital S.A. The remaining minority interest amounts are primarily
related to operating joint ventures we control. The largest of these, amounting to $580 million,
was related to Darwin LNG, an operation located in Australia’s Northern Territory.

In December 2001, in order to raise funds for general corporate purposes, ConocoPhillips and Cold
Spring Finance S.a.r.l. formed Ashford Energy Capital S.A. through the contribution of a $1 billion
ConocoPhillips subsidiary promissory note and $500 million cash by Cold Spring. Through its
initial $500 million investment, Cold Spring is entitled to a cumulative annual preferred return
consisting of 1.32 percent plus a three-month LIBOR rate set at the beginning of each quarter. The
preferred return at December 31, 2008, was 5.37 percent. In 2008, Cold Spring declined its option
to remarket its investment in Ashford. This option remains available in 2018 and at each 10-year
anniversary thereafter. If remarketing is unsuccessful, we could be required to provide a letter
of credit in support of Cold Spring’s investment, or in the event such a letter of credit is not
provided, cause the redemption of Cold Spring’s investment in Ashford. Should our credit rating
fall below investment grade, Ashford would require a letter of credit to support $475 million of
the term loans, as of December 31, 2008, made by Ashford to other ConocoPhillips subsidiaries. If
the letter of credit is not obtained within 60 days, Cold Spring could cause Ashford to sell the
ConocoPhillips subsidiary notes. At December 31, 2008, Ashford held $2.0 billion of ConocoPhillips
subsidiary notes and $28 million in investments unrelated to ConocoPhillips. We report Cold
Spring’s investment as a minority interest because it is not mandatorily redeemable, and the entity
does not have a specified liquidation date. Other than the obligation to make payment on the
subsidiary notes described above, Cold Spring does not have recourse to our general credit.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry practice, we
enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share
costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements. At December 31, 2008,
we were liable for certain contingent obligations under the following contractual arrangements:

•

Qatargas 3

:

We own a 30 percent interest in Qatargas 3, an integrated project to
produce and liquefy natural gas from Qatar’s North field. The other participants in the
project are affiliates of Qatar Petroleum (68.5 percent) and Mitsui & Co., Ltd.
(1.5 percent). Our interest is held through a jointly



owned company, Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited (3), for
which we use the equity method of accounting. Qatargas 3 secured project financing of $4 billion in December 2005, consisting
of $1.3 billion of loans from export credit agencies (ECA), $1.5 billion from commercial
banks, and $1.2 billion from ConocoPhillips. The ConocoPhillips loan facilities have
substantially the same terms as the ECA and commercial bank facilities. Prior to project
completion certification, all loans, including the ConocoPhillips loan facilities, are
guaranteed by the participants, based on their respective ownership interests. Accordingly,
our maximum exposure to this financing structure is $1.2 billion. Upon completion
certification, currently expected in 2011, all project loan facilities, including the
ConocoPhillips loan facilities, will become nonrecourse to the project participants. At
December 31, 2008, Qatargas 3 had $3.0 billion outstanding under all the loan facilities, of
which ConocoPhillips provided $835 million, and an additional $76 million of accrued
interest.

Rockies Express Pipeline LLC

:

In June 2006, we issued a guarantee for 24 percent
of $2.0 billion in credit facilities issued to Rockies Express Pipeline LLC. Rockies
Express is constructing a natural gas pipeline across a portion of the United States. The
maximum potential amount of future payments to third-party lenders under the guarantee is
estimated to be $480 million, which could become payable if the credit facilities are fully
utilized and Rockies Express fails to meet its obligations under the credit agreement. At
December 31, 2008, Rockies Express had $1,561 million outstanding under the credit
facilities, with our 24 percent guarantee equaling $375 million. In addition, we have a 24
percent guarantee on $600 million of Floating Rate Notes due 2009. It is anticipated that
construction completion will be achieved in 2009, and refinancing will take place at that
time, making the debt nonrecourse.

•

Keystone Oil Pipeline

:

In December 2007, we acquired a 50 percent equity
interest in four Keystone pipeline entities (Keystone), to create a joint venture with
TransCanada Corporation. Keystone is constructing a crude oil pipeline originating in
Alberta, with delivery points in Illinois and Oklahoma. In connection with certain
planning and construction activities, we agreed to reimburse TransCanada with respect to a
portion of guarantees issued by TransCanada for certain of Keystone’s obligations to third
parties. Our maximum potential amount of future payments associated with these guarantees
is based on our ultimate ownership percentage in Keystone and is estimated to be $180
million, which could become payable if Keystone fails to meet its obligations and the
obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated. Payments under the guarantees are contingent
upon the partners not making necessary equity contributions into Keystone; therefore, it is
considered unlikely payments would be required. All but $8 million of the guarantees will
terminate after construction is completed, currently estimated to occur in 2010.

In October 2008, we elected to exercise an option to reduce our equity interest in Keystone
from 50 percent to 20.01 percent. The change in equity will occur through a dilution
mechanism, which is expected to gradually lower our ownership
interest until it reaches 20.01 percent by the third
quarter of 2009. At December 31, 2008, our ownership interest was 38.7 percent.

In addition to the above guarantees, in order to obtain long-term shipping commitments that
would enable a pipeline expansion starting at Hardisty, Alberta, and extending to near Port
Arthur, Texas, the Keystone owners executed an agreement in July 2008 to guarantee Keystone’s
obligations under its agreement to provide transportation at a specified price for certain
shippers to the Gulf Coast. Although our guarantee is for 50 percent of these obligations,
TransCanada has agreed to reimburse us for amounts we pay in excess of our ownership
percentage in Keystone. Our maximum potential amount of future payments, or cost of volume
delivery, under this guarantee, after such reimbursement, is estimated to be $220 million
($550 million before reimbursement) based on a full 20-year term of the shipping commitments,
which could become payable if Keystone fails to meet its obligations under the agreements and
the obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated. Future payments are considered unlikely, as
the payments, or cost of volume delivery, are contingent upon Keystone defaulting on its
obligation to construct the pipeline in accordance with the terms of the agreement.



In December 2008, we provided a guarantee of up to $250 million of balances outstanding under
a commercial paper program. This program was established by Keystone to provide funding for
a portion of Keystone’s construction costs attributable to our ownership interest in the
project. Payment under the guarantee would be due in the event Keystone failed to repay
principal and interest, when due, to short-term noteholders. The commercial paper program
and our guarantee are expected to increase as funding needs increase during construction of
the Keystone pipeline. Keystone’s other owner will guarantee a similar, but separate,
funding vehicle. Post-construction Keystone financing is anticipated to be nonrecourse to
us. At December 31, 2008, $200 million was outstanding under the Keystone commercial paper
program guaranteed by us.

For additional information about guarantees, see Note 14—Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Capital Requirements

Our debt balance at December 31, 2008, was $27.5 billion, an increase of $5.8 billion during 2008,
and our debt-to-capital ratio was 33 percent at year-end 2008, versus 19 percent at the end of
2007. The increase in the debt-to-capital ratio was mainly due to noncash impairments taken in the
fourth quarter of 2008 and the increase in debt. Our debt-to-capital target range is 20 percent to
25 percent.

In January 2008, we reduced our Floating Rate Five-Year Term Note due 2011 from $3 billion to $2
billion, with a subsequent reduction in June 2008 to $1.5 billion. In March 2008, we redeemed our
$300 million 7.125% Debentures due 2028 at a premium of $8 million, plus accrued interest.

On January 3, 2007, we closed on a business venture with EnCana. As part of this transaction, we
are obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus accrued interest,
over a 10-year period, beginning
in 2007, to the upstream business venture, FCCL, formed as a result of the transaction. An initial
contribution of $188 million was made upon closing in January. Quarterly principal and interest
payments of $237 million began in the second quarter of 2007, and will continue until the balance
is paid. Of the principal obligation amount, approximately $625 million is short-term and was
included in the “Accounts payable—related parties” line on our December 31, 2008, consolidated
balance sheet. The principal portion of these payments, which totaled $593 million in 2008, was
included in the “Other” line in the financing activities section of our consolidated statement of
cash flows. Interest accrues at a fixed annual rate of 5.3 percent on the unpaid principal
balance. Fifty percent of the quarterly interest payments was reflected as an additional capital
contribution and was included in the “Capital expenditures and investments” line on our
consolidated statement of cash flows.

On July 9, 2007, we announced plans to repurchase up to $15 billion of our common stock through the
end of 2008. This amount included $2 billion remaining under a previously announced program. At
year-end 2007, approximately $10.1 billion remained authorized for share repurchases in 2008.
During 2008, we repurchased 103.7 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $8.2 billion.

In December 2005, we entered into a credit agreement with Qatargas 3, whereby we will provide loan
financing of approximately $1.2 billion for the construction of an LNG train in Qatar. This
financing will represent 30 percent of the project’s total debt financing. Through December 31,
2008, we had provided $835 million in loan financing, and an additional $76 million of accrued
interest.

In 2004, we finalized our transaction with Freeport LNG Development, L.P. to participate in an LNG
receiving terminal in Quintana, Texas, for which construction began in early 2005. We do not have
an ownership interest in the facility, but we do have a 50 percent interest in the general
partnership managing the venture, along with contractual rights to regasification capacity of the
terminal. We entered into a credit agreement with Freeport to provide loan financing for the
construction of the facility. The terminal became operational in June 2008, and in August 2008,
the loan was converted from a construction loan to a term loan and consisted of $650 million in
loan financing and $124 million of accrued interest. Freeport began making repayments in September
2008, and the loan balance outstanding at December 31, 2008, was $757 million.



In 2004, ConocoPhillips and LUKOIL agreed to the expansion of the Varandey terminal as part of our
investment in the OOO Naryanmarneftegaz (NMNG) joint venture. We have an obligation to provide
loan financing to Varandey Terminal Company for 30 percent of the costs of the terminal expansion,
but we will have no governance or ownership interest in the terminal. Terminal construction was
completed in June 2008, and the final loan amount was $275 million at December 2008 exchange rates,
excluding accrued interest. Although repayments are not required to start until May 2010, Varandey
used available cash to repay $12 million of interest in the second half of 2008. The outstanding
accrued interest at December 31, 2008, was $38 million at December exchange rates.

Our loans to Qatargas 3, Freeport and Varandey Terminal Company are included in the “Loans and
advances—related parties” line on our consolidated balance sheet, while the short-term portion is
in “Accounts and notes receivable—related parties.”

In February 2009, we announced a quarterly dividend of 47 cents per share. The dividend is payable
March 2, 2009, to stockholders of record at the close of business February 23, 2009.

(a)

Includes $639 million of net unamortized premiums and discounts. See Note 12—Debt, in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.

(b)

Represents any agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally
binding and that specifies all significant terms. Does not include purchase commitments for
jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator.

The majority of the purchase obligations are market-based contracts, including exchanges and
futures, for the purchase of products such as crude oil, unfractionated natural gas liquids
(NGL), natural gas, and power. The products are mostly used to supply our refineries and
fractionators, optimize the supply chain, and resell to customers. Product purchase
commitments with third parties totaled $35,732 million; $28,315 million of these commitments
are product purchases from the following affiliated companies: CPChem, mostly for natural gas
and NGL over the remaining term of 91 years, and Excel Paralubes, for base oil over the
remaining initial term of 16 years.



Purchase obligations of $8,185 million are related to agreements to access and utilize the
capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and LNG and product
terminals, to transport, process, treat, and store products.

The remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services
for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are the operator.

(c)

Represents the remaining amount of contributions, excluding interest, due over an eight-year
period to the FCCL upstream joint venture formed with EnCana.

(d)

Does not include: Pensions—for the 2009 through 2013 time period, we expect to contribute an
average of $625 million per year to our qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement
benefit plans in the United States and an average of $161 million per year to our non-U.S.
plans, which are expected to be in excess of required minimums in many cases. The U.S.
five-year average consists of $925 million for 2009 and then approximately $550 million per
year for the remaining four years. Our required minimum funding in 2009 is expected to be
$274 million in the United States and $98 million outside the United States.

(e)

Excludes unrecognized tax benefits of $968 million because the ultimate disposition and
timing of any payments to be made with regard to such amount are not reasonably estimable.
Although unrecognized tax benefits are not a contractual obligation, they are presented in
this table because they represent potential demands on our liquidity.

Our capital expenditures and investments for the three-year period ending December 31, 2008,
totaled $46.5 billion, with 77 percent going to our E&P segment. Included in these amounts was
approximately $4.7 billion related to the October 2008 closing of a transaction with Origin Energy
to further enhance our long-term Australasian natural gas business through a 50/50 joint venture
named Australia Pacific LNG. The joint venture will focus on coalbed methane production from the
Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia, and LNG processing and export sales. For
additional information about the Origin transaction,



see Note 7—Investments,
Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our capital expenditures and investments budget for 2009 is $11.7 billion. Included in this amount
is approximately $600 million in capitalized interest. The decline from 2008 spending is primarily
due to the closing of the transaction with Origin Energy in 2008 and the deferring or slowing of
some projects or programs in 2009, as a result of the current business environment. We plan to
direct 81 percent of the capital expenditures and investments budget to E&P and 17 percent to R&M.
With the addition of loans to certain affiliated companies and principal contributions related to
funding our portion of the FCCL business venture, our total capital program for 2009 is
approximately $12.5 billion.

E&P

Capital expenditures and investments for E&P during the three-year period ending December 31, 2008,
totaled $35.9 billion. The expenditures over this period supported key exploration and development
projects including:

•

Significant U.S. lease acquisitions in the federal waters of the Chukchi Sea offshore
Alaska, as well as in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.

•

Alaska activities related to development drilling in the Greater Kuparuk Area, including
West Sak; the Greater Prudhoe Bay Area; the Alpine field, including satellite field
prospects; and the Cook Inlet Area; as well as initiatives to progress the gas pipeline
project named Denali—The Alaska Gas Pipeline; and exploration activities.

•

Oil and natural gas developments in the Lower 48, including New Mexico, Texas,
Louisiana, Oklahoma, Montana, North Dakota, Colorado, Wyoming, and offshore in the Gulf of
Mexico.

•

Investment in West2East Pipeline LLC, a company holding a 100 percent interest in
Rockies Express Pipeline LLC.

•

Development of the Surmont heavy-oil project, capital expenditures related to the FCCL
upstream business venture, and development of conventional oil and gas reserves, all in
Canada.

•

Development drilling and facilities projects in the Greater Ekofisk Area and the Alvheim
project, both located in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea.

•

The Statfjord Late Life project straddling the offshore boundary between Norway and the
United Kingdom.

•

The Britannia satellite developments in the U.K. North Sea.

•

An integrated project to produce and liquefy natural gas from Qatar’s North field.

•

Expenditures related to the terms under which we returned to our former oil and natural
gas production operations in the Waha concessions in Libya and continued development of
these concessions.

•

Ongoing development of onshore oil and natural gas fields in Nigeria and ongoing
exploration activities both onshore and within deepwater leases.

•

The Kashagan field and satellite prospects in the Caspian Sea, offshore Kazakhstan.

•

Development of the Yuzhno Khylchuyu (YK) field in the northern part of Russia’s
Timan-Pechora province through the NMNG joint venture with LUKOIL.

•

The initial investment related to the 50/50 joint venture with Origin Energy.

•

Projects in offshore Block B and onshore South Sumatra in Indonesia.

•

The Peng Lai 19-3 development in China’s Bohai Bay and additional Bohai Bay appraisal
and adjacent field prospects.

•

The Gumusut-Kakap development offshore Sabah, Malaysia.

2009 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND INVESTMENTS BUDGET

E&P’s 2009 capital expenditures and investments budget is $9.5 billion, 43 percent lower than
actual expenditures in 2008. The decline is primarily due to the 2008 Origin transaction and the
deferring or slowing of some projects or programs. Thirty-seven percent of E&P’s 2009 capital
expenditures and investments budget is planned for the United States.



Capital spending for our Alaskan operations is expected to fund Prudhoe Bay, Kuparuk and Western
North Slope operations, including the Alpine satellite fields, as well as initiatives to progress
Denali—The Alaska Gas Pipeline, and exploration activities.

In the Lower 48, we expect to make capital expenditures and investments for ongoing development
programs in the Permian, San Juan, Williston and Fort Worth basins and the Lobo Trend in South
Texas, as well as for development of projects such as the Rockies Express natural gas pipeline.

E&P is directing $6.0 billion of its 2009 capital expenditures and investments budget to
international projects. Funds in 2009 will be directed to developing major long-term projects
including:

•

Oil sands projects, primarily those associated with the FCCL business venture, and
ongoing natural gas projects in Canada.

•

In the North Sea, the Ekofisk Area, J-Block fields, Greater Britannia fields and
various southern North Sea assets.

•

The Kashagan field in the Caspian Sea.

•

Advancement of coalbed methane projects in Australia associated with the Origin Energy
joint venture.

•

Continued development of Bohai Bay in China.

•

The Gumusut field offshore Malaysia.

•

The North Belut field in Block B, as well as other projects offshore Block B and
onshore South Sumatra in Indonesia.

•

Fields offshore Vietnam.

•

Continued development of the Qatargas 3 project in Qatar.

•

The Shah gas field in Abu Dhabi.

•

Onshore developments in Nigeria, Algeria and Libya.

PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES

The net addition of proved undeveloped reserves accounted for 156 percent, 77 percent and
37 percent of our total net additions in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. During these years, we
converted, on average, 15 percent per year of our proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed
reserves. Of our 2,823 million total BOE proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2008, we
estimated that the average annual conversion rate for these reserves for the three-year period
ending 2011 will be approximately 15 percent.

Costs incurred for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, relating to the development of
proved undeveloped reserves were $4.8 billion, $4.3 billion, and $3.9 billion, respectively.
Estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves for
the years 2009 through 2011 are projected to be $3.9 billion, $3.1 billion, and $2.0 billion,
respectively.

Approximately 80 percent of our proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2008 were associated with
10 major development areas in our E&P segment, and our investment in LUKOIL. Eight of the major
development areas within E&P are currently producing and are expected to have proved reserves
convert from undeveloped to developed over time as development activities continue and/or
production facilities are expanded or upgraded, and include:

•

The Ekofisk field in the North Sea.

•

The Peng Lai 19-3 field in China.

•

Fields in the United States.

•

FCCL heavy-oil projects—Christina Lake and Foster Creek in Canada.

•

The Surmont heavy-oil project in Canada.

The remaining two major projects, Qatargas 3 in Qatar and the Kashagan field in Kazakhstan, will
have undeveloped proved reserves convert to developed as these projects begin production.



R&M

Capital spending for R&M during the three-year period ending December 31, 2008, was primarily for
acquiring additional crude oil refining capacity, clean fuels projects to meet new environmental
standards, refinery upgrade projects to improve product yields, the operating integrity of key
processing units, as well as for safety projects. During this three-year period, R&M capital
spending was $6.7 billion, representing 14 percent of our total capital expenditures and
investments.

Key projects during the three-year period included:

•

Acquisition of the Wilhelmshaven refinery in Germany.

•

Debottlenecking of a crude and fluid catalytic cracking unit, and completion of a new
sulfur plant at the Ferndale refinery.

•

Installations, revamps and expansions of equipment at all U.S. refineries to enable
production of low-sulfur and ultra-low-sulfur fuels.

•

Investment to obtain an equity interest in four Keystone pipeline entities (Keystone), a
joint venture to construct a crude oil pipeline from Hardisty, Alberta, to delivery points
in the United States.

•

Installation of a 25,000-barrel-per-day coker and new vacuum unit at the Borger
refinery. Commissioning of these units was completed following the formation of the WRB
joint venture.

•

Upgrading the distillate desulfurization capability at the Humber refinery.

Major construction activities in progress include:

•

Expansion of a hydrocracker at the Rodeo facility of our San Francisco refinery.

•

Construction of a low-sulfur gasoline project at the Billings refinery.

•

Construction of a new sulfur recovery unit at the Sweeny refinery.

•

Continued investment in the Keystone Oil Pipeline.

•

Construction of a wet gas scrubber at our Alliance refinery.

2009 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND INVESTMENTS BUDGET

R&M’s 2009 capital budget is $2.0 billion, a 12 percent decrease from actual spending in 2008.
Domestic spending in 2009 is expected to comprise 71 percent of the R&M budget.

We plan to direct about $1.1 billion of the R&M capital budget to domestic refining, primarily for
projects related to sustaining and improving existing business with a focus on safety, regulatory
compliance, reliability and capital maintenance. Work continues on projects to expand conversion
capability and increase clean product yield, including funding for the San Francisco hydrocracker
project. Our U.S. transportation, marketing and specialty businesses are expected to spend about
$300 million, including investments in the Keystone project.

Internationally, we plan to spend about $600 million, with a focus on projects related to
reliability, safety and the environment, as well as an upgrade project at the Wilhelmshaven,
Germany, refinery. The construction bidding process for the refinery project in Yanbu, Saudi
Arabia, is currently scheduled to take place in 2009.

LUKOIL Investment

Capital spending in our LUKOIL Investment segment during the three-year period ending December 31,
2008, was for purchases of ordinary shares of LUKOIL in 2006 to increase our ownership interest.
No additional purchases were made in 2007 or 2008, and none are expected in 2009.

Emerging Businesses

Capital spending for Emerging Businesses during the three-year period ending December 31, 2008, was
primarily for an expansion of the Immingham combined heat and power cogeneration plant near the
company’s Humber refinery in the United Kingdom. In addition, in October 2007, we purchased a 50
percent interest in Sweeny Cogeneration LP.



Contingencies

Legal and Tax Matters

We accrue for non-income-tax-related contingencies when a loss is probable and the amounts can be
reasonably estimated. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the
range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. In the
case of income-tax-related contingencies, we adopted Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (FIN 48), effective
January 1, 2007. FIN 48 requires a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where
sustaining a tax position is less than certain. Based on currently available information, we
believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed
current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated
financial statements.

Environmental

We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and
regulations as other companies in the petroleum exploration and production, refining and crude oil
and refined product marketing and transportation businesses. The most significant of these
environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the:

•

U.S. Federal Clean Air Act, which governs air emissions.

•

U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, which governs discharges to water bodies.

•

European Union Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of
Chemicals (REACH).

•

U.S. Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
(CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters and arrangers of hazardous
substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to
occur.

•

U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment,
storage and disposal of solid waste.

•

U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of
onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore
facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and
damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States.

•

U.S. Federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires
facilities to report toxic chemical inventories with local emergency planning committees
and response departments.

•

U.S. Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in
underground injection wells.

•

U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas
operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting
from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages.

•

European Union Trading Directive resulting in European Emissions Trading Scheme.

These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of
discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in
association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect
substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and
time-consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and
the agency’s processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting
process are beyond the control of the applicant.

Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar
environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in
some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to
the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international
borders.



The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly
known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality
standards and stricter fuel regulations continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and
regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are
expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in
other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission
compliance and remediation obligations in the United States.

For example, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 imposed obligations to provide increasing volumes on a
percentage basis of renewable fuels in transportation motor fuels through 2012. These obligations
were changed with the enactment of the Energy Independence & Security Act of 2007, which was signed
in late December. The new law requires fuel producers and importers to provide approximately 66
percent more renewable fuels in 2008 as compared with amounts set forth in the Energy Policy Act of
2005, with increases in amounts of renewable fuels required through 2022. We are in the process of
establishing implementation, operating and capital strategies, along with advanced technology
development, to meet these requirements.

We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation
obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA
and RCRA and their state equivalents. Remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility
arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous past and present
ConocoPhillips-owned and/or operated petroleum-marketing outlets throughout the United States.
Federal and state laws require contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be
assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. In addition to other cleanup standards, many
states adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) for both soil and
groundwater.

At RCRA permitted facilities, we are required to assess environmental conditions. If conditions
warrant, we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to
CERCLA, which is often referred to as “Superfund,” the cost of corrective action activities under
RCRA corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us. Over the next decade, we
anticipate increasing expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required, but such annual
expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such
expenditures we have experienced over the past few years. Longer-term expenditures are subject to
considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly.

We, from time to time, receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the
EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under
CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost
recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits
assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by
us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2007, we
reported we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 68
sites around the United States. At December 31, 2008, we re-opened three sites and closed one of
those sites, resolved and closed seven sites, and received two new notices of potential liability,
leaving 65 unresolved sites where we have been notified of potential liability.

For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site
remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to
all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those
potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for
state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had
the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially
responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially.
Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA
or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally
assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In
some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs
generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are
relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and



amounts of anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs
at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our
competitive or financial condition.

Expensed environmental costs were $957 million in 2008 and are expected to be about $1.0 billion
per year in 2009 and 2010. Capitalized environmental costs were $1,025 million in 2008 and are
expected to be about $900 million per year in 2009 and 2010.

We accrue for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and
reasonable estimates of the liability can be made. These accrued liabilities are not reduced for
potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those
assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis).

Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require us to
undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once
conducted, operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips-generated waste was disposed. The accrual
also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which
are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. If applicable, we
accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may
incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect
to these costs, and under adverse changes in circumstances, potential liability may exceed amounts
accrued as of December 31, 2008.

Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the
mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies
and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties.
Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs.

At December 31, 2008, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $979 million,
compared with $1,089 million at December 31, 2007. We expect to incur a substantial amount of
these expenditures within the next 30 years.

Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses,
environmental costs and liabilities are inherent in our operations and products, and there can be
no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do
not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a
result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations.

Climate Change

There has been a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws
focusing on greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. These proposed or promulgated laws apply or could
apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws in this field
continue to evolve, and while they are likely to be increasingly widespread and stringent, at this
stage it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future
compliance costs relating to implementation. Compliance with changes in laws, regulations and
obligations that create a GHG emissions trading scheme or GHG reduction policies generally could
significantly increase costs or reduce demand for fossil energy derived products. Examples of
legislation or precursors for possible regulation that does or could affect our operations include:

•

European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the program through which many of the European
Union (EU) member states are implementing the Kyoto Protocol.

•

California’s Global Warming Solutions Act, which requires the California Air Resources
Board (CARB) to develop regulations and market mechanisms that will ultimately reduce
California’s greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent by 2020.



•

Two regulations issued by the Alberta government in 2007 under the Climate Change and
Emissions Act. These regulations require any existing facility with emissions equal to or
greater than 100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide or equivalent per year to reduce the net
emissions intensity of that facility by 2 percent per year beginning July 1, 2007, with an
ultimate reduction target of 12 percent of baseline emissions.

•

The U.S. Supreme Court decision in

Massachusetts v. EPA

, 549 U.S. 497, 127 S.Ct.
1438 (2007) confirming that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has the
authority to regulate carbon dioxide as an “air pollutant”
under the Federal Clean Air Act.

In the EU, we have assets that are subject to the ETS. The first phase of the EU ETS was completed
at the end of 2007, with EU ETS phase II running from 2008 through 2012. The European Commission
has approved most of the phase II national allocation plans. We are actively engaged to minimize
any financial impact from the trading scheme.

In the United States, there is growing consensus that some form of regulation will be forthcoming
at the federal level with respect to GHG emissions and such regulation could result in the creation
of additional costs in the form of taxes or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances.
In light of this consensus, we have taken a position to encourage the adoption of a pragmatic and
sustainable regulatory framework addressing GHG. To that end, we joined the U.S. Climate Action
Partnership (USCAP) in support of the development of a national regulatory framework to reduce the
level of GHG emissions. We support a framework that is economically sustainable, environmentally
effective, transparent and fair, and internationally linked. We are working to continuously
improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our
operations.

Other

We have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, loss carryforwards and credit
carryforwards. Valuation allowances have been established to reduce these deferred tax assets to
an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Based on our historical taxable income,
our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects that the
net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as
reductions in future taxable income.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141
(Revised), “Business Combinations” (SFAS No. 141(R)). This Statement will apply to all
transactions in which an entity obtains control of one or more other businesses. In general, SFAS
No. 141(R) requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the fair value of
all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction; establishes the acquisition
date as the fair value measurement point; and modifies the disclosure requirements. Additionally,
it changes the accounting treatment for transaction costs, acquired contingent arrangements,
in-process research and development, restructuring costs, changes in deferred tax asset valuation
allowances as a result of business combination, and changes in income tax uncertainties after the
acquisition date. This Statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the
acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009. However, starting January 1, 2009, accounting for
changes in valuation allowances for acquired deferred tax assets and the resolution of uncertain
tax positions for prior business combinations will impact tax expense instead of impacting
goodwill.

Also in December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated
Financial Statements—an amendment of ARB No. 51,” which requires noncontrolling interests, also
called minority interests, to be presented as a separate item in the equity section of the
consolidated balance sheet. It also requires the amount of consolidated net income attributable to
the noncontrolling interest to be clearly presented on the face of the consolidated income
statement. Additionally, this Statement clarifies that changes in a parent’s ownership interest in
a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions, and when a subsidiary
is deconsolidated, it requires gain or loss recognition in net income based on the fair value on
the deconsolidation date. This Statement is effective January 1,
2009, and will be applied prospectively



with the exception of the presentation and disclosure requirements, which must be applied
retrospectively for all periods presented.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities—an amendment of FASB No. 133.” This Statement expands disclosure requirements of SFAS
No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” for derivative instruments
within the scope of that Statement to provide greater transparency. This includes disclosure of
the additional information regarding how and why derivative instruments are used, how derivatives
are accounted for, and how they affect an entity’s financial performance. This Statement is
effective for interim and annual financial statements beginning with the first quarter of 2009, but
it will not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements, other than the additional
disclosures.

In November 2008, the FASB reached a consensus on Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 08-6,
“Equity Method Investment Accounting Considerations” (EITF 08-6), which was issued to clarify how
the application of equity method accounting will be affected by SFAS No. 141(R) and SFAS No. 160.
EITF 08-6 clarifies that an entity shall continue to use the cost accumulation model for its equity
method investments. It also confirms past accounting practices related to the treatment of
contingent consideration and the use of the impairment model under
Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 18, “The
Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock.” Additionally, it
requires an equity method investor to account for a share issuance by an investee as if the
investor had sold a proportionate share of the investment. This issue is effective January 1,
2009, and will be applied prospectively.

In December 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. 132(R)-1, “Employers’ Disclosures
about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets,” to improve the transparency associated with the
disclosures about the plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. This
FSP requires the disclosure of each major asset category at fair value using the fair value
hierarchy in SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.” Also, this FSP requires entities to disclose
the net periodic benefit cost recognized for each annual period for which a statement of income is
presented. This FSP is effective for annual statements beginning with 2009.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note
1—Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our
major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and
uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different
amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been
used. These critical accounting estimates are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee of
the Board of Directors at least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical
accounting estimates, along with the discussions of contingencies and of deferred tax asset
valuation allowances in this report, address all important accounting areas where the nature of
accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment
necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change.

Oil and Gas Accounting

Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules unique to
the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information, prior
to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research
and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory well costs are
capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have
been discovered on the prospect.

Property Acquisition Costs

For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on
exploration and drilling efforts to date. For leasehold acquisition costs that individually are
relatively small, management



exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the
prospect ultimately will fail to find proved
oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold information with others in the geographic area. For
prospects in areas that have had limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage
probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is
multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period
of the leasehold to determine a periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in
exploration expense.

This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period
of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on
adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. At
year-end 2008, the book value of the pools of property acquisition costs, that individually are
relatively small and thus subject to the above-described periodic leasehold impairment calculation,
was $1,447 million and the accumulated impairment reserve was
$494 million. The weighted-average
judgmental percentage probability of ultimate failure was
approximately 65 percent, and the weighted-average amortization period was approximately 2.4 years. If that judgmental percentage were to be
raised by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax leasehold impairment expense in 2009 would
increase by approximately $30 million. The remaining $4,745 million of capitalized unproved
property costs at year-end 2008 consisted of individually significant leaseholds, mineral rights
held in perpetuity by title ownership, exploratory wells currently drilling, and suspended
exploratory wells. Management periodically assesses individually significant leaseholds for
impairment based on the results of exploration and drilling efforts and the outlook for project
commercialization. Of this amount, approximately $2.4 billion is concentrated in 10 major
development areas. None of these major assets are expected to move to proved properties in 2009.

Exploratory Costs

For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or “suspended,” on the balance
sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been
discovered by the drilling effort to justify completion of the find as a producing well.

Once a determination is made the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas
quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and reported in exploration expense. If
exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain
capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the
economic and operating viability of the project is being made. The accounting notion of “sufficient
progress” is a judgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of
suspended well costs on the mere chance that future market conditions will improve or new
technologies will be found that would make the project’s development economically profitable.
Often, the ability to move the project into the development phase and record proved reserves is
dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is
ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as the company is
actively pursuing such approvals and permits, and believes they will be obtained. Once all
required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development
phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves. For complex exploratory
discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for
several years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil
and gas field, or while we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans or seek
environmental permitting.

Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of the
additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as a dry hole
when it determines the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term.
Criteria utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristics
and hydrocarbon properties, expected development costs, ability to apply existing technology to
produce the reserves, fiscal terms, regulations or contract negotiations, and our required return
on investment.

At year-end 2008, total suspended well costs were $660 million, compared with $589 million at
year-end 2007. For additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see Note
8—Properties, Plants and Equipment, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



Proved Oil and Gas Reserves and Canadian Syncrude Reserves

Engineering estimates of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves in oil and gas fields
and in-place crude bitumen volumes in oil sand mining operations are inherently imprecise and
represent only approximate amounts because of the subjective judgments involved in developing such
information. Reserve estimates are based on subjective judgments involving geological and
engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production or mining plan, historical
extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and operating
approval limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the
quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and
processing the hydrocarbons.

Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require
disclosure of “proved” reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better
understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a company’s E&P operations. There are
several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before
estimated reserves can be designated as “proved.” Our reservoir engineering organization has
policies and procedures in place that are consistent with these authoritative guidelines. We have
trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved crude oil, natural
gas and natural gas liquids reserves held by consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity
affiliates, with assistance from third-party petroleum engineering consultants with regard to our
equity interests in LUKOIL and Australia Pacific LNG.

Proved reserve estimates are updated annually and take into account recent production and
subsurface information about each field or oil sand mining operation. Also, as required by current
authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when a field or oil sand mining operation will
be permanently shut down for economic reasons is based on an extrapolation of sales prices and
operating costs prevalent at the balance sheet date. This estimated date when production will end
affects the amount of estimated reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to
year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes.

Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to production sharing contracts, which are
reported under the “economic interest” method and are subject to fluctuations in prices of crude
oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs. If
costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to
changes in commodity prices. For example, if prices increase, then our applicable reserve
quantities would decline.

The estimation of proved reserves also is important to the statement of operations because the
proved oil and gas reserve estimate for a field or the estimated in-place crude bitumen volume for
an oil sand mining operation serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of
depreciation, depletion and amortization of the capitalized costs for that asset. At year-end
2008, the net book value of productive E&P properties, plants and equipment subject to a
unit-of-production calculation, including our Canadian Syncrude bitumen oil sand assets, was
approximately $58 billion and the depreciation, depletion and amortization recorded on these assets
in 2008 was approximately $7.7 billion. The estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves of
these fields were 6.1 billion BOE at the beginning of 2008 and were 5.5 billion BOE at the end of
2008. The estimated proved reserves of Canadian Syncrude assets were 221 million barrels at the
beginning of 2008 and were 249 million barrels at the end of 2008. If the estimates of proved
reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 5 percent across all
calculations, pretax depreciation, depletion and amortization in 2008 would have increased by an
estimated $406 million. Impairments of producing oil and gas properties in 2008, 2007 and 2006
totaled $793 million, $471 million and $215 million, respectively. Of these write-downs,
$56 million in 2008, $76 million in 2007 and $131 million in 2006 were due to downward revisions of
proved reserves due to reservoir performance.

Impairments

Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and
circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be
generated by an asset group. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less
than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair
value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of
the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that



are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets—generally on a field-by-field
basis for exploration and production assets, at an entire complex level for downstream assets, or
at a site level for retail stores. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for
long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is determined based on the present values of
expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the asset
group or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions
of similar assets where possible. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and
related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes,
prices and costs, considering all available information at the date of review. See Note
10—Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.

Investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for
impairment when there is evidence of a loss in value. Such evidence of a loss in value might
include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which
would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair value less than the investment’s
carrying amount. When it is determined such a loss in value is other than temporary, an impairment
charge is recognized for the difference between the investment’s carrying value and its estimated
fair value. When determining whether a decline in value is other than
temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the
investee’s financial condition and near-term prospects, and the company’s ability and intention to
retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in
the market value of the investment. When quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is
usually based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate
with the risks of the investment. Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of
an impairment of an investment in any period. For additional information, see the “LUKOIL” section
of Note 7—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs

Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove
tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites.
Our largest asset removal obligations involve removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas
platforms around the world, oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska, and asbestos
abatement at refineries. The fair values of obligations for dismantling and removing these
facilities are accrued at the installation of the asset based on estimated discounted costs.
Estimating the future asset removal costs necessary for this accounting calculation is difficult.
Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and
regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when
the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs are changing constantly,
as well as political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations.

In addition, under the above or similar contracts, permits and regulations, we have certain
obligations to complete environmental-related projects. These projects are primarily related to
cleanup at domestic refineries and underground storage tanks at U.S. service stations, and
remediation activities required by Canada and the state of Alaska at exploration and production
sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to estimate because they are subject
to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and
extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in
proportion to that of other responsible parties.



Business Acquisitions

Purchase Price Allocation

Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the
various assets and liabilities of the acquired business. For most assets and liabilities, purchase
price allocation is accomplished by recording the asset or liability at its estimated fair value.
The most difficult estimations of individual fair values are those involving properties, plants and
equipment and identifiable intangible assets. We use all available information to make these fair
value determinations. We have, if necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date to
finish these fair value determinations and finalize the purchase price allocation.

Intangible Assets and Goodwill

At December 31, 2008, we had $738 million of intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful
lives, thus they are not amortized. This judgmental assessment of an indefinite useful life must
be continuously evaluated in the future. If, due to changes in facts and circumstances, management
determines these intangible assets have definite useful lives, amortization will have to commence
at that time on a prospective basis. As long as these intangible assets are judged to have
indefinite lives, they will be subject to periodic lower-of-cost-or-market tests that require
management’s judgment of the estimated fair value of these intangible assets. See Note 9—Goodwill
and Intangibles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.

In the fourth quarter of 2008, we fully impaired the recorded goodwill associated with our
Worldwide E&P reporting unit. See the “Goodwill Impairment” section of Note 9—Goodwill and
Intangibles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by
reference, for a detailed discussion of the facts and circumstances leading to this impairment, as
well as the judgments required by management in the analysis leading to the impairment
determination. After the goodwill impairment, at December 31, 2008, we had $3,778 million of
goodwill remaining on our balance sheet, all of which was attributable to the Worldwide R&M
reporting unit.

Projected Benefit Obligations

Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and
postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance
sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the statement of operations. The actuarial
determination of projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements involves
judgment about uncertain future events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at
retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health
care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees. Due to the
specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the
determination of these projected benefit obligations and company contribution requirements. For
Employee Retirement Income Security Act-qualified pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary
care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in
determining required company contributions into plan assets. Due to differing objectives and
requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations
promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes
differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised
benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment
returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect
periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Benefit expense is particularly
sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1 percent decrease in the
discount rate would increase annual benefit expense by $79 million, while a 1 percent decrease in
the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $43 million. In
determining the discount rate, we use yields on high-quality fixed income investments matched to
the estimated benefit cash flows of our plans.

Factors” in this report.

Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Financial Instrument Market Risk

We and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments
that expose our cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates or
interest rates. We may use financial and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage the risks
produced by changes in the prices of electric power, natural gas, crude oil and related products,
fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, or to exploit market
opportunities.

Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “Authority Limitations” document approved by
our Board of Directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative
instruments without sufficient liquidity for comparable valuations. The Authority Limitations
document also authorizes the Chief Operating Officer to establish the maximum Value at Risk (VaR)
limits for the company and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. The Chief Financial
Officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and
reports to the Chief Executive Officer. The Senior Vice President of Commercial monitors commodity
price risk and reports to the Chief Operating Officer. The Commercial organization manages our
commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, monitors related risks of our
upstream and downstream businesses, and selectively takes price risk to add value.

Commodity Price Risk

We operate in the worldwide crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, and
electric power markets and are exposed to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities. These
fluctuations can affect our revenues, as well as the cost of operating, investing, and financing
activities. Generally, our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of commodities;
however, executive management may elect to use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk of
our crude oil and natural gas production, as well as refinery margins.

Our Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps, and options in various markets to
optimize the value of our supply chain, which may move our risk profile away from market average
prices to accomplish the following objectives:

•

Balance physical systems. In addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration,
exchange-traded futures contracts also may be settled by physical delivery of the
commodity, providing another source of supply to meet our refinery requirements or
marketing demand.

•

Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market
prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed-price sales contracts, which are often
requested by natural gas and refined product consumers, to a floating market price.

•

Manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil, natural
gas, refined product and electric power transactions.

•

Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from these activities to do a limited
amount of trading not directly related to our physical business. For the years ended
December 31, 2008 and 2007, the gains or losses from this activity were not material to our
cash flows or net income.

We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day
from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and
derivative commodity instruments held or issued, including commodity purchase and sales contracts
recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2008, as derivative instruments in accordance with
SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended (SFAS No.
133). Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period,
the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
was immaterial to our net income and cash flows.



The VaR for instruments held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2008 and 2007, was
also immaterial to our net income and cash flows.

Interest Rate Risk

The following tables provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to
changes in short-term U.S. interest rates. The debt table presents principal cash flows and
related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted-average variable
rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date. The carrying
amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the fixed-rate
financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices.

Foreign Currency Risk

We have foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from international operations. We do not
comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency rate changes, although we may choose to selectively
hedge exposures to foreign currency rate risk. Examples include firm commitments for capital
projects, net investments in foreign subsidiaries, certain local currency tax payments and
dividends, and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the
coming year.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we held foreign currency swaps hedging short-term intercompany loans
between European subsidiaries and a U.S. subsidiary. Although these swaps hedge exposures to
fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting as allowed by SFAS No.
133. As a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency swaps is recorded
directly in earnings. Since the gain or loss on the swaps is offset by the gain or loss from
remeasuring the intercompany loans into the functional currency of the lender or borrower, there
would be no material impact to income from an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the
December 31, 2008 or 2007, exchange rates. The notional and fair market values of these positions
at December 31, 2008 and 2007, were as follows:

Report of Management

Management prepared, and is responsible for, the consolidated financial statements and the other
information appearing in this annual report. The consolidated financial statements present fairly
the company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In preparing its consolidated
financial statements, the company includes amounts that are based on estimates and judgments that
management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The company’s financial statements
have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm appointed
by the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors and ratified by stockholders.
Management has made available to Ernst & Young LLP all of the company’s financial records and
related data, as well as the minutes of stockholders’ and directors’ meetings.

Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting. ConocoPhillips’ internal control system was designed to provide reasonable
assurance to the company’s management and directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation
of published financial statements.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore,
even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to
financial statement preparation and presentation.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2008. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

.
Based on our assessment, we believe the company’s internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December 31, 2008.

Ernst & Young LLP has issued an audit report on the company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2008.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Consolidated Financial Statements

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

ConocoPhillips

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ConocoPhillips as of December 31,
2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in common
stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2008. Our audits also included the related condensed consolidating
financial information listed in the Index at Item 8 and
financial statement schedule listed in Item 15(a). These financial statements, condensed
consolidating financial information, and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements, condensed
consolidating financial information, and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of ConocoPhillips at December 31, 2008 and 2007, and
the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Also, in our opinion, the related condensed consolidating financial information and financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
present fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2006 ConocoPhillips adopted
Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04-13, “Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with
the Same Counterparty,” and the recognition and disclosure provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R).”

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), ConocoPhillips’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 25,
2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

ConocoPhillips

We have audited ConocoPhillips’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008,
based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). ConocoPhillips’
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and
for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included under
the heading “Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting” in the accompanying “Report
of Management.” Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, ConocoPhillips maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the 2008 consolidated financial statements of ConocoPhillips and our report
dated February 25, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

ConocoPhillips

Note 1—Accounting Policies

•

Consolidation Principles and Investments—

Our
consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of majority-owned, controlled
subsidiaries and variable interest entities
where we are the primary beneficiary. The
equity method is used to account for
investments in affiliates in which we have
the ability to exert significant influence
over the affiliates’ operating and financial
policies. The cost method is used when we do
not have the ability to exert significant
influence. Undivided interests in oil and
gas joint ventures, pipelines, natural gas
plants, terminals and Canadian Syncrude
mining operations are consolidated on a
proportionate basis. Other securities and
investments, excluding marketable securities,
are generally carried at cost.

•

Foreign Currency Translation—

Adjustments
resulting from the process of translating
foreign functional currency financial
statements into U.S. dollars are included in
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
in common stockholders’ equity. Foreign
currency transaction gains and losses are
included in current earnings. Most of our
foreign operations use their local currency
as the functional currency.

•

Use of Estimates—

The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United
States requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses, and the disclosures of contingent
assets and liabilities. Actual results could
differ from these estimates.

•

Revenue Recognition—

Revenues associated with
sales of crude oil, natural gas, natural gas
liquids, petroleum and chemical products, and
other items are recognized when title passes
to the customer, which is when the risk of
ownership passes to the purchaser and
physical delivery of goods occurs, either
immediately or within a fixed delivery
schedule that is reasonable and customary in
the industry.

Prior to April 1, 2006, revenues included the sales portion of transactions commonly called
buy/sell contracts. Effective April 1, 2006, we implemented Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF)
Issue No. 04-13, “Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty.”
Issue No. 04-13 requires purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty and
entered into “in contemplation” of one another to be combined and reported net (i.e., on the
same income statement line). See Note 2—Changes in Accounting Principles, for additional
information about our adoption of this Issue.

Revenues from the production of natural gas and crude oil properties, in which we have an
interest with other producers, are recognized based on the actual volumes we sold during the
period. Any differences between volumes sold and entitlement volumes, based on our net working
interest, which are deemed to be nonrecoverable through remaining production, are recognized as
accounts receivable or accounts payable, as appropriate. Cumulative differences between
volumes sold and entitlement volumes are generally not significant.

Revenues associated with royalty fees from licensed technology are recorded based either upon
volumes produced by the licensee or upon the successful completion of all substantive
performance requirements related to the installation of licensed technology.

•

Shipping and Handling Costs—

Our Exploration and Production (E&P) segment includes shipping
and handling costs in production and operating expenses for production activities.
Transportation costs related to E&P marketing activities are
recorded in purchased crude oil, natural gas and products. The



Refining and Marketing (R&M) segment records shipping and handling costs in purchased crude
oil, natural gas and products. Freight costs billed to customers are recorded as a component
of revenue.

•

Cash Equivalents—

Cash equivalents are highly liquid, short-term
investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash
and have original maturities of three months or less from their
date of purchase. They are carried at cost plus accrued interest,
which approximates fair value.

•

Inventories—

We have several valuation methods for our various
types of inventories and consistently use the following methods
for each type of inventory. Crude oil, petroleum products, and
Canadian Syncrude inventories are valued at the lower of cost or
market in the aggregate, primarily on the last-in, first-out
(LIFO) basis. Any necessary lower-of-cost-or-market write-downs
at year end are recorded as permanent adjustments to the LIFO cost
basis. LIFO is used to better match current inventory costs with
current revenues and to meet tax-conformity requirements. Costs
include both direct and indirect expenditures incurred in bringing
an item or product to its existing condition and location, but not
unusual/nonrecurring costs or research and development costs.
Materials, supplies and other miscellaneous inventories, such as
tubular goods and well equipment, are valued under various
methods, including the weighted-average-cost method, and the
first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, consistent with industry
practice.

•

Derivative Instruments—

All derivative instruments are recorded on
the balance sheet at fair value in either prepaid expenses and
other current assets, other assets, other accruals, or other
liabilities and deferred credits. If the right of offset exists
and the other criteria of Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) Interpretation No. 39, “Offsetting of Amounts Related to
Certain Contracts—an interpretation of APB Opinion No. 10 and FASB
Statement No. 105” (FIN 39), are met, derivative assets and
liabilities with the same counterparty are netted on the balance
sheet and collateral payable or receivable is netted against
derivative assets and derivative liabilities, respectively.

Recognition and classification of the gain or loss that results from recording and adjusting a
derivative to fair value depends on the purpose for issuing or holding the derivative. Gains
and losses from derivatives that are not accounted for as hedges under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,” are recognized immediately in earnings. For derivative instruments that are
designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gains or losses from adjusting the derivative
to its fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings and, to the extent the hedge is
effective, offset the concurrent recognition of changes in the fair value of the hedged item.
Gains or losses from derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow
hedge or hedge of a net investment in a foreign entity will be recorded on the balance sheet in
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged transaction is recognized in
earnings; however, to the extent the change in the value of the derivative exceeds the change
in the anticipated cash flows of the hedged transaction, the excess gains or losses will be
recognized immediately in earnings.

In the consolidated statement of operations, gains and losses from derivatives that are held
for trading and not directly related to our physical business are recorded in other income.
Gains and losses from derivatives used for other purposes are recorded in either sales and
other operating revenues; other income; purchased crude oil, natural gas and products; interest
and debt expense; or foreign currency transaction (gains) losses, depending on the purpose for
issuing or holding the derivatives.

•

Oil and Gas Exploration and Development—

Oil and gas exploration and development costs are
accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting.

Property Acquisition Costs—

Oil and gas leasehold acquisition costs are capitalized and
included in the balance sheet caption properties, plants and equipment. Leasehold
impairment is recognized based on exploratory experience and management’s judgment. Upon
achievement of all conditions



necessary for the classification of reserves as proved, the associated leasehold costs are
reclassified to proved properties.

Exploratory Costs—

Geological and geophysical costs and the costs of carrying and retaining
undeveloped properties are expensed as incurred. Exploratory well costs are capitalized, or
“suspended,” on the balance sheet pending further evaluation of whether economically
recoverable reserves have been found. If economically recoverable reserves are not found,
exploratory well costs are expensed as dry holes. If exploratory wells encounter
potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the
balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and
operating viability of the project is being made. For complex exploratory discoveries, it
is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several
years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil
and gas field, or while we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans or
seek environmental permitting. Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained,
the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves are
designated as proved reserves.

Management reviews suspended well balances quarterly, continuously monitors the results of
the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work, and expenses the suspended well costs as
a dry hole when it judges that the potential field does not warrant further investment in
the near term.

See Note 8—Properties, Plants and Equipment, for additional information on suspended wells.

Development Costs—

Costs incurred to drill and equip development wells, including
unsuccessful development wells, are capitalized.

Depletion and Amortization—

Leasehold costs of producing properties are depleted using the
unit-of-production method based on estimated proved oil and gas reserves. Amortization of
intangible development costs is based on the unit-of-production method using estimated
proved developed oil and gas reserves.

•

Syncrude Mining Operations—

Capitalized costs, including support
facilities, include property acquisition costs and other capital
costs incurred. Capital costs are depreciated using the
unit-of-production method based on the applicable portion of
proven reserves associated with each mine location and its
facilities.

•

Capitalized Interest—

Interest from external borrowings is
capitalized on major projects with an expected construction period
of one year or longer. Capitalized interest is added to the cost
of the underlying asset and is amortized over the useful lives of
the assets in the same manner as the underlying assets.

•

Intangible Assets Other Than Goodwill—

Intangible assets that have
finite useful lives are amortized by the straight-line method over
their useful lives. Intangible assets that have indefinite useful
lives are not amortized but are tested at least annually for
impairment. Each reporting period, we evaluate the remaining
useful lives of intangible assets not being amortized to determine
whether events and circumstances continue to support indefinite
useful lives. Intangible assets are considered impaired if the
fair value of the intangible asset is lower than net book value.
The fair value of intangible assets is determined based on quoted
market prices in active markets, if available. If quoted market
prices are not available, fair value of intangible assets is
determined based upon the present values of expected future cash
flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in
the asset, or upon estimated replacement cost, if expected future
cash flows from the intangible asset are not determinable.



•

Goodwill—

Goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment. If the fair
value of a reporting unit is less than the recorded book value of the reporting unit’s assets
(including goodwill), less liabilities, then a hypothetical purchase price allocation is
performed on the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities using the fair value of the reporting
unit as the purchase price in the calculation. If the amount of goodwill resulting from this
hypothetical purchase price allocation is less than the recorded amount of goodwill, the
recorded goodwill is written down to the new amount. For purposes of goodwill impairment
calculations, two reporting units have been determined: Worldwide Exploration and Production
and Worldwide Refining and Marketing.

•

Depreciation and Amortization—

Depreciation and amortization of
properties, plants and equipment on producing oil and gas
properties, certain pipeline assets (those which are expected to
have a declining utilization pattern), and on Syncrude mining
operations are determined by the unit-of-production method.
Depreciation and amortization of all other properties, plants and
equipment are determined by either the
individual-unit-straight-line method or the group-straight-line
method (for those individual units that are highly integrated with
other units).

•

Impairment of Properties, Plants and Equipment—

Properties, plants
and equipment used in operations are assessed for impairment
whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible
significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be
generated by an asset group. If, upon review, the sum of the
undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of
the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated
fair value through additional amortization or depreciation
provisions and reported as impairments in the periods in which the
determination of the impairment is made. Individual assets are
grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which
there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of
the cash flows of other groups of assets—generally on a
field-by-field basis for exploration and production assets, at an
entire complex level for refining assets or at a site level for
retail stores. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market
prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is
determined based on the present values of expected future cash
flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in
the asset group or based on a multiple of operating cash flow
validated with historical market transactions of similar assets
where possible. Long-lived assets committed by management for
disposal within one year are accounted for at the lower of
amortized cost or fair value, less cost to sell.

The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations
are based on estimated future production volumes, prices and costs, considering all available
evidence at the date of review. If the future production price risk has been hedged, the
hedged price is used in the calculations for the period and quantities hedged. The impairment
review includes cash flows from proved developed and undeveloped reserves, including any
development expenditures necessary to achieve that production. Additionally, when probable
reserves exist, an appropriate risk-adjusted amount of these reserves may be included in the
impairment calculation. The price and cost outlook assumptions used in impairment reviews
differ from the assumptions used in the Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash
Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Gas Reserve Quantities. In that disclosure, SFAS No. 69,
“Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities,” requires inclusion of only proved
reserves and the use of prices and costs at the balance sheet date, with no projection for
future changes in assumptions.

•

Impairment of Investments in Nonconsolidated Entities—

Investments
in nonconsolidated entities are assessed for impairment whenever
changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value
has occurred, which is other than a temporary decline in value.
The fair value of the impaired investment is based on quoted
market prices, if available, or upon the present value of expected
future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks
of the investment.

•

Maintenance and Repairs—

The costs of maintenance and repairs,
which are not significant improvements, are expensed when
incurred.



•

Advertising Costs—

Production costs of media advertising are
deferred until the first public showing of the advertisement.
Advances to secure advertising slots at specific sporting or other
events are deferred until the event occurs. All other advertising
costs are expensed as incurred, unless the cost has benefits that
clearly extend beyond the interim period in which the expenditure
is made, in which case the advertising cost is deferred and
amortized ratably over the interim periods, that clearly benefit
from the expenditure.

•

Property Dispositions—

When complete units of depreciable property
are sold, the asset cost and related accumulated depreciation are
eliminated, with any gain or loss reflected in other income. When
less than complete units of depreciable property are disposed of
or retired, the difference between asset cost and salvage value is
charged or credited to accumulated depreciation.

•

Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs—

We record the
fair value of legal obligations to retire and remove long-lived
assets in the period in which the obligation is incurred
(typically when the asset is installed at the production
location). When the liability is initially recorded, we
capitalize this cost by increasing the carrying amount of the
related properties, plants and equipment. Over time the liability
is increased for the change in its present value, and the
capitalized cost in properties, plants and equipment is
depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. See
Note 11—Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental
Costs, for additional information.

Environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized, depending upon their future economic
benefit. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations, and do
not have a future economic benefit, are expensed. Liabilities for environmental expenditures
are recorded on an undiscounted basis (unless acquired in a purchase business combination) when
environmental assessments or cleanups are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.
Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties, such as state reimbursement
funds, are recorded as assets when their receipt is probable and estimable.

•

Guarantees—

The fair value of a guarantee is determined and
recorded as a liability at the time the guarantee is given. The
initial liability is subsequently reduced as we are released from
exposure under the guarantee. We amortize the guarantee liability
over the relevant time period, if one exists, based on the facts
and circumstances surrounding each type of guarantee. In cases
where the guarantee term is indefinite, we reverse the liability
when we have information that the liability is essentially
relieved or amortize it over an appropriate time period as the
fair value of our guarantee exposure declines over time. We
amortize the guarantee liability to the related statement of
operations line item based on the nature of the guarantee. When
it becomes probable that we will have to perform on a guarantee,
we accrue a separate liability if it is reasonably estimable,
based on the facts and circumstances at that time. We reverse the
fair value liability only when there is no further exposure under
the guarantee.

•

Stock-Based Compensation—

Effective January 1, 2003, we voluntarily
adopted the fair value accounting method prescribed by SFAS No.
123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” We used the
prospective transition method, applying the fair value accounting
method and recognizing compensation expense equal to the
fair-market value on the grant date for all stock options granted
or modified after December 31, 2002.

Employee stock options granted prior to 2003 were accounted for under Accounting Principles
Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related
Interpretations; however, by the end of 2005, all of these awards had vested.

Generally, our stock-based compensation programs provided accelerated vesting (i.e., a waiver
of the remaining period of service required to earn an award) for awards held by employees at
the time of their retirement. We recognized expense for these awards over the period of time
during which the employee earned the award, accelerating the recognition of expense only when
an employee actually retired.



Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised
2004), “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS No. 123(R)), which requires us to recognize stock-based compensation expense for new
awards over the shorter of: 1) the service period (i.e., the stated period of time required to
earn the award); or 2) the period beginning at the start of the service period and ending when
an employee first becomes eligible for retirement. This shortens the period over which we
recognize expense for most of our stock-based awards granted to our employees who are already
age 55 or older, but it has not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
For share-based awards granted after our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we have elected to
recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the service period for the entire award,
whether the award was granted with ratable or cliff vesting.

•

Income Taxes—

Deferred income taxes are computed using the
liability method and are provided on all temporary differences
between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our
assets and liabilities, except for deferred taxes on income
considered to be permanently reinvested in certain foreign
subsidiaries and foreign corporate joint ventures. Allowable tax
credits are applied currently as reductions of the provision for
income taxes. Interest related to unrecognized tax benefits is
reflected in interest expense, and penalties in production and
operating expenses.

•

Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental
Authorities—

Excise taxes are reported gross within sales and other
operating revenues and taxes other than income taxes, while other
sales and value-added taxes are recorded net in taxes other than
income taxes.

•

Net Income (Loss) Per Share of Common Stock—

Basic net income
(loss) per share of common stock is calculated based upon the
daily weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during
the year, including unallocated shares held by the stock savings
feature of the ConocoPhillips Savings Plan. Also, this
calculation includes fully vested stock and unit awards that have
not been issued. Diluted net income per share of common stock
includes the above, plus unvested stock, unit or option awards
granted under our compensation plans and vested but unexercised
stock options, but only to the extent these instruments dilute net
income per share. Diluted net loss per share is calculated the
same as basic net loss per share—that is, it does not assume
conversion or exercise of securities, totaling 17,354,959 in 2008,
that would have an antidilutive effect. Treasury stock and shares
held by the grantor trusts are excluded from the daily
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding in both
calculations.

•

Accounting for Sales of Stock by Subsidiary or Equity Investees—

We
recognize a gain or loss upon the direct sale of nonpreference
equity by our subsidiaries or equity investees if the sales price
differs from our carrying amount, and provided that the sale of
such equity is not part of a broader corporate reorganization.

Note 2—Changes in Accounting Principles

SFAS No. 157

Effective January 1, 2008, we implemented FASB SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements,” which
defines fair value, establishes a framework for its measurement and expands disclosures about fair
value measurements. We elected to implement this Statement with the one-year deferral permitted by
FASB Staff Position (FSP) 157-2 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities measured at
fair value, except those that are recognized or disclosed on a recurring basis (at least annually).
The deferral applies to nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in a business
combination; impaired properties, plants and equipment; intangible assets and goodwill; and initial
recognition of asset retirement obligations and restructuring costs for which we use fair value.
We do not expect any significant impact to our consolidated financial statements when we implement
SFAS No. 157 for these assets and liabilities.

Due to our election under FSP 157-2, for 2008, SFAS No. 157 applies to commodity and foreign
currency derivative contracts and certain nonqualified deferred compensation and retirement plan
assets that are



measured at fair value on a recurring basis in periods subsequent to initial
recognition. The implementation of SFAS No. 157 did not cause a change in the method of
calculating fair value of assets or liabilities, with the exception of incorporating the impact of our nonperformance risk on derivative liabilities—which
was not material. The primary impact from adoption was additional disclosures.

SFAS No. 157 requires disclosures that categorize assets and liabilities measured at fair value
into one of three different levels depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the
measurement. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities. Level 2 inputs are observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1
for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market-corroborated inputs.
Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability reflecting significant
modifications to observable related market data or our assumptions about pricing by market
participants.

We value our exchange-cleared derivatives using closing prices provided by the exchange as of the
balance sheet date, and these are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Over the
counter (OTC) financial swaps and physical commodity purchase and sale contracts are generally
valued using quotations provided by brokers and price index developers such as Platts and Oil Price
Information Service. These quotes are corroborated with market data and are classified as Level 2.
In certain less liquid markets or for longer-term contracts, forward prices are not as readily
available. In these circumstances, OTC swaps and physical commodity purchase and sale contracts
are valued using internally developed methodologies that consider historical relationships among
various commodities that result in management’s best estimate of fair value. These contracts are
classified as Level 3.

Exchange-cleared financial options are valued using exchange closing prices and are classified as
Level 1. Financial OTC and physical commodity options are valued using industry-standard models
that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value,
volatility factors, and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other
relevant economic measures. The degree
to which these inputs are observable in the forward markets determines whether the option is
classified as
Level 2 or 3.

As permitted under SFAS No. 157, we use a mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point between bid
and ask prices). When appropriate, valuations are adjusted to reflect credit considerations,
generally based on available market evidence.

The fair value hierarchy for our financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value on a
recurring basis at December 31, 2008, was:

The derivative values above are based on an analysis of each contract as the fundamental unit of
account as required by SFAS No. 157; therefore, derivative assets and liabilities with the same
counterparty are not netted



where the legal right of offset exists, which is different than the net
presentation basis in Note 16—Financial Instruments and Derivative Contracts. Gains or losses from contracts in one level may be offset by
gains or losses on contracts in another level or by changes in values of physical contracts or
positions that are not reflected in the table above.

During 2008, the fair value of net commodity derivatives classified as Level 3 in the fair value
hierarchy changed as follows:

SFAS No. 159

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities—Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115.” This Statement permits
the election to carry financial instruments and certain other items similar to financial
instruments at fair value on the balance sheet, with all changes in fair value reported in
earnings. By electing the fair value option in conjunction with a derivative, an entity can
achieve an accounting result similar to a fair value hedge without having to comply



with complex
hedge accounting rules. We adopted this Statement effective
January 1, 2008, but did not make a fair value election at that time or during the remainder of 2008 for any financial instruments
not already carried at fair value in accordance with other accounting standards. Accordingly, the
adoption of SFAS No. 159 did not impact our consolidated financial statements.

Other

In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8, “Disclosures about Transfers of
Financial Assets and Interest in Variable Interest Entities.” This FSP requires additional
disclosures about an entity’s involvement with a variable interest entity (VIE) and certain
transfers of financial assets to special-purpose entities and VIEs. This FSP was effective
December 31, 2008, and the additional disclosures related to VIEs have been incorporated into Note
4—Variable Interest Entities (VIEs), including the methodology for determining whether we are the
primary beneficiary of a VIE, whether we have provided financial or other support we were not
contractually required to provide, and other qualitative and quantitative information. We did not
have any transfers of financial assets within the scope of this FSP.

During 2008, we implemented FSP FIN 39-1, “Amendment of FASB Interpretation No. 39,” which requires
a reporting entity to offset rights to reclaim cash collateral or obligations to return cash
collateral against derivative assets and liabilities executed with the same counterparty, if the
entity elects to use netting in accordance with the criteria of FIN 39. The adoption did not have
a material effect on our financial statements. For more information on FSP FIN 39-1, see the
“Derivative Instruments” section of Note 1—Accounting Policies.

In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (FIN 48). This Interpretation provides guidance on
recognition, classification and disclosure concerning uncertain tax liabilities. The evaluation of
a tax position requires recognition of a tax benefit if it is more likely than not it will be
sustained upon examination. We adopted FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007. The adoption did not
have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 21—Income Taxes, for
additional information about income taxes.

Effective April 1, 2006, we implemented EITF Issue No. 04-13, which requires purchases and sales of
inventory with the same counterparty and entered into “in contemplation” of one another to be
combined and reported net (i.e., on the same income statement line). Exceptions to this are
exchanges of finished goods for raw materials or work-in-progress within the same line of business,
which are only reported net if the transaction lacks economic substance. The implementation of
Issue No. 04-13 did not have a material impact on net income.

The table below shows the actual 2008 and 2007, sales and other operating revenues, and purchased
crude oil, natural gas and products under Issue No. 04-13, and the respective pro forma amounts had
this new guidance been effective for periods prior to April 1, 2006.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension
and Other Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R).” This
Statement requires an employer that sponsors one or more single-employer defined benefit plans to:

•

Recognize the funded status of the benefit in its statement of financial position.

•

Recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses
and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period, but are not recognized as
components of net periodic benefit cost.

•

Measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer’s
fiscal year-end statement of financial position.

•

Disclose in the notes to financial statements additional information about certain
effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed
recognition of the gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, and the transition
asset or obligation.

We adopted the provisions of this Statement effective December 31, 2006, except for the requirement
to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer’s fiscal year end,
which we adopted effective December 31, 2008. For information on the impact of the adoption of
this new Statement, see Note 20—Employee Benefit Plans.

Note 3—Acquisition of Burlington Resources Inc.

On March 31, 2006, we completed the $33.9 billion acquisition of Burlington Resources Inc., an
independent exploration and production company that held a substantial position in North American
natural gas proved reserves, production and exploratory acreage. We issued approximately
270.4 million shares of our common stock and paid approximately $17.5 billion in cash.

The final allocation of the purchase price to specific assets and liabilities was completed in the
first quarter of 2007. It was based on the fair value of Burlington Resources long-lived assets
and the conclusion of the fair value determination of all other Burlington Resources assets and
liabilities.

Note 4—Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)

We hold significant variable interests in VIEs that have not been consolidated because we are not
considered the primary beneficiary. Information on these VIEs follows:

We own a 24 percent interest in West2East Pipeline LLC, a company holding a 100 percent interest in
Rockies Express Pipeline LLC. Rockies Express is constructing a natural gas pipeline from Colorado
to Ohio. West2East is a VIE because a third party has a 49 percent voting interest through the end
of the construction of the pipeline, but has no ownership interest. This third party was
originally involved in the project, but exited and retained their voting interest to ensure project
completion. We have no voting interest during the construction phase, but once the pipeline has
been completed, our ownership will increase to 25 percent with a voting interest of 25 percent.
Additionally, we have contracted for approximately 22 percent of the pipeline capacity for a
10-year period once the pipeline becomes operational. Construction commenced on the pipeline in
2006 and is expected to be completed in late 2009. Total construction costs are projected to be
approximately $6.3 billion and our portion is expected to be funded by a combination of equity
contributions and a guarantee of debt incurred by Rockies Express. Given our 24 percent ownership
and the fact the expected returns are shared among the equity holders in proportion to ownership,
we are not the primary beneficiary. We use the equity method of accounting for our investment. In
2006, we issued a guarantee for 24 percent of the $2 billion in credit facilities of Rockies
Express. In addition, we have a guarantee for 24 percent of $600 million of Floating Rate Notes
due 2009 issued by Rockies Express. At December 31, 2008, the book value of our investment in
West2East was $242 million.

We have a 30 percent ownership interest with a 50 percent governance interest in the OOO
Naryanmarneftegaz (NMNG) joint venture to develop resources in the Timan-Pechora province of
Russia. The NMNG joint venture is a VIE because we and our related party, OAO LUKOIL, have
disproportionate interests. When related parties are involved in a VIE, FIN 46(R) indicates that
reasonable judgment should take into account the relevant facts and circumstances for the
determination of the primary beneficiary. The activities of NMNG are more closely aligned with
LUKOIL since they share Russia as a home country and LUKOIL conducts extensive exploration
activities in the same province. Additionally, there are no financial guarantees given by LUKOIL
or us, and LUKOIL owns 70 percent, versus our 30 percent direct interest. As a result, we have
determined we are not the primary beneficiary of NMNG, and we use the equity method of accounting
for this investment. The funding of NMNG has been provided with equity contributions for the
development of the Yuzhno Khylchuyu (YK) field. Initial production from YK was achieved in June
2008. At December 31, 2008, the book value of our investment in the venture was $1,751 million.

Production from the NMNG joint venture fields is transported via pipeline to LUKOIL’s terminal at
Varandey Bay on the Barents Sea and then shipped via tanker to international markets. LUKOIL
completed an expansion of the terminal’s gross oil-throughput capacity from 30,000 barrels per day to
240,000 barrels per day, with us participating in the design and financing of the expansion. The
terminal entity, Varandey Terminal Company, is a VIE because we and our related party, LUKOIL, have
disproportionate interests. We had an obligation to fund, through loans, 30 percent of the
terminal’s costs, but have no governance or direct ownership interest in the terminal. Similar to
NMNG, we determined we are not the primary beneficiary for Varandey because of
LUKOIL’s ownership, the activities are in LUKOIL’s home country, and LUKOIL is the operator of Varandey. We account for our loan to Varandey as a financial
asset. Terminal construction was completed in June 2008, and the final loan amount was $275
million at December 2008 exchange rates, excluding accrued interest. Although repayments are not
required to start until May 2010, Varandey did repay $12 million of interest in the second half of
2008 with available cash. The outstanding accrued interest at December 31, 2008, was $38 million
at December exchange rates.

We have an agreement with Freeport LNG Development, L.P. (Freeport LNG) to participate in a
liquefied natural gas (LNG) receiving terminal in Quintana, Texas. We have no ownership in
Freeport LNG; however, we obtained a 50 percent interest in Freeport LNG GP, Inc (Freeport GP),
which serves as the general partner



managing the venture. We entered into a credit agreement with
Freeport LNG, whereby we agreed to provide loan financing for the construction of the terminal. We also entered into a long-term agreement
with Freeport LNG to use 0.9 billion cubic feet per day of regasification capacity. The terminal
became operational in June 2008, and we began making payments under the terminal use agreement. In
August 2008, the loan was converted from a construction loan to a term loan and consisted of $650
million in loan financing and $124 million of accrued interest. Freeport LNG began making loan
repayments in September 2008 and the loan balance outstanding as of December 31, 2008, was $757
million. Freeport LNG is a VIE because Freeport GP holds no equity in Freeport LNG and the limited
partners of Freeport LNG do not have any substantive decision making ability. We performed an
analysis of the expected losses and determined we are not the primary beneficiary. This expected
loss analysis took into account that the credit support arrangement requires Freeport LNG to
maintain sufficient commercial insurance to mitigate any loan losses. The loan to Freeport LNG is
accounted for as a financial asset, and our investment in Freeport GP is accounted for as an equity
investment.

In the case of Ashford Energy Capital S.A., we consolidate this entity in our financial statements
because we are the primary beneficiary of this VIE based on an analysis of the variability of the
expected losses and expected residual returns. In December 2001, in order to raise funds for
general corporate purposes, ConocoPhillips and Cold Spring Finance S.a.r.l. formed Ashford through
the contribution of a $1 billion ConocoPhillips subsidiary promissory note and $500 million cash by
Cold Spring. Through its initial $500 million investment, Cold Spring is entitled to a cumulative
annual preferred return consisting of 1.32 percent plus a three-month LIBOR rate set at the
beginning of each quarter. The preferred return at December 31, 2008, was 5.37 percent. In 2008,
Cold Spring declined its option to remarket its investment in Ashford. This option remains
available in 2018 and at each 10-year anniversary thereafter. If remarketing is unsuccessful, we
could be required to provide a letter of credit in support of Cold Spring’s investment, or in the
event such a letter of credit is not provided, cause the redemption of Cold Spring’s investment in
Ashford. Should our credit rating fall below investment grade, Ashford would require a letter of
credit to support $475 million of the term loans, as of December 31, 2008, made by Ashford to other
ConocoPhillips subsidiaries. If the letter of credit is not obtained within 60 days, Cold Spring
could cause Ashford to sell the ConocoPhillips subsidiary notes. At December 31, 2008, Ashford
held $2.0 billion of ConocoPhillips subsidiary notes and $28 million in investments unrelated to
ConocoPhillips. We report Cold Spring’s investment as a minority interest because it is not
mandatorily redeemable, and the entity does not have a specified liquidation date. Other than the
obligation to make payment on the subsidiary notes described above, Cold Spring does not have
recourse to our general credit.

Inventories valued on a LIFO basis totaled $3,939 million and $2,974 million at December 31, 2008
and 2007, respectively. The remaining inventories were valued under various methods, including
FIFO and weighted average. The excess of current replacement cost over LIFO cost of inventories
amounted to $1,959 million and $6,668 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.



During 2008, certain international inventory quantity reductions caused a liquidation of LIFO
inventory values resulting in a $39 million benefit to our R&M segment net income. In 2007, a
liquidation of LIFO inventory values increased net income $280 million, of which $260 million was attributable to our R&M
segment. Comparable amounts in 2006 increased net income $39 million, of which $32 million was
attributable to our R&M segment.

Note 6—Assets Held for Sale

In 2006, we announced the commencement of certain asset rationalization efforts. During the third
and fourth quarters of 2006, certain assets included in these efforts met the held-for-sale
criteria of SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.”
Accordingly, in the third and fourth quarters of 2006, on those assets required, we reduced the
carrying value of the assets held for sale to estimated fair value less costs to sell, resulting in
an impairment of properties, plants and equipment, goodwill and intangibles totaling $496 million
before-tax ($464 million after-tax). Further, we ceased depreciation, depletion and amortization
of the properties, plants and equipment associated with these assets in the month they were
classified as held for sale.

During 2007 and 2008, a significant portion of these held-for-sale assets were sold, additional
assets met the held-for-sale criteria, and other assets no longer met the held-for-sale criteria.
As a result, at December 31, 2008 and 2007, we classified $594 million and $1,092 million,
respectively, of noncurrent assets as “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” on our
consolidated balance sheet. In addition, we classified $92 million at year-end 2008 and $159
million at year-end 2007 of noncurrent liabilities as current liabilities, consisting of $78
million for 2008 and $133 million for 2007 in “Accrued income and other taxes” and $14 million and
$26 million, respectively, in “Other accruals.”

The major classes of noncurrent assets and noncurrent liabilities held for sale and classified to
current at December 31 were:

In January 2009, we closed on the sale of a large part of our U.S. retail marketing assets, which
included seller financing in the form of a $370 million five-year note and letters of credit totaling
$54 million. Accordingly, this reduced the R&M noncurrent assets held for sale and reclassified as
current from $554 million to $152 million, and reduced the noncurrent liabilities reclassified as
current from $92 million to $24 million, which includes $19 million of deferred taxes. We expect the disposal of the remaining held-for-sale
assets to be completed in 2009.

Our share of income taxes incurred directly by the equity companies is reported in equity in
earnings of affiliates, and as such is not included in income taxes in our consolidated financial
statements.

At December 31, 2008, retained earnings included $1,178 million related to the undistributed
earnings of affiliated companies. Distributions received from affiliates were $3,259 million,
$3,326 million and $3,294 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Australia Pacific LNG

In October 2008, we closed on a transaction with Origin Energy, an integrated Australian energy
company, to further enhance our long-term Australasian natural gas business. The 50/50 joint
venture will focus on coalbed methane production from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland,
Australia, and LNG processing and export sales.

This transaction gives us access to coalbed methane resources in Australia and enhances our LNG
position with the expected creation of an additional LNG hub targeting the Asia Pacific markets.

Under the terms of the transaction, we paid $5 billion at closing, which after the effect of
hedging gains, resulted in an initial cash acquisition cost of $4.7 billion. In addition, we will
be responsible for AU$1.15 billion related to Origin’s initial share of joint venture funding
requirements, when incurred. We have committed to make up to four additional payments of $500
million each, expected within the next decade, conditional on each of four expected LNG trains
being approved by the joint venture for development, for a total possible cash acquisition
investment of approximately $7.5 billion at current exchange rates.

At
December 31, 2008, the book value of our investment in Australia
Pacific LNG (APLNG) was $5.4 billion.
Our 50 percent share of the historical cost basis net assets of
APLNG on its books under U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP) was $380 million, resulting in a basis
difference of $5 billion on our books. The amortizable portion of the basis
difference, approximately $3.5 billion associated with properties,
plants and equipment, has been allocated on a relative fair value basis to the 62 individual exploration and
production license areas owned by APLNG, most of which are not currently in
production. Any future additional payments are expected to be allocated in a similar manner. Each
exploration license area will periodically be reviewed for any indicators of potential impairment.
As the joint venture begins producing natural gas from each license, we will begin amortizing the
basis difference allocated to that license using the unit-of-production method. Included in net
income for 2008 was after-tax expense of $7 million representing the amortization of this basis
difference on currently producing licenses during the fourth quarter.

FCCL and WRB

In October 2006, we announced a business venture with EnCana Corporation to create an integrated
North American heavy oil business. The transaction closed on January 3, 2007, and consists of two
50/50 business ventures, a Canadian upstream general partnership, FCCL Oil Sands Partnership, and a
U.S. downstream



limited liability company, WRB Refining LLC. We use the equity method of accounting for both
entities, with the operating results of our investment in FCCL reflecting its use of the full-cost
method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities.

FCCL’s operating assets consist of the Foster Creek and Christina Lake steam-assisted gravity
drainage bitumen projects, both located in the eastern flank of the Athabasca oil sands in
northeastern Alberta. A subsidiary of EnCana is the operator and managing partner of FCCL. We are
obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus accrued interest, to FCCL over a 10-year period beginning in 2007. For
additional information on this obligation, see Note 13—Joint Venture Acquisition Obligation.

WRB’s operating assets consist of the Wood River and Borger refineries, located in Roxana,
Illinois, and Borger, Texas, respectively. As a result of our contribution of these two assets to
WRB, a basis difference of $5 billion was created due to the fair value of the contributed assets
recorded by WRB exceeding their historical book value. The difference is primarily amortized and
recognized as a benefit evenly over a period of 25 years, which is the estimated remaining useful
life of the refineries at the closing date. The basis difference at December 31, 2008, was
approximately $4.6 billion. Equity earnings in 2008 and 2007 were increased by $246 million and
$202 million, respectively, due to amortization of this basis difference. We are the operator and
managing partner of WRB. EnCana is obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus accrued interest, to
WRB over a 10-year period beginning in 2007. For the Wood River refinery, operating results are
shared 50/50 starting upon formation. For the Borger refinery, we were entitled to 85 percent of
the operating results in 2007, with our share decreasing to 65 percent in 2008, and 50 percent in
all years thereafter.

LUKOIL

LUKOIL is an integrated energy company headquartered in Russia, with operations worldwide. Our
ownership interest was 20 percent at December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, based on 851 million shares
authorized and issued. For financial reporting under U.S. GAAP, treasury shares held by LUKOIL are not considered outstanding for determining our
equity method ownership interest in LUKOIL. Our ownership interest, based on estimated shares
outstanding, was 20.6 percent at December 31, 2006 and 2007, and 20.06 percent at December 31,
2008.

Because LUKOIL’s accounting cycle close and preparation of U.S. GAAP financial statements occur
subsequent to our reporting deadline, our equity earnings and statistics for our LUKOIL investment
are estimated, based on current market indicators, publicly available LUKOIL information, and other
objective data. Once the difference between actual and estimated results is known, an adjustment
is recorded. This estimate-to-actual adjustment will be a recurring component of future period
results. Any difference between our estimate of fourth-quarter 2008 and the actual LUKOIL U.S.
GAAP net income will be reported in our 2009 equity earnings.

Since the inception of our investment and through June 30, 2008, the market value of our investment
in LUKOIL, based on the price of LUKOIL American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) on the London Stock
Exchange, exceeded book value. However, as disclosed in our Form 10-Q for the quarterly period
ended September 30, 2008, the price of LUKOIL ADRs declined significantly in the third quarter of
2008, closing the quarter at $58.80 per share. As a result, at September 30, 2008, the aggregate
market value of our investment was less than book value by $2,861 million. At the time of the
filing of our

third-quarter

2008 Form 10-Q, we determined this decline in market value below book
value did not meet the other-than-temporary impairment recognition
guidance of APB Opinion No. 18, “The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock.”

The price of LUKOIL ADRs experienced significant further decline during the fourth quarter, and
traded for most of the quarter and into early 2009 in the general range of $25 to $40 per share.
The ADR price ended the year at $32.05 per share, or 45 percent lower than the September 30, 2008,
price. This resulted in a December 31, 2008, market value of our investment of $5,452 million, or
58 percent lower than our book value. Based on a review of the facts and circumstances surrounding
this further decline in the market value of



our investment during the fourth quarter, we concluded
that an impairment of our investment was necessary. In reaching this conclusion, we considered the increased length of time market value
has been below book value and the severity of the decline in market value to be important factors.
In combination, these two items caused us to conclude that the decline was other than temporary.

Accordingly, we recorded a noncash $7,410 million, before- and after-tax impairment, in our
fourth-quarter 2008 results. This impairment had the effect of reducing our book value to $5,452
million, based on the market value of LUKOIL ADRs on December 31, 2008.

At December 31, 2008, the book value of our ordinary share investment in LUKOIL was $5,452 million.
Our 20 percent share of the net assets of LUKOIL was estimated to be $10,350 million. This
negative basis difference of $4,898 million will primarily be amortized on a straight-line basis
over a 22-year useful life as an increase to equity earnings. Equity earnings in 2008, 2007 and
2006 were reduced $88 million, $77 million and $43 million, respectively, due to amortization of
the positive basis difference that existed prior to the year-end investment impairment.

NMNG

NMNG is a joint venture with LUKOIL, created in June 2005, to develop resources in the northern
part of Russia’s Timan-Pechora province. We have a 30 percent direct ownership interest with a 50
percent governance interest. NMNG is working to develop the Yuzhno Khylchuyu (YK) field, which
achieved initial production in June 2008. Production from the NMNG joint venture fields is
transported via pipeline to LUKOIL’s existing terminal at Varandey Bay on the Barents Sea and then
shipped via tanker to international markets. We use the equity method of accounting for this joint
venture.

At
December 31, 2008, the book value of our investment in NMNG was $1,751 million. When our
interest was acquired in 2005, the difference between our acquisition cost and the net asset value
of our 30 percent interest was approximately $200 million. Since our initial investment, we have
added $127 million of capitalized interest to our basis difference. For the portion of the basis
difference that is amortizable, the basis difference is primarily
amortized on a unit-of-production
basis. Equity earnings for 2006 and 2007 were increased by $1 million and $30 million,
respectively, due to amortization of the basis difference. Equity earnings for 2008 were decreased
by $47 million. The change from an increase to a decrease of equity earnings reflects the change
in the mix of producing properties.

DCP Midstream

DCP Midstream is a joint venture between ConocoPhillips and Spectra Energy, whereby each party owns
a 50 percent interest. DCP Midstream owns and operates gas plants, gathering systems, storage
facilities and fractionation plants.

At December 31, 2008, the book value of our investment in DCP Midstream was $838 million. Our
50 percent share of the net assets of DCP Midstream was $825 million. This difference of
$13 million is being amortized on a straight-line basis through March 2015.

DCP Midstream markets a portion of its natural gas liquids to us and CPChem under a supply
agreement that continues until December 31, 2014. This purchase commitment is on an “if-produced,
will-purchase” basis and so has no fixed production schedule, but
has had, and is expected over the remaining term of the contract to
have, a
relatively stable purchase pattern. Natural gas liquids are
purchased under this agreement at various published market index prices, less transportation and
fractionation fees.

CPChem

CPChem manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics. At December 31, 2008, the book value
of our investment in CPChem was $2,186 million. Our 50 percent share of the total net assets of
CPChem was $2,073 million. This difference of $113 million is being amortized on a straight-line
basis through 2020.
We have multiple supply and purchase agreements in place with CPChem, ranging in initial terms from
one



to 99 years, with extension options. These agreements cover sales and purchases of refined
products, solvents, and petrochemical and natural gas liquids feedstocks, as well as fuel oils and
gases. Delivery quantities vary by product, and are generally on an “if-produced, will-purchase” basis. All products are purchased
and sold under specified pricing formulas based on various published pricing indices, consistent
with terms extended to third-party customers.

Loans to Related Parties

As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with industry practice, we invest
and enter into numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share
costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements. Included in such
activity are loans made to certain affiliated companies. Loans are recorded within “Loans and
advances—related parties” when cash is transferred to the affiliated company pursuant to a loan
agreement. The loan balance will increase as interest is earned on the outstanding loan balance
and will decrease as interest and principal payments are received. Interest is earned at the loan
agreement’s stated interest rate. Loans are assessed for impairment when events indicate the loan
balance will not be fully recovered.

Significant loans to affiliated companies include the following:

•

We entered into a credit agreement with Freeport LNG, whereby we provided loan financing
of approximately $650 million, excluding accrued interest, for the construction of an LNG
facility which became operational in June 2008. The loan was converted from a construction
loan to a term loan in August 2008, and Freeport started making repayments in September
2008. At the time of the loan conversion in August, it consisted of $650 million of
principal and $124 million of accrued interest. As of December 31, 2008, the outstanding
loan balance was $757 million.

•

We had an obligation to provide loan financing to Varandey Terminal Company for
30 percent of the costs of the terminal expansion. Terminal construction was completed in
June 2008, and the final loan amount was $275 million at December 2008 exchange rates,
excluding accrued interest. Although repayments were not required to start until May 2010,
Varandey used available cash to repay $12 million of interest in the second half of 2008.
The outstanding accrued interest at December 31, 2008, was $38 million at December exchange
rates.

•

Qatargas 3 is an integrated project to produce and liquefy natural gas from Qatar’s
North field. We own a 30 percent interest in the project. The other participants in the
project are affiliates of Qatar Petroleum (68.5 percent) and Mitsui & Co., Ltd.
(1.5 percent). Our interest is held through a jointly owned company, Qatar Liquefied Gas
Company Limited (3), for which we use the equity method of accounting. Qatargas 3 secured
project financing of $4 billion in December 2005, consisting of $1.3 billion of loans from
export credit agencies (ECA), $1.5 billion from commercial banks, and $1.2 billion from
ConocoPhillips. The ConocoPhillips loan facilities have substantially the same terms as
the ECA and commercial bank facilities. Prior to project completion certification, all
loans, including the ConocoPhillips loan facilities, are guaranteed by the participants
based on their respective ownership interests. Accordingly, our maximum exposure to this
financing structure is $1.2 billion. Upon completion certification, which is expected in
2011, all project loan facilities, including the ConocoPhillips loan facilities, will
become nonrecourse to the project participants. At December 31, 2008, Qatargas 3 had $3.0
billion outstanding under all the loan facilities, of which ConocoPhillips provided $835
million, and an additional $76 million of accrued interest.



Note 8—Properties, Plants and Equipment

Properties, plants and equipment (PP&E) are recorded at cost. Within the E&P segment, depreciation
is mainly on a unit-of-production basis, so depreciable life will vary by field. In the R&M
segment, investments in refining manufacturing facilities are generally depreciated on a
straight-line basis over a 25-year life, and pipeline assets over a 45-year life. The company’s
investment in PP&E, with accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization (Accum. DD&A), at
December 31 was:

Goodwill Impairment

Goodwill is subject to annual reviews for impairment based on a two-step accounting test. The
first step is to compare the estimated fair value of any reporting units within the company that
have recorded goodwill with the recorded net book value (including the goodwill) of the reporting
unit. If the estimated fair value of the



reporting unit is higher than the recorded net book
value, no impairment is deemed to exist and no further testing is required. If, however, the
estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the recorded net
book value, then a second step must be performed to determine the goodwill impairment required, if any.
In this second step, the estimated fair value from the first step is used as the purchase price in
a hypothetical acquisition of the reporting unit. Purchase business combination accounting rules
are followed to determine a hypothetical purchase price allocation to the reporting unit’s assets
and liabilities. The residual amount of goodwill that results from this hypothetical purchase price
allocation is compared to the recorded amount of goodwill for the reporting unit, and the recorded
amount is written down to the hypothetical amount, if lower.

We perform our annual goodwill impairment review in the fourth quarter of each year. During the
fourth quarter of 2008, there were severe disruptions in the credit markets and reductions in
global economic activity which had significant adverse impacts on stock markets and
oil-and-gas-related commodity prices, both of which contributed to a significant decline in our
company’s stock price and corresponding market capitalization. For most of the fourth quarter, our
market capitalization value was significantly below the recorded net book value of our balance
sheet, including goodwill.

Because quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available, management must apply
judgment in determining the estimated fair value of these reporting units for purposes of
performing the annual goodwill impairment test. Management uses all available information to make
these fair value determinations, including the present values of expected future cash flows using
discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the assets. A key component of these fair
value determinations is a reconciliation of the sum of these net present value calculations to our
market capitalization. We use an average of our market capitalization over the 30 calendar days
preceding the impairment testing date as being more reflective of our stock price trend than a
single day, point-in-time market price. Because, in our judgment, Worldwide E&P is considered to
have a higher valuation volatility than Worldwide R&M, the long-term free cash flow growth rate
implied from this reconciliation to our recent average market capitalization is applied to the
Worldwide E&P net present value calculation.

The accounting principles regarding goodwill acknowledge that the observed market prices of
individual trades of a company’s stock (and thus its computed market capitalization) may not be
representative of the fair value of the company as a whole. Substantial value may arise from the
ability to take advantage of synergies and other benefits that flow from control over another
entity. Consequently, measuring the fair value of a collection of assets and liabilities that
operate together in a controlled entity is different from measuring the fair value of that entity’s
individual common stock. In most industries, including ours, an acquiring entity typically is
willing to pay more for equity securities that give it a controlling interest than an investor
would pay for a number of equity securities representing less than a controlling interest.
Therefore, once the above net present value calculations have been determined, we also add a
control premium to the calculations. This control premium is judgmental and is based on observed
acquisitions in our industry. The resultant fair values calculated for the reporting units are
then compared to observable metrics on large mergers and acquisitions in our industry to determine
whether those valuations, in our judgment, appear reasonable.

After determining the fair values of our various reporting units as of December 31, 2008, it was
determined that our Worldwide R&M reporting unit passed the first step of the goodwill impairment
test, while our Worldwide E&P reporting unit did not pass the first step. As described above, the
second step of the goodwill impairment test uses the estimated fair value of Worldwide E&P from the
first step as the purchase price in a hypothetical acquisition of the reporting unit. The
significant hypothetical purchase price allocation adjustments made to the assets and liabilities
of Worldwide E&P in this second step calculation were in the areas of:

•

Adjusting the carrying value of major equity method investments to their estimated fair
values.

•

Adjusting the carrying value of properties, plants and equipment (PP&E) to the estimated
aggregate fair value of all oil and gas property interests.



•

Recalculating deferred income taxes under FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income
Taxes,” after considering the likely tax basis a hypothetical buyer would have in the assets
and liabilities.

When determining the above adjustment for the estimated aggregate fair value of PP&E, it was noted
that in order for any residual purchase price to be allocated to goodwill, the purchase price
assigned to PP&E would have to be well below the value of the PP&E implied by recently-observed
metrics from other sales of major oil and gas properties.

Based on the above analysis, we concluded that a $25.4 billion before- and after-tax noncash
impairment of the entire amount of recorded goodwill for the Worldwide E&P reporting unit was
required. This impairment was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008.

Venezuela Expropriation

In the second quarter of 2007, we recorded a noncash impairment related to the expropriation of our
oil interests in Venezuela. The impairment included $1,925 million before- and after-tax of
goodwill allocated to the expropriation event. For additional information, see the “Expropriated
Assets” section of Note 10—Impairments.

Expropriated Assets

On January 31, 2007, Venezuela’s National Assembly passed a law allowing the president of Venezuela
to pass laws on certain matters by decree. On February 26, 2007, the president of Venezuela issued
a decree (the Nationalization Decree) mandating the termination of the then-existing structures
related to our heavy oil ventures and oil production risk contracts and the transfer of all rights
relating to our heavy oil ventures and oil production risk contracts to joint ventures (“

empresas
mixtas

”) that will be controlled by the Venezuelan national oil company or its subsidiaries.

On June 26, 2007, we announced we had been unable to reach agreement with respect to our migration
to an

empresa mixta

structure mandated by the Nationalization Decree. In response, Petróleos de
Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) or its affiliates directly assumed the activities associated with
ConocoPhillips’ interests in the Petrozuata and Hamaca heavy oil ventures and the offshore Corocoro
oil development project. Based on Venezuelan statements that the expropriation of our oil
interests in Venezuela occurred on June 26, 2007, management determined such expropriation required
a complete impairment, under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, of our investments in
the Petrozuata and Hamaca heavy oil ventures and the offshore Corocoro oil development project.
Accordingly, we recorded a noncash impairment, including allocable goodwill, of $4,588 million
before-tax ($4,512 million after-tax) in the second quarter of 2007.

The
impairment included equity method investments and properties, plants and equipment. Also, this
expropriation of our oil interests is viewed as a partial disposition
of our Worldwide E&P reporting unit and, under the guidance in SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets,” required an allocation of goodwill to the expropriation event. The amount of
goodwill impaired as a result of this allocation was $1,925 million.

We filed a request for international arbitration on November 2, 2007, with the International Centre
for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), an arm of the World Bank. The request was
registered by ICSID on December 13, 2007. The tribunal of three arbitrators is constituted, and
the arbitration proceeding is under way.

We believe the value of our expropriated Venezuelan oil operations substantially exceeds the
historical cost-based carrying value plus goodwill allocable to those operations. However, U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles require a claim that is the subject of litigation be
presumed to not be probable of realization. In addition, the timing of any negotiated or
arbitrated settlement is not known at this time, but we anticipate it could take years.
Accordingly, any compensation for our expropriated assets was not considered



when making the
impairment determination, since to do so could result in the
recognition of compensation for the expropriation prior to its realization.

As a result of the economic downturn in the fourth quarter of 2008, the outlook for crude oil and
natural gas prices, refining margins, and power spreads sharply deteriorated. In addition, current
project economics in our E&P segment resulted in revised capital spending plans. Because of these
factors, certain E&P, R&M and Emerging Businesses properties no longer passed the undiscounted cash
flow tests required by SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets,” and thus had to be written down to fair value. Consequently, we recorded property
impairments of approximately $1,480 million, primarily consisting of:

•

$712 million for producing fields in the U.S. Lower 48 and Canada.

•

$625 million for a refinery in the United States and one in Europe.

•

$130 million for a U.S. power generation facility.

Also during 2008, we recorded property impairments of:

•

$63 million due to increased asset retirement obligations for properties at the end of
their economic life, primarily for certain fields located in the North Sea.

•

$61 million associated with planned asset dispositions consisting mainly of $52 million
for downstream assets in the United States.

•

$48 million for vacant office buildings in the United States.

•

$30 million for cancelled capital projects, primarily in our R&M segment.



During 2007, we recorded property impairments of $257 million associated with planned asset
dispositions, comprised of $187 million of impairments in our E&P segment and $70 million in our
R&M segment. In addition to impairments resulting from planned asset dispositions, the E&P segment
recorded property impairments in 2007 resulting from:

•

Increased asset retirement obligations for properties at the end of their economic life
for certain fields, primarily located in the North Sea, totaling $175 million.

•

Downward reserve revisions and higher projected operating costs for fields in the United
States, Canada and the United Kingdom, totaling $80 million.

•

An abandoned project in Alaska resulting from increased taxes, totaling $28 million.

In addition to impairments resulting from planned asset dispositions, the R&M segment recorded
property impairments in 2007 of $21 million associated with various terminals and pipelines,
primarily in the United States.

In addition and in accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets,” we reported a $128 million benefit in 2007 for the subsequent increase in the
fair value of certain assets impaired in the prior year, primarily to reflect finalized sales
agreements. This gain was included in the “Impairments—Other” line of the consolidated statement
of operations.

During 2006, we recorded impairments of $496 million associated with planned asset dispositions in
our E&P and R&M segments, comprised of properties, plants and equipment ($196 million), trademark
intangibles ($70 million), and goodwill ($230 million). In the fourth quarter of 2006, we recorded
an impairment of $131 million associated with assets in the Canadian Rockies Foothills area, as a
result of declining well performance and drilling results. We recorded a property impairment of
$40 million in 2006 as a result of our decision to withdraw an application for a license under the
federal Deepwater Port Act, associated with a proposed LNG regasification terminal located offshore
Alabama.

Asset Retirement Obligations

SFAS No. 143 requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement
obligation when it is incurred (typically when the asset is installed at the production location).
When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost by increasing the
carrying amount of the related properties, plants and equipment. Over time, the liability
increases for the change in its present value, while the capitalized cost depreciates over the
useful life of the related asset.



We have numerous asset removal obligations that we are required to perform under law or contract
once an asset is permanently taken out of service. Most of these obligations are not expected to
be paid until several years, or decades, in the future and will be funded from general company
resources at the time of removal. Our largest individual obligations involve removal and disposal
of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, oil and gas production facilities and pipelines
in Alaska, and asbestos abatement at refineries.

SFAS No. 143 calls for measurements of asset retirement obligations to include, as a component of
expected costs, an estimate of the price that a third party would demand, and could expect to
receive, for bearing the uncertainties and unforeseeable circumstances inherent in the obligations,
sometimes referred to as a market-risk premium. To date, the oil and gas industry has no examples
of credit-worthy third parties who are willing to assume this type of risk, for a determinable
price, on major oil and gas production facilities and pipelines. Therefore, because determining
such a market-risk premium would be an arbitrary process, we excluded it from our SFAS No. 143
estimates.

Accrued Environmental Costs

Total environmental accruals at December 31, 2008 and 2007, were $979 million and $1,089 million,
respectively. The 2008 decrease in total accrued environmental costs is due to payments during the
year on accrued environmental costs exceeding new accruals, accrual adjustments and accretion.

We had accrued environmental costs of $652 million and $740 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively, primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries and underground storage tanks at
U.S. service stations, and remediation activities required by Canada and the state of Alaska at
exploration and production sites. We had also accrued in Corporate and Other $234 million and
$255 million of environmental costs associated with nonoperator sites at December 31, 2008 and
2007, respectively. In addition, $93 million and $94 million were included at December 31, 2008
and 2007, respectively, where the company has been named a potentially responsible party under the
Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or similar state
laws. Accrued environmental liabilities will be paid over periods extending up to 30 years.

Because a large portion of the accrued environmental costs were acquired in various business
combinations, they are discounted obligations. Expected expenditures for acquired environmental
obligations are discounted using a weighted-average 5 percent discount factor, resulting in an
accrued balance for acquired environmental liabilities of $729 million at December 31, 2008. The
expected future undiscounted payments related to the portion of the accrued environmental costs
that have been discounted are: $104 million in 2009, $101 million in 2010, $81 million in 2011,
$79 million in 2012, $73 million in 2013, and $404 million for all future years after 2013.

Maturities of long-term borrowings, inclusive of net unamortized premiums and discounts, in 2009
through 2013 are: $370 million, $1,496 million, $4,714 million, $8,221 million and $1,290 million,
respectively. At December 31, 2008, we had classified $7,883 million of short-term debt as
long-term debt, based on our ability and intent to refinance the obligation on a long-term basis
under our revolving credit facilities and early 2009 issuance of long-term notes.

In January 2008, we reduced our Floating Rate Five-Year Term Note due 2011 from $3 billion to $2
billion, with a subsequent reduction in June 2008 to $1.5 billion. In March 2008, we redeemed our
$300 million 7.125% Debentures due 2028 at a premium of $8 million, plus accrued interest.

In May 2008, we issued notes consisting of $400 million of 4.40%
Notes due 2013, $500 million of 5.20% Notes due 2018 and $600 million of 5.90% Notes due 2038. The
proceeds from the offering were used to reduce commercial paper and for general corporate purposes.

In October 2008, we issued approximately $4.9 billion of commercial paper to help fund our initial
upfront payment to close on a transaction with Origin Energy to further enhance our long-term
Australasian natural gas business. For additional information on the Origin transaction, see Note
7—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables.

At December 31, 2008, we had two revolving credit facilities totaling $9.85 billion, consisting of
a $7.35 billion facility, expiring in September 2012, and a $2.5 billion facility scheduled to
expire September 2009 (terminated in early 2009, see below). The $7.35 billion facility was
reduced from $7.5 billion during the third quarter of 2008 due to the bankruptcy of Lehman
Commercial Paper Inc., one of the revolver participants. The $2.5 billion facility is a 364-day
bank facility entered into during October 2008 to provide additional support of a temporary
expansion of our commercial paper program. We expanded our commercial paper program to ensure
adequate liquidity after the initial funding of our transaction with Origin Energy.

Our revolving credit facilities may be used as direct bank borrowings, as support for issuances of
letters of credit totaling up to $750 million, as support for our commercial paper programs, or as
support of up to $250 million on commercial paper issued by
TransCanada Keystone Pipeline LP, a Keystone pipeline joint venture
entity. The revolving credit facilities are broadly syndicated among financial
institutions and do not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring
maintenance of specified financial ratios or ratings. The facility agreements contain a
cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt
obligations of $200 million or more by ConocoPhillips, or by any of its consolidated subsidiaries.

We have two commercial paper programs: the ConocoPhillips $8.1 billion program, primarily a funding
source for short-term working capital needs, and the ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. $1.5 billion
commercial paper program, which is used to fund commitments relating to the Qatargas 3 project.
Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we
had no direct outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facilities, but $40 million and $41
million, respectively, in letters of credit had been issued. In addition, under both commercial
paper programs, there was $6,933 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2008,
compared with $725 million at December 31, 2007. Since we had $6,933 million of commercial paper
outstanding, had issued $40 million of letters of credit and had up to a $250 million guarantee on
commercial paper issued by Keystone, we had access to $2.6 billion in borrowing capacity under our
revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2008.

Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain designated
banks in the London interbank market or at a margin above the overnight federal funds rate or prime
rates offered by certain designated banks in the United States. The agreements call for commitment
fees on available, but unused, amounts. The agreements also contain early termination rights if
our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of
Directors.



In early 2009, we issued $1.5 billion of 4.75% Notes due 2014, $2.25 billion of 5.75% Notes due
2019, and $2.25 billion of 6.50% Notes due 2039. The proceeds of the notes were primarily used to
reduce outstanding commercial paper balances. Under the terms of the $2.5 billion, 364-day
revolving credit facility noted above, the receipt of the proceeds from this bond offering
terminated this revolving credit facility.

Note 13—Joint Venture Acquisition Obligation

On January 3, 2007, we closed on a business venture with EnCana Corporation. As a part of the
transaction, we are obligated to contribute $7.5 billion, plus interest, over a 10-year period,
beginning in 2007, to the upstream business venture, FCCL Oil Sands Partnership, formed as a result
of the transaction. An initial cash contribution of $188 million was made upon closing in January
of 2007, and was included in the “Capital expenditures and investments” line on our consolidated
statement of cash flows.

Quarterly principal and interest payments of $237 million began in the second quarter of 2007, and
will continue until the balance is paid. Of the principal obligation amount, approximately $625
million was short-term and was included in the “Accounts payable—related parties” line on our
December 31, 2008, consolidated balance sheet. The principal portion of these payments, which
totaled $593 million in 2008, was included in the “Other” line in the financing activities section
of our consolidated statement of cash flows. Interest accrues at a fixed annual rate of 5.3
percent on the unpaid principal balance. Fifty percent of the quarterly interest payments is
reflected as an additional capital contribution and is included in the “Capital expenditures and
investments” line on our consolidated statement of cash flows.

Note 14—Guarantees

At December 31, 2008, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual
arrangements as described below. We recognize a liability, at inception, for the fair value of our
obligation as a guarantor for newly issued or modified guarantees. Unless the carrying amount of
the liability is noted below, we have not recognized a liability either because the guarantees were
issued prior to December 31, 2002, or because the fair value of the obligation is immaterial. In
addition, unless otherwise stated we are not currently performing with any significance under the
guarantee and expect future performance to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of
occurrence.

Construction Completion Guarantees

•

In December 2005, we issued a construction completion guarantee for 30 percent of the
$4.0 billion in loan facilities of Qatargas 3, which will be used to construct an LNG train
in Qatar. Of the $4.0 billion in loan facilities, ConocoPhillips has committed to provide
$1.2 billion. The maximum potential amount of future payments to third-party lenders under
the guarantee is estimated to be $850 million, which could become payable if the full debt
financing is utilized and completion of the Qatargas 3 project is not achieved. The project
financing will be nonrecourse to ConocoPhillips upon certified completion, currently expected
in 2011. At December 31, 2008, the carrying value of the guarantee to the third-party
lenders was $11 million. For additional information, see Note 7—Investments, Loans and
Long-Term Receivables.

Guarantees of Joint Venture Debt

•

In June 2006, we issued a guarantee for 24 percent of the $2 billion in credit facilities
of Rockies Express Pipeline LLC, which will be used to construct a natural gas pipeline
across a portion of the United States. At December 31, 2008, Rockies Express had $1,561
million outstanding under the credit facilities, with our 24 percent guarantee equaling $375
million. The maximum potential amount of future payments to third-party lenders under the
guarantee is estimated to be $480 million, which could



become payable if the credit
facilities are fully utilized and Rockies Express fails to meet its obligations
under the credit agreement. In addition, we also have a guarantee for 24 percent of
$600 million of Floating Rate Notes due 2009 issued by Rockies Express. It is anticipated
final construction completion will be achieved in 2009, and refinancing will take place at
that time, making the debt nonrecourse to ConocoPhillips. At December 31, 2008, the total
carrying value of these guarantees to third-party lenders was $12 million.

•

In December 2007, we acquired a 50 percent equity interest in four Keystone pipeline
entities (Keystone), to create a joint venture with TransCanada Corporation. Keystone is
constructing a crude oil pipeline originating in Alberta, with delivery points in Illinois
and Oklahoma. In December 2008, we provided a guarantee for up to $250 million of balances
outstanding under a commercial paper program. This program was established by Keystone to
provide funding for a portion of Keystone’s construction costs attributable to our ownership
interest in the project. Payment under the guarantee would be due in the event Keystone
failed to repay principal and interest, when due, to short-term noteholders. The commercial
paper program and our guarantee are expected to increase as funding needs increase during
construction of the Keystone pipeline. Keystone’s other owner will guarantee a similar, but
separate, funding vehicle. Post-construction Keystone financing is anticipated to be
nonrecourse to us. At December 31, 2008, $200 million was outstanding under the Keystone
commercial paper program guaranteed by us.

•

At December 31, 2008, we had other guarantees outstanding for our portion of joint venture
debt obligations, which have terms of up to 17 years. The maximum potential amount of future
payments under the guarantees is approximately $90 million. Payment would be required if a
joint venture defaults on its debt obligations.

Other Guarantees

•

In connection with certain planning and construction activities of the Keystone pipeline,
we agreed to reimburse TransCanada with respect to a portion of guarantees issued by
TransCanada for certain of Keystone’s obligations to third parties. Our maximum potential
amount of future payments associated with these guarantees is based on our ultimate ownership
percentage in Keystone and is estimated to be $180 million, which could become payable if
Keystone fails to meet its obligations and the obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated.
Payments under the guarantees are contingent upon the partners not making necessary equity
contributions into Keystone; therefore, it is considered unlikely payments would be required.
All but $8 million of the guarantees will terminate after construction is completed,
currently estimated to occur in 2010.

In October 2008, we elected to exercise an option to reduce our equity interest in Keystone
from 50 percent to 20.01 percent. The change in equity will occur through a dilution
mechanism, which is expected to gradually lower our ownership
interest until it reaches 20.01 percent by the third
quarter of 2009. At December 31, 2008, our ownership interest was 38.7 percent.

In addition to the above guarantee, in order to obtain long-term shipping commitments that
would enable a pipeline expansion starting at Hardisty, Alberta, and extending to near Port
Arthur, Texas, the Keystone owners executed an agreement in July 2008 to guarantee Keystone’s
obligations under its agreement to provide transportation at a specified price for certain
shippers to the Gulf Coast. Although our guarantee is for 50 percent of these obligations,
TransCanada has agreed to reimburse us for amounts we pay in excess of our ownership
percentage in Keystone. Our maximum potential amount of future payments, or cost of volume
delivery, under this guarantee, after such reimbursement, is estimated to be $220 million
($550 million before reimbursement) based on a full 20-year term of the shipping commitments,
which could become payable if Keystone fails to meet its obligations under the agreements and
the obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated. Future payments are considered unlikely, as
the payments, or cost of volume delivery, are contingent upon Keystone defaulting on its
obligation to construct the pipeline in accordance with the terms of the agreement.



•

We have other guarantees with maximum future potential payment amounts totaling $520
million, which consist primarily of dealer and jobber loan guarantees to support our
marketing business, guarantees to
fund the short-term cash liquidity deficits of certain joint ventures, a guarantee of minimum
charter revenue for two LNG vessels, one small construction completion guarantee, guarantees
relating to the startup of a refining joint venture, guarantees of the lease payment
obligations of a joint venture, and guarantees of the residual value of leased corporate
aircraft. These guarantees generally extend up to 16 years or life of the venture.

Indemnifications

Over the years, we have entered into various agreements to sell ownership interests in certain
corporations and joint ventures and have sold several assets, including downstream and midstream
assets, certain exploration and production assets, and downstream retail and wholesale sites that
gave rise to qualifying indemnifications. Agreements associated with these sales include
indemnifications for taxes, environmental liabilities, permits and licenses, employee claims, real
estate indemnity against tenant defaults, and litigation. The terms of these indemnifications vary
greatly. The majority of these indemnifications are related to environmental issues, the term is
generally indefinite and the maximum amount of future payments is generally unlimited. The
carrying amount recorded for these indemnifications at December 31, 2008, was $427 million. We
amortize the indemnification liability over the relevant time period, if one exists, based on the
facts and circumstances surrounding each type of indemnity. In cases where the indemnification
term is indefinite, we will reverse the liability when we have information the liability is
essentially relieved or amortize the liability over an appropriate time period as the fair value of
our indemnification exposure declines. Although it is reasonably possible future payments may
exceed amounts recorded, due to the nature of the indemnifications, it is not possible to make a
reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments. Included in the carrying
amount recorded were $239 million of environmental accruals for known contamination that is
included in asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs at December 31, 2008. For
additional information about environmental liabilities, see Note 15—Contingencies and Commitments.

Note 15—Contingencies and Commitments

In the case of all known non-income-tax-related contingencies, we accrue a liability when the loss
is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably
estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the
minimum of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or
third-party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other
third-party recoveries. In the case of income-tax-related contingencies, we adopted FIN 48,
effective January 1, 2007. FIN 48 requires a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases
where sustaining a tax position is less than certain. See
Note 21—Income Taxes, for additional information about income-tax-related contingencies.

Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to
known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a
material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. As we learn new facts concerning
contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other
potential exposures. Estimates that are particularly sensitive to future changes include
contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters. Estimated
future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain
magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be
required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible
parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events
evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation
processes.

Environmental

We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. These may result in
obligations to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage,
disposal or release of certain



chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various sites. When
we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we record accruals for environmental liabilities
based on management’s best estimates, using all information that is available at the time. We
measure estimates and base liabilities on currently available facts,
existing technology, and presently enacted laws and regulations, taking into account stakeholder
and business considerations. When measuring environmental liabilities, we also consider our prior
experience in remediation of contaminated sites, other companies’ cleanup experience, and data
released by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or other organizations. We consider
unasserted claims in our determination of environmental liabilities and we accrue them in the
period they are both probable and reasonably estimable.

Although liability of those potentially responsible for environmental remediation costs is
generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, we are usually
only one of many companies cited at a particular site. Due to the joint and several liabilities,
we could be responsible for all of the cleanup costs related to any site at which we have been
designated as a potentially responsible party. If we were solely responsible, the costs, in some
cases, could be material to our, or one of our segments’, results of operations, capital resources
or liquidity. However, settlements and costs incurred in matters that previously have been
resolved have not been material to our results of operations or financial condition. We have been
successful to date in sharing cleanup costs with other financially sound companies. Many of the
sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state
agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess the
site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some
instances, we may have no liability or may attain a settlement of liability. Where it appears that
other potentially responsible parties may be financially unable to bear their proportional share,
we consider this inability in estimating our potential liability, and we adjust our accruals
accordingly.

As a result of various acquisitions in the past, we assumed certain environmental obligations.
Some of these environmental obligations are mitigated by indemnifications made by others for our
benefit and some of the indemnifications are subject to dollar limits and time limits. We have not
recorded accruals for any potential contingent liabilities that we expect to be funded by the prior
owners under these indemnifications.

We are currently participating in environmental assessments and cleanups at numerous federal
Superfund and comparable state sites. After an assessment of environmental exposures for cleanup
and other costs, we make accruals on an undiscounted basis (except those acquired in a purchase
business combination, which we record on a discounted basis) for planned investigation and
remediation activities for sites where it is probable that future costs will be incurred and these
costs can be reasonably estimated. We have not reduced these accruals for possible insurance
recoveries. In the future, we may be involved in additional environmental assessments, cleanups
and proceedings. See Note 11—Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs, for a
summary of our accrued environmental liabilities.

Legal Proceedings

Our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience, and professional judgment to the specific
characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the
legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of
potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases which
have been scheduled for trial, as well as the pace of settlement discussions in individual matters.
Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and
available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization believes
there is a remote likelihood future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will
exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated
financial statements.

Other Contingencies

We have contingent liabilities resulting from throughput agreements with pipeline and processing
companies not associated with financing arrangements. Under these agreements, we may be required
to provide any such



company with additional funds through advances and penalties for fees related
to throughput capacity not utilized. In addition, at December 31, 2008, we had performance
obligations secured by letters of credit of $1,950 million (of which $40 million was issued under
the provisions of our revolving credit facility, and the remainder was issued as direct bank
letters of credit) related to various purchase commitments for materials,
supplies, services and items of permanent investment incident to the
ordinary conduct of business. See Note 10—Impairments, for additional information about expropriated assets in Venezuela and the
contingencies related to receiving adequate compensation for our oil interests in Venezuela.

Long-Term Throughput Agreements and Take-or-Pay Agreements

We have certain throughput agreements and take-or-pay agreements that are in support of financing
arrangements. The agreements typically provide for natural gas or crude oil transportation to be
used in the ordinary course of the company’s business. The aggregate amounts of estimated payments
under these various agreements are: 2009—$62 million; 2010—$63 million; 2011—$63 million;
2012—$62 million; 2013—$62 million; and 2014 and after—$152 million. Total payments under the
agreements were $75 million in 2008, $67 million in 2007 and $66 million in 2006.

Note 16—Financial Instruments and Derivative Contracts

Derivative Instruments

We may use financial and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage exposures to fluctuations
in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates, or to exploit market
opportunities. Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “Authority Limitations”
document approved by our Board of Directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives
or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity for comparable valuations. The Authority
Limitations document also authorizes the Chief Operating Officer to establish the maximum Value at
Risk (VaR) limits for the company, and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. The Chief
Financial Officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates
and reports to the Chief Executive Officer. The Senior Vice President of Commercial monitors
commodity price risk and reports to the Chief Operating Officer. The Commercial organization
manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, monitors related
risks of our upstream and downstream businesses, and selectively takes price risk to add value.

SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended (SFAS
No. 133), requires companies to recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or
liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value. Assets and liabilities resulting from derivative
contracts open at December 31 were:

Millions of Dollars



Derivative Assets

Current

$

1,257


Long-term



$

1,439


Derivative Liabilities

Current

$



Long-term



$

1,036


In the preceding table, the 2008 derivative assets appear net of $123 million of obligations to
return cash collateral, and the 2008 derivative liabilities appear net of $332 million of rights to
reclaim cash collateral. Collateral receivables and payables at December 31, 2007, were not
material. The derivative assets and liabilities in the preceding table appear as prepaid expenses
and other current assets, other assets, other accruals, or other liabilities and deferred credits
on the balance sheet.



The accounting for changes in fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends
on whether it meets the qualifications for, and has been designated as, a SFAS No. 133 hedge, and
the type of hedge. At this time, we are not using SFAS No. 133 hedge accounting. All gains and
losses, realized or unrealized, from derivative contracts not designated as SFAS No. 133 hedges
have been recognized in the consolidated statement of operations. Gains and losses from derivative
contracts held for trading not directly related to our
physical business, whether realized or unrealized, have been reported net in other income.

SFAS No. 133 also requires purchase and sales contracts for commodities that are readily
convertible to cash (e.g., crude oil, natural gas, and gasoline) to be recorded on the balance
sheet as derivatives unless the contracts are for quantities we expect to use or sell over a
reasonable period in the normal course of business (the normal purchases and normal sales
exception), among other requirements, and we have documented our intent to apply this exception.
Except for contracts to buy or sell natural gas, we generally apply this exception to eligible
purchase and sales contracts; however, we may elect not to apply this exception (e.g., when another
derivative instrument will be used to mitigate the risk of the purchase or sale contract but hedge
accounting will not be applied). When this occurs, both the purchase or sales contract and the
derivative contract mitigating the resulting risk will be recorded on the balance sheet at fair
value in accordance with the preceding paragraphs. Most of our contracts to buy or sell natural
gas are recorded on the balance sheet as derivatives, except for certain long-term contracts to
sell our natural gas production, for which we have elected the normal purchases and normal sales
exception or which do not meet the SFAS No. 133 definition of a derivative.

Currency Exchange Rate Derivative Contracts—

We have foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting
from international operations. We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency rate
changes, although we may choose to selectively hedge exposures to foreign currency rate risk.
Examples include firm commitments for capital projects, certain local currency tax payments and
dividends, net investment in a foreign subsidiary, short-term intercompany loans between
subsidiaries operating in different countries, and cash returns from net investments in foreign
affiliates to be remitted within the coming year.

Commodity Derivative Contracts—

We operate in the worldwide crude oil, refined product, natural gas,
natural gas liquids, and electric power markets and are exposed to fluctuations in the prices for
these commodities. These fluctuations can affect our revenues as well as the cost of operating,
investing, and financing activities. Generally, our policy is to remain exposed to the market
prices of commodities; however, executive management may elect to use derivative instruments to
hedge the price risk of our crude oil and natural gas production, as well as refinery margins.

Our Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps, and options in various markets to
optimize the value of our supply chain, which may move our risk profile away from market average
prices to accomplish the following objectives:

•

Balance physical systems. In addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration,
exchange traded futures contracts may also be settled by physical delivery of the
commodity, providing another source of supply to meet our refinery requirements or
marketing demand.

•

Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market
prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed-price sales contracts, which are often
requested by natural gas and refined product consumers, to a floating market price.

•

Manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil, natural
gas, refined product and electric power transactions.

•

Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from these activities to do a limited
amount of trading not directly related to our physical business. For the years ended
December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the gains or losses from this activity were not material
to our cash flows or net income.



Credit Risk

Our financial instruments that are potentially exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist
primarily of cash equivalents, over-the-counter derivative contracts, and trade receivables. Our
cash equivalents are placed in high-quality commercial paper, money market funds and time deposits
with major international banks and financial institutions. The credit risk from our
over-the-counter derivative contracts, such as forwards and swaps, derives from the counterparty to
the transaction, typically a major bank or financial institution. We closely monitor these credit
exposures against predetermined credit limits, including the continual exposure adjustments that
result from market movements. Individual counterparty exposure is managed within these limits, and
includes the use of cash-call margins when appropriate, thereby reducing the risk of significant
nonperformance. We also use futures contracts, but futures have a negligible credit risk because
they are traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange or the ICE Futures.

Our trade receivables result primarily from our petroleum operations and reflect a broad national
and international customer base, which limits our exposure to concentrations of credit risk. The
majority of these receivables have payment terms of 30 days or less, and we continually monitor
this exposure and the creditworthiness of the counterparties. We do not generally require
collateral to limit the exposure to loss; however, we will sometimes use letters of credit,
prepayments, and master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk with counterparties that both
buy from and sell to us, as these agreements permit the amounts owed by us or owed to others to be
offset against amounts due us.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments

We used the following methods and assumptions to estimate the fair value of financial instruments:

•

Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amount reported on the balance sheet
approximates fair value.

•

Accounts and notes receivable: The carrying amount reported on the balance sheet
approximates fair value.

•

Investment in LUKOIL shares: See Note 7—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables,
for a discussion of the carrying value and fair value of our investment in LUKOIL shares.

•

Debt: The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates fair value. The fair
value of the fixed-rate debt is estimated based on quoted market prices.

•

Fixed-rate 5.3 percent joint venture acquisition obligation: Fair value is estimated
based on the net present value of the future cash flows, discounted at a year-end effective
yield rate of 5.4 percent, based on yields of U.S. Treasury securities of similar average
duration adjusted for our average credit risk spread and the amortizing nature of the
obligation principal. See Note 13—Joint Venture Acquisition Obligation, for additional
information.

•

Swaps: Fair value is estimated based on forward market prices and approximates the exit
price at year end. When forward market prices are not available, they are estimated using
the forward prices of a similar commodity with adjustments for differences in quality or
location.

•

Futures: Fair values are based on quoted market prices obtained from the New York
Mercantile Exchange, the ICE Futures, or other traded exchanges.

•

Forward-exchange contracts: Fair value is estimated by comparing the contract rate to
the forward rate in effect on December 31 and approximates the exit price at year end.

cash collateral. Collateral receivables and payables at December 31, 2007, were not material.

Note 17—Preferred Stock and Minority Interests

Preferred Stock

We have 500 million shares of preferred stock authorized, par value $.01 per share, none of which
was issued or outstanding at December 31, 2008 or 2007.

Minority Interests

The minority interest owner in Ashford Energy Capital S.A. is entitled to a cumulative annual
preferred return on its investment, consisting of 1.32 percent plus a three-month LIBOR rate set at
the beginning of each quarter. The preferred return at December 31, 2008 and 2007, was 5.37
percent and 6.55 percent, respectively. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the minority interest was
$507 million and $508 million, respectively. Ashford Energy Capital S.A. is consolidated in our
financial statements under the provisions of FIN 46(R) because we are the primary beneficiary. See
Note 4—Variable Interest Entities (VIEs), for additional information.

The remaining minority interest amounts are primarily related to operating joint ventures we
control. The largest of these, amounting to $580 million at December 31, 2008, and $648 million at
December 31, 2007, relates to Darwin LNG, an operation located in Australia’s Northern Territory.

Note 18—Preferred Share Purchase Rights

In 2002, our Board of Directors authorized and declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase
right for each common share outstanding, and authorized and directed the issuance of one right per
common share for any newly issued shares. The rights have certain anti-takeover effects. The
rights will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire ConocoPhillips
on terms not approved by the Board of Directors. However, since the rights may either be redeemed
or otherwise made inapplicable by ConocoPhillips prior to an acquiror obtaining beneficial
ownership of 15 percent or more of ConocoPhillips’ common stock, the rights should not interfere
with any merger or business combination approved by the Board of Directors prior to that
occurrence. The rights, which expire June 30, 2012, will be exercisable only if a person or group
acquires 15 percent or more of the company’s common stock or commences a tender offer that would
result in ownership of 15 percent or more of the common stock. Each right would entitle
stockholders to buy one one-hundredth of a share of preferred stock at an exercise price of $300.
If an acquiror obtains 15



percent or more of ConocoPhillips’ common stock, then each right will be
adjusted so that it will entitle the
holder (other than the acquiror, whose rights will become void) to purchase, for the then exercise
price, a number of shares of ConocoPhillips’ common stock equal in value to two times the exercise
price of the right. In addition, the rights enable holders to purchase the stock of an acquiring
company at a discount, depending on specific circumstances. We may redeem the rights in whole, but
not in part, for one cent per right.

Note 19—Non-Mineral Leases

The company leases ocean transport vessels, tugboats, barges, pipelines, railcars, corporate
aircraft, service stations, drilling equipment, computers, office buildings and other facilities
and equipment. Certain leases include escalation clauses for adjusting rental payments to reflect
changes in price indices, as well as renewal options and/or options to purchase the leased property
for the fair market value at the end of the lease term. There are no significant restrictions
imposed on us by the leasing agreements in regards to dividends, asset dispositions or borrowing
ability. Leased assets under capital leases were not significant in any period presented.

At December 31, 2008, future minimum rental payments due under noncancelable leases were:

For both U.S. and international pensions, the overall expected long-term rate of return is
developed from the expected future return of each asset class, weighted by the expected allocation
of pension assets to that asset class. We rely on a variety of independent market forecasts in
developing the expected rate of return for each class of assets.

At December 31, 2007, all of our plans used a December 31 measurement date, except for a plan in
the United Kingdom, which had a September 30 measurement date. To comply with the provisions of
SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—an
amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R),” we changed the measurement date for the
U.K. plan from September 30 to December 31 for our 2008 consolidated financial statements. We
elected to implement the change by remeasuring the U.K. plan assets and obligations as of December
31, 2007. To implement the change in measurement date, we recognized the $10 million (net of tax)
of net periodic pension cost incurred from October 1, 2007, to December 31, 2007, as an adjustment
to 2008 beginning retained earnings.

Included in other comprehensive income at December 31 were the following before-tax amounts that

For our tax-qualified pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets,
the projected benefit obligation, the accumulated benefit obligation, and the fair value of plan
assets were $6,092 million, $5,289 million, and $3,624 million at December 31, 2008, respectively,
and $6,392 million, $5,417 million, and $5,056 million at December 31, 2007, respectively.

For our unfunded nonqualified key employee supplemental pension plans, the projected benefit
obligation and the accumulated benefit obligation were $391 million and $334 million, respectively,
at December 31, 2008, and were $390 million and $344 million, respectively, at December 31, 2007.

We recognized pension settlement losses of $18 million, $2 million and $11 million and special
termination benefits of $2 million, $1 million and $1 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Curtailment losses of $1 million were recognized in 2007.

In determining net pension and other postretirement benefit costs, we amortize prior service costs
on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive
benefits under the plan. For net gains and losses, we amortize 10 percent of the unamortized
balance each year.

We have multiple nonpension postretirement benefit plans for health and life insurance. The health
care plans are contributory and subject to various cost sharing features, with participant and
company contributions adjusted annually; the life insurance plans are noncontributory. The
measurement of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation assumes a health care cost trend
rate of 8.5 percent in 2009 that declines to 5.0 percent by 2023. A one-percentage-point change in
the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects on the 2008 amounts:

Plan Assets—

We follow a policy of broadly diversifying pension plan assets across asset classes,
investment managers, and individual holdings. Asset classes that are considered appropriate
include U.S. equities, non-U.S. equities, U.S. fixed income, non-U.S. fixed income, real estate,
and private equity investments. Plan fiduciaries may consider and add other asset classes to the
investment program from time to time. Our funding policy for U.S. plans is to contribute at least
the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Contributions to foreign plans are dependent upon
local laws and tax regulations. In 2009, we expect to contribute approximately $930 million to our
domestic qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans and $150 million to
our international qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans.



A portion of U.S. pension plan assets is held as a participating interest in an insurance annuity
contract. This participating interest is calculated as the market value of investments held under this contract,
less the accumulated benefit obligation covered by the contract. At December 31, 2008, the
participating interest in the annuity contract was valued at $138 million and consisted of
$400 million in debt securities, less $262 million for the accumulated benefit obligation covered
by the contract. At December 31, 2007, the participating interest in the annuity contract was
valued at $159 million and consisted of $201 million in debt securities and $229 million in equity
securities, less $271 million for the accumulated benefit obligation covered by the contract. The
participating interest is not available for meeting general pension benefit obligations in the near
term. No future company contributions are required and no new benefits are being accrued under
this insurance annuity contract.

In the United States, plan asset allocation is managed on a gross asset basis, which includes the
market value of all investments held under the insurance annuity contract. On this basis, the
weighted-average asset allocations are as follows:

Severance Accrual

As a result of the current business environment’s impact on our operating and capital plans, a
reduction in our overall employee work force is expected in 2009. Various business units and staff
groups recorded accruals in the fourth quarter of 2008 for severance and related employee benefits
totaling $162 million, all of which is classified as short-term.

Defined Contribution Plans

Most U.S. employees (excluding retail service station employees) are eligible to participate in
either the ConocoPhillips Savings Plan (CPSP) or the Burlington Resources Savings Plan (BR Savings
Plan). Employees can deposit up to 30 percent of their eligible pay up to the statutory limit ($15,500 in 2008) in the thrift feature of the CPSP to a choice of approximately 43
investment funds. ConocoPhillips matches contribution deposits, up to 1.25 percent of eligible
pay. Company contributions charged to expense for the CPSP and predecessor plans, excluding the
stock savings feature (discussed below), were $22 million in 2008, $21 million in 2007, and $19
million in 2006. For the BR Savings Plan, ConocoPhillips matches deposits, up to 6 percent or 8
percent of the employee’s eligible pay based upon years of service. During 2008, ConocoPhillips
contributed $5 million to the BR Savings Plan, to match eligible contributions by employees.

Assets of
the BR Savings Plan were merged into the CPSP effective at close
of business on December 31, 2008, and the BR Savings Plan participants became participants in CPSP.

The stock savings feature of the CPSP is a leveraged employee stock ownership plan. Employees may
elect to participate in the stock savings feature by contributing 1 percent of eligible pay and
receiving an allocation of shares of common stock proportionate to the amount of contribution.

In 1990, the Long-Term Stock Savings Plan of Phillips Petroleum Company (now the stock savings
feature of the CPSP) borrowed funds that were used to purchase previously unissued shares of
company common stock. Since the company guarantees the CPSP’s borrowings, the unpaid balance is
reported as a liability of the company and unearned compensation is shown as a reduction of common
stockholders’ equity. Dividends on all shares are charged against retained earnings. The debt is
serviced by the CPSP from company contributions and dividends received on certain shares of common
stock held by the plan, including all unallocated shares. The shares held by the stock savings
feature of the CPSP are released for allocation to participant accounts based on debt service
payments on CPSP borrowings. In addition, during the period from 2009 through 2012, when no debt
principal payments are scheduled to occur, we have committed to make direct contributions of stock
to the stock savings feature of the CPSP, or make prepayments on CPSP borrowings, to ensure a
certain minimum level of stock allocation to participant accounts.



We recognize interest expense as incurred and compensation expense based on the fair market value
of the stock contributed or on the cost of the unallocated shares released, using the
shares-allocated method. We recognized total CPSP expense related to the stock savings feature of
$111 million, $148 million and $126 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, all of which was
compensation expense. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, we contributed 1,668,456 shares, 1,856,224 shares
and 1,921,688 shares, respectively, of company common stock from the Compensation and Benefits
Trust. The shares had a fair market value of $120 million, $155 million and $132 million,
respectively. Dividends used to service debt were $41 million, $39 million and $37 million in
2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. These dividends reduced the amount of compensation expense
recognized each period. Interest incurred on the CPSP debt in 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $6 million,
$11 million and $12 million, respectively.

The total CPSP stock savings feature shares as of December 31 were:

The fair value of unallocated shares at December 31, 2008 and 2007, was $373 million and
$798 million, respectively.

We have several defined contribution plans for our international employees, each with its own terms
and eligibility depending on location. Total compensation expense recognized for these
international plans was approximately $53 million in 2008, $44 million in 2007 and $39 million in
2006.

Share-Based Compensation Plans

The 2004 Omnibus Stock and Performance Incentive Plan (the Plan) was approved by shareholders in
May 2004. Over its

10-year

life, the Plan allows the issuance of up to 70 million shares of our
common stock for compensation to our employees, directors and consultants. After approval of the
Plan, the heritage plans were no longer used for further awards. Of the 70 million shares
available for issuance under the Plan, 40 million shares of common stock are available for
incentive stock options, and no more than 40 million shares may be used for awards in stock.

Our share-based compensation programs generally provide accelerated vesting (i.e., a waiver of the
remaining period of service required to earn an award) for awards held by employees at the time of
their retirement. For share-based awards granted prior to our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we
recognize expense over the period of time during which the employee earns the award, accelerating
the recognition of expense only when an employee actually retires. For share-based awards granted
after our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006, we recognize share-based compensation
expense over the shorter of: 1) the service period (i.e., the stated period of time required to
earn the award); or 2) the period beginning at the start of the service period and ending when an
employee first becomes eligible for retirement, but not less than six months, as this is the
minimum period of time required for an award to not be subject to forfeiture.

Some of our share-based awards vest ratably (i.e., portions of the award vest at different times)
while some of our awards cliff vest (i.e., all of the award vests at the same time). For awards
granted prior to our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) that vest ratably, we recognize expense on a
straight-line basis over the service period for each separate vesting portion of the award (i.e.,
as if the award was multiple awards with different requisite service periods). For share-based
awards granted after our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we recognize expense on a straight-line basis
over the service period for the entire award, whether the award was granted with ratable or cliff
vesting.



Total share-based compensation expense recognized in income and the associated tax benefit for the
three years ended December 31, 2008, was as follows:

Stock Options—

Stock options granted under the provisions of the Plan and earlier plans permit
purchase of our common stock at exercise prices equivalent to the average market price of the stock
on the date the options were granted. The options have terms of 10 years and generally vest
ratably, with one-third of the options awarded vesting and becoming exercisable on each anniversary
date following the date of grant. Options awarded to employees already eligible for retirement
vest within six months of the grant date, but those options do not become exercisable until the end
of the normal vesting period.

The weighted-average remaining contractual term of vested options and exercisable options at
December 31, 2008, was 3.98 years and 3.77 years, respectively.



During 2008, we received $260 million in cash and realized a tax benefit of $161 million from the
exercise of options. At December 31, 2008, the remaining unrecognized compensation expense from
unvested options was $18 million, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 11
months, the longest period being 25 months.

calculate the average period of time lapsed between grant dates and exercise dates of past grants
to estimate the expected life of new option grants.

Stock Unit Program—

Stock units granted under the provisions of the Plan vest ratably, with
one-third of the units vesting in 36 months, one-third vesting in 48 months, and the final third
vesting 60 months from the date of grant. Upon vesting, the units are settled by issuing one share
of ConocoPhillips common stock per unit. Units awarded to employees already eligible for
retirement vest within six months of the grant date, but those units are not issued as shares until
the end of the normal vesting period. Until issued as stock, most recipients of the units receive
a quarterly cash payment of a dividend equivalent that is charged to expense. The grant date fair
value of these units is deemed equal to the average ConocoPhillips stock price on the date of
grant. The grant date fair market value of units that do not receive a dividend equivalent while
unvested is deemed equal to the average ConocoPhillips stock price on the grant date, less the net
present value of the dividends that will not be received.

Performance Share Program—

Under the Plan, we also annually grant to senior management restricted
stock units that do not vest until either (i) with respect to awards for periods beginning before
2009, the employee becomes eligible for retirement by reaching age 55
with five years of service or
(ii) with respect to awards for periods beginning in 2009, five years after the grant date of the
award (although recipients can elect to defer the lapsing of restrictions until retirement after
reaching age 55 with five years of service), so we recognize compensation expense for these awards
beginning on the date of grant and ending on the date the units are scheduled to vest. Since these
awards are authorized three years prior to the grant date, for employees eligible for such
retirement by or shortly after the grant date, we recognize compensation expense over the period
beginning on the date of authorization and ending on the date of grant. These units are settled by
issuing one share of ConocoPhillips common stock per unit, generally when the employee retires from
ConocoPhillips. Until issued as stock, recipients of the units receive a quarterly cash payment of
a dividend equivalent that is charged to expense. In its current form, the first grant of units
under this program was in 2006.

Other—

In addition to the above active programs, we have outstanding shares of restricted stock and
restricted stock units that were either issued to replace awards held by employees of companies we
acquired or issued as part of a compensation program that has been discontinued. Generally, the
recipients of the restricted shares or units receive a quarterly dividend or dividend equivalent.

Compensation and Benefits Trust

The Compensation and Benefits Trust (CBT) is an irrevocable grantor trust, administered by an
independent trustee and designed to acquire, hold and distribute shares of our common stock to fund
certain future compensation and benefit obligations of the company. The CBT does not increase or
alter the amount of benefits or compensation that will be paid under existing plans, but offers us
enhanced financial flexibility in providing the funding requirements of those plans. We also have
flexibility in determining the timing of distributions of shares from the CBT to fund compensation
and benefits, subject to a minimum distribution schedule. The trustee votes shares held by the CBT
in accordance with voting directions from eligible employees, as specified in a trust agreement
with the trustee.

We sold 58.4 million shares of previously unissued company common stock to the CBT in 1995 for
$37 million of cash, previously contributed to the CBT by us, and a promissory note from the CBT to
us of $952 million. The CBT is consolidated by ConocoPhillips; therefore, the cash contribution
and promissory note are eliminated in consolidation. Shares held by the CBT are valued at cost and
do not affect earnings per share or total common stockholders’ equity until after they are
transferred out of the CBT. In 2008 and 2007, shares transferred out of the CBT were 1,668,456 and
1,856,224, respectively. At December 31, 2008, the CBT had 40.5 million shares remaining. All
shares are required to be transferred out of the CBT by January 1, 2021. The CBT, together with
two smaller grantor trusts, comprise the “Grantor trusts” line in the equity section of the
consolidated balance sheet.

Current assets, long-term assets, current liabilities and long-term liabilities included deferred
taxes of $457 million, $58 million, $1 million and $18,167 million, respectively, at December 31,
2008, and $329 million, $26 million, $39 million and $21,018 million, respectively, at December 31,
2007.

We have loss and credit carryovers in multiple taxing jurisdictions. These attributes generally
expire between 2009 and 2028 with some carryovers having indefinite carryforward periods.

Valuation allowances have been established for certain loss and credit carryforwards that reduce
deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. During 2008,
valuation allowances increased a total of $71 million. This reflects increases of $303 million
primarily related to U.S. foreign tax credit and foreign and state tax loss carryforwards,
partially offset by decreases of $232 million related to utilization of credits and loss
carryforwards, currency effects and asset relinquishment. Based on our historical taxable income,
expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects remaining
net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as
offsets to the tax consequences of future taxable income. None of the future tax benefit for
recognition of deferred tax assets that have valuation allowances, if any, will be allocated to
goodwill due to the effect of SFAS No. 141 (Revised), “Business Combinations” (SFAS No. 141(R)).
For additional information on SFAS No. 141(R), see Note 27—New Accounting Standards.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, income considered to be permanently reinvested in certain foreign
subsidiaries and foreign corporate joint ventures totaled approximately $3,319 million and
$6,606 million, respectively. The change from 2007 relates primarily to the impairment of our
LUKOIL investment in 2008. Deferred income taxes have not been provided on this income, as we do
not plan to initiate any action that would require the payment of income taxes. It is not
practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable on this foreign income
if distributed.



In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (FIN 48). This Interpretation provides guidance
on recognition, classification and disclosure concerning uncertain tax liabilities. The evaluation
of a tax position requires recognition of a tax benefit if it is more likely than not it will be
sustained upon examination. We adopted
FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007. The adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements.

The following table shows a reconciliation of the beginning and ending unrecognized tax benefits
for 2007 and 2008.

Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits for 2008 and 2007 were $862 million and $698
million, respectively, which, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. The increase
from 2007 was primarily due to the effect of SFAS No. 141(R).

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, accrued liabilities for interest and penalties totaled $147 million
and $137 million, respectively, net of accrued income taxes. Interest and penalties affecting
earnings in 2008 and 2007 were $28 million and $46 million, respectively.

We and our subsidiaries file tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many foreign and
state jurisdictions. Audits in major jurisdictions are generally complete as follows: United
Kingdom (2001), Canada (2003), United States (2004) and Norway (2007). Issues in dispute for
audited years and audits for subsequent years are ongoing and in various stages of completion in
the many jurisdictions in which we operate around the world. As a consequence, the balance in
unrecognized tax benefits can be expected to fluctuate from period to period. It is reasonably
possible such changes could be significant when compared with our total unrecognized tax benefits,
but the amount of change is not estimable.

Our effective tax rate in 2008 was a negative 373 percent, compared with a positive 49 percent in
2007. The change in the effective tax rate for 2008 was primarily due to the impact of impairments
relating to goodwill and to our LUKOIL investment taken in the fourth quarter of 2008. For
additional information on the impairments, see Note 9—Goodwill and Intangibles and Note
7—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables.

Tax rate changes in 2008 did not have a significant impact on our 2008 income tax expense. Our
2007 tax expense was decreased $204 million and $141 million, respectively, due to remeasurement of
deferred tax liabilities resulting from tax rate reductions in Canada and Germany. Our 2006 tax
expense was increased $470 million due to remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities and the current
year impact of increases in the U.K. tax rate. This was mostly offset by a 2006 reduction in tax
expense of $435 million due to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities from the 2006 Canadian
graduated tax rate reduction and an Alberta provincial tax rate change.

The increase in 2007 is primarily due to purchases from the WRB business venture.

(a)

We sold natural gas to DCP Midstream and crude oil to the Malaysian Refining Company Sdn.
Bhd. (MRC), among others, for processing and marketing. Natural gas liquids, solvents and
petrochemical feedstocks were sold to Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem), gas oil
and hydrogen feedstocks were sold to Excel Paralubes and refined products were sold primarily
to CFJ Properties and LUKOIL. Natural gas, crude oil, blendstock and other intermediate
products were sold to WRB Refining LLC. In addition, we charged several of our affiliates,
including CPChem, Merey Sweeny L.P. (MSLP) and Hamaca Holding LLC (until expropriation on June
26, 2007), for the use of common facilities, such as steam generators, waste and water
treaters, and warehouse facilities.

(b)

We purchased refined products from WRB. We purchased natural gas and natural gas liquids
from DCP Midstream and CPChem for use in our refinery processes and other feedstocks from
various affiliates. We purchased crude oil from LUKOIL, upgraded crude oil from Petrozuata
C.A. (until expropriation on June 26, 2007) and refined products from MRC. We also paid fees
to various pipeline equity companies for transporting finished refined products, as well as a
price upgrade to MSLP for heavy crude processing. We purchased base oils and fuel products
from Excel Paralubes for use in our refinery and specialty businesses.

(c)

We paid processing fees to various affiliates. Additionally, we paid crude oil
transportation fees to pipeline equity companies.

(d)

We paid and/or received interest to/from various affiliates, including FCCL Oil Sands
Partnership. See Note 7—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, for additional
information on loans to affiliated companies.



Note 26—Segment Disclosures and Related Information

We have organized our reporting structure based on the grouping of similar products and services,
resulting in six operating segments:

1)

E&P—This segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil,
natural gas and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. At December 31, 2008, our E&P
operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada,

Note 27—New Accounting Standards

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (Revised), “Business Combinations” (SFAS No. 141(R)).
This Statement will apply to all transactions in which an entity obtains control of one or more
other businesses. In general, SFAS No. 141(R) requires the acquiring entity in a business
combination to recognize the fair value of all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the
transaction; establishes the acquisition date as the fair value measurement point; and modifies the
disclosure requirements. Additionally, it changes the accounting treatment for transaction costs,
acquired contingent arrangements, in-process research and development, restructuring costs, changes
in deferred tax asset valuation allowances as a result of business combination, and changes in
income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date. This Statement applies prospectively to
business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009. However,
starting January 1, 2009, accounting for changes in valuation allowances for acquired deferred tax
assets and the resolution of uncertain tax positions for prior business combinations will impact
tax expense instead of impacting goodwill.

Also in December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated
Financial Statements—an amendment of ARB No. 51,” which requires noncontrolling interests, also
called minority interests, to be presented as a separate item in the equity section of the
consolidated balance sheet. It also requires the amount of consolidated net income attributable to
the noncontrolling interest to be clearly presented on the face of the consolidated income
statement. Additionally, this Statement clarifies that changes in a parent’s ownership interest in
a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions, and when a subsidiary
is deconsolidated, it requires gain or loss recognition in net income based on the fair value on
the deconsolidation date. This Statement is effective January 1, 2009, and will be applied
prospectively with



the exception of the presentation and disclosure requirements, which must be applied
retrospectively for all periods presented.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities—an amendment of FASB No. 133.” This Statement expands disclosure requirements of SFAS
No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” for derivative instruments
within the scope of that Statement to provide greater transparency. This includes the disclosure
of the additional information regarding how and why derivative instruments are used, how
derivatives are accounted for, and how they affect an entity’s financial performance. This
Statement is effective for interim and annual financial statements beginning with the first quarter
of 2009, but it will not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements, other than the
additional disclosures.

In November 2008, the FASB reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 08-6, “Equity Method Investment
Accounting Considerations” (EITF 08-6), which was issued to clarify how the application of equity
method accounting will be affected by SFAS No. 141(R) and SFAS No. 160. EITF 08-6 clarifies that
an entity shall continue to use the cost accumulation model for its equity method investments. It
also confirms past accounting practices related to the treatment of contingent consideration and
the use of the impairment model under APB Opinion No. 18,
“The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock.” Additionally, it requires an equity method investor
to account for a share issuance by an investee as if the investor had sold a proportionate share of
the investment. This Issue is effective January 1, 2009, and will be applied prospectively.

In December 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. 132(R)-1, “Employers’ Disclosures
about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets,” to improve the transparency associated with the
disclosures about the plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. This
FSP requires the disclosure of each major asset category at fair value using the fair value
hierarchy in SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements.” Also, this FSP requires entities to disclose
the net periodic benefit cost recognized for each annual period for which a statement of income is
presented. This FSP is effective for annual statements beginning with 2009.



Oil and Gas Operations

(Unaudited)

In accordance with SFAS No. 69, “Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities,” and
regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), we are making certain
supplemental disclosures about our oil and gas exploration and production operations. While this
information was developed with reasonable care and disclosed in good faith, we emphasize some of
the data is necessarily imprecise and represents only approximate amounts because of the subjective
judgments involved in developing such information. Accordingly, this information may not
necessarily represent our current financial condition or our expected future results.

These disclosures include information about our consolidated oil and gas activities and our
proportionate share of our equity affiliates’ oil and gas activities, covering both those in our
Exploration and Production (E&P) segment, as well as in our LUKOIL Investment segment. As a result,
amounts reported as Equity Affiliates in Oil and Gas Operations may differ from those shown in the
individual segment disclosures reported elsewhere in this report. The data included for the LUKOIL
Investment segment reflects the company’s estimated share of OAO LUKOIL’s amounts. Because
LUKOIL’s accounting cycle close and preparation of U.S. GAAP financial statements occur subsequent
to our reporting deadline, our equity share of financial information and statistics for our LUKOIL
investment are estimated based on current market indicators, publicly
available LUKOIL information, and other objective data. Once the difference between actual and estimated results is
known, an adjustment is recorded. Our estimated year-end 2008 reserves related to our equity
investment in LUKOIL are based on LUKOIL’s year-end 2008 reserve estimates and include adjustments
to conform them to ConocoPhillips’ reserves policy.

Our proved reserves include estimated quantities related to production sharing contracts (PSCs),
which are reported under the “economic interest” method and are subject to fluctuations in prices
of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids; recoverable operating expenses; and capital
costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change
inversely to changes in commodity prices. For example, if prices increase, then our applicable
reserve quantities would decline. At December 31, 2008, approximately 14 percent of our total
proved reserves, excluding LUKOIL, were under PSCs, primarily in our Asia Pacific geographic
reporting area.

Our disclosures by geographic area for our consolidated operations include the United States,
Canada, Europe (primarily Norway and the United Kingdom), Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa,
Russia and Caspian, and Other Areas (primarily South America). In these supplemental oil and gas
disclosures, where we use equity accounting for operations that have proved reserves, these
operations are shown separately and designated as Equity Affiliates, and include Canada, Asia
Pacific, Middle East and Africa, Russia and Caspian, and Other Areas. Canada includes our share of
the FCCL Oil Sands Partnership. Asia Pacific includes our share of Australia Pacific LNG’s coalbed
methane exploration and production activities. Middle East and Africa includes Qatargas 3. The
Russia and Caspian area includes our share of Polar Lights Company, OOO Naryanmarneftegaz, and
LUKOIL. Other Areas consists of the Petrozuata and Hamaca heavy-oil projects in Venezuela, which
were expropriated on June 26, 2007.

On December 31, 2008, the SEC issued its final rules to modernize the supplemental oil and gas
disclosures. Significant changes have occurred in our industry in the nearly three decades since
the SEC first adopted its oil and gas disclosure rules, which include guidance on determining the
volumetric measure of proved reserves. The new rules require the use of 12-month historical
average prices using first-of-the-month pricing. The final rules also allow for companies to
include nontraditional resources, such as bitumen extracted from oil sands, in their SEC-reported
reserves. We expect to include Syncrude in our SEC proved reserves reporting as allowed under the
new rules. We are currently evaluating the final rules and have not yet determined the overall
impact



to our proved reserve determinations. Our year-end 2009 reserve determinations and the oil and gas
disclosures in our 2009 Form 10-K are expected to be subject to the new rules, based on current
effective dates.

Reserves Governance

The recording and reporting of proved reserves are governed by criteria established by regulations
of the SEC. Those regulations define proved reserves as those estimated quantities of hydrocarbons
that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in
future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Proved
reserves are further classified as either developed or undeveloped. Proved developed reserves are
the quantities expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and
operating methods, while proved undeveloped reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered
from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from an existing well where relatively major expenditures
are required for recompletion.

We have a companywide, comprehensive, SEC-compliant internal policy that governs the determination
and reporting of proved reserves. This policy is applied by the geologists and reservoir engineers
in our E&P business units around the world. As part of our internal control process, each business
unit’s reserves are reviewed annually by an internal team composed of reservoir engineers,
geologists and finance personnel for adherence to SEC guidelines and company policy through on-site
visits and review of documentation. In addition to providing independent reviews of the business
units’ recommended reserve changes, this internal team also ensures reserves are calculated using
consistent and appropriate standards and procedures. This team is independent of business unit
line management and is responsible for reporting its findings to senior management and our internal
audit group. The team is responsible for maintaining and communicating our reserves policy and
procedures and is available for internal peer reviews and consultation on major projects or
technical issues throughout the year. All of our proved crude oil, natural gas and natural gas
liquids reserves held by consolidated companies and our share of equity affiliates have been
estimated by ConocoPhillips, with assistance from third-party petroleum engineering consultants
with regard to our equity interests in LUKOIL and Australia Pacific LNG.

During 2008, approximately 34 percent of our year-end 2007 E&P proved reserves were reviewed by an
outside third-party petroleum engineering consulting firm. At the present time, we plan
to continue to have an outside firm review a similar percentage of our reserve base during 2009.

Engineering estimates of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves in oil and gas fields
and in-place crude bitumen volumes in oil sand mining operations are inherently imprecise. See the
“Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations for additional discussion of the sensitivities surrounding
these estimates.

Notable changes in proved crude oil reserves in the three years ending December 31, 2008, included:

•

Revisions

: In 2008, revisions in Alaska were mainly due to lower prices at December
31, 2008, compared with December 31, 2007. In 2007 for our equity affiliate operations,
revisions were primarily attributable to LUKOIL. In 2006, revisions in Alaska were primarily
a result of reservoir performance.

•

Purchases

: In 2007 for our equity affiliate operations, purchases reflect the
formation of FCCL. In 2006, purchases in the Lower 48 were primarily related to our
acquisition of Burlington Resources. In 2006 for our equity affiliate operations, purchases
were mainly attributable to acquiring additional interests in LUKOIL.



•

Extensions and Discoveries

: In 2007 for our equity affiliate operations, extensions
and discoveries were primarily associated with FCCL.

•

Sales

: In 2007 for our equity affiliates, sales were primarily due to the
expropriation of our oil interests in Venezuela.

In addition to conventional crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) proved reserves,
we have proved oil sands mining reserves in Canada, associated with a Syncrude project totaling 249
million barrels at the end of 2008. For internal management purposes, we view these mining
reserves and their development as part of our total exploration and production operations.
However, SEC regulations currently in effect define these reserves as mining related. Therefore,
they are not included in our tabular presentation of proved crude oil, natural gas and NGL
reserves. These oil sands mining reserves also are not included in the standardized measure of
discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserve quantities.

Natural gas production in the reserves table may differ from gas production (delivered for sale) in
our statistics disclosure, primarily because the quantities above include gas consumed at the
lease, but omit the gas equivalent of liquids extracted at any of our owned, equity-affiliate, or
third-party processing plants or facilities.

Natural gas reserves are computed at 14.65 pounds per square inch absolute and 60 degrees
Fahrenheit.

Notable changes in proved natural gas reserves in the three years ended December 31, 2008,
included:

•

Revisions

: In 2008, revisions in Alaska were mainly due to lower prices at December
31, 2008, compared with December 31, 2007. For our equity affiliate operations, revisions
primarily resulted from a revised assessment of the reasonable certainty of project
development and of the marketability of uncontracted gas volumes.



•

Purchases

: In 2008 for our equity affiliate operations, purchases relate to our
Australia Pacific LNG joint venture with Origin Energy. In 2006 for our consolidated
operations, purchases were primarily related to our acquisition of Burlington Resources.

•

Extensions and Discoveries

: In 2006 for our equity affiliate operations,
extensions and discoveries were primarily in Qatar and LUKOIL.

Certain amounts in the Middle East and Africa were
reclassified between “sales” and “transfers.”
Total revenues were unchanged.

•

Results of operations for producing activities consist of all activities within the E&P
organization and producing activities within the LUKOIL Investment segment, except for
pipeline and marine operations, liquefied natural gas operations, our Canadian Syncrude
operation, and crude oil and gas marketing activities, which are included in other earnings.
Also excluded are our Midstream segment, downstream petroleum and chemical activities, as well
as general corporate administrative expenses and interest.

•

Transfers are valued at prices that approximate market.

•

Other revenues include gains and losses from asset sales, certain amounts resulting from
the purchase and sale of hydrocarbons, and other miscellaneous income.

•

Production costs are those incurred to operate and maintain wells and related equipment and
facilities used to produce petroleum liquids and natural gas. These costs also include
depreciation of support equipment and administrative expenses related to the production
activity.

•

Taxes other than income taxes include production, property and other non-income taxes.

•

Exploration expenses include dry hole costs, leasehold impairments, geological and
geophysical expenses, the costs of retaining undeveloped leaseholds, and depreciation of
support equipment and administrative expenses related to the exploration activity.



•

Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) in Results of Operations differs from that shown
for total E&P in Note 26—Segment Disclosures and Related Information, in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements, mainly due to depreciation of support equipment being reclassified to
production or exploration expenses, as applicable, in Results of Operations. In addition, other
earnings include certain E&P activities, including their related DD&A charges.

•

Transportation costs include costs to transport our produced oil, natural gas or natural
gas liquids to their points of sale, as well as processing fees paid to process natural gas to
natural gas liquids. The profit element of transportation operations in which we have an
ownership interest are deemed to be outside oil and gas producing activities. The net income
of the transportation operations is included in other earnings.

•

Other related expenses include foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and other
miscellaneous expenses.

•

The provision for income taxes is computed by adjusting each country’s income before income
taxes for permanent differences related to oil and gas producing activities that are reflected
in our consolidated income tax expense for the period, multiplying the result by the country’s
statutory tax rate, and adjusting for applicable tax credits. Included in 2007 for Canada is
a benefit related to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities from the 2007 Canadian
graduated tax rate reduction. Included in 2006 for Canada is a $353 million benefit (which
excludes $48 million related to the Syncrude oil project reflected in other earnings) related
to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities from the 2006 Canadian graduated tax rate
reduction and an Alberta provincial tax rate change. Europe income tax expense for 2006 was
increased $250 million due to remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities as a result of
increases in the U.K. tax rate.

(1)

Excludes farmout arrangements.

(2)

Includes step-out wells, as well as other types of exploratory wells. Step-out exploratory wells are wells drilled in areas near or offsetting
current production, for which we cannot demonstrate with certainty that there is continuity of production from an existing productive formation.
These are classified as exploratory wells because we cannot attribute proved reserves to these locations.

(3)

Excludes LUKOIL.

Restated to include amounts omitted from equity affiliates in 2007 and to align certain amounts in
the Middle East and Africa from consolidated operations to equity affiliates.

•

Costs incurred include capitalized and expensed items.

•

Acquisition costs include the costs of acquiring proved and unproved oil and gas
properties. In 2008, equity affiliate acquisition costs were due to the Australia Pacific LNG
joint venture with Origin Energy. In 2007, equity affiliate acquisition costs were due to the
FCCL business venture with EnCana. For 2006 consolidated operations, acquisition costs were
primarily related to the Burlington Resources acquisition.

•

Exploration costs include geological and geophysical expenses, the cost of retaining
undeveloped leaseholds, and exploratory drilling costs.

•

Development costs include the cost of drilling and equipping development wells and building
related production facilities for extracting, treating, gathering and storing petroleum
liquids and natural gas.

Restated to include certain amounts that were omitted in 2007.

•

Capitalized costs include the cost of equipment and facilities for oil and gas producing
activities. These costs include the activities of our E&P and LUKOIL Investment segments,
excluding pipeline and marine operations, liquefied natural gas operations, our Canadian
Syncrude operation, crude oil and natural gas marketing activities, and downstream operations.

•

Proved properties include capitalized costs for oil and gas leaseholds holding proved
reserves, development wells and related equipment and facilities (including uncompleted
development well costs), and support equipment.

•

Unproved properties include capitalized costs for oil and gas leaseholds under exploration
(including where petroleum liquids and natural gas were found but determination of the
economic viability of the required infrastructure is dependent upon further exploratory work
under way or firmly planned) and for uncompleted exploratory well costs, including exploratory
wells under evaluation.



•

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Gas
Reserve Quantities

Amounts are computed using year-end prices and costs (adjusted only for existing contractual
changes), appropriate statutory tax rates and a prescribed 10 percent discount factor.
Continuation of year-end economic conditions also is assumed. The calculation is based on
estimates of proved reserves, which are revised over time as new data becomes available.
Probable or possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, are not considered. The
calculation also requires assumptions as to the timing of future production of proved reserves,
and the timing and amount of future development, including dismantlement, and production costs.

While due care was taken in its preparation, we do not represent that this data is the fair
value of our oil and gas properties, or a fair estimate of the present value of cash flows to
be obtained from their development and production.

Supplementary Information—Condensed Consolidating Financial Information

We have various cross guarantees among ConocoPhillips, ConocoPhillips Company, ConocoPhillips
Australia Funding Company, ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company I, and ConocoPhillips Canada
Funding Company II, with respect to publicly held debt securities. ConocoPhillips Company is
wholly owned by ConocoPhillips. ConocoPhillips Australia Funding Company is an indirect, wholly
owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips Company. ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company I and
ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company II are indirect, wholly owned subsidiaries of ConocoPhillips.
ConocoPhillips and ConocoPhillips Company have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payment
obligations of ConocoPhillips Australia Funding Company, ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company I,
and ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company II, with respect to their publicly held debt securities.
Similarly, ConocoPhillips has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payment obligations of
ConocoPhillips Company with respect to its publicly held debt securities. In addition,
ConocoPhillips Company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payment obligations of
ConocoPhillips with respect to its publicly held debt securities. All guarantees are joint and
several. The following condensed consolidating financial information presents the results of
operations, financial position and cash flows for:

•

ConocoPhillips, ConocoPhillips Company, ConocoPhillips Australia Funding Company,
ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company I, and ConocoPhillips Canada Funding Company II (in
each case, reflecting investments in subsidiaries utilizing the equity method of
accounting).

•

All other nonguarantor subsidiaries of ConocoPhillips.

•

The consolidating adjustments necessary to present ConocoPhillips’ results on a
consolidated basis.

In April 2006, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC under which
ConocoPhillips, as a well-known seasoned issuer, has the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate
amount of various types of debt and equity securities, with certain debt securities guaranteed by
ConocoPhillips Company. Also as part of that registration statement, ConocoPhillips Trust I and
ConocoPhillips Trust II have the ability to issue and sell preferred trust securities, guaranteed
by ConocoPhillips. ConocoPhillips Trust I and ConocoPhillips Trust II have not issued any
trust-preferred securities under this registration statement, and thus have no assets or
liabilities. Accordingly, columns for these two trusts are not included in the condensed
consolidating financial information.

This condensed consolidating financial information should be read in conjunction with the
accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes. Certain previously reported amounts
appearing on the 2007 and 2006 statements of operations of ConocoPhillips Company have been
reclassified between line items to conform to the current year presentation.
