Items 1 and 2. BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES

CORPORATE STRUCTURE

ConocoPhillips is a major, integrated, global energy company. ConocoPhillips
was incorporated in the state of Delaware on November 16, 2001, in connection
with, and in anticipation of, the merger between Conoco Inc. (Conoco) and
Phillips Petroleum Company (Phillips). The merger between Conoco and Phillips
(the merger) was consummated on August 30, 2002, at which time Conoco and
Phillips combined their businesses by merging with separate acquisition
subsidiaries of ConocoPhillips. As a result of the merger, Conoco and Phillips
each became wholly owned subsidiaries of ConocoPhillips. For accounting
purposes, Phillips was designated as the acquirer of Conoco and ConocoPhillips
was treated as the successor of Phillips. Accordingly, Phillips’ operations
and results are presented in this Form 10-K for all periods prior to the close
of the merger. From the merger date forward, the operations and results of
ConocoPhillips reflect the combined operations of the two companies.
Subsequent to the merger, Conoco was renamed ConocoPhillips Holding Company,
and Phillips was renamed ConocoPhillips Company, but for ease of reference,
those companies will be referred to respectively in this document as Conoco and
Phillips.

Our business is organized into five operating segments:

1)

Exploration and Production (E&P)—This segment primarily explores
for and produces crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids on a
worldwide basis.

2)

Midstream—Through both consolidated and equity interests, this
segment gathers and processes natural gas produced by ConocoPhillips
and others, and fractionates and markets natural gas liquids, primarily
in the United States, Canada and Trinidad. The Midstream segment
includes our 30.3 percent equity investment in Duke Energy Field
Services, LLC, a joint venture with Duke Energy.

3)

Refining and Marketing (R&M)—This segment refines, markets and
transports crude oil and petroleum products, mainly in the United
States, Europe and Asia.

4)

Chemicals—This segment manufactures and markets petrochemicals and
plastics on a worldwide basis. The Chemicals segment consists of our
50 percent equity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC,
a joint venture with ChevronTexaco Corporation.



5)

Emerging Businesses—This segment encompasses the development of new
businesses beyond our traditional operations. Emerging Businesses
includes new technologies related to natural gas conversion into clean
fuels and related products (gas-to-liquids), technology solutions,
power generation, and emerging technologies.

At December 31, 2003, ConocoPhillips employed approximately 39,000 people.

SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

For operating segment information and geographic information, see Note
28—Segment Disclosures and Related Information in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by reference.

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION (E&P)

This segment explores for and produces crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas
liquids on a worldwide basis. It also mines deposits of oil sands in Canada to
extract the bitumen and upgrade it into a synthetic crude oil. At December 31,
2003, our E&P operations were producing in the United States, the Norwegian and
U.K. sectors of the North Sea, Canada, Nigeria, Venezuela, offshore Timor Lesté
in the Timor Sea, offshore Australia, offshore China, offshore the United Arab
Emirates, offshore Vietnam, Russia, and Indonesia.

The information listed below appears in the supplemental oil and gas operations
disclosures on pages 154 through 172 and is incorporated herein by reference:

In 2003, our worldwide production, including our share of equity affiliates’
production, averaged 1,590,000 barrels-of-oil-equivalent (BOE) per day, a 49
percent increase from 1,069,000 BOE per day in 2002. During 2003, 674,000 BOE
per day were produced in the United States, a 15 percent increase from 587,000
BOE per day in 2002. Production from our international E&P operations
averaged 916,000 BOE per day in 2003, up 90 percent from 482,000 BOE per day in
2002. In addition, our Canadian Syncrude mining operations had net production
of 19,000 barrels per day in 2003, compared with 8,000 barrels per day in 2002.
The increased production mainly reflects the impact of the merger. We convert
our natural gas production to BOE based on a 6:1 ratio: six thousand cubic feet
of natural gas equals one barrel-of-oil-equivalent.

Our worldwide annual average crude oil sales price increased 14 percent in
2003, from $24.07 per barrel to $27.47 per barrel. Our annual average
worldwide natural gas sales price also increased, going from $2.77 per thousand
cubic feet in 2002 to $4.07 per thousand cubic feet in 2003.



Finding and development costs in 2003 were $5.35 per barrel-of-oil-equivalent,
compared with $5.57 in 2002. Over the last five years, our finding and
development costs averaged $4.29 per barrel-of-oil-equivalent. Finding and
development costs per barrel-of-oil-equivalent is calculated by dividing the
net reserve change for the period (excluding production and sales) into the
costs incurred for the period, as reported in the “Costs Incurred” disclosure
required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 69, “Disclosures
about Oil and Gas Producing Activities.”

At December 31, 2003, ConocoPhillips, including its share of equity affiliates,
held a combined 52.6 million net developed and undeveloped acres, compared with
101.9 million net acres at year-end 2002. The decrease in acreage primarily
reflects the removal of acreage in Somalia, where operations had been suspended
by declarations of force majeure. At year-end 2003, we held acreage in 25
countries.

E&P—U.S. OPERATIONS

In 2003, U.S. E&P operations contributed 43 percent of our worldwide liquids
production and 42 percent of our worldwide natural gas production. Our U.S.
E&P operations are managed in two divisions: Alaska and the Lower 48 States.

Alaska

We are a major producer of crude oil on Alaska’s North Slope, and we produce
natural gas in the Cook Inlet. A brief summary of our major Alaska producing
fields, transportation infrastructure, and exploration activities follows.

Greater Prudhoe Area

The Greater Prudhoe Area is comprised of the Prudhoe Bay field and satellites,
as well as the Greater Point McIntyre Area fields. We have a 36.1 percent
interest in all fields within the Greater Prudhoe Area, all of which are
operated by BP p.l.c. (BP).

The Prudhoe Bay field is the largest oil field on Alaska’s North Slope. It is
the site of a large waterflood and enhanced oil recovery project, as well as a
gas processing plant that processes and reinjects natural gas back into the
reservoir. Our net crude oil production from the Prudhoe Bay field averaged
121,500 barrels per day in 2003, compared with 130,800 barrels per day in 2002,
while natural gas liquids production averaged 23,000 barrels per day in 2003,
compared with 24,100 barrels per day in 2002. Normal field declines were the
main cause of the lower production rates in 2003.

Prudhoe Bay satellite fields Aurora, Borealis, Polaris, Midnight Sun, and Orion
produced 16,200 net barrels per day of crude oil in 2003, compared with 12,700
net barrels per day in 2002. Borealis contributed the biggest share in 2003,
producing 10,300 net barrels per day. All Prudhoe Bay satellite fields are
produced through Prudhoe Bay production facilities. Development options and
plans are being studied for other potential Prudhoe Bay satellites.

The Greater Point McIntyre Area (GPMA) is made up of the Point McIntyre,
Niakuk, Lisburne, West Beach, and North Prudhoe Bay State fields. The fields
within the GPMA are generally produced through the Lisburne Production Center.
Net crude oil production for GPMA averaged 18,200 barrels per day in 2003,
compared with 19,800 barrels per day in 2002. The bulk of this production came
from the Point McIntyre field, which is approximately seven miles north of the
Prudhoe Bay field and extends into the Beaufort Sea.



Greater Kuparuk Area

We operate the Greater Kuparuk Area, which is comprised of the Kuparuk field
and four satellite fields: Tarn, Tabasco, Meltwater, and West Sak. Our
ownership interest is 55.2 percent in the Kuparuk field, which is located about
40 miles west of Prudhoe Bay. Field installations include three central
production facilities that separate oil, natural gas and water. The natural
gas is either used for fuel or compressed for reinjection. Our net crude oil
production from the Kuparuk field averaged 78,600 barrels per day in 2003,
compared with 79,000 barrels per day in 2002. Natural production declines from
Kuparuk were offset by an average of 8,000 barrels per day of production from
the Palm discovery that extended the Kuparuk field to the west about three
miles. Development of the Palm discovery included the construction of a new
drill site and the drilling of 17 wells. Palm production began in November
2002.

Other fields in the Greater Kuparuk Area produced 21,800 net barrels per day of
crude oil in 2003, primarily from the Tarn, Tabasco, and Meltwater satellites.
We have a 55.3 percent interest in Tarn and Tabasco and a 55.4 percent interest
in Meltwater.

The Greater Kuparuk Area also includes the West Sak heavy-oil field. Annual
production rates increased from 3,300 net barrels per day in 2002 to 3,800 net
barrels per day in 2003. Progress was made in 2003 towards proving concepts
necessary for full-scale development of this field. Eight wells were drilled
during the year, increasing production from 3,300 net barrels per day in the
month of December 2002 to 5,000 net barrels per day in the month of December
2003. We have a 55.3 percent interest in this field.

Western North Slope

The Alpine field, located west of the Kuparuk field, began production in
November 2000. In 2003, the field produced at a net rate of 64,500 barrels of
oil per day, compared with 63,400 barrels per day in 2002. We are the operator
and hold a 78 percent interest in Alpine.

In May 2003, we announced plans to increase produced water and natural gas
handling capacities at our Alpine production facilities. Although we inject
seawater into the Alpine reservoir as a means of enhanced oil recovery, most
production has been almost 100 percent oil. Eventually, the injected water and
natural gas will start to break through into the producing wells, requiring an
increase in the amount of produced water and natural gas that needs to be
handled. The increase in water and natural gas handling capacities should
allow crude oil production to remain at or slightly above current production
rates for a longer period of time than could otherwise have been achieved.
Startup of the expanded facilities is planned to commence by the end of 2004.

In January 2003, ConocoPhillips and the U.S. Department of Interior Bureau of
Land Management signed a Memorandum of Understanding that provides for
completion of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for five prospective
Alpine satellites: Fiord, Nanuq, Lookout, Spark, and Alpine West, as well as
future potential developments in the northeast corner of the National Petroleum
Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A) and near the Alpine oil field. A final decision to move
forward on these projects will be made after the EIS is completed, currently
expected in second half of 2004, and the appropriate permits have been granted.

Cook Inlet

Our assets in Alaska include the North Cook Inlet field, the Beluga River
natural gas field, and the Kenai liquefied natural gas facility.



We have a 100 percent interest in the North Cook Inlet field. Net production
in 2003 averaged 112 million cubic feet per day, compared with 125 million
cubic feet per day in 2002. All of the production from the North Cook Inlet
field is used to supply our share of gas to the Kenai liquefied natural gas
plant. The decline in production in 2003 was the result of well problems.
Well work completed in late 2003 and planned for 2004 is expected to improve
production.

Our interest in the Beluga River field is 33 percent. Net production averaged
63 million cubic feet per day in 2003, compared with 41 million cubic feet per
day in 2002. Gas from the Beluga River field is sold to local utilities,
industrial consumers, and used as back-up supply to the Kenai liquefied natural
gas plant.

We have a 70 percent interest in the Kenai liquefied natural gas plant, which
supplies liquefied natural gas to two utility companies in Japan. Utilizing
two ships, the company transports the liquefied natural gas to Japan, where it
is reconverted to dry gas at the receiving terminal. We sold 44.0 billion
cubic feet of liquefied natural gas to Japan in 2003, compared with 44.4
billion cubic feet in 2002.

Exploration

We drilled or participated in three exploratory wells during 2003, on locations
near Alpine, the NPR-A and the Cook Inlet. Two of these wells are pending
further appraisal, and one was a dry hole. We plan to drill or participate in
four exploration wells in Alaska during 2004.

Transportation

We transport the petroleum liquids we produce on the North Slope to market
through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS), an 800-mile pipeline, marine
terminal, spill response and escort vessel system that ties the North Slope of
Alaska to the port of Valdez in south-central Alaska.

In 2001, ConocoPhillips and the five other owners of TAPS completed and filed
state and federal applications for renewal of the pipeline’s right-of-way
permit through 2034. The State of Alaska approved the 30-year right-of-way
renewal in November 2002 and U.S. federal approval was received in January
2003.

Regulatory approval was received in early 2003 for us to purchase an additional
1.5 percent interest in TAPS from Amerada Hess Corporation, thereby increasing
our ownership in TAPS to 28.3 percent. The purchase was effective January 24,
2003. We also have ownership interests in the Alpine, Kuparuk and Oliktok
pipelines on the North Slope.

We continue to evaluate a gas pipeline project to deliver natural gas from
Alaska’s North Slope to the Lower 48. Given the size of the project and risk
associated with it, we continue to believe that risk mitigation mechanisms and
improvements in project economics are necessary before this project can
proceed. Activities in 2003 included promoting state and federal legislation
that would lower the economic risk of the project.

Our wholly owned subsidiary, Polar Tankers Inc., manages the marine
transportation of our Alaska North Slope production. Polar Tankers is based in
Long Beach, California, and operates six ships in the Alaskan trade, chartering
additional third-party-operated vessels as necessary. In 2001, Polar Tankers
brought the

Polar Endeavour

into service; the

Polar Resolution

was brought into
service in 2002; and the

Polar Discovery

was brought into service in 2003.
These 125,000 deadweight-ton, double-hulled crude oil tankers are the first
three of five Endeavour Class tankers that we plan to add to our Alaska-trade
fleet. The fourth and fifth tankers are scheduled to enter the fleet in 2004
and 2005, respectively.



Lower 48 States

Our operations in the Lower 48 States are principally located in the following
areas:

•

Offshore: Gulf of Mexico

•

Onshore: various trends in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Louisiana,
Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming

Gulf of Mexico

Our current portfolio of producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico includes
three fields operated by us and six fields operated by other companies. The
number of fields declined in 2003 with the divestiture of properties as part of
our portfolio rationalization program. At December 31, 2003, we had 22 leases
in production or under development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.

We hold a 16 percent interest in the co-venturer-operated Ursa field. The Ursa
tension-leg platform was installed in late 1998 in approximately 3,900 feet of
water, with first production occurring in March 1999. Our net production in
2003 averaged 13,300 barrels per day of liquids and 13 million cubic feet per
day of natural gas.

The Princess field is a northern, subsalt extension of the Ursa field. It was
discovered in 2000, with first production beginning in late 2002 from an
extended-reach well from the Ursa platform. A three-well subsea tieback to the
Ursa platform was completed in 2003. Our net production in 2003 averaged 2,600
barrels per day of liquids and 7.3 million cubic feet per day of natural gas.
We hold a 16 percent interest in Princess.

We operate and hold a 75 percent interest in the Garden Banks 783 and 784
leases which contain the Magnolia field discovered in 1999. Installation of a
tension-leg platform, to be located in almost 4,700 feet of water, is expected
in mid-2004, with first oil scheduled for late 2004. Peak production of 49,000
net barrels-of-oil-equivalent per day is expected in 2005 from proved reserves.

We have a 16.8 percent interest in the K2 discovery. K2, located in Green
Canyon Block 562, was discovered in 1999, with appraisal drilling continuing in
2003. A development option under consideration would utilize a subsea tieback
to a nearby third-party platform. Project sanctioning is expected in the first
quarter of 2004.

In July 2003, we announced a discovery with the Lorien well in Green Canyon
Block 199. The well was drilled in 2,177 feet of water and encountered more
than 120 feet of hydrocarbons. The well has been suspended pending further
appraisal of the hydrocarbon zone. We are the operator with a 65 percent
interest.

During 2003, two deepwater exploratory wells did not encounter commercial
quantities of hydrocarbons: the Voss well in Keathley Canyon Block 511 and the
Yorick well in Green Canyon Block 435.

Onshore

Our onshore Lower 48 production is primarily natural gas, with the majority of
the production located in the Lobo Trend in south Texas, the San Juan Basin of
New Mexico, and the Guymon-Hugoton Trend in the panhandles of Texas and
Oklahoma. We also have oil and natural gas production from the Permian Basin
in West Texas and Southeast New Mexico. Other positions and production are
maintained in other parts of Texas and Oklahoma, the Arkansas/Louisiana/Texas
area, and onshore Gulf Coast area. In



addition, we hold coalbed methane acreage positions in the Powder River Basin
in Wyoming, the Uinta Basin in Utah, and the Black Warrior Basin in Alabama.

Activities in 2003 primarily were centered on continued optimization and
development of these mature assets. Combined production from Lower 48 onshore
fields in 2003 averaged a net 1,237 million cubic feet per day of natural gas
and 57,000 barrels per day of liquids.

E&P—NORTHWEST EUROPE

In 2003, E&P operations in Northwest Europe contributed 30 percent of our
worldwide liquids production and 34 percent of our worldwide natural gas
production. Our Northwest Europe assets are principally located in the
Norwegian and U.K. sectors of the North Sea.

Norway

The Ekofisk Area is located approximately 200 miles offshore Norway in the
center of the North Sea. The Ekofisk Area is comprised of four producing
fields: Ekofisk, Eldfisk, Embla, and Tor. Ekofisk serves as a hub for
petroleum operations in the area, with surrounding developments utilizing the
Ekofisk infrastructure. Net production in 2003 from the Ekofisk Area was
126,500 barrels of liquids per day and 127 million cubic feet of natural gas
per day, compared with 127,000 barrels of liquids per day and 133 million cubic
feet of natural gas per day in 2002. We are operator and hold a 35.1 percent
interest in Ekofisk.

In 2003, we and our co-venturers approved a plan for further development of the
Ekofisk Area. The project consists of two interrelated components. A new
platform, Ekofisk 2/4M, is anticipated to have 30 well slots, a high-pressure
separator and equipment for produced water treatment. The project also
includes modification on the existing Ekofisk Complex to increase process
capacity. Construction began in 2003 and production from the new platform is
projected to begin in the fall of 2005.

We also have ownership interests in other producing fields in the Norwegian
North Sea, including a 24.3 percent interest in the Heidrun field, a 10.3
percent interest in the Statfjord field, a 23.3 percent interest in the Huldra
field, a 1.6 percent interest in the Troll field, a 9.1 percent interest in the
Visund field, and a 2.4 percent interest in the Oseberg area. Production from
these and other fields in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea and the
Norwegian Sea averaged a net 93,300 barrels of liquids per day and 149 million
cubic feet of natural gas per day in 2003.

In September 2003, production began from the Grane field, in which we have a
6.4 percent interest. Peak production from this field is expected in 2005, and
is anticipated to be approximately 14,000 net barrels per day from proved
reserves.

We also have interests in certain of the transportation and processing
infrastructure of the Norwegian North Sea, including a 35.1 percent interest in
the Norpipe Oil Pipeline System, a 2.3 percent interest in Gassled, which owns
most of the Norwegian gas transportation system, and a 1.6 percent interest in
the southern part of the planned Langeled gas pipeline.

United Kingdom

We are the largest owner in, and the joint operator of, the Britannia natural
gas/condensate field, in which we have a 58.7 percent interest. Our net
production from Britannia averaged 391 million cubic feet of natural gas per
day and 14,500 barrels of liquids per day in 2003. Oil and gas production from
Britannia is delivered by pipeline to Scotland. Development drilling on
Britannia is expected to continue into the year 2006.



In December 2003, we approved a plan for the development of the Callanish and
Brodgar fields. These new Britannia satellite development projects will be
tied back to the Britannia facility, with first production targeted for 2007.
The development plan has been submitted for government approval. We have a 75
percent interest in the Brodgar field and an 83.5 percent interest in the
Callanish field.

We operate and hold a 36.5 percent interest in the Judy/Joanne fields, which
together comprise J-Block. Additionally, the Jade field began production in
the first quarter of 2002 from a wellhead platform and pipeline tied to the
J-Block facilities. We are the operator of and hold a 32.5 percent interest in
Jade. Together, these fields produced a net 18,100 barrels of liquids per day
and 118 million cubic feet of natural gas per day in 2003.

ConocoPhillips continues to supply gas from J-Block to Enron Capital and Trade
Resources Limited (Enron Capital), which was placed in Administration in the
United Kingdom on November 29, 2001. ConocoPhillips has been paid all amounts
currently due and payable by Enron Capital in respect of the J-Block gas sales
agreement, including outstanding amounts due for the period prior to the
appointment of the Administrator. We believe that Enron Capital will continue
to pay the amounts due for gas supplied by us in accordance with the terms of
the gas sales agreement. We do not currently expect that we will have to
curtail sales of gas under the gas sales agreement or shut in production as a
result of the Administration of Enron Capital. However, in the event that the
arrangements for the processing of Enron Capital’s gas are terminated or Enron
Capital goes into liquidation, there may be additional risk of production being
reduced or shut-in.

We have various ownership interests in 13 producing gas fields in the southern
North Sea, in the Rotliegendes and Carboniferous areas. These fields mostly
feed into the ConocoPhillips-operated Theddlethorpe gas processing facility
through three ConocoPhillips-operated pipeline systems. Net production in 2003
averaged 371 million cubic feet per day of natural gas and 2,000 barrels of
liquids per day.

During 2003 we continued the development of the CMS3 area in the southern
sector of the U.K. North Sea, which consists of five natural gas reservoirs
currently being developed by us as a single, unitized project. The McAdam and
Watt fields were brought onstream in 2003, following the Hawksley and Murdoch K
fields in 2002. Drilling operations on the final reservoir, Boulton H, are
ongoing into 2004. Collectively, these fields are known as CMS3 due to their
utilization of the production and transportation facilities of the
ConocoPhillips-operated Caister Murdoch System (CMS). We are the operator of
CMS3 and hold a 59.5 percent interest.

We also have ownership interests in several other producing fields in the U.K.
North Sea, including a 23.4 percent interest in the Alba field, a 40 percent
interest in the MacCulloch field, an 11.5 percent interest in the Armada field,
and a 4.8 percent interest in the Statfjord field. Production from these and
the other remaining fields in the U.K. sector of the North Sea averaged a net
44,500 barrels of liquids per day and 61 million cubic feet of natural gas per
day in 2003.

We have a 24 percent interest in the Clair field development in the Atlantic
Margin. The Clair development is comprised of a conventional steel jacket
structure with minimum manned facilities topside. First production from Clair
is targeted for late 2004.

The Interconnector pipeline, which connects the United Kingdom and Belgium,
facilitates the marketing throughout Europe of the natural gas we produce in
the United Kingdom. Our 10 percent equity share of the Interconnector pipeline
allows us to ship approximately 200 million cubic feet of natural gas per day
to markets in continental Europe. We have multi-year contracts to supply
natural gas to Gasunie in the Netherlands and Wingas in Germany.



Exploration

In Norway, we drilled or participated in six exploratory and appraisal wells
during 2003 in the deepwater Voring and More basins, the South Viking Graben
and the Central Graben. Of the six wells, three are moving forward with
development plans or pending further evaluation, and three were considered
non-commercial discoveries or dry holes. Four partner-operated exploration
wells are planned for 2004. One is a deepwater prospect in PL 283, and the
other three are near-field exploration wells in the Heidrun and Visund
licenses.

In the U.K. sector of the North Sea, we drilled or participated in four
exploratory and appraisal wells during 2003 in the southern North Sea, the
central North Sea near the Jade and Britannia fields, and the West of Shetland
deepwater area. Of the four wells, two are moving forward with development
plans and two were dry holes. We plan to participate in three exploratory
wells in 2004, including two wells in the southern North Sea and one on a
structure adjacent to the Callanish field.

E&P—CANADA

In 2003, E&P operations in Canada contributed 5 percent of our worldwide
liquids production and 13 percent of our worldwide natural gas production,
excluding Syncrude production.

Conventional Oil and Gas Operations

Operations in western Canada encompass properties in Alberta, northeastern
British Columbia and southwestern Saskatchewan. We separate our holdings in
western Canada into four geographic regions. The north region contains a mix
of oil and natural gas, and primarily is winter access. The central and west
regions produce mainly natural gas. The south region has shallow gas and
medium-to-heavy oil. Production from conventional oil and gas operations in
western Canada averaged a net 40,500 barrels per day of liquids and 435 million
cubic feet per day of natural gas in 2003.

We are working with three other energy companies, as members of the Mackenzie
Delta Producers’ Group (Group), on the development of the Mackenzie Valley
pipeline, which is proposed to transport onshore gas production from the
Mackenzie Delta in northern Canada to existing markets. Initial design
capacity for the Mackenzie Valley pipeline is proposed to be 1,200 million
cubic feet per day, but capacity would be expandable with additional
compression. We would hold a 16 percent interest in the pipeline and a 75
percent interest in the development of the Parsons Lake gas field. The Parsons
Lake gas field would be one of the three primary fields in the Mackenzie Delta
that would anchor the pipeline development. Conceptual engineering commenced
in April 2002. Regulatory applications for the project are expected to be
submitted in mid-2004 and first gas production is currently targeted for late
2009.

We owned a 46.7 percent interest in Petrovera, a joint venture that combined a
substantial portion of our Canadian heavy-oil assets and certain associated
natural gas assets. The asset base of the joint venture was located mainly in
southwestern Saskatchewan. Net production in 2003 was 15,300 barrels of
petroleum liquids per day, and was included in equity affiliate production. On
February 18, 2004, we sold our interest in the joint venture.

Exploration

We hold exploration acreage in three areas of Canada: offshore eastern Canada,
the foothills of western Alberta, and the Mackenzie Delta/Beaufort Sea. In
eastern Canada, we hold a 20 percent interest in deepwater Nova Scotia, EL
2359. After participating in the Newburn well in 2002, we are waiting on the
results from drilling in adjacent blocks. In deepwater Newfoundland, we are
working to convert our large Laurentian permit into specific exploration
licenses. We hope to complete this in 2004 and expect to



acquire seismic in 2005. In the foothills, two out of three exploratory wells
drilled in 2003 were successful. In the Mackenzie Delta/Beaufort Sea, we began
drilling a well in early 2004.

Other Canadian Operations

We have two oil sands projects in Canada: Syncrude Canada Ltd. and Surmont.

Syncrude Canada Ltd.

We own a 9.03 percent undivided interest in Syncrude Canada Ltd., a joint
venture created by a number of energy companies for the purpose of mining
shallow deposits of oil sands, extracting the bitumen, and upgrading it into a
light sweet crude oil called Syncrude. The primary plant and facilities are
located at Mildred Lake, about 25 miles north of Fort McMurray, Alberta,
together with an auxiliary mining and extraction facility approximately 20
miles from the Mildred Lake plant. Syncrude Canada Ltd. holds eight oil sands
leases and the associated surface rights, of which our share is approximately
23,000 net acres. Our net share of production averaged 19,000 barrels per day
in 2003.

We continued with development of the Stage III expansion-mining project in
2003, which is expected to increase our Syncrude production. The Aurora Train
2 project (the new mine) was completed and started up in the fourth quarter of
2003. The expansion project is expected to bring various units onstream during
2004, while the completion of a new coker to service the expanded project is
anticipated in the second half of 2005.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s regulations define this project
as mining-related and not part of conventional oil and gas operations. As
such, Syncrude operations are not included in our proved oil and gas reserves
or production as reported in the supplemental oil and gas information.

Surmont

The Surmont lease is located about 35 miles south of Fort McMurray, Alberta.
We own a 43.5 percent interest and are the operator. The project will use a
method called “steam assisted gravity drainage,” that involves the injection of
steam deep into the oil sands, effectively melting the bitumen, which is then
recovered and pumped to the surface for further processing. In May 2003, we
received regulatory approval to develop the oil sands from the Alberta Energy
and Utilities Board, and in late 2003 our Board of Directors approved the
project. Construction of the facilities is expected to begin in early 2004,
with first oil production scheduled for 2006.

E&P—SOUTH AMERICA

In 2003, E&P operations in South America were comprised of interests in
Venezuela, Ecuador and Brazil. South American operations contributed 8 percent
of our worldwide liquids production in 2003.

Venezuela

We operate and have an interest in two heavy-oil projects in Venezuela:
Petrozuata and Hamaca. We also have an interest in and operate in the Gulf of
Paria, which contains the Corocoro conventional oil and gas discovery as well
as exploration opportunities. In addition, we have an interest in Plataforma
Deltana Block 2, a large natural gas discovery.

In December of 2002, civil unrest in Venezuela caused economic and other
disruptions that shut down most oil and gas operations in Venezuela, including
the company’s Petrozuata and Hamaca operations. Production from these
operations resumed in the first quarter of 2003.



Petrozuata

Petrozuata is a Venezuelan Corporation formed under a 35-year Association
Agreement between a wholly owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips that has a 50.1
percent non-controlling equity interest and PDVSA Petroleo, a subsidiary of
Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), the national oil company of Venezuela.

The project is an integrated operation that produces extra-heavy crude oil from
reserves in the Zuata region of the Orinoco Oil Belt, transports it to the Jose
industrial complex on the north coast of Venezuela, and upgrades it into
medium-grade crude oil. Associated by-products produced are liquefied
petroleum gas, sulfur, petroleum coke and heavy gas oil. The medium-grade
crude oil produced by Petrozuata is used as a feedstock for our Lake Charles,
Louisiana, refinery and the Cardon refinery in Venezuela operated by PDVSA.
Our net production was 51,600 barrels of heavy crude oil per day in 2003, and
is included in equity affiliate production.

We entered into an agreement to purchase up to 104,000 barrels
per day of the Petrozuata upgraded crude oil for a market-based formula price
over the term of the joint venture in the event that Petrozuata is unable to
sell the production for higher prices. All upgraded crude oil sales are
denominated in U.S. dollars. By-products produced by the upgrading facility
are sold to a variety of domestic and foreign purchasers. The loading
facilities at Jose transfer crude oil and some of the by-products to ocean
vessels for export.

Hamaca

The Hamaca project also involves the development of heavy-oil reserves from the
Orinoco Oil Belt. ConocoPhillips owns a 40 percent interest in the Hamaca
project, which is operated by Petrolera Ameriven on behalf of the owners. The
other participants in Hamaca are PDVSA and ChevronTexaco Corporation. Our
interest is held through a joint limited liability company, Hamaca Holding LLC,
for which we use the equity method of accounting.

Net production averaged 22,100 barrels per day of heavy crude oil in 2003, and
is included in equity affiliate production. The joint-venture agreement has a
35-year term.

Construction of the heavy-oil upgrader, pipelines and associated production
facilities at the Jose industrial complex began in 2000. The upgrader is
expected to begin producing commercial quantities of medium-grade crude oil by
the end of 2004, at which time our net production from the Hamaca field is
expected to increase to approximately 71,000 barrels per day from proved
reserves.

Gulf of Paria

In 1999 the Corocoro discovery in the Gulf of Paria West Block was made and
later confirmed with appraisal drilling in 2001 and 2002. In 2003, Venezuelan
authorities approved Phase I of the development plan for the Corocoro field.
We operate the field with a 32.2 percent interest. In accordance with the
profit sharing agreement that governs the block, a subsidiary of PDVSA elected
to acquire a 35 percent interest in the development, lowering our interest from
50 percent to 32.5 percent. In September 2003, we acquired a 37.5 percent
interest in the adjoining Gulf of Paria East Block, onto which a portion of the
Corocoro discovery extends.

Plataforma Deltana Block 2

We acquired a 40 percent interest in Plataforma Deltana Block 2 in 2003. The
block is co-venturer-operated and holds a gas discovery made by PDVSA in 1983.
Appraisal wells are planned in 2004. Contingent on the results of the
appraisal wells, development of the field may include a well platform in
approximately 300 feet of water, a 170-mile pipeline to shore, and a liquefied
natural gas plant. The liquefied natural gas would be shipped to the U.S.
market.



Brazil

We have concession agreements on two deepwater exploration blocks (BM-ES-11 and
BM-PAMA-3) offshore Brazil. These blocks were acquired in Brazil’s third bid
round held in June 2001. We entered into joint ventures on both blocks in late
2002, reducing our interest to 70 percent in BM-ES-11 and 65 percent in
BM-PAMA-3. In 2003, further evaluation led to the write-off of our leasehold
investment in BM-ES-11, and we initiated the process to exit the block.
Further evaluation of BM-PAMA-3 is planned for 2004.

Ecuador

We sold our 14 percent, non-operator interest in Block 16 and the associated
fields on December 5, 2003, with an effective date of January 1, 2003. We have
no other assets in Ecuador, and have exited the country.

E&P—ASIA PACIFIC

In 2003, E&P operations in the Asia Pacific area contributed 6 percent of our
worldwide liquids production and 9 percent of our worldwide natural gas
production.

China

Our combined net production of crude oil from the Xijiang facilities averaged
10,900 barrels per day in 2003. The Xijiang development consists of three
fields located approximately 80 miles from Hong Kong in the South China Sea.
The facilities include two manned platforms and a floating production, storage
and offloading facility.

Production from Phase I development of the Peng Lai 19-3 field in Bohai Bay
Block 11-05 began in late December 2002. In 2003, the field produced 14,800
net barrels of oil per day. We have a 49 percent interest, with the remainder
held by the China National Offshore Oil Corporation. The Phase I development
utilizes one wellhead platform and a floating production, storage and
offloading facility.

We continue to move forward with the design for Phase II of the Peng Lai 19-3
development. Phase II would include multiple wellhead platforms, and a larger
floating production, storage and offloading facility. The Peng Lai 25-6 field,
discovered in 2000 and located three miles east of Peng Lai 19-3, will be
developed in conjunction with Phase II of the Peng Lai 19-3 development
project.

Exploration activity continued in 2003 in Block 11-05, with two successful
wells announced. The Peng Lai 19-9-1 well, located about two miles east of the
Peng Lai 19-3 field, discovered the Peng Lai 19-9 field that will be part of
the Phase II development. Drilling of the Peng Lai 13-1-1 well, located about
18 miles north of the Peng Lai 19-3 field, was completed in March 2003.

Indonesia

We operate nine Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) in Indonesia and have a
non-operator interest in four others. Our assets are concentrated in two core
areas: the West Natuna Sea and South Sumatra; with a potentially emerging area
offshore East Java. We are a party to five long-term U.S. dollar pipeline gas
contracts that have been signed in Indonesia. Production of natural gas from
Indonesia averaged a net 255 million cubic feet per day in 2003, while
production of crude oil averaged a net 16,000 barrels per day.



Offshore Assets

We operate three offshore PSCs: 1) South Natuna Sea Block B, 2) Nila, and 3)
Ketapang. We also hold a non-operator interest in the Pangkah PSC offshore
East Java. We participate in various natural gas marketing arrangements in
connection with these assets, including being a co-venturer in the West Natuna
Gas Supply Group (WNG). The WNG jointly markets natural gas from certain
fields in three South Natuna Sea PSCs to Singapore.

The Kakap PSC, adjacent to the South Natuna Sea Block B, was sold in September
2003. The property was selected for disposition because of its high operating
cost structure and limited further exploration potential. In addition, during
2003 we relinquished the Tobong PSC and sold the Sebuku PSC after concluding
that neither PSC had significant remaining exploration potential.

The South Natuna Sea Block B PSC has two currently producing mature oil fields
and 15 gas fields (some with recoverable oil volumes) in various phases of
development. The largest current development in Block B is the Belanak oil and
gas field, in which a floating production, storage and offloading vessel is
under construction. The vessel is expected to be completed, and oil production
to commence, in the first half of 2005. Two additional developments that would
produce into the Belanak infrastructure are scheduled for startup in 2006 and
2008.

We also have an active exploration program in both the Natuna Sea and East
Java. During 2003, two unsuccessful exploratory wells were drilled in the
Natuna Sea Nila Block. An additional well in the Nila Block is planned for
2004. During 2003, in the East Java offshore Ketapang Block, two appraisal
wells were drilled on the Bukit Tua oil field discovery, one of which was
successful, and one of which was unsuccessful. An additional appraisal well
and an exploration well are planned for 2004.

Onshore Assets

We operate six onshore PSCs: 1) Corridor TAC, 2) Corridor PSC, 3) South Jambi
‘B’, 4) Sakakemang JOB (jointly operated with a co-venturer), 5) Block A PSC in
Aceh, and 6) Warim. We also hold non-operator interests in the Banyumas PSC in
Java and the Bentu and Korinci-Baru PSCs in Sumatra. The Tungkal PSC was sold
in December 2003. As with our offshore properties, we participate in various
gas marketing arrangements in connection with these fields. Exploration
efforts focus on locating additional natural gas reserves.

We announced in March 2003 the successful test of the Suban-8 delineation well
on the southwest flank of the Suban gas field, located in the Corridor PSC of
South Sumatra. In December 2003, we began an exploratory well in the Corridor
Block to test a gas prospect located close to other producing fields. We
continue to appraise and develop the Suban gas field. In addition, we
completed the successful test of the North Sumpal-1 well in the Sakakemang
Block located in South Sumatra, and continued on the construction of the South
Jambi gas project in the South Jambi B Block also located in South Sumatra.

We are a 35 percent owner of TransAsia Pipeline Company Pvt. Ltd., a consortium
company, which has a 40 percent ownership in PT Transportasi Gas Indonesia, an
Indonesian limited liability company, which owns and operates the Grissik to
Duri gas pipeline.

Vietnam

We have a 23.25 percent interest in Block 15-1 in the Cuu Long Basin in the
South China Sea. In 2001, the co-venturers in Block 15-1 declared the
southwest portion of the Su Tu Den (Black Lion) field commercial after a
successful appraisal program. In addition, an appraisal well in the northeast
portion of Su Tu Den was successfully drilled in 2002. The Su Tu Den Phase I
development project was approved in December 2001. Production from Su Tu Den
Phase I began in the fourth quarter of 2003. The initial net



production rate was approximately 16,000 barrels of oil per day from seven
wells located in the Phase I area. The oil is being processed and stored in a
new floating production, storage and offloading vessel, which has a 1 million
barrel storage capacity and can initially process up to 65,000 gross barrels
per day.

An exploration discovery was also made on the nearby Su Tu Vang (Golden Lion)
prospect in the third quarter of 2001. The potential commerciality of Su Tu
Vang and the northeast portion of Su Tu Den are being evaluated. In addition,
in the fourth quarter of 2003, a successful exploration well was drilled in the
Su Tu Trang (White Lion) area (southeast area of the block).

We have a 36 percent interest in the Rang Dong field in Block 15-2 in the Cuu
Long Basin. In the third quarter of 2002, production began from two new
wellhead platforms in the Rang Dong field. During late 2003, field facilities
were upgraded to include a utilities/living quarters platform, and a central
processing platform with facilities to enable gas lift, gas export and water
injection. With the completion of these facilities, water injection became
possible on all three wellhead platforms and gas lift became possible on two of
the wellhead platforms. A successful appraisal step-out well, Rang Dong-12X,
was drilled in the central part of the field in late 2001, and a development
plan for this area of the field is being evaluated.

We also own interests in offshore Blocks 16-2, 5-3, 133 and 134, as well as a
16.33 percent interest in the Nam Con Son gas pipeline.

Timor Sea and Australia

Bayu-Undan

The unitized Bayu-Undan field, located in the Timor Sea, is being developed in
two phases. Phase I is a gas-recycle project, where condensate and natural gas
liquids will be separated and removed and the dry gas reinjected back into the
reservoir. This phase began production in February 2004, and is expected to
average a net rate of 23,000 barrels of liquids per day from proved reserves in
2004.

In June 2003, we announced that the Gas Development Plan for the field had
received approval from the Timor Sea Designated Authority. This final approval
allowed Phase II, the development of the natural gas reserves, to proceed.
Phase II will involve a natural gas pipeline from the field to Darwin, and a
liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility located at Wickham Point, Darwin. In
March 2002, we announced that we had signed a Heads of Agreement (LNG HOA) with
The Tokyo Electric Power Company, Incorporated (TEPCO) and Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd.
(Tokyo Gas). Under the LNG HOA, TEPCO and Tokyo Gas would purchase 3 million
tons per year in total of LNG for a period of 17 years, utilizing natural gas
from the Bayu-Undan field. The approval of the Gas Development Plan by the
Timor Sea Designated Authority satisfied the remaining condition precedent
necessary for the LNG HOA to have a binding effect and for the project to
proceed. As a result of project approvals, we added 1.36 trillion cubic feet
of net proved natural gas reserves in 2003. The first LNG cargo is scheduled
for delivery in early 2006. We have a 56.7 percent controlling interest in the
integrated project.

Greater Sunrise

We and our co-venturers continue to evaluate commercial development options and
LNG markets in the Asia Pacific region and the North American west coast for
the natural gas and condensate from the Greater Sunrise field. The development
options under consideration consist of an offshore floating LNG facility and an
onshore LNG facility located in Darwin, Australia. Efforts are under way to
market LNG into both the Asian and North American west coast markets. Further
engineering studies relating to design and development concepts also continue.
We have a 30 percent, non-operator interest in Greater Sunrise.



E&P—AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST

Nigeria

Our crude oil production from five leases in Nigeria averaged a net 36,900
barrels per day in 2003, while net natural gas production averaged 63 million
cubic feet per day. These five leases include four onshore Oil Mining Leases
(OML) and a shallow-water offshore OML. Continued development and exploratory
drilling is planned for 2004 on the onshore leases.

We also have production sharing contracts on deepwater Nigeria Oil Prospecting
Leases (OPLs), including OPL 318 with a 50 percent interest where we are the
operator, OPL 214 with a 20 percent interest and OPL 248 with a 40 percent
interest. We are planning to drill the first exploration well on OPL 248 in
2004.

We have a 20 percent interest in a 480-megawatt gas-fired power plant being
constructed to supply electricity to Nigeria’s national electricity supplier.
When operational, the plant will consume 68 million cubic feet per day of
natural gas sourced from within our Nigerian proved natural gas reserves. The
plant is expected to become operational in 2005.

In October 2003, ConocoPhillips, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation
(NNPC), Eni and ChevronTexaco signed a Heads of Agreement (HOA) to conduct
front-end engineering and design work for a new LNG facility that would be
constructed in Nigeria’s central Niger Delta. The co-venturers have agreed to
form an incorporated joint venture, to be known as “Brass LNG Limited” to
undertake the project. The front-end engineering and design work will be for
two trains, each nominally sized at 5 million metric tons per year. Natural
gas supplies for the facility would come from natural gas reserves within oil
and gas fields already operated by existing Nigerian Agip Oil Company and
ChevronTexaco joint ventures. The front-end studies are expected to be
completed in 2005, and the LNG facility is targeted to be operational in 2009.

Angola

We have a 20 percent interest in exploratory activity in deepwater Block 34,
offshore Angola. The first exploration well, completed in 2002, did not
encounter commercial quantities of hydrocarbons, which led to a substantial
financial impairment of our investment in the block. The second exploration
well, drilled in late 2003, was also unsuccessful, leading to a write-off of
our remaining investment in the block.

Cameroon

In December 2002, we announced a successful test of an exploratory well
offshore Cameroon. The well, located in exploration permit PH 77, offshore in
the Douala Basin, obtained a maximum flow rate of 3,000 barrels of oil per day
and 1.8 million cubic feet of natural gas per day during the test. Contractor
interests in the permit are held 50 percent by ConocoPhillips and 50 percent by
a subsidiary of Petronas Carigali (Petronas). We serve as the operator of the
consortium. We are currently analyzing well results, and developing plans to
evaluate the discovery and other identified exploration prospects.

Dubai

In Dubai, United Arab Emirates, we are using horizontal drilling techniques and
advanced reservoir drainage technology to enhance the efficiency of the
offshore production operations and improve recovery rates from four fields that
we operate.

Saudi Arabia

We had a 15 percent interest in Core Venture 1 and a 30 percent interest in
Core Venture 3 of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s natural gas initiative.
Agreement could not be reached during the negotiation of the implementation
agreement, leading to the termination of both projects.



E&P—RUSSIA AND CASPIAN SEA REGION

Russia

We have a 50 percent ownership interest in Polar Lights Company, a Russian
limited liability company established in January 1992 to develop the Ardalin
field in the Timan-Pechora basin in Northern Russia. We account for our
interest using the equity method. Polar Lights started producing oil in August
1994 from the Ardalin field. In June 2002, production commenced from the
Oshkotyn field, the first of three satellite fields under development. In
2003, production began from the other two satellite fields: East Kolva and
Dyusushev.

Our net production from Polar Lights averaged 13,600 barrels of petroleum
liquids per day in 2003, and is included in equity affiliate production.

Caspian Sea

In the North Caspian Sea, we have an 8.33 percent interest in the Republic of
Kazakhstan’s North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement (NCPSA), which
includes the Kashagan field. During 2003, we, along with four of the remaining
five co-venturers, exercised our pre-emptive rights to acquire a proportionate
share of BG International’s sale of their 16.67 percent interest in the
project. Upon Republic of Kazakhstan approval of the transaction, our interest
in the NCPSA will increase to 10.19 percent.

The exploration area consists of 10.5 blocks, totaling nearly 2,000 square
miles. The initial production phase of the contract is for 20 years, with
options to extend the agreement an additional 20 years. In June 2002, we and
the other contracting companies, in conjunction with KazMunayGas, which
represents the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan, declared the Kashagan
discovery commercial. In February 2004, the Kashagan Development
Plan was approved by the Republic of Kazakhstan.

The contracting companies plan to continue to explore other structures within
the North Caspian Sea license. In October 2002, we and our co-venturers
announced a new hydrocarbon discovery on the Kalamkas More prospect located
approximately 40 miles southwest of the Kashagan field. Exploratory drilling
continued in 2003 with three additional wells drilled. The Aktote #1 and the
Kashagan Southwest #1 were announced as discoveries in November 2003.
Operations on the Kairan #1 well were suspended for the winter period and will
resume in the spring of 2004.

In the South Caspian Sea offshore Azerbaijan, we have a 20 percent interest in
the Zafar Mashal prospect. The first exploratory well began in late 2003 and
is planned for completion in 2004.

E&P—OTHER

In July 2003, we signed a Heads of Agreement with Qatar Petroleum for the
development of Qatargas 3, a large-scale liquefied natural gas (LNG) project
located in Qatar and servicing the U.S. natural gas markets. The agreement
provided the framework for the necessary project agreements and the completion
of feasibility studies. Qatargas 3 is planned as an integrated project,
jointly owned by ConocoPhillips (30 percent) and Qatar Petroleum. It would
consist of the facilities to produce gas from Qatar’s offshore North Field,
yielding approximately 7.5 million gross tons per year of LNG from a new
facility located in Ras Laffan Industrial City. The LNG would be shipped from
Qatar to the United States in a fleet of new LNG carriers. We would purchase
the LNG and be responsible for regasification and marketing within the United
States. The project could result in sales of natural gas up to 1 billion cubic
feet per day. Startup of the Qatargas 3 project is estimated to be in the 2009
timeframe.



In December 2003, we signed a Statement of Intent with Qatar Petroleum
regarding the construction of a gas-to-liquids (GTL) plant in Ras Laffan,
Qatar. The agreement initiates the detailed technical and commercial
pre-front-end engineering and design studies and established principles for
negotiating a Heads of Agreement for an integrated reservoir-to-market GTL
project.

In late 2003, we signed an agreement with Freeport LNG Development, L.P. to
participate in its proposed LNG receiving terminal in Quintana, Texas. This
agreement gives us 1 billion cubic feet per day of regasification capacity in
the terminal and a 50 percent interest in the general partnership managing the
venture. The terminal will be designed with a storage capacity of 6.9 billion
cubic feet and a send-out capacity of 1.5 billion cubic feet per day. Pending
government approvals, construction is scheduled to begin in the second half of
2004, with commercial startup in mid-2007.

We are continuing with plans to develop a project to build a liquefied natural
gas import terminal in northern Baja California to provide access to gas
markets in that region. Although we wrote-off our investment in the proposed
Rosarito LNG terminal, we continue working with federal, state, and local
officials in Mexico to evaluate various other alternatives, which includes
offshore options.

E&P—RESERVES

The company has not filed any information with any other federal authority or
agency with respect to its estimated total proved reserves at December 31,
2003. No difference exists between the company’s estimated total proved
reserves for year-end 2002 and year-end 2001, which are shown in this filing,
and estimates of these reserves shown in a filing with another federal agency
in 2003.

DELIVERY COMMITMENTS

The Commercial organization optimizes the commodity flows of our E&P segment.
This group markets our crude oil and natural gas production, with commodity
buyers, traders and marketers in offices in Houston, London, Singapore and
Calgary.

We sell crude oil and natural gas from our E&P producing operations under a
variety of contractual arrangements, some of which specify the delivery of a
fixed and determinable quantity. Our Commercial organization also enters into
natural gas sales contracts where the source of the natural gas used to fulfill
the contract can be the spot market, or a combination of our reserves and the
spot market. Worldwide, we are contractually committed to deliver
approximately 4.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 270 million barrels of
crude oil in the future, including the minority interests of consolidated
subsidiaries. These contracts have various expiration dates through the year
2025. The crude oil commitment and approximately 4.3 trillion cubic feet of
the natural gas commitment are expected to come from proved reserves in the
United States, the Timor Sea, Nigeria, and the United Kingdom. The remainder
of the natural gas commitment will be purchased in the spot market.

MIDSTREAM

Our Midstream business is conducted through owned and operated assets as well
as through our 30.3 percent equity investment in Duke Energy Field Services,
LLC (DEFS). The Midstream businesses purchase raw natural gas from producers
and gather natural gas through extensive pipeline gathering systems. The
gathered natural gas is then processed to extract natural gas liquids from the
raw gas stream. The remaining



“residue” gas is marketed to electrical utilities, industrial users, and gas
marketing companies. Most of the natural gas liquids are
fractionated-separated into individual components like ethane, butane and
propane—and marketed as chemical feedstock, fuel, or blendstock. Total natural
gas liquids extracted in 2003, including our share of DEFS, was 219,000 barrels
per day, with 167,000 barrels per day of natural gas liquids fractionated.

DEFS markets a substantial portion of its natural gas liquids to ConocoPhillips
and Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (a joint venture between
ConocoPhillips and ChevronTexaco) under a supply agreement that continues until
December 31, 2014. This purchase commitment is on an “if-produced,
will-purchase” basis and so it has no fixed production schedule, but has had,
and is expected over the remaining term of the contract to have, a relatively
stable purchase pattern. Under this agreement, natural gas liquids are
purchased at various published market index prices, less transportation and
fractionation fees. DEFS also purchases raw natural gas from our E&P
operations in the United States.

DEFS is headquartered in Denver, Colorado. At December 31, 2003, DEFS owned
and operated 56 natural gas liquids extraction plants, and owned an equity
interest in another 10. Also at year end, DEFS’ gathering and transmission
systems included approximately 58,000 miles of pipeline. In 2003, DEFS’ raw
natural gas throughput averaged 6.7 billion cubic feet per day, and natural gas
liquids extraction averaged 365,000 barrels per day. DEFS’ assets are
primarily located in the Gulf Coast area, West Texas, Oklahoma, the Texas
Panhandle, the Rocky Mountain area, and western Canada.

Outside of DEFS, our U.S. Midstream assets are located primarily in New Mexico,
Texas and Louisiana. At December 31, 2003, these assets included seven fully
owned and operated natural gas liquids extraction plants, plus two additional
plants that we operate and in which we own a 95 percent and a 50 percent
interest. These nine plants have a combined natural gas net plant inlet
capacity of 762 million cubic feet per day. One of the plants in Louisiana
also includes a 10,500 barrel-per-day liquids fractionator. We also have minor
interests in two other natural gas liquids extraction plants, and we own
underground natural gas liquids storage facilities in Texas and Louisiana.

We own a 25,000 barrel-per-day capacity liquids fractionation plant in Gallup,
New Mexico; a 22.5 percent equity interest in Gulf Coast Fractionators, which
owns a natural gas liquids fractionating plant in Mt. Belvieu, Texas (with our
net share of capacity at 25,000 barrels per day); and a 40 percent interest in
a fractionation plant in Conway, Kansas (with our share of capacity at 42,000
barrels per day). We own a 700-mile intrastate natural gas and liquids
pipeline system in Louisiana and gas gathering and natural gas liquids
pipelines in several states.

Our Canadian natural gas liquids business includes the following assets:

•

A 92 percent operating interest in the 2.4
billion-cubic-feet-per-day Empress natural gas processing and
fractionation facilities near Medicine Hat, Alberta, with natural gas
liquids production capacity of 50,000 barrels per day;

•

A 580-mile Petroleum Transmission Company pipeline from Empress to
Winnipeg and six related pipeline terminals;

•

Two underground natural gas liquids storage facilities, comprised
of the Richardson caverns with a one million barrel capacity and the
Dewdney caverns with a three million barrel capacity along with 0.6
billion cubic feet of natural gas storage capacity; and

•

A 10 percent interest in the 1,902-mile Cochin liquefied petroleum
gas pipeline, originating in Edmonton, Alberta, and ending in Sarnia,
Ontario, and a terminal storage system that transports propane, ethane
and ethylene.



Canadian natural gas liquids extracted averaged 45,000 barrels per day in 2003.

We also own a 39 percent equity interest in Phoenix Park Gas Processors
Limited, a joint venture with the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago
Limited, which processes gas in Trinidad and markets natural gas liquids
throughout the Caribbean and into the U.S. Gulf Coast. Phoenix Park’s
facilities include a gas processing plant and a natural gas liquids
fractionator. Our share of natural gas liquids extracted averaged 11,100
barrels per day in 2003.

In early 2004, we approved
the disposal of some of our non-DEFS Midstream assets located in the
Lower 48 states that are not associated with our E&P operations.

REFINING AND MARKETING (R&M)

R&M operations encompass refining crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum
products (such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels), buying, selling
and transporting crude oil, and buying, transporting, distributing and
marketing petroleum products. R&M has operations in the United States, Europe
and Asia Pacific.

The Commercial organization optimizes the commodity flows of our R&M segment.
This organization selects and procures feedstocks for R&M’s refineries.
Commercial also supplies the gas and power needs of the R&M facilities.
Commercial has buyers, traders and marketers in offices in Houston, London,
Singapore and Calgary.

As a condition to the merger, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) required
that we divest specified Conoco and Phillips assets, the most significant of
which were Phillips’ Woods Cross, Utah, refinery and associated motor fuel
marketing operations; Conoco’s Commerce City, Colorado, refinery and related
crude oil pipelines; and Phillips’ Colorado motor fuel marketing operations.
All FTC-mandated dispositions were completed in late-2002 or during 2003.

In addition, in December 2002, we committed to and initiated a plan to sell
approximately 3,200 marketing sites that did not fit into our long-range plans.
In the third quarter of 2003, we concluded the sale of all of the
Exxon-branded marketing assets in New York and New England, including contracts
with independent dealers and marketers. Approximately 230 of the 3,200 sites
were included in this package. In the fourth quarter of 2003, we concluded the
sale of our Circle K subsidiary, representing approximately 1,660 sites, as
well as the assignment of the franchise relationship with more than 350
franchised and licensed stores. Other, smaller dispositions also occurred
during 2003. In January 2004, we signed agreements to sell our Mobil-branded
marketing assets on the East Coast in two separate transactions. Assets in the
packages include 104 company-owned and operated sites, and 352 dealer sites.
Each of the transactions is expected to close in the second quarter of 2004.
Discussions are under way with potential buyers for the remaining sites, and we
expect to complete the sales of these assets during 2004.

Both the FTC-required dispositions and the retail site dispositions were
classified as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes, and are
included in Corporate and Other. Accordingly, they are excluded from the
descriptions of R&M’s continuing operations contained in this section. See
Note 4—Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, for additional information.

Marketing

In the United States, we market gasoline, diesel fuel, and aviation fuel
through approximately 14,300 outlets in 44 states. The majority of these sites
utilize the Conoco, Phillips 66 or 76 brands.

Wholesale

In our wholesale operations, we utilize a network of marketers and dealers
operating approximately 13,300 outlets. We place a strong emphasis on the
wholesale channel of trade because of its lower capital requirements and higher
return on capital. Our refineries and transportation systems provide strategic
support to these operations. We also buy and sell petroleum products in spot
markets. Our refined products are marketed on both a branded and unbranded
basis.

In addition to automotive gasoline and diesel fuel, we produce and market
aviation gasoline, which is used by smaller, piston-engine aircraft. Aviation
gasoline and jet fuel are sold through independent marketers at approximately
570 Phillips 66 branded locations in the United States.

Retail

In our retail operations, we own and operate approximately 330 sites under the
Phillips 66, Conoco and 76 brands. Company-operated retail operations are
focused in 10 states, mainly in the Midcontinent, Rocky Mountains, and West
Coast regions. Most of these outlets market merchandise through the Kicks 66,
Breakplace, or Circle K brand convenience stores.

At December 31, 2003, CFJ Properties, our 50/50 joint venture with Flying J,
owned and operated 97 truck travel plazas that carry the Conoco and/or Flying J
brands. The merger of Conoco and Phillips triggered change of control
provisions in the joint venture agreement, giving Flying J the option to
purchase our interest in CFJ Properties at fair value. A third party is
determining the fair value of the joint venture. Once that binding appraised
value is determined, Flying J will have 30 days to exercise their purchase
option. Assuming Flying J does not exercise its purchase option, we plan to
continue as a co-venturer in CFJ Properties.

Transportation

Pipelines and Terminals

At December 31, 2003, we had approximately 32,800 miles of common-carrier crude
oil, raw natural gas liquids and products pipeline systems in the United
States, including those partially owned and/or operated by affiliates. We also
owned and/or operated 76 finished product terminals, eight liquefied petroleum

CHEMICALS

On July 1, 2000, ConocoPhillips and ChevronTexaco combined their worldwide
chemicals businesses, excluding ChevronTexaco’s Oronite business, into a new
company, Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem). In addition to
contributing the assets and operations included in our Chemicals segment, we
also contributed the natural gas liquids business associated with our Sweeny,
Texas, complex. ConocoPhillips and ChevronTexaco each own 50 percent of CPChem.
We use the equity method of accounting for our investment in CPChem.

CPChem, headquartered in The Woodlands, Texas, has 32 production facilities and
six research and technology centers. CPChem uses natural gas liquids and other
feedstocks to produce petrochemicals such as ethylene, propylene, styrene,
benzene and paraxylene. These products are then marketed and sold, or used as
feedstocks to produce plastics and commodity chemicals, such as polyethylene,
polystyrene, and cyclohexane.



CPChem’s domestic production facilities are located at Baytown, Borger, Conroe,
La Porte, Orange, Pasadena, Port Arthur and Old Ocean, Texas; St. James,
Louisiana; Pascagoula, Mississippi; Marietta, Ohio; and Guayama, Puerto Rico.
CPChem also has nine plastic pipe plants and one pipe fittings plant in eight
states.

Major international production facilities are located in Belgium, China, Saudi
Arabia, Singapore, South Korea and Qatar. There is one plastic pipe plant in
Mexico.

CPChem has research facilities in Oklahoma, Ohio and Texas, as well as in
Singapore and Belgium.

Construction of a major olefins and polyolefins complex in Mesaieed, Qatar,
named Q-Chem I, was completed in 2003. The facility, which is operating and in
the final stages of performance testing, has an annual capacity of
approximately 1.1 billion pounds of ethylene, 1 billion pounds of polyethylene
and 100 million pounds of 1-hexene. CPChem has a 49 percent interest, with a
Qatar state firm owning the remaining 51 percent interest.

CPChem has also signed an agreement for the development of a second complex to
be built in Mesaieed, Qatar, named Q-Chem II. The facility will be designed to
produce polyethylene and normal alpha olefins, on a site adjacent to the
newly-constructed Q-Chem I complex. CPChem and Qatar Petroleum, through the
Q-Chem II joint venture, entered into a separate agreement with Atofina and
Qatar Petrochemical Company to jointly develop an ethane cracker in northern
Qatar at Ras Laffan Industrial City. Final approval of the Q-Chem II projects
by CPChem’s Board of Directors is expected to be requested in 2005, with
startup expected in 2008.

CPChem announced plans in 2002 for a 50 percent-owned joint venture project in
Al Jubail, Saudi Arabia. The project includes the construction of an integrated
olefins, ethyl benzene and styrene monomer facility on a site adjacent to the
existing aromatics complex owned by Saudi Chevron Phillips Company, a 50
percent-owned CPChem joint venture. The project also includes the expansion of
Saudi Chevron Phillips Company’s benzene facility. This additional benzene
capacity will be used to provide feedstock for the new facility. Final
approval of the project by CPChem’s Board of Directors is expected to be
requested in 2004, with operational startup expected in 2007.

EMERGING BUSINESSES

Emerging Businesses encompass
the development of new businesses beyond our traditional operations. As a result of market, operating and
technological uncertainties, we terminated our carbon fibers project during
2003.

GAS-TO-LIQUIDS (GTL)

The GTL process refines natural gas into a wide range of transportable
products. Our GTL research facility is located in Ponca City, Oklahoma, and
includes laboratories, pilot plants, and a demonstration plant to facilitate
technology advancements. The 400 barrel-per-day demonstration plant, designed
to produce clean fuels from natural gas, was completed in April 2003. The
plant has been commissioned and operations started, with thorough testing
scheduled throughout 2004.

TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS

Our Technology Solutions businesses provide technologies and services that can
be used in our operations or licensed to third parties. Downstream, major
product lines include sulfur removal technologies (S Zorb), alkylation
technologies (ReVAP), and delayed coking technologies. For upstream and
downstream, Technology Solutions offers analytical services, pilot plant, and
industrial hygiene services.

POWER GENERATION

The focus of our power business is on developing integrated projects in support
of the company’s E&P and R&M strategies and business objectives. The projects
that enable these strategies are included within the respective E&P and R&M
segments. The projects and assets that have a significant merchant component
are included in the Emerging Businesses segment.

The power business is developing a 730-megawatt gas-fired combined heat and
power plant in North Lincolnshire, United Kingdom. The facility will provide
steam and electricity to the Humber refinery and steam to a neighboring
refinery, as well as market power into the U.K. market. Construction began in
2002, with commercial operation anticipated in 2004.

We also own or have an interest in gas-fired cogeneration plants in Orange and
Corpus Christi, Texas, and a petroleum coke-fired plant in Lake Charles,
Louisiana.

EMERGING TECHNOLOGY

Emerging Technology focuses on developing new business opportunities designed
to provide growth options for ConocoPhillips well into the future. Example
areas of interest include renewable energy, advanced hydrocarbon processes,
energy conversion technologies and new petroleum-based products.

COMPETITION

We compete with private, public and state-owned companies in all facets of the
petroleum and chemicals businesses. Some of our competitors are larger and
have greater resources. Each of the segments in which we operate is highly
competitive. No single competitor, or small group of competitors, dominates
any of our business lines.



Upstream, our E&P segment competes with numerous other companies in the
industry to locate and obtain new sources of supply, and to produce oil and
natural gas in an efficient, cost-effective manner. Based on reserves
statistics published in the September 15, 2003, issue of the

Oil and Gas
Journal

, we had the eighth-largest total of worldwide reserves of
non-government-controlled companies. We deliver our oil and natural gas
production into the worldwide oil and natural gas commodity markets. The
principal methods of competing include geological, geophysical and engineering
research and technology; experience and expertise; and economic analysis in
connection with property acquisitions.

The Midstream segment, through our equity investment in DEFS and our
consolidated operations, competes with numerous other integrated petroleum
companies, as well as natural gas transmission and distribution companies, to
deliver the components of natural gas to end users in the commodity natural gas
markets. DEFS is one of the largest producers of natural gas liquids in the
United States, based on the November 17, 2003,

Gas Processors Report

. DEFS’
principle methods of competing include economically securing the right to
purchase raw natural gas into its gathering systems, managing the pressure of
those systems, operating efficient natural gas liquids processing plants, and
securing markets for the products produced.

Downstream, our R&M segment competes primarily in the United States, Europe and
the Asia Pacific region. Based on the statistics published in the December 22,
2003, issue of the

Oil and Gas Journal

, we had the largest U.S. refining
capacity of about 15 large refiners of petroleum products. Worldwide, we
ranked fourth among non-government-controlled companies. In the Chemicals
segment, through our equity investment, CPChem generally ranks within the top
10 producers of its major product lines, based on average 2003 production
capacity, as published by Chemical Market Associates Inc. Petroleum products,
petrochemicals and plastics are delivered into the worldwide commodity markets.
Elements of downstream competition include product improvement, new product
development, low-cost structures, and manufacturing and distribution systems.
In the marketing portion of the business, competitive factors include product
properties and processibility, reliability of supply, customer service, price
and credit terms, advertising and sales promotion, and development of customer
loyalty to ConocoPhillips’ or CPChem’s branded products.

GENERAL

At the end of 2003, we held a total of 1,918 active patents in 68 countries
worldwide, including 733 active U.S. patents. During 2003, we received 57
patents in the United States and 136 foreign patents. Our products and
processes generated licensing revenues of $35 million in 2003. The overall
profitability of any business segment is not dependent on any single patent,
trademark, license, franchise or concession.

Company-sponsored research and development activities charged against earnings
were $136 million, $355 million and $44 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

The environmental information contained in Management’s Discussion and Analysis
on pages 72 through 75 under the caption, “Environmental” is incorporated
herein by reference. It includes information on expensed and capitalized
environmental costs for 2003 and those expected for 2004 and 2005.

Like all major international oil companies, we have for many years operated in
countries that are subject to U.S. government restrictions or prohibitions on
business activities by U.S. companies. In some cases, business is permitted if
we have received a license from the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).
The regulations implementing the restrictions are complicated and subject to
interpretation by OFAC. We have programs designed to ensure compliance with
the restrictions and believe that our present operations comply with applicable
laws and regulations.



In view of recent political, diplomatic and military developments in the Middle
East, and throughout the world, we have reexamined our policies and procedures
in order to prevent any actions that would violate the letter, or even the
spirit of the restrictions. These developments may affect prices, production
levels, allocation and distribution of raw materials and products, including
their import, export and ownership; the amount of tax and timing of payment;
and the cost of compliance with environmental regulations.

Following the events of September 11, 2001, a number of institutional investors
and state governmental agencies have questioned the appropriateness of U.S.
companies transacting business in or with any country that has reportedly been
linked to terrorism, even if the country is not subject to legal restrictions.
We have reexamined our policies and business ventures to ensure that our
activities in or with certain countries are consistent with the U.S.
government’s policy, interests and objectives in such countries.

Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The following is a description of reportable legal proceedings including those
involving governmental authorities under federal, state and local laws
regulating the discharge of materials into the environment for this reporting
period. The following proceedings include those matters that arose during the
fourth quarter of 2003 and those matters previously reported in ConocoPhillips’
2002 Form 10-K and our first-, second- and third-quarter 2003 Forms 10-Q that
have not been resolved. While it is not possible to accurately predict the
final outcome of these pending proceedings, if any one or more of such
proceeding was decided adversely to ConocoPhillips, there would be no material
effect on our consolidated financial position. Nevertheless, such proceedings
are reported pursuant to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s
regulations.

In December 2003, we entered into an Administrative Consent Order and Notice of
Noncompliance with the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection for
alleged violations of State II and Hazardous Waste requirements at various
retail gasoline outlets formerly owned by us. This Consent Agreement provides
for the payment of a civil administrative penalty in the amount of $106,250.

In November 2003, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued us a
notice of violation for alleged violations of the gasoline Reid Vapor Pressure
rules in 1999, 2000 and 2001 at our Wood River and Billings refineries. The
notice of violation seeks a proposed penalty of $127,000. We are currently
working with EPA toward a negotiated resolution of this matter.

On September 17, 2003, U.S. EPA Region 10 notified ConocoPhillips of its intent
to assess civil penalties for alleged National Pollution Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permit violations at our Tyonek offshore platform located near
Cook Inlet, Alaska. The alleged violations arise from our July 2003 NPDES
self-disclosure report to EPA Region 10. On February 10, 2004, EPA Region 10
issued to us a proposed Complaint for Civil Penalties and a proposed Consent
Decree for the alleged permit violations. The proposed consent decree provides
for the payment of a $450,000 civil penalty. We are currently working with the
EPA and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) on the terms of the agreements and
expect the matter to be finalized by the end of the second quarter of 2004.

On August 24, 2003, the Contra Costa County District Attorney’s Office in
California issued a demand letter to ConocoPhillips seeking civil penalties in
the amount of $524,000 for 31 alleged violations of the Bay Area Air Quality
Management District regulations at our Rodeo facility of the San Francisco area
refinery. The demand has been reduced to $361,000. These alleged violations
cover the period from mid-2001 through August 2003. We are currently working
with the Contra Costa County District Attorney’s Office toward a negotiated
resolution of this matter.

In August of 2003, EPA Region 6 issued a Show Cause Order alleging violations
of the Clean Water Act at the Borger refinery. The alleged violations relate
primarily to discharges of selenium and reported exceedances of permit limits
for whole effluent toxicity. We met with EPA staff on October 29, 2003, to
discuss the allegations. We believe the EPA staff is evaluating the
information presented at the meeting. The EPA has not yet proposed a penalty
amount.

On December 31, 2002, we received a Revised Proposed Agreed Order, which
amended the June 24, 2002, Proposed Agreed Order, from the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality (TCEQ), proposing a penalty of $458,163 in connection
with alleged air emission violations at our Borger refinery as a result
of an inspection conducted by the TCEQ in October 2000. On March 19, 2003, the
TCEQ issued a recalculation of the proposed penalty in the amount of $467,834.
We are currently working with TCEQ toward a negotiated resolution of this
matter.



On December 17, 2002, the DOJ notified ConocoPhillips of various alleged
violations of the NPDES permit for the Sweeny refinery. DOJ asserts that these
alleged violations occurred at various times during the period beginning
January 1997 through July 2002. We have reached a tentative agreement with the
DOJ that will require us to pay a civil penalty and/or perform certain work
valued at $700,000.

In December 2002, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ)
notified ConocoPhillips of its intent to assess civil penalties for over 120
alleged regulatory violations at various Circle K stores in the Baton Rouge,
Louisiana area. On October 6, 2003, the LDEQ notified ConocoPhillips that the
civil penalty assessment for these alleged violations is $189,659. This matter
was settled in November 2003.

On November 14, 2002, the TCEQ issued a proposed agreed Findings Order to
resolve alleged water discharge violations of the Texas Water Code and
Commission Rules at the Sweeny refinery for the period beginning March 2000
through July 2002. The proposed order assesses a penalty in the amount of
$488,125. We have agreed with the TCEQ to settlement terms that are expected
to be finalized during the first quarter of 2004.

On July 15, 2002, the United States filed a Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) cost recovery action against
ConocoPhillips alleging that the United States has incurred unreimbursed
oversight costs at the Lowry Superfund Site located in Arapahoe County,
Colorado. The United States seeks recovery of approximately $12.3 million in
past oversight costs and a declaratory judgment for future CERCLA response cost
liability. Pursuant to the terms of a prior settlement agreement between us,
Waste Management, Inc. and others, Waste Management has assumed our defense for
this matter and it is our position that Waste Management should indemnify us
for any liability arising from this action.

We have responded to information requests from EPA regarding New Source Review
compliance at our Alliance, Bayway, Borger, Ferndale, Los Angeles, Sweeny,
Trainer, and Wood River refineries; and the Rodeo and Santa Maria units of our
San Francisco refinery. Although we have not been notified of any formal
findings or violations arising from these information requests, we have been
informed that the EPA is contemplating the filing of a civil proceeding against
us for alleged violations of the Clean Air Act. We are currently seeking a
negotiated resolution of these matters, which will likely result in increased
environmental capital expenditures and governmental monetary sanctions.

All significant litigation
arising from the March 27, 2000, explosion and fire
that occurred in an out-of-service butadiene storage tank at the K-Resin

®

styrene-butadiene copolymer plant has now been resolved.

In June of 1997, we experienced pipeline spills on our Seminole pipeline at
Banner, Wyoming, and Lodge Grass, Montana. In response to these spills, the
DOJ advised us in August 2000 that the United States is contemplating a legal
proceeding under the Clean Water Act against us. We and DOJ have reached a
tentative agreement that will require us to pay a $465,000 civil penalty.

Additionally, we are subject to various lawsuits and claims including, but not
limited to: actions challenging oil and gas royalty and severance tax payments;
actions related to gas measurement and valuation methods; actions related to
joint interest billings to operating agreement partners; and claims for damages
resulting from leaking underground storage tanks or other accidental releases,
with related toxic tort claims. As a result of Conoco’s separation agreement
with DuPont in October 1998, we also have assumed responsibility for current
and future claims related to certain discontinued chemicals and agricultural
chemicals businesses operated by Conoco in the past. In general, the effect on
future financial results is not subject to reasonable estimation because
considerable uncertainty exists. The ultimate liabilities resulting from such
lawsuits and claims may be material to results of operations in the period in
which they are recognized.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Merger of Conoco and Phillips

On August 30, 2002, Conoco Inc. (Conoco) and Phillips Petroleum Company
(Phillips) combined their businesses by merging with wholly owned subsidiaries
of a new company named ConocoPhillips (the merger). The merger was accounted
for using the purchase method of accounting, with Phillips designated as the
acquirer for accounting purposes. Because Phillips was designated as the
acquirer, its operations and results are presented in this annual report for
all periods prior to the close of the merger. From the merger date forward,
the operations and results of ConocoPhillips reflect the combined operations of
the two companies.

Business Environment and Executive Summary

Our overall earnings depend primarily upon the profitability of our Exploration
and Production (E&P) and Refining and Marketing (R&M) segments. Our earnings
normally are less impacted by results from the Midstream, Chemicals and
Emerging Businesses segments.

Crude oil and natural gas prices, along with refining margins, play the most
significant roles in our profitability. These prices and margins are driven by
market factors over which we have no control. However, from a competitive
perspective, there are other important factors that we must manage well to be
successful, including:

•

Operating our producing properties and refining and marketing
operations safely, consistently and in an environmentally sound manner.

Safety is our first priority and we are committed to protecting the
health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations.
Consistently high utilization rates at our refineries, minimizing
downtime in producing fields, and maximizing the development of our
reserves all enable us to capture the value the market gives us in
terms of prices and margins. Finally, our operations are conducted in
a manner that emphasizes our environmental stewardship.



•

Controlling costs and expenses.

Since we cannot control the prices of
the commodity products we sell, keeping our operating and overhead costs
low, within the context of our commitment to safety and environmental
stewardship, is a top priority. We monitor these costs using various
methodologies that are reported to senior management monthly, on both an
absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit basis. Low operating and overhead
costs are critical to maintaining competitive positions in our
industries, as such, cost control is a component of our variable
compensation programs.

•

Selecting the appropriate projects in which to invest our capital
dollars.

We participate in capital-intensive industries. As a result,
we must often invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil
and gas fields, develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing
fields, or continue to maintain and improve our refinery complexes. We
invest in those projects that are expected to provide an adequate
financial return on invested dollars. However, there are often long
lead times from the time we make an investment to the time that
investment is operational and begins generating financial returns. Our
capital spending in 2003 totaled $6.2 billion, and we anticipate
capital spending to be approximately $6.9 billion in 2004.

•

Evaluating our asset portfolio.

We continue to evaluate
opportunities to acquire assets that will contribute to future growth
at competitive prices. We also continually assess our assets to
determine if any no longer fit our growth strategy and should be sold
or otherwise disposed. This management of our asset portfolio is
important to ensuring our long-term growth and maintaining adequate
financial returns.

•

Hiring, developing and retaining a talented workforce.

We want to
attract, train, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and
skills to implement our business strategy and who support our values
and ethics.

Many of our key performance indicators are shown in the statistical tables
provided at the beginning of our operating segment sections that follow. These
include crude oil and natural gas prices and production, natural gas liquids
prices, refining capacity utilization, and refinery output. We also use the
“return on capital employed” measure.

Other significant factors that can and/or do affect our profitability include:

•

Property and leasehold impairments.

As mentioned above, we
participate in capital intensive industries. At times, these
investments become impaired when our reserve estimates are revised
downward, when crude oil or natural gas prices decline significantly
for long periods of time, or when a decision to dispose of an asset
leads to a write-down to fair market value. Also, at times we invest
large amounts of money in exploration blocks which, if exploratory
drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to material impairment of
leasehold values.

•

Goodwill.

As a result of recent mergers and acquisitions, we have
a significant amount of goodwill on our balance sheet. Although our
latest tests indicate that no goodwill impairment is currently
required, future deterioration in market conditions could lead to
goodwill impairments that would have a substantial negative affect on
the company’s profitability.

•

Tax jurisdictions.

As a global company, our operations are located
in countries with different tax rates and fiscal structures.
Accordingly, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly
between periods based on the “mix” of earnings within our global
operations.



Segment Analysis

The E&P segment’s results are most closely linked to crude oil and natural gas
prices. These are commodity products, the prices of which are subject to
factors external to our company and over which we have no control. We
benefited from favorable crude oil prices in 2003, which contributed
significantly to what we view as strong results from this segment in 2003. For
a discussion of factors impacting crude oil and natural gas prices in 2003, as
well as our view of the potential movement of these prices into 2004, see the
“Outlook” section. At year-end 2003, we estimated that a $1 per barrel change
in crude oil prices would have an estimated $170 million annual impact on net
income. For natural gas, the corresponding impact is approximately $40 million
for a 10 cent per thousand cubic feet price change.

The Midstream segment’s results are most closely linked to natural gas liquids
prices. The most important factor on the profitability of this segment is the
results from our 30.3 percent equity investment in Duke Energy Field Services,
LLC (DEFS). Higher natural gas liquids prices improved results from this
segment in 2003. In early 2004, we approved the disposal of some of our non-DEFS Midstream assets
located in the Lower 48 states that are not associated with our E&P operations.

Refining margins, refinery utilization, cost control, and marketing margins
primarily drive the R&M segment’s results. Refining margins are subject to
movements in the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks, and the sales prices
for refined products, which are subject to market factors over which we have no
control. Refining margins in 2003 were much improved over 2002, resulting in
improved R&M profitability. See the “Outlook” section for further discussion
of refining margins in 2003 and our view of their potential movement into 2004.
At year-end 2003, we estimated that a 25 cent per barrel change in refining
margins would have an estimated $125 million annual impact on net income. For
wholesale marketing margins, the corresponding impact is approximately $100
million for a 1 cent per gallon margin change. Our refineries operated at 94
percent of rated capacity in 2003, and our goal in 2004 is to operate at about
the same level.

The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in Chevron Phillips
Chemical Company LLC (CPChem). The chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a
commodity-based industry where the margins for key products are based on market
factors over which CPChem has little or no control. The chemicals and plastics
industry has been in a cyclical downturn for the last several years. In this
difficult market environment, CPChem has placed great emphasis on safety, cost
control and managing its capacity utilization. In addition, CPChem is
investing in feedstock-advantaged areas in the Middle East with access to
large, growing markets, such as Asia. With its low cost structure, we feel
CPChem is well positioned to benefit from improved margins when the chemicals
industry emerges from its downturn.

The Emerging Businesses segment represents our investment in new technologies
or businesses outside our normal scope of operations. We do not expect the
results from this segment to be material to our consolidated results. However,
the businesses in this segment allow us to support our primary segments by
staying current on new technologies that could become important drivers of
profitability in future years.

At December 31, 2003, we had a debt-to-capital ratio of 34 percent. We have
made a priority of using funds available after paying dividends and capital
spending to reduce debt. We reduced our debt by $4.8 billion in 2003. We feel
that by lowering our debt-to-capital ratio over the next several years to about
30 percent, we can improve our cost of capital and further position ourselves
for growth opportunities in the future.

2003 vs. 2002

Net income was $4,735 million in 2003, compared with a net loss of $295 million
in 2002. The improved results in 2003 were primarily due to:

See the “Segment Results” section for additional information on our E&P and R&M
results, as well as our other reporting segments.

2002 vs. 2001

We incurred a net loss of $295 million in 2002, compared with net income of
$1,661 million in 2001. The decrease was primarily attributable to recognizing
impairments and loss accruals totaling $1,077 million after-tax associated with
our retail and wholesale marketing operations that were classified as
discontinued operations in late 2002, as well as merger-related costs totaling
$557 million after-tax. Also negatively impacting results for 2002 were other
asset impairments totaling $192 million after-tax, lower refining



margins, lower natural gas sales prices, decreased equity earnings from Duke
Energy Field Services, LLC (DEFS), and higher interest expense. These factors
were partially offset by improved results from Chemicals and higher production
volumes in E&P after the merger.

Income Statement Analysis

2003 vs. 2002

The merger affects the comparability of the 2003 and 2002 periods. 2003
includes a full year of ConocoPhillips’ operations, while 2002 includes only
four months of combined operations. Prior to August 30, 2002, our results
reflect Phillips’ operations only. Accordingly, the merger significantly
increased:

In addition to the merger impact, sales and other operating revenues and
purchase costs increased because of higher prices for key products such as
crude oil, natural gas, automotive gasoline and distillates. These are
commodity products and their price levels are determined by market factors.

Our share of earnings from affiliates acquired in the merger accounted for the
majority of the increase in the equity earnings. Of these, the E&P joint
ventures in Canada (Petrovera) and Venezuela (Petrozuata), along with CFJ
Properties in our R&M segment, provided the largest equity earnings. On
February 18, 2004, we sold our interest in the Petrovera joint venture. Of the
equity affiliates held prior to the merger, our equity earnings from DEFS
improved on higher natural gas liquids prices, and our earnings from Hamaca, an
E&P heavy-oil joint venture in Venezuela, increased due to higher crude oil
production.

A higher net gain on asset sales was primarily responsible for the increase in
other income in 2003. During 2003 we sold several E&P operations that did not
fit into our long-term growth strategy. In addition, 2003 included gains
attributable to insurance demutualization benefits. See the Corporate and
Other section of “Segment Results” for additional information on these
insurance benefits.

Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2002 included a $246 million
charge for the write-off of in-process research and development costs acquired
in the merger. The absence of such a significant charge in the 2003 period
reduced the impact of the merger on this line item.

Property impairments increased by $75 million in 2003, compared with 2002. The
2003 impairments were recorded as a result of asset status changes from
held-for-use to held-for-sale, producing properties that failed to meet
recoverability tests, and tax law changes in Norway affecting asset removal
costs. During 2002, property impairments were triggered by asset dispositions
and the impairment of tradenames. See
Note 12—Property Impairments, in the Notes to Financial Statements, for
additional information.



Accretion on discounted liabilities increased $123 million in 2003, reflecting
accretion expense on environmental liabilities assumed in the merger and
discounted obligations associated with the retirement and removal of long-lived
assets that became effective January 1, 2003, with the adoption of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations.” See Note 2—Changes in Accounting Principles, in the Notes to
Financial Statements, for additional information on SFAS No. 143.

In addition to the merger impact, interest and debt expense also increased in
2003 because of the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” (FIN 46).
The adoption of FIN 46 for variable interest entities involving synthetic
leases and certain other financing structures, effective January 1, 2003,
resulted in increased balance sheet debt, which resulted in higher interest
expense in 2003. See Note 2—Changes in Accounting Principles, and Note
14 – Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional
information.

During 2003, we recognized a $28 million gain on subsidiary equity transactions
related to our E&P Bayu-Undan development in the Timor Sea. See Note
7—Subsidiary Equity Transactions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, for additional information.

Our effective tax rate in 2003 was 45 percent, compared with 67 percent in
2002. The lower effective tax rate in 2003 primarily was the result of a
higher proportion of income in lower-tax-rate jurisdictions and the one-time
impact of tax law changes in certain international jurisdictions. Contributing
to the higher effective tax rate in 2002 was a write-off of in-process research
and development costs, as well as the partial impairment of an exploration
prospect, both without corresponding tax benefits in 2002.

Our discontinued operations had income of $237 million in 2003, compared with a
net loss of $993 million in 2002. The net loss in 2002 reflected charges
totaling $1,008 million after-tax related to the impairment of properties,
plants and equipment; goodwill; intangible assets; and provisions for losses
associated with various operating lease commitments. For additional
information about our discontinued operations, see Note 4—Discontinued
Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

We adopted SFAS No. 143 effective January 1, 2003, resulting in the recognition
of a benefit of $145 million for the cumulative effect of this accounting
change. Also effective January 1, 2003, we adopted FIN 46 for variable
interest entities involving synthetic leases and certain other financing
structures created prior to February 1, 2003. This resulted in a charge of
$240 million for the cumulative effect of this accounting change. Together,
these resulted in a net charge of $95 million. For additional information on
these accounting changes, see Note 2—Changes in Accounting Principles, in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

2002 vs. 2001

In addition to the merger of Conoco and Phillips on August 30, 2002,
ConocoPhillips closed on the $7 billion acquisition of Tosco Corporation on
September 14, 2001. Together, these transactions significantly increased
operating revenues; equity earnings; other income; purchase costs; operating
expenses; selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation, depletion
and amortization; taxes other than income taxes; accretion on discounted
liabilities; and interest and debt expense in 2002, compared with 2001.



Restructuring Accruals

As a result of the merger, we began a restructuring program in September 2002
to capture the benefits of combining Conoco and Phillips by eliminating
redundancies, consolidating assets, and sharing common services and functions
across regions. We expect the restructuring program to be completed by the end
of the first quarter of 2004. From September 2002 through December 31, 2003,
approximately 3,900 positions worldwide had been identified for elimination.
Of this total, approximately 3,000 employees had been terminated by December
31, 2003. The information in Note 5—Restructuring, in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, is incorporated herein by reference.

2003 vs. 2002

The E&P segment explores for and produces crude oil, natural gas, and natural
gas liquids on a worldwide basis. It also mines deposits of oil sands in
Canada to extract the bitumen and upgrade it into a synthetic crude oil. At
December 31, 2003, our E&P operations were producing in the United States, the
Norwegian and U.K. sectors of the North Sea, Canada, Nigeria, Venezuela,
offshore Timor Lesté in the Timor Sea, offshore Australia, offshore China,
offshore the United Arab Emirates, offshore Vietnam, Russia, and Indonesia.

Net income from the E&P segment increased 146 percent in 2003, compared with
2002. The improvement reflects higher production volumes, primarily due to the
merger; higher crude oil and natural gas prices; and an increased net gain on
asset sales. These items were partially offset by higher production and
operating expenses; depreciation, depletion and amortization; and taxes other
than income taxes, all the result of the larger size and scope of our
operations following the merger.

In addition, 2003 included benefits of $233 million in our international E&P
operations from changes in income tax and site restoration laws, as well as an
equity realignment of certain Australian operations. Also, the cumulative
effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 143 and the adoption of FIN 46 for variable
interest entities involving synthetic leases and certain other financing
structures increased E&P’s net income by $142 million in 2003.

Our average worldwide crude oil sales price was $27.47 per barrel in 2003,
compared with $24.07 in 2002. We also benefited from higher natural gas prices
in 2003, with our average worldwide price increasing from $2.77 per thousand
cubic feet in 2002 to $4.07 in 2003. If crude oil and natural gas prices in
2004 do not remain at the historically strong levels experienced in 2003, E&P’s
earnings will be negatively impacted in 2004. See the “Outlook” section for
additional discussion of crude oil and natural gas prices.

ConocoPhillips’ proved reserves at year-end 2003 were 7.85 billion barrels of
oil equivalent, a slight increase over 7.81 billion barrels at year-end 2002.
Our Canadian Syncrude mining operations had an additional 265 million barrels
of proved oil sands reserves at the end of 2003, compared with 272 million
barrels at year-end 2002.

2002 vs. 2001

Net income from the E&P segment increased 3 percent in 2002, compared with
2001. Although E&P benefited from four months of increased production volumes
in 2002 following the merger, this increase was mostly offset by lower natural
gas sales prices, higher exploration expenses, and the unfavorable $24 million
impact of a tax law change in the United Kingdom. Our average worldwide crude
oil sales price was $24.07 per barrel in 2002, a 1 percent increase over $23.74
in 2001. Our average worldwide natural gas price in 2002 was $2.77 per
thousand cubic feet, a 14 percent decrease from $3.23 in 2001.

Our proved reserves at year-end 2002 were 7.81 billion barrels of oil
equivalent, a 52 percent increase over year-end 2001’s 5.13 billion barrels of
oil equivalent. The increase was attributable to the merger.



U.S. E&P

2003 vs. 2002

Net income from our U.S. E&P operations increased 105 percent in 2003, compared
with 2002. Net income from our Alaskan operations increased $575 million in
2003. The improvement in Alaska reflects higher crude oil prices, and a net
$143 million benefit from the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 143 and
FIN 46, partially offset by slightly lower crude oil production volumes. The
West Coast price of our Alaskan crude oil production increased 22 percent in
2003, from $23.75 per barrel in 2002 to $28.87 per barrel in 2003. Normal
field declines and some operating interruptions in 2003 were mostly offset by
increased production from the Borealis satellite field, the new Kuparuk Palm
drill site, and Alpine, which enabled us to experience only a slight decrease
in our Alaska crude oil production rate in 2003.

Our E&P Lower 48 net income increased $643 million in 2003, primarily because
of increased natural gas production and sales prices, as well as, to a lesser
extent, higher crude oil production and prices. U.S. Lower 48 natural gas
prices increased 71 percent in 2003. Our increased production volumes in the
Lower 48 mainly were the result of the merger, partially offset by the impact
of asset dispositions. We continued our Lower 48/Gulf of Mexico asset
rationalization program in 2003, which resulted in the sale of properties that
did not fit into our long-term growth strategy. As planned, we are exiting the
shallow water areas of the Gulf of Mexico. The Lower 48 operations recognized
a net $1 million charge from the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 143 and
FIN 46 effective January 1, 2003.

2002 vs. 2001

Net income from U.S. E&P operations decreased 14 percent in 2002, compared with
2001. Although net income for 2002 benefited from four months of increased
production volumes following the merger, this increase was more than offset by
lower natural gas prices, lower production volumes in Alaska, and higher dry
hole costs. Our U.S. average natural gas price in 2002 was 23 percent lower
than in 2001.

Our U.S. crude oil production decreased slightly in 2002, while natural gas
production increased 20 percent. The increase in natural gas production was
mainly due to four months of production from fields acquired in the merger.
The merger impact on total crude oil production was offset by lower production
in Alaska, which experienced normal field declines, along with operating
interruptions at the Prudhoe Bay field.

International E&P

2003 vs. 2002

Net income from our international E&P operations increased 225 percent in 2003,
compared with 2002. Increased production volumes following the merger
accounted for the majority of the earnings improvement. Higher crude oil and
natural gas prices contributed to the remaining increase.

International E&P’s production on a barrel-of-oil-equivalent basis averaged
916,000 barrels per day in 2003, compared with 482,000 barrels per day in 2002.
In addition, our Syncrude mining operations produced 19,000 barrels per day in
2003, compared with 8,000 barrels per day in 2002. Although the merger was the
primary reason for the production increase, other items impacting our
production rate in 2003 were:



•

The startup of the Grane field in the Norwegian North Sea in
September 2003;

•

A full year’s production from Phase I of the development of the
Peng Lai 19-3 field in China’s Bohai Bay; and

•

The startup of production from the Phase I development of the Su Tu
Den project in Vietnam late in the fourth quarter of 2003.

Included in international E&P’s net income in 2003 was a net foreign currency
transaction loss of $50 million, compared with a net loss of $34 million in
2002.

International E&P’s net income in 2003 also was favorably impacted by the
following items:

•

In Norway, the Norway Removal Grant Act (1986) was repealed in
the second quarter of 2003. Prior to its repeal, this Act required
the Norwegian government to contribute to the cost of removing
offshore oil and gas production facilities. Now, the co-venturers in
the facilities must fund all removal costs, but can deduct the removal
costs, as incurred, under the Petroleum Tax Act, at the marginal tax
rate in effect at the time of removal. These changes required us: to
recognize an additional liability for the government’s share, prior to
repeal of the Act, of the future removal costs, with a corresponding
increase in properties, plants and equipment (PP&E); and to establish
a net deferred tax asset for the temporary differences between the
financial basis and tax basis of all of our Norwegian removal assets
and liabilities. Some of the increases in PP&E were on shut-in
fields, which led to immediate impairments of those properties. The
overall impact on 2003 results was a net after-tax benefit of $87
million.

•

In the Timor Sea region, ConocoPhillips and its co-venturers
received final approvals from authorities to proceed with the natural
gas development phase of the Bayu-Undan project in the second quarter
of 2003. This approval allowed a broad ownership interest
re-alignment among the co-venturers to proceed, which included our
sale of a 10 percent interest in the project and the issuance of
equity by previously wholly owned subsidiaries. In addition, the
ratification of the Australia/Timor Lesté treaty lowered the company’s
deferred tax liability position. The net result of these events was
an after-tax benefit of $51 million in 2003. See Note 7—Subsidiary
Equity Transactions, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, for additional information.

•

In November 2003, the Canadian Parliament enacted federal tax
rate reductions for oil and gas producers. As a result we recognized
a $95 million benefit upon revaluation of our deferred tax liability
in the fourth quarter.

2002 vs. 2001

Net income from international E&P operations increased 66 percent in 2002. The
improvement reflects four months of increased production volumes following the
merger. However, 2002 net income included a $24 million deferred tax charge
related to tax law changes in the United Kingdom. Net income in 2002 also
included a $77 million leasehold impairment of deepwater Block 34, offshore
Angola, due to an unsuccessful exploratory well in the block, along with higher
dry hole charges.

Our international crude oil production increased 64 percent in 2002, while
natural gas production increased 126 percent. The increases were mainly due to
the addition of four months of production from fields acquired in the merger.

2003 vs. 2002

The Midstream segment purchases raw natural gas from producers and gathers
natural gas through extensive pipeline gathering systems. The natural gas is
then processed to extract natural gas liquids from the raw gas stream. The
remaining “residue” gas is marketed to electrical utilities, industrial users,
and gas marketing companies. Most of the natural gas liquids are
fractionated—separated into individual components like ethane, butane and
propane—and marketed as chemical feedstock, fuel, or blendstock.

Our Midstream segment consists of a 30.3 percent interest in Duke Energy Field
Services, LLC (DEFS), as well as our other natural gas gathering and processing
operations, and natural gas liquids fractionation and marketing businesses,
primarily in the United States, Canada and Trinidad.

Net income from the Midstream segment increased 136 percent in 2003, compared
with 2002. The increase primarily was attributable to improved results from
DEFS and the addition of midstream operations following the merger. DEFS’
results mainly increased because of higher natural gas liquids prices in 2003.
In addition, DEFS’ results in 2002 included higher costs for gas imbalance
adjustment accruals.

Included in the Midstream segment’s 2003 net income was a basis-difference
benefit of $36 million, compared with $35 million in 2002, representing the
amortization of the excess amount of our 30.3 percent equity interest in the
net assets of DEFS over the book value of our investment in DEFS.

2002 vs. 2001

Net income from the Midstream segment decreased 54 percent in 2002, compared
with 2001. The decrease was primarily due to lower results from DEFS, which
experienced a decline in natural gas liquids prices, increased costs for gas
imbalance accruals and other adjustments, and higher operating expenses.



These items were partially offset by the benefit of four months’ results from
operations acquired in the merger.

Included in the Midstream segment’s net income in 2002 was a benefit of $35
million, representing the amortization of the basis difference between the book
value of ConocoPhillips’ contribution to DEFS and our 30.3 percent equity
interest in DEFS. The corresponding amount for 2001 was $36 million.

Weighted-average crude oil capacity for the period, including the refineries acquired in the
Tosco acquisition in September 2001 and the refineries acquired as a result of the merger.
Actual capacity at year-end 2002 and 2001 was 2,166,000 and 1,656,000 barrels per day,
respectively, in the United States and 440,000 and 72,000 barrels per day, respectively,
internationally.



2003 vs. 2002

The R&M segment’s operations encompass refining crude oil and other feedstocks
into petroleum products (such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels),
buying and selling crude oil and refined products, and transporting,
distributing and marketing petroleum products. R&M has operations in the
United States, Europe and Asia Pacific.

Net income from our R&M segment increased substantially in 2003, compared with
2002. The improved results primarily were due to significantly higher U.S.
refining margins. The addition of refining and marketing assets in the merger
also contributed to the higher 2003 earnings, as did increased wholesale
gasoline margins. Partially offsetting the improvements was a net charge of
$125 million for the cumulative effect of the adoption of FIN 46 for variable
interest entities involving synthetic leases and certain other financing
structures.

Our refineries produced 2.7 million barrels per day of petroleum products in
2003, compared with 2.0 million barrels per day in 2002. The increase reflects
the addition of production from refineries acquired in the merger.

2002 vs. 2001

Net income from the R&M segment declined 64 percent in 2002, compared with
2001, reflecting lower refining margins, along with an $84 million after-tax
impairment of a tradename and leasehold improvements of certain retail sites.
R&M earnings for 2002 included four months’ results from operations acquired in
the merger, as well as the impact of a full year’s results from Tosco
operations, while the 2001 results included Tosco operations for only the last
three and one-half months of 2001.

Worldwide crude oil refining capacity utilization was 90 percent in 2002,
compared with 94 percent in 2001. Our refineries produced 2.0 million barrels
per day of petroleum products in 2002, compared with 814,000 barrels per day in
2001. The increase reflects a full year of operations for refineries acquired
in the Tosco acquisition and four months of operations for the refineries
acquired in the merger.

U.S. R&M

2003 vs. 2002

Net income from our U.S. R&M operations increased significantly in 2003,
compared with 2002. The improved results mainly were due to significantly
higher refining margins, particularly during the third quarter of 2003.
Industry U.S. refining margins were strong in the third quarter of 2003 due to
increased gasoline demand in August and an unusual number of refined product
supply disruptions, including refinery outages in the Midwest caused by a major
power blackout in August 2003. See the “Outlook” section for additional
discussion of refining margins. We capitalized on the strong refining margins
in the third quarter by running our U.S. refineries at a utilization rate of 96
percent during the quarter. However, this rate was negatively impacted by a
fire at our Ponca City, Oklahoma, refinery during July that resulted in
portions of the facility being shut down. The Ponca City refinery’s throughput
was restored in the fourth quarter of 2003 to levels achieved before the fire.



The addition of refining and marketing assets in the merger also contributed to
the higher 2003 earnings, as did increased wholesale gasoline margins.
Partially offsetting the margin improvements in 2003 was a net charge of $125
million for the cumulative effect of the adoption of FIN 46 for variable
interest entities involving synthetic leases and certain other financing
structures, along with higher utility costs.

For the full year of 2003, our U.S. refineries ran at a crude oil capacity
utilization rate of 96 percent, compared with 91 percent in 2002. The rate in
2002 was lowered by higher maintenance turnaround activity, the impact of
tropical storms on our Gulf Coast refineries, and the loss of Venezuelan crude
oil supply in the fourth quarter due to the economic and political instability
in that country during the quarter.

2002 vs. 2001

Net income from U.S. R&M operations declined 65 percent in 2002, compared with
2001. The decrease was primarily due to lower refining margins, particularly
in the Midcontinent and Gulf Coast regions, along with an $84 million after-tax
impairment of a tradename and leasehold improvements of certain retail sites.
These items were partially offset by increased production and sales volumes as
a result of the Tosco acquisition and the merger. Net income for 2002 included
four months of operations acquired in the merger, and a full year of Tosco
operations, while the 2001 results included Tosco operations for only three and
one-half months. Effective January 1, 2001, we changed our method of
accounting for the costs of major maintenance turnarounds from the
accrue-in-advance method to the expense-as-incurred method. The cumulative
effect of this change in accounting principle increased R&M net income by $26
million. Also included in 2001 was a $27 million write-down of inventories to
market value.

International R&M

2003 vs. 2002

Net income from our international R&M operations increased substantially in
2003, compared with 2002. The improvement was due to the larger size and scope
of our international refining and marketing operations following the merger,
along with higher international refining margins. Prior to the merger, our
international R&M operations consisted only of our Whitegate refinery in
Ireland with a rated crude oil capacity of 72,000 barrels per day. The merger
added one wholly owned and four joint-venture refineries, with a rated crude
oil capacity of 370,000 barrels per day. In addition, the merger added an
extensive marketing network throughout Europe and Asia. Included in
international R&M’s net income in 2003 was a net foreign currency gain of $18
million, compared with a net gain of $9 million in 2002.

Our international crude oil capacity utilization rate was 87 percent in 2003,
compared with 78 percent in 2002. The lower utilization rate in 2002 primarily
was the result of the Humber refinery in the United Kingdom being shut down for
an extended period of time in the fourth quarter due to a power outage and
subsequent downtime.

2002 vs. 2001

Net income from international R&M operations increased $3 million in 2002,
compared with 2001, reflecting the impact of the merger. The Humber refinery
was shut down for an extended period of time during the fourth quarter of 2002,
which negatively impacted international R&M’s 2002 results.

2003 vs. 2002

The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in Chevron Phillips
Chemical Company LLC (CPChem), which we account for using the equity method of
accounting. CPChem uses natural gas liquids and other feedstocks to produce
petrochemicals such as ethylene, propylene, styrene, benzene, and paraxylene.
These products are then marketed and sold, or used as feedstocks to produce
plastics and commodity chemicals, such as polyethylene, polystyrene and
cyclohexane.

As the results in both years indicate, the chemicals industry continues to be
challenged to effectively utilize capacity, manage costs and improve margins in
a difficult economic environment. The worldwide chemicals industry experienced
an economic downturn beginning in the second half of 2000, and the downturn
continued through 2003. The downturn has led to excess production capacity in
the industry and pressured margins on key products. The chemicals industry has
also been impacted by high energy prices, which negatively impacts both utility
and feedstock costs.

2002 vs. 2001

The Chemicals segment incurred a net loss of $14 million in 2002, compared with
a net loss of $128 million in 2001. Higher margins in 2002 contributed to the
improvement in results. Lower operating expenses, feedstock costs and energy
prices in 2002 were partially offset by decreased sales prices.

Due to depressed economic conditions in the chemicals industry, asset
retirements and impairments totaling $84 million after-tax were recognized by
CPChem in 2001. A developmental reactor at the Pasadena Plastics Complex in
Pasadena, Texas, was retired; accelerated depreciation was recognized by CPChem
on two polyethylene reactors at the Orange chemical plant in Orange, Texas; an
ethylene unit was retired at the Sweeny complex in Old Ocean, Texas; an equity
affiliate of CPChem recorded a property impairment related to a polypropylene
facility; property impairments were taken on the manufacturing facility in
Puerto Rico; and the benzene and cyclohexane units at the Puerto Rico facility
were retired. In addition, the valuation allowance on the Puerto Rico
facility’s deferred tax asset related to its net operating losses was increased
in 2001 so that the deferred tax assets were fully offset by valuation
allowances. Partially offsetting these impairments and retirements was a
business interruption insurance settlement recognized by CPChem, and a
favorable deferred tax adjustment recorded by ConocoPhillips related to the
Puerto Rico facility, together totaling $57 million after-tax.

The Emerging Businesses segment includes the development of new businesses
outside our traditional operations. Emerging Businesses incurred a net loss of
$99 million in 2003, compared with a net loss of $310 million in 2002. The net
loss in 2003 was less than that in 2002 as a result of a $246 million write-off
of purchased in-process research and development costs in the third quarter of
2002 related to Conoco’s natural gas-to-liquids and other technologies. In
accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 4, “Applicability of FASB Statement No.
2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method,” value
assigned to research and development activities in the purchase price
allocation that have no alternative future use are required to be charged to
expense at the date of the consummation of the combination. The $246 million
charge was the same on both a before-tax and after-tax basis, because there was
no tax basis in the assigned value prior to its write-off.

2002 vs. 2001

The Emerging Businesses segment posted a net loss of $310 million in 2002,
compared with a net loss of $12 million in 2001. Results for 2002 included a
$246 million write-off of acquired in-process research and development costs
described above. The increased number of developing businesses after the
merger also contributed to the larger losses in 2002.

2003 vs. 2002

Net interest after-tax represents interest expense, net of interest income and
capitalized interest, as well as premiums incurred on the early retirement of
debt. Net interest increased 53 percent in 2003, compared with 2002. The
increase in 2003 mainly was due to our higher debt levels following the merger,
the impact of the adoption of FIN 46 for variable interest entities involving
synthetic leases and certain other financing structures, and increased premiums
on the early retirement of debt. The adoption of FIN 46 at January 1, 2003,
increased debt, which resulted in higher interest expense. See Note
2—Changes
in Accounting Principles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
for additional information.

After-tax corporate general and administrative expenses were the same in 2003
as in 2002. Expenses in 2003 were impacted by the merger, as well as the
expensing of stock options. Beginning in 2003, on a prospective basis, we
elected to use the fair-value accounting method provided for under SFAS No.
123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” Offsetting these items were
increased allocations of certain staff costs to the operating segments in 2003.
The increased corporate allocations did not have a material impact on the
operating segments’ results.

Income from discontinued operations was $237 million in 2003, compared with a
loss of $993 million in 2002. The net loss in 2002 reflects charges totaling
$1,008 million after-tax related to the impairment of properties, plants and
equipment; goodwill; intangible assets; and provisions for losses associated
with various operating lease commitments. For additional information about our
discontinued operations, see Note 4—Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

On an after-tax basis, merger-related costs were $223 million in 2003, compared
with $307 million in 2002. Included in these costs were employee relocation
expenses, transition labor costs, and other charges directly associated with
the merger.

The category “Other” consists primarily of items not directly associated with
the operating segments on a stand-alone basis, including certain foreign
currency transaction gains and losses, and environmental costs associated with
sites no longer in operation. Results from Other were improved in 2003 because
of higher foreign currency transaction gains and an after-tax gain of $34
million in the first quarter of 2003, representing beneficial interests we had
in certain insurance companies as a result of the conversion of those companies
from mutual companies to stock companies, a process known as demutualization.
These beneficial interests arose from our prior purchase and ownership of
various insurance policies and contracts issued by the mutual companies. Prior
to the demutualizations, our mutual ownership interests in these insurance
companies were not recognized because the ownership interests in the mutual
companies were neither capable of valuation nor marketable. Included in Other
in 2003 was a net foreign currency transaction gain of $67 million, after-tax,
compared with a net gain of $21 million in 2002.

2002 vs. 2001

Corporate and Other’s net loss was $1,918 million in 2002, compared with $415
million in 2001. The increased net loss in 2002 reflects losses from
discontinued operations, primarily due to impairments, and merger-related
costs. Net interest expense and corporate general and administrative costs
were also higher in 2002 due to the merger.

With the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” effective January 1, 2003, the mandatorily redeemable preferred
securities were removed from our balance sheet and effectively replaced with debt.

**

Capital includes total debt, mandatorily redeemable preferred securities, other minority interests and common stockholders’ equity.

To meet our liquidity requirements, including funding our capital program,
paying dividends and repaying debt, we look to a variety of funding sources,
primarily cash generated from operating activities. During 2003, available
cash was used to support the company’s ongoing capital expenditures program,
repay debt and pay dividends. In October 2003, our Board of Directors (Board)
declared a dividend of $.43 per share, payable December 1, 2003, which
represented a 7.5 percent increase from the previous quarter’s dividend rate.
Total dividends paid on our common stock in 2003 was $1.1 billion. During
2003, cash and cash equivalents increased $183 million to $490 million.

Significant Sources of Capital

Operating Activities

During 2003, cash of $9,356 million was provided by operating activities, an
increase of $4,378 million from 2002. The increase in cash provided by
operating activities was primarily due to:

•

Higher crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices;

•

Increased production as a result of the inclusion of Conoco activity for the full year; and

•

Higher refining and marketing margins.

In addition, working capital changes increased cash flow from operating
activities $589 million in 2003, compared with an increase of $982 million in
2002. Cash from operating activities provided by discontinued operations
amounted to $189 million, compared with $202 million in 2002.

Asset Sales

Following the merger, we initiated an asset disposition program to sell
approximately $3 billion to $4 billion of assets by the end of 2004. Through
year-end 2003, we had sold approximately $3.4 billion of assets and raised
our target to $4.5 billion by year-end 2004. In February 2004, we sold our
46.7 percent interest in Petrovera Resources Limited, which primarily
produced conventional heavy oil in Western Canada. Additional assets
expected to be sold in 2004 are primarily related to our marketing



business. In addition, we are proceeding with plans to dispose of some of
our non-DEFS Midstream assets. During 2003, $2.7 billion was received from
the sale of various assets, including the remaining assets required to be
sold by the Federal Trade Commission as a result of the merger, a substantial
portion of our U.S. retail marketing sites, and non-strategic E&P properties.
Proceeds from these asset sales have been, and will be, used primarily to
pay off debt.

Commercial Paper and Credit Facilities

While the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from
geographic diversity and the effects of upstream and downstream integration,
our operating cash flows remain exposed to the volatility of commodity crude
oil and natural gas prices and refining and marketing margins, as well as
periodic cash needs to finance tax payments and crude oil, natural gas and
petroleum product purchases. Our primary funding source for short-term working
capital needs is a $4 billion commercial paper program, a portion of which may
be denominated in other currencies (limited to euro 3 billion equivalent).
Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. At December 31,
2003, we had $709 million of commercial paper outstanding, compared with $1,517
million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2002, of which $206
million was denominated in foreign currencies.

Effective October 14, 2003, we entered into two new revolving credit facilities
to replace our previously existing $2 billion 364-day facility that expired on
that same date. The new revolving credit facilities consist of a $1.5 billion
364-day facility and a $500 million five-year facility. We also have two
revolving credit facilities totaling $2 billion expiring in October 2006.
There were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31,
2003. These credit facilities support the company’s $4 billion commercial
paper program. In addition, one of our Norwegian subsidiaries has two $300
million revolving credit facilities that expire in June 2004, under which no
borrowings were outstanding at December 31, 2003.

Moody’s Investor Service has maintained a rating of A3 on our senior long-term
debt; and Standard and Poors’ Rating Service and Fitch have maintained ratings
of A-. We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that
would cause an automatic event of default in the event of a downgrade of our
credit rating and thereby impact our access to liquidity. In the event that
our credit rating deteriorated to a level that would prohibit us from accessing
the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our
$4.6 billion revolving credit facilities. Based on our year-end commercial
paper balance of $709 million, we had access to $3.9 billion in borrowing
capacity as of December 31, 2003, which provides ample liquidity to cover daily
operations.

Shelf Registration

In late 2002, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission for various types of debt and equity
securities. As a result, we have available to issue and sell a total of $5
billion of various types of securities under the universal shelf registration
statement.

Minority Interests

At December 31, 2003, we had outstanding $842 million of equity held by
minority interest owners, including a net minority interest of $496 million in
Ashford Energy Capital S.A. and a $141 million net minority interest in Conoco
Corporate Holdings L.P.

•

In December 2001, in order to raise funds for general corporate
purposes, Conoco and Cold Spring Finance S.a.r.l. formed Ashford Energy
Capital S.A. through the contribution of a $1 billion Conoco subsidiary
promissory note and $500 million cash by Cold Spring. Through its
initial $500 million investment, Cold Spring is entitled to a
cumulative annual preferred return based on three-month LIBOR rates,
plus 1.27 percent. The preferred return at December 31, 2003, was 2.48
percent. In 2008, and at each 10-year anniversary thereafter, Cold
Spring may elect to



remarket their investment in Ashford, and if unsuccessful, could require
ConocoPhillips to provide a letter of credit in support of Cold Spring’s
investment, or in the event that such letter of credit is not provided,
then cause the redemption of their investment in Ashford. Should
ConocoPhillips’ credit rating fall below investment grade, Ashford would
require a letter of credit to support $475 million of the term loans, as
of December 31, 2003, made by Ashford to other ConocoPhillips
subsidiaries. If the letter of credit is not obtained within 60 days,
Cold Spring could cause Ashford to sell the ConocoPhillips subsidiary
notes. At December 31, 2003, Ashford held $1.6 billion of ConocoPhillips
subsidiary notes and $25 million in investments unrelated to
ConocoPhillips. We report Cold Spring’s investment as a minority
interest because it is not mandatorily redeemable and the entity does not
have a specified liquidation date. Other than the obligation to make
payment on the subsidiary notes described above, Cold Spring does not
have recourse to our general credit.

•

In 1999, in order to raise funds for general corporate purposes,
Conoco formed Conoco Corporate Holdings L.P., contributing an office
building and four aircraft to the partnership. Conoco Corporate
Holdings L.P. is a limited-life entity that must be liquidated in 2019.
The limited partner interest was sold to Highlander Investors L.L.C.
for $141 million, which represented an initial net 47 percent interest.
Highlander’s current investment in Conoco Corporate Holdings L.P. is
24.4 percent. Highlander is entitled to a cumulative annual priority
return on its investment of 7.86 percent. The net minority interest in
Conoco Corporate Holdings L.P. was $141 million at December 31, 2003
and 2002, and is callable without penalty beginning in the fourth
quarter of 2004.

Receivables Factoring

At December 31, 2003 and 2002, we also had sold $226 million and $264 million,
respectively, of receivables under factoring arrangements. We retained
servicing responsibility for these sold receivables, which gives us certain
benefits, the fair value of which approximates the fair value of
the liability incurred for continuing to service the receivables. See Note
15—Sales of Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for
additional information.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Receivables Monetization

At December 31, 2002, certain credit card and trade receivables had been sold
to two Qualifying Special Purpose Entities (QSPEs) in revolving-period
securitization arrangements. These arrangements provided for us to sell, and
the QSPEs to purchase, certain receivables and for the QSPEs to then issue
beneficial interests of up to $1.5 billion to five bank-sponsored entities.
All five bank-sponsored entities are multi-seller conduits with access to the
commercial paper market and purchase interests in similar receivables from
numerous other companies unrelated to us. We have no ownership interests, nor
any variable interests, in any of the bank-sponsored entities. As a result, we
do not consolidate any of these entities. Furthermore, we do not consolidate
the QSPEs because they meet the requirements of SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for
Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
Liabilities,” to be excluded from the consolidated financial statements of
ConocoPhillips.

During 2003, we purchased from the bank-sponsored entities the senior interests
of one of our two existing QSPEs and discontinued selling receivables to it.
We have consolidated this QSPE since acquiring the senior interests. Also
during 2003, the third-party beneficial interest holders approved amendments to
the other QSPE to increase the amount of third-party beneficial interests that
can be issued to $1.2 billion. These changes resulted in a net reduction of
the maximum level of senior beneficial interests that can be issued to
third-party beneficial interest holders from $1.5 billion to $1.2 billion. At
December 31, 2003



and 2002, we had sold accounts receivable of $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion,
respectively. The receivables transferred to the QSPE meets the isolation
requirements and other requirements of SFAS No. 140 to be accounted for as
sales. Accordingly, receivables transferred to the QSPEs were accounted for as
sales.

We retain beneficial interests in this QSPE that are subordinate to the
beneficial interests issued to the bank-sponsored entities. These retained
interests, which are reported on the balance sheet in accounts and notes
receivable—related parties, were $1.3 billion at both December 31, 2003 and 2002. We also retain servicing responsibility related
to the sold receivables, which gives us certain benefits, the fair
value of which approximates the fair value of the liability incurred for
continuing to service the receivables. The carrying value of the subordinated
beneficial interests approximates fair market value due to the short term of
the underlying assets, which makes stress testing unnecessary.

Preferred Stock

During 1996 and 1997, we formed two statutory business trusts, Phillips 66
Capital I (Trust I) and Phillips 66 Capital II (Trust II), with ConocoPhillips
owning all of the common securities of the trusts. The sole purpose of the
trusts was to issue preferred securities to outside investors, investing the
proceeds thereof in an equivalent amount of subordinated debt securities of
ConocoPhillips. The two trusts were established to raise funds for general
corporate purposes. On May 31, 2002, we redeemed all of the outstanding
subordinated debt securities held by Trust I, which triggered the redemption of
the $300 million of trust preferred securities of Trust I at par value, $25 per
share. The redemption was funded by the issuance of commercial paper.

At December 31, 2003, Trust II had $350 million of mandatorily redeemable
preferred securities outstanding, whose sole asset was $361 million of
ConocoPhillips’ subordinated debt securities, which bear interest at 8 percent.
Distributions on the trust preferred securities are paid by the trust with
funds from interest payments made by ConocoPhillips on the subordinated debt
securities. We made interest payments in 2003 totaling $29 million. In
addition, we have guaranteed the payment obligations of the trust on the trust
preferred securities to the extent we have made interest payments on the
subordinated debt securities. Prior to January 1, 2003, we consolidated Trust
II and the mandatorily redeemable preferred securities were presented in the
mezzanine section of the balance sheet. The subordinated debt securities and
related income statement effects were eliminated in our consolidated financial
statements. However, with the adoption of the provisions of FIN 46, effective
January 1, 2003, we were required to deconsolidate Trust II, which had the
effect of increasing debt by $361 million since the subordinated debt
securities were no longer eliminated in consolidation, and removing the
mandatorily redeemable preferred securities from our balance sheet. When we
redeem the subordinated debt securities, Trust II is required to apply all the
redemption proceeds to the immediate redemption of the preferred securities.
See Note 2—Changes in Accounting Principles and Note 19—Preferred Stock and
Other Minority Interests, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
for additional information.

Affiliated Companies

As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal
industry practice, we invest in, and enter into, numerous agreements with other
parties to pursue business opportunities, which share costs and apportion risks
among the parties as governed by the agreements. At December 31, 2003, we were
liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual
arrangements as described below.

•

Hamaca:

The Hamaca project involves the development of heavy-oil
reserves from the Orinoco Oil Belt. We own a 40 percent interest in the
Hamaca project, which is operated by Petrolera Ameriven on behalf of the
owners. The other participants in Hamaca are Petroleos de Venezuela
S.A. (PDVSA) and ChevronTexaco Corporation. Our interest is held
through a jointly owned



limited liability company, Hamaca Holding LLC, for which we use the
equity method of accounting. Hamaca Holding LLC revenues for 2003 were
approximately $284 million, expenses were approximately $143 million and
cash provided by operating activities was approximately $143 million. We
have a 57.1 percent non-controlling ownership interest in Hamaca Holding
LLC. In the second quarter of 2001, we, along with our co-venturers in
the Hamaca project, secured approximately $1.1 billion in a joint debt
financing for our heavy-crude oil project in Venezuela. The
Export-Import Bank of the United States provided a guarantee supporting a
17-year-term $628 million bank facility. The joint venture also arranged
a $470 million 14-year-term commercial bank facility for the project.
Total debt of $969 million was outstanding under these credit facilities
at December 31, 2003. Of this amount, $388 million is recourse to
ConocoPhillips. The proceeds of these joint financings are being used to
primarily fund a heavy-oil upgrader. The remaining necessary funding
will be provided by capital contributions from the co-venturers on a pro
rata basis to the extent necessary to successfully complete construction.
Once completion certification is achieved (required by October 1, 2005),
the joint project financings will become non-recourse with respect to the
co-venturers and the lenders under those facilities can then look only to
the Hamaca project’s cash flows for payment.

•

Merey Sweeny L.P. (MSLP):

MSLP is a limited partnership in which we
and PDVSA each own an indirect 50 percent interest. During 1999, MSLP
issued $350 million of 8.85 percent bonds due 2019 that we, along with
PDVSA, are jointly-and-severally liable for under a construction
completion guarantee. The bond proceeds were used to fund construction
of a coker, vacuum unit and related facilities at our Sweeny, Texas,
refinery, plus certain improvements to existing facilities at the same
location. MSLP owns the coker and vacuum unit and, in the third quarter
of 2000, began processing long residue produced from the Venezuelan
Merey crude oil delivered under a supply agreement that we have with
PDVSA. MSLP charges us a fee, which totaled approximately $145 million
in 2003, to process the long residue through the vacuum unit and coker.
This is the partnership’s primary source of revenue. MSLP revenues for
2003 were approximately $162 million, expenses were approximately $140
million and cash provided by operating activities was approximately $31
million. If completion certification is not attained by June 18, 2004,
the 8.85 percent bonds could be called and the bondholders would look to
the two MSLP partners for repayment. MSLP is currently awaiting receipt
of a permit for a new waste water pipeline and working to resolve issues
in placing its insurance program, after which we expect to achieve
completion certification in the second quarter of 2004. Upon completion
certification, the 8.85 percent bonds become non-recourse to the two
MSLP partners and the bondholders can then look only to MSLP cash flows
for payment.

We purchased the improvements to existing facilities from MSLP for a
price equal to the cost of construction, and MSLP provided seller
financing. Terms of financing provide for 240 monthly payments of
principal and interest commencing September 2000 with interest accruing
at a 7 percent annual rate. The principal balance due on the seller
financing was $131 million at December 31, 2003, and is included as
long-term debt in our balance sheet. MSLP pays a monthly access fee to
us, which totaled approximately $20 million in 2003, for the use of the
improvements to the refinery. The access fee equals the monthly
principal and interest paid by us to purchase the improvements from MSLP.
To the extent the access fee is not paid by MSLP, we are not obligated
to make payments for the improvements.

During the first quarter of 2002, MSLP issued $25 million of tax-exempt
bonds due 2021. This issuance, combined with similar bonds MSLP issued
in 1998, 2000, and 2001, bring the total outstanding to $100 million. As
a result of the company’s support as a primary obligor of a 50 percent
share of these MSLP financings, $50 million of long-term debt is included
in our balance sheet at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.



•

Other:

At December 31, 2003, we had guarantees of approximately $340
million outstanding for our portion of other joint-venture debt
obligations, which have terms of up to 22 years. Included in these
outstanding guarantees was $158 million associated with the Polar Lights
Company joint venture in Russia. Payment will be required if a joint
venture defaults on its debt obligations.

Capital Requirements

For information about our capital expenditures and investments, see “Capital
Spending” below.

Our balance sheet debt at December 31, 2003, was $17.8 billion. This reflects
debt reductions of approximately $4.8 billion during 2003, including accounting
changes that increased balance sheet debt approximately $2.8 billion as a
result of the adoption of FIN 46. See Note 2—Changes in Accounting Principles
and Note 14—Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for
additional information.

During 2003, we reduced our commercial paper balance outstanding from $1.5
billion at December 31, 2002, to $709 million at December 31, 2003. In 2003,
we paid off the following notes and debt facilities as they were called or
matured and funded the payments with cash from operating activities and
proceeds from asset dispositions:

In October and November 2003, we executed certain interest rate swaps that had
the effect of converting $1.5 billion of debt from fixed to floating rate.
These swaps qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133, “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.”

Also during 2003, we issued $79.5 million of tax-exempt bonds and assumed an
additional amount of $20 million.

Represents any agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms. The
majority of the purchase obligations are market-based contracts.
Includes: (1) our commercial activities of $23.0 billion,
of which $11.1
billion are primarily related to the supply of crude oil to our refineries and the optimization of the supply chain, $5.6 billion primarily
related to the supply of unfractionated NGLs to fractionators, optimization of NGL assets, and for resale to customers, $4.4 billion primarily
related to natural gas for resale to customers, $1.7 billion of futures, and $217 million related to the purchase side of exchange agreements; (2)
$23.3 billion of purchase commitments for products, mostly natural gas and natural gas liquids, from CPChem over the remaining term of 97 years;
and (3) purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are the operator, of which some of the obligations will be
reimbursed by our co-owners in these properties. Does not include: (1) purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we
are not the operator; (2) our agreement to purchase up to 104,000 barrels per day of Petrozuata crude oil for a
market-based formula price over the term of the Petrozuata joint venture (about 35 years) in the event that Petrozuata is unable to sell the
production for higher prices; and (3) an agreement to purchase up to 165,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan Merey, or equivalent, crude oil for a
market price over a remaining 16-year term if a variety of conditions are met.

***

Does not include: (1) Taxes—the company’s consolidated balance sheet reflects liabilities related to income, excise, property, production,
payroll and environmental taxes. We anticipate the current liability of $2,676 million for accrued income and other taxes will be paid in the
next year. We have other accrued tax liabilities whose resolution may not occur for several years, so it is not possible to determine the exact
timing or amount of future payments. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the
amounts used for tax purposes; (2) Pensions—for the 2004 through 2008 time
period, we expect to contribute an average of $400 million per year to our qualified and non-qualified pension and postretirement medical plans
in the United States and an average of $100 million per year to our non-U.S. plans, which are expected to be in excess of required minimums in
many cases. Our required minimum funding in 2004 is expected to be $95 million in the United States and $75 million outside the United States;
(3) Severance—we have expected severance payments of $109 million in 2004 and $3 million in 2005; and (4) Interest—we anticipate payments of $1,046
million in 2004, $2,012 million for the period 2005 through 2006, $1,708 million for the period 2007 through 2008, and $8,955 million for the
remaining years to total $13,721 million.

Excludes discontinued operations.

Our capital spending for continuing operations for the three-year period ending
December 31, 2003, totaled $13.6 billion. Spending was primarily focused on
the growth of our E&P business, with 76 percent of total spending for
continuing operations in this segment. The capital programs of DEFS, our gas
gathering, processing and marketing joint-venture company, and CPChem, our
chemicals joint-venture company, are intended to be self-funding, and are not
reflected in the amounts above.

Including about $500 million in capitalized interest and $400 million that will
be funded by minority interests in the Bayu-Undan gas export project, our Board
has approved $6.9 billion for capital projects and investments for continuing
operations in 2004, a 12 percent increase over our 2003 capital spending of
$6.2 billion. We plan to direct 78 percent of our 2004 capital budget to E&P
and 19 percent to R&M. The remaining budget will be allocated toward emerging
businesses, mainly power generation; and general corporate purposes, with a
majority related to global integration of systems. Thirty-eight percent of the
budget is targeted for projects in the United States.

E&P

Capital spending for continuing operations for E&P during the three-year period
ending December 31, 2003, totaled $10.3 billion. The expenditures over the
three-year period supported several key exploration and development projects
including:

•

National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A) and satellite field
prospects on Alaska’s North Slope;



Capital expenditures for construction of our Endeavour Class tankers and an
additional interest in the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System were also included in
the E&P segment.

We have contracted to build, for approximately $200 million each, five
double-hulled Endeavour Class tankers for use in transporting Alaskan crude oil
to the U.S. West Coast. During 2001, the

Polar Endeavour

, the first Endeavour
Class tanker, entered service. The second tanker, the

Polar Resolution

,
entered service in May 2002 and the third tanker, the

Polar Discovery

, was
delivered for service in September 2003. We expect to add a new Endeavour
Class tanker to our fleet in both 2004 and 2005, allowing us to retire older
ships and cancel non-operated charters.

In Alaska, we continued development drilling in the Kuparuk, Tabasco and West
Sak fields in the Greater Kuparuk Area, Prudhoe Bay satellite fields and the
Alpine field. In 2003, we, along with our co-venturers, drilled or
participated in 71 new development wells at Greater Prudhoe Bay, 17 new
development wells at Greater Kuparuk and five development wells at Alpine.
Also in 2003, funds were expended on the Alpine capacity expansion project that
is expected to start up in the second half of 2004.

In the Lower 48, we continued to explore and develop our acreage positions in
the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, South Texas, the San Juan Basin, the Permian
Basin, and the Texas Panhandle. In the Gulf of Mexico, development drilling
has been completed in the Magnolia and Princess Phase 1 fields. Sanction for
the K2 project development is expected in the first quarter of 2004.
Preliminary engineering for Princess Phase 2 and Ursa waterflood is expected
to begin in the first quarter of 2004. Magnolia’s tension-leg platform
construction is ongoing and first production is expected prior to the end of
2004. In February 2003, we began drilling the Lorien exploration well on Block
199, which was declared a discovery in July. The well has been temporarily
suspended pending evaluation of development alternatives. The Voss deepwater
exploratory well drilled in Keathley Canyon Block 511 was declared dry in early
2003 and as required was charged against 2002 earnings. The Yorick deepwater
exploratory well in Green Canyon Block 435 was declared a dry hole in late
2003.

Onshore capital was focused on natural gas developments in the San Juan Basin
of New Mexico and the Lobo Trend of South Texas. In addition, Lower 48 is
pursuing select opportunities in its other producing basins.



In Canada, we continued with development of the Stage III expansion-mining
project in the Canadian province of Alberta, which is expected to increase
our Canadian Syncrude production. The Aurora Train 2 project (the new mine)
started up in late-October 2003. The upgrader expansion project is expected
to start up in the second half of 2005. In the fourth quarter of 2003,
approval was obtained for our project in Surmont. Our ownership share is
43.5 percent. The Surmont lease covers over 200 square miles. This initial
development project is designed to use “steam assisted gravity drainage”
technology, with first oil production expected in 2006. In addition to these
projects, we also are involved in conventional oil and gas properties in
Canada.

During the fourth quarter of 2001, we began production of heavy crude oil from
the Hamaca project in Venezuela’s Orinoco Oil Belt. Construction of an
upgrader to convert heavy crude oil into a medium-grade crude oil continues.
Completion of the upgrader is expected by the end of 2004. We own a 40 percent
equity interest in the Hamaca project. Our other heavy-oil project in
Venezuela, Petrozuata, incurred capital expenditures in 2003 associated with
solids handling and restoration capacity projects, as well as ongoing drilling.

In addition to the Hamaca and Petrozuata developments, we have an interest in
the Corocoro oil discovery in Venezuela’s Gulf of Paria West. In April 2003,
Venezuelan authorities and co-venturers approved Phase I of the development
plan for the Corocoro field. We are the operator of the block. In September
2003, we acquired a 37.5 percent interest in the Gulf of Paria East Block. A
portion of the Corocoro discovery extends onto this block. Our interest in the
development is 32.2 percent.

In February 2003, Venezuelan authorities granted a 35-year license to
ChevronTexaco to appraise and develop Plataforma Deltana Block 2.
ChevronTexaco selected us as their minority partner in accordance with the
terms of the license, which was approved by the Venezuelan government in late
2003. We now have a 40 percent interest in the project. Plataforma Deltana
Block 2 is located to the east of our Corocoro discovery. Block 2 already has
a gas discovery on it, and additional drilling is planned for 2004.

In Brazil, we added joint-venture partners for our two deepwater blocks,
BM-ES-11 and BM-PAMA-3, and purchased additional seismic data in 2002. In
2003, 3-D seismic results indicated the prospect for BM-ES-11 was below
expectations, leading to a write-off of our leasehold investment and the
initiation of plans to exit the block. Further evaluation of BM-PAMA-3 is
planned for 2004.

In 2003, we continued with several development projects in the U.K. and
Norwegian sectors of the North Sea, including the Clair field in the U.K.
sector. We expect first production from Clair in late 2004. Late in the third
quarter of 2003, we and our co-venturers began oil production from the Grane
field in the Norwegian North Sea. Net peak production from proved reserves of
approximately 14,000 barrels per day is anticipated in 2005.

We continued the development of the CMS3 area, a single unitized project,
comprising five natural gas reservoirs in the southern sector of the U.K. North
Sea. Collectively, the fields are known as CMS3 due to their utilization of
the production and transportation facilities of our operated Caister Murdoch
System (CMS). In September 2002, production commenced from the Hawksley field,
followed in the fourth quarter by production at the Murdoch K field. During
2003, McAdam came onstream in the second quarter and Watt began in the fourth
quarter. Drilling operations on the final reservoir, Boulton H, are ongoing in
2004. We are the operator of CMS3 and hold a 59.5 percent interest.

In December 2003, our Board approved the development of the Britannia field
satellites in the North Sea. A development plan has been submitted for
government approval. These satellites are comprised of the Callanish and
Brodgar fields. The Callanish field is an oil reservoir, and the Brodgar field
is a gas



condensate reservoir with properties similar to those of Britannia. The fields
are planned to be developed jointly via a bridge-linked platform to Britannia,
with production startup scheduled for 2007. We are the operator of both fields
with an interest of 75 percent in Brodgar and 83.5 percent in Callanish.

Elsewhere in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea, in 2003, we, along with our
co-venturers, approved a plan to further develop the Ekofisk Area to increase
the recovery of oil and gas from the area by improving the area’s processing
capacity and reliability. The Ekofisk growth project consists of two
interrelated components: the construction and installation of a new steel
wellhead and process platform and an increase in capacity from existing
facilities. We expect to complete and install the steel jacket in 2004 and the
topsides early in the summer of 2005. Additional production from this
development is anticipated to begin in the fall of 2005. We are modifying the
existing Ekofisk Complex and four additional platforms to increase processing
capacity.

In 2002, we and our co-venturers, in conjunction with the government of the
Republic of Kazakhstan, declared the Kashagan field on the Kazakhstan shelf in
the north Caspian Sea to be commercial. A development plan for the
field was approved by the Republic of Kazakhstan in February 2004. Four of five
planned appraisal wells on Kashagan had been successfully completed by the end
of 2003. The fifth well is currently being tested. In May 2002, we along with
the other remaining co-venturers, completed the acquisition of proportionate
interests of two co-venturers' rights, which increased our ownership interest
from 7.14 percent to 8.33 percent. In October 2002, we and our co-venturers
announced a new hydrocarbon discovery in the Kazakhstan sector of the Caspian
Sea. In 2003, a 3-D survey was carried out over the Kalamkas field and an
initial appraisal well is planned for 2005.

During 2003, we exercised our pre-emptive rights related to B.G.
International’s sale of their share in the North Caspian License that includes
the Kashagan field. The transaction is expected to close in 2004, at which
time our interest in the license will increase from 8.33 percent to 10.19
percent. In November 2003, we and our co-venturers announced the successful
completion of the first offshore exploration wells on the Aktote and Kashagan
Southwest prospects. These two wells are located in the Kazakhstan sector of
the Caspian Sea in an area adjacent to the Kashagan field. Another exploration
well, on the Kairan prospect, completed drilling in 2003 and will be tested in
2004.

In late-December 2002, we began production from Phase I of our Peng Lai 19-3
development located on Block 11/05 in China’s Bohai Bay. During 2003, we
continued with planning and design for Phase II of the Peng Lai 19-3
development, which includes multiple wellhead platforms, central processing
facilities, and a floating storage and offloading facility. We are developing,
in conjunction with Phase II, the Peng Lai 25-6 oil field, located three miles
east of Peng Lai 19-3. We also drilled exploration wells on the Peng Lai 19-9
prospect and the Peng Lai 13-1 prospect, which resulted in two discoveries.
The Peng Lai 19-9-1 well is located two miles east of the Peng Lai 19-3 oil
field, and along with adjacent structures will be a part of the Phase II
development.

In the Timor Sea, we continued with development activities associated with the
Bayu-Undan gas recycle and gas development projects. We continued to drill
future production wells and have installed all major facilities, including two
production, processing and living quarters platforms and an unmanned production
platform. A multi-product floating, storage and offloading vessel was
connected to the production facilities during the fourth quarter of 2003.
First liquids production began in February 2004, and full capacity of 62,000
net barrels per day of condensate and natural gas liquids is anticipated to be
reached in the third quarter of 2004. An average rate of 23,000 net barrels
per day of combined condensate and natural gas liquids is expected for 2004.



We also have received approval of the gas development plan for the Bayu-Undan
project from the Timor Sea Designated Authority, concluded fiscal and legal
provisions with the government of Timor Lesté, and executed new production
sharing contract (PSC) arrangements with the Designated Authority. The gas
development project includes a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant, including a
pipeline to Darwin, Australia. The first LNG cargo from the 3.52
million-ton-per-year facility is scheduled for delivery in early 2006. During
the third quarter of 2003, construction of the LNG facility and the pipeline
began. In June 2003, we sold what currently equates to a 10.08 percent
interest in the unitized Bayu-Undan field; purchased other interests that
currently equate to a 2.65 percent interest in the field; sold a 43.3 percent
interest in the Bayu-Undan pipeline under construction; and sold a 43.3 percent
interest in Darwin LNG Pty Ltd (owner of the LNG plant to be constructed). The
net result is that we retain a 56.72 percent controlling interest in the
integrated project.

In Vietnam’s Block 15-1, the Su Tu Den Phase I (southwest area) development
project was approved in December 2001 and production from this area began in
late-October 2003. We also are evaluating the commerciality of the Su Tu Vang
fields and the northeast portion of the Su Tu Den field. In November 2003, we
announced the completion of a successful exploratory well in the Su Tu Trang
field in Block 15-1. Technical evaluation is in progress to assess the
reservoir potential of the Su Tu Trang field.

In the third quarter of 2002, we began production from two new wellhead
platforms in the Block 15-2 Rang Dong field in Vietnam. During late 2003,
field facilities were upgraded to include a utilities-living quarters platform,
and a central processing platform with facilities to enable gas lift, gas
export and water injection. With the completion of these facilities, water
injection is now possible on all three wellhead platforms and gas lift is
possible on the N-1 and E-1 wellhead platforms. These facilities became
operational in the fourth quarter of 2003.

We continued with the appraisal and development of key gas fields in Indonesia.
In 2003, we announced the successful test of the Suban-8 delineation well on
the southwest flank of the Suban gas field, located in the Corridor PSC of
South Sumatra. We also completed the successful test of the North Sumpal-1
well in the Sakakemang Block located in South Sumatra, and continued on the
construction of the South Jambi gas project in the South Jambi B Block also
located in South Sumatra. In addition, we continue to develop the offshore
Belanak and other fields in the Block B PSC in the Natuna Sea, for which a
floating production storage and offloading vessel is under construction. The
vessel is expected to be completed in the first half of 2005.

In May 2002, initial results showed that the first exploratory well drilled in
Block 34, offshore Angola, was a dry hole. In view of this information, we
reassessed the fair value of the remainder of the block and determined that our
investment in the block was impaired by $77 million, both before- and
after-tax. In December 2003, the second exploration well was drilled in Block
34, offshore Angola. The well encountered non-commercial gas and was plugged
and abandoned. In view of this information, we fully impaired our remaining
investment in the block.

In 2003, we obtained a 40 percent interest in Block 248 and a 20 percent
interest in Block 214, both offshore Nigeria. First exploration drilling is
planned for Block 248 in the second quarter of 2004.

Other capital spending for
E&P during the three-year period ended December 31,
2003, supported:

•

The Eldfisk waterflood development in Norway;

•

The Jade field development in the United Kingdom;

2004 Capital Budget

E&P’s 2004 capital budget for continuing operations is $5.4 billion, 19 percent
higher than actual expenditures in 2003. Twenty-six percent of E&P’s 2004
capital budget is planned for the United States, with 46 percent of that slated
for Alaska.

We have budgeted $628 million for worldwide exploration capital activities in
2004, with 17 percent of that amount, $106 million, allocated to the United
States. Outside the United States, significant exploration expenditures are
planned in Kazakhstan, Venezuela, the United Kingdom and Norway.

We plan to spend $656 million in 2004 for our Alaskan operations. A majority
of the capital spending will fund Prudhoe Bay, Greater Kuparuk and Western
North Slope operations—including additional work on the Alpine capacity
expansion project, Orion and West Sak field developments—construction of
Endeavour Class tankers, and the exploratory activity discussed above.

In the Lower 48, offshore capital expenditures will be focused on the continued
development of the Magnolia, Ursa and Princess fields in the deepwater Gulf of
Mexico. Onshore capital will focus primarily on developing natural gas
reserves within core areas, such as the San Juan Basin of New Mexico and the
Lobo Trend of South Texas.

E&P is directing $3.9 billion of its 2004 capital budget to international
projects. The majority of these funds will be directed to developing major
long-term projects, including the Bayu-Undan liquids and gas development
projects in the Timor Sea; the Hamaca heavy-oil project in Venezuela;
additional development of oil and gas reserves in offshore Block B and onshore
South Sumatra blocks in Indonesia; the second phase of Bohai Bay in China;
projects in the Caspian region, including Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline;
projects in Canada, including Syncrude, Surmont heavy-oil and the Mackenzie
Delta gas development; and the Qatargas 3 LNG facility in Qatar. In addition,
funds will be used to expand the company’s positions in the U.K. and Norwegian
sectors of the North Sea.

Costs incurred for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, relating
to the development of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves were $2,002
million, $1,631 million, and $1,423 million, respectively. As of December 31,
2003, estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved
undeveloped oil and gas reserves for the years 2004 through 2006 were projected
to be $1,767 million, $1,111 million, and $659 million, respectively.

R&M

Capital spending for continuing operations for R&M during the three-year period
ending December 31, 2003, was primarily for refinery-upgrade projects to
improve product yields, to meet new environmental standards, to improve the
operating integrity of key processing units, and to install advanced process
control technology, as well as for safety projects. Total capital spending for
continuing operations for R&M for the three-year period was $2.4 billion,
representing 18 percent of our total capital spending for continuing
operations.



Key projects during the three-year period included:

In early 2003, we completed three major projects: a polypropylene plant at the
Bayway refinery in Linden, New Jersey, and both a fluid catalytic cracking unit
and a S Zorb unit at the Ferndale, Washington, refinery. The Bayway
polypropylene plant utilizes propylene feedstock from the Bayway refinery to
make up to 775 million pounds per year of polypropylene. The plant became
operational in March 2003. At Ferndale, the fluid catalytic cracking unit
significantly improves gasoline production per barrel of crude input and the
new S Zorb unit reduces sulfur in gasoline. Both became fully operational in
2003.

Also in 2003, we made investments related to clean fuels, safety and
environmental projects throughout our refining system. We completed projects
at our refineries in Ponca City, Oklahoma and Roxana, Illinois, to produce the
low-sulfur gasoline required by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We
also began construction of a new diesel hydrotreater at the Rodeo facility of
our San Francisco area refinery that is expected to produce reformulated
California highway diesel an estimated one year ahead of the June 2006
deadline.

In July 2003, we completed the acquisition of certain refining assets in
Hartford, Illinois, from Premcor. The operations of these assets are being
integrated into the operations of our nearby Wood River refinery. The overall
production of the refinery will only increase slightly, but integration of the
new assets will enable the refinery to process heavier, lower cost crude oil.
Startup of the integrated facilities is expected in the second quarter of 2004.

Internationally, we continue to invest in our ongoing refining and marketing
operations, including a replacement reformer at our Humber refinery in the
United Kingdom and marketing growth in select countries in Europe and Asia.

2004 Capital Budget

R&M’s 2004 capital budget for continuing operations is $1.3 billion, a 9
percent increase over spending of $1.2 billion in 2003. Domestic spending is
expected to consume 81 percent of the R&M budget.

We plan to direct about $900 million of the R&M capital budget to domestic
refining, primarily to fund clean fuels projects in order to comply with new
EPA standards for refined products. Worldwide, clean fuels spending for our
R&M business is expected to be about $600 million, or 55 percent of the total
refining budget. Our U.S. marketing and transportation businesses are expected
to spend about $125 million, while the remaining budget will fund projects in
our international refining and marketing businesses in Europe and the Asia
Pacific region.



Emerging Businesses

Capital spending for Emerging Businesses during 2003 was primarily for
construction of the Immingham combined heat and power cogeneration plant near
the company’s Humber refinery in the United Kingdom. We expect the plant to be
operational in mid-2004.

Emerging Businesses’ 2004 capital budget of $62 million is primarily dedicated
to the completion of the Immingham plant.

Contingencies

Legal and Tax Matters

We accrue for contingencies when a loss is probable and the amounts can be
reasonably estimated. Based on currently available information, we believe
that it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability
exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material
adverse impact on the company’s financial statements.

All significant litigation arising from the March 27, 2000, explosion and fire
that occurred in an out-of-service butadiene storage tank at the K-Resin
styrene-butadiene copolymer (SBC) plant has now been resolved.

Environmental

We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state, and local
environmental laws and regulations, as are other companies in the petroleum
exploration and production industry; and refining, marketing and transportation
of crude oil and refined products businesses. The most significant of these
environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the:



•

U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to
offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for
the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations, as well as
potential liability for pollution damages.

These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in
the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in
most cases, require permits in association with new or modified operations.
These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in
connection with the application process, which can be expensive and
time-consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and
comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application. Many of the
delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the
applicant.

Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are
developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same
types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose
additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and
difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international
borders.

The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations
is neither clearly known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air
emission standards, water quality standards and stricter fuel regulations,
continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and regulations, including
those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are
expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the
United States and in other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of
potential impacts include air emission compliance and remediation obligations
in the United States. Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA has promulgated a
number of stringent limits on air emissions and established a federally
mandated operating permit program. Violations of the Clean Air Act and most
other environmental laws and regulations in the United States are enforceable
with civil and criminal sanctions.

The EPA also has promulgated specific rules governing the sulfur content of
gasoline, known generically as the “Tier II Sulfur Rules,” the first phase
requirements of which became applicable to our gasoline as of January 2004. To
meet the requirements, we are implementing a compliance strategy that relies on
the use of a combination of technologies, including our proprietary S Zorb
technology.

The EPA also has promulgated rules regarding the sulfur content in highway
diesel fuel, which become applicable in 2006. In April 2003, the EPA proposed
a rule regarding emissions from non-road diesel engines and limiting non-road
diesel fuel sulfur content. If promulgated, this rule would significantly
reduce non-road diesel fuel sulfur content limits as early as 2007. We are
currently evaluating S Zorb systems for removing sulfur from diesel fuel in
special applications. The refining industry is actively considering several
advanced and conventional technologies for complying with these rules. Because
the non-road rule is not final, we are still evaluating and developing capital
strategies for future compliance.
Additional areas of potential air-related impact are the proposed revisions to
the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and the Kyoto Protocol. In
July 1997, the EPA promulgated more stringent revisions to the NAAQS for ozone
and particulate matter. Since that time, final adoption of these revisions has
been the subject of litigation (

American Trucking Association, Inc. et al. v.
United States Environmental Protection Agency

) that eventually reached the U.S.
Supreme Court during the fall of 2000. In February 2001, the U.S. Supreme Court
remanded this matter, in part, to the EPA to address the implementation
provisions relating to the revised ozone NAAQS. If adopted, the revised NAAQS
could result in substantial future environmental expenditures for us.

In 1997, an international conference on global warming concluded an agreement,
known as the Kyoto Protocol, which called for reductions of certain emissions
that contribute to increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. The
United States has not ratified the treaty codifying the Kyoto Protocol



but may in the future. In addition, other countries where we have interests,
or may have interests in the future, have made commitments to the Kyoto
Protocol and are in various stages of formulating applicable regulations.
Currently, it is not possible to accurately estimate the costs that we could
incur to comply with such regulations, but such expenditures could be
substantial.

We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental
remediation obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws
and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their state equivalents.
Remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility arising from petroleum
releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous past and present
ConocoPhillips-owned and/or operated petroleum-marketing outlets throughout the
United States. Federal and state laws require that contamination caused by
such underground storage tank releases be assessed and remediated to meet
applicable standards. In addition to other cleanup standards, many states have
adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) for both soil
and groundwater. MTBE standards continue to evolve, and future environmental
expenditures associated with the remediation of MTBE-contaminated underground
storage tank sites could be substantial.

At RCRA permitted facilities, we are required to assess environmental
conditions. If conditions warrant, we may be required to remediate
contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to CERCLA, which is
often referred to as “Superfund,” the cost of corrective action activities
under RCRA corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us. Over
the next decade, we anticipate that significant ongoing expenditures for RCRA
remediation activities may be required, but such annual expenditures for the
near term are not expected to vary significantly from the range of such
expenditures we have experienced over the past few years. Longer term,
expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate
significantly.

We, from time to time, receive requests for information or notices of potential
liability from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a
potentially responsible party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On
occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those
agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert
potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are
not owned by us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past
operations. As of December 31, 2002, we reported we had been notified of
potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 58 sites around
the United States. In the 2002 report, sites from Phillips and Conoco were
listed separately resulting in eight duplicate listings. These duplicate
listings are consolidated in this 2003 report. At December 31, 2003, we had
combined the eight duplicate listings, reclassified one existing site, and
resolved six sites. Additionally, we had received 16 new notices of potential
liability, leaving 61 sites where we have been notified of potential liability.

For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less
than the total site remediation costs because the percentage of waste
attributable to us, versus that attributable to all other potentially
responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those
potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and
frequently so for state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites
where we are a party typically have had the financial strength to meet their
obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially responsible parties
could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially.
Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under
investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual
cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess site conditions,
apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some
instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability.
Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent
state agency approval. There are relatively few sites where we are a major
participant, and given the timing and amounts of anticipated expenditures,
neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all CERCLA
sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our
competitive or financial condition.



Expensed environmental costs were $593 million in 2003 and are expected to be
about $596 million in 2004 and $574 million in 2005. Capitalized environmental
costs were $522 million in 2003 and are expected to be about $742 million and
$967 million in 2004 and 2005, respectively.

Remediation Accruals

We accrue for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has
been incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made. These
accrued liabilities are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or
other third parties and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase
business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis).

Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that
require us to undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites
where we conduct, or once conducted, operations or at sites where
ConocoPhillips-generated waste was disposed. The accrual also includes a
number of sites we have identified that may require environmental remediation,
but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement
activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or
other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur significant costs
under both CERCLA and RCRA. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to
these costs, and under adverse changes in circumstances, potential liability
may exceed amounts accrued as of December 31, 2003.

Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to
site, depending on the mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation
technologies, diverse regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the
presence or absence of potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is
difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs.

At December 31, 2003, our balance sheet included a total environmental accrual
related to continuing operations of $1,119 million, compared with $743 million
at December 31, 2002. The increase in accruals from year-end 2002, primarily
resulted from evaluation of Conoco environmental liabilities during the
purchase price allocation period. We expect to incur the majority of these
expenditures within the next 30 years.

Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in
similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent in our
operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and
liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any
material adverse affect upon our results of operations or financial position as
a result of compliance with environmental laws and regulations.

Other

We have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, alternative
minimum tax credits, and loss carryforwards. Valuation allowances have been
established for certain foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards that
reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be
realized. Uncertainties that may affect the realization of these assets
include tax law changes and the future level of product prices and costs.
Based on our historical taxable income, our expectations for the future, and
available tax-planning strategies, management expects that the net deferred tax
assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as
reductions in future taxable income. The alternative minimum tax credit can be
carried forward indefinitely to reduce our regular tax liability.



NEW ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS

In December 2003, the FASB revised and reissued SFAS No. 132 (revised 2003),
“Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits—an
amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, and 106,” which revises and requires
additional disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit
plans. It does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans
required by previous Financial Accounting Board Standards. We adopted the
provisions of this Standard effective December 2003. Certain provisions of
this Standard regarding disclosure of information about foreign plans and
disclosure of estimated future benefit payments are not required until 2004.
The adoption of the provisions applicable to 2003 did not have an impact on our
results of operations or financial position, nor will the adoption of the
additional provisions in 2004 have an impact on our results of operations or
financial position.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of Liabilities and Equity,” to address the
balance sheet classification of certain financial instruments that have
characteristics of both liabilities and equity. This statement was immediately
effective for all contracts created or modified after May 31, 2003, and became
effective July 1, 2003, for all previously existing contracts. On November 7,
2003, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 150-3, which deferred certain
provisions of SFAS No. 150. As a result of adopting this new accounting
standard in the third quarter of 2003, and the subsequent November 7, 2003,
deferral of certain provisions, there was no impact on our 2003 financial
statements. We continue to monitor the deferral status of SFAS No. 150.

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations,” and SFAS
No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” which became effective on July
1, 2001, and January 1, 2002, respectively. The Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) has requested the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) to
consider the issue of whether SFAS Nos. 141 and 142 require interests held
under oil, gas and mineral leases to be separately classified as intangible
assets on the balance sheets of companies in the extractive industries.
Historically, in accordance with SFAS No. 19, “Financial Accounting and
Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies,” we have capitalized the cost of
oil and gas leasehold interests and, consistent with industry practice,
reported these assets as part of tangible E&P properties, plants and equipment.

If such interests were deemed to be intangible assets by the EITF, mineral
rights to extract oil and gas for both proved and unproved properties would be
classified separately from E&P properties, plants and equipment as intangible
assets on our balance sheet. This interpretation by the EITF would only affect
the classification of oil and gas mineral rights on our balance sheet and would
not affect total assets, net worth, results of operations or cash flows.

E&P properties, plants and equipment at December 31, 2003 and 2002, included
approximately $10.5 billion and $10.8 billion, respectively, of mineral rights
to extract oil and gas, net of accumulated depletion, that would be
reclassified on the balance sheet as intangible assets, if the interpretation
that the SEC requested the EITF to consider was applied. We plan to continue
to classify oil and gas mineral rights as E&P properties, plants and equipment
until further guidance is provided by the EITF.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting
policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1—Accounting Policies



in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for descriptions of our major
accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments
and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that
materially different amounts would have been reported under different
conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. These critical
accounting policies are discussed with the Audit and Compliance Committee on an
annual basis and are presented below.

Oil and Gas Accounting

Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special
accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition
of geological and geophysical seismic information, prior to the discovery of
proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to accounting for research
and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and exploratory
well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet, pending determination of
whether proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the prospect.

Property Acquisition Costs

For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for
impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For leasehold
acquisition costs that individually are relatively small, management exercises
judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately
will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold
information with others in the geographic area. For prospects in areas that
have had limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage
probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This
judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that
product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a
periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense.
This judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout
the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable
exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold
impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. By the end of the
contractual period of the leasehold, the impairment probability percentage will
have been adjusted to 100 percent if the leasehold is expected to be abandoned,
or will have been adjusted to zero percent if there is an oil or gas discovery
that is under development. See the supplemental Oil and Gas Operations
disclosures about Costs Incurred and Capitalized Costs for more information
about the amounts and geographic locations of costs incurred in acquisition
activity, and the amounts on the balance sheet related to unproved properties.

Exploratory Costs

For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or
“suspended,” on the balance sheet, pending a judgmental determination of
whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered by the
drilling effort. This judgment usually is made within two months of the
completion of the drilling effort, but can take longer, depending on the
complexity of the geologic structure. Accounting rules require that this
judgment be made at least within one year of well completion. If a judgment is
made that the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas
quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole and are reported in
exploration expense. Exploratory wells that are judged to have discovered
potentially economic quantities of oil and gas and that are in areas where a
major capital expenditure (e.g., a pipeline or offshore platform) would be
required before production could begin, and where the economic viability of
that major capital expenditure depends upon the successful completion of
further exploratory work in the area, remain capitalized on the balance sheet
as long as additional exploratory appraisal work is under way or firmly
planned. For complicated offshore exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual
to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several
years while we perform additional appraisal work on the potential oil and gas
field. Unlike leasehold acquisition costs, there is no periodic impairment
assessment of suspended exploratory well costs. Management continuously
monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work and
expenses the suspended well costs as dry holes when it judges that the
potential field does not warrant further exploratory efforts in the near term.



See the supplemental Oil and Gas Operations disclosures about Costs Incurred
and Capitalized Costs for more information about the amounts and geographic
locations of costs incurred in exploration activity and the amounts on the
balance sheet related to unproved properties, as well as the Wells In Progress
disclosure for the number and geographic location of wells not yet declared
productive or dry.

Proved Oil and Gas Reserves

Engineering estimates of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves in
oil and gas fields are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate
amounts because of the subjective judgments involved in developing such
information. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates,
accounting rules require supplemental disclosure of “proved” oil and gas
reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better
understanding the perceived value and future cash flows of a company’s oil and
gas operations. The judgmental estimation of proved oil and gas reserves also
is important to the income statement because the proved oil and gas reserve
estimate for a field serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production
calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortization of the capitalized
costs for that field. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the
engineering criteria that have to be met before estimated oil and gas reserves
can be designated as “proved.” Our reservoir engineering department has
policies and procedures in place that are consistent with these authoritative
guidelines. We have qualified and experienced internal engineering personnel
who make these estimates. Proved reserve estimates are updated annually and
take into account recent production and seismic information about each field.
Also, as required by authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when a
field will be permanently shut-in for economic reasons is based on an
extrapolation of oil and gas prices and operating costs prevalent at the
balance sheet date. This estimated date when production will end affects the
amount of estimated recoverable reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels
change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes.

Canadian Syncrude Reserves

Canadian Syncrude proven reserves cannot be measured precisely. Reserve
estimates of Canadian Syncrude are based on subjective judgments involving
geological and engineering assessments of in-place crude bitumen volume, the
mining plan, historical extraction recovery and upgrading yield factors,
installed plant operating capacity and operating approval limits. The
reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality
and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of
extracting the bitumen and upgrading it into a light sweet crude oil. Despite
the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, these estimates are
used in determining depreciation expense.

Impairment of Assets

Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever
changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant
deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset
group. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less
than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down
to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes
based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are
identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other
groups of assets—generally on a field-by-field basis for exploration and
production assets, at an entire complex level for downstream assets, or at a
site level for retail stores. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market
prices for long-lived assets, the fair value usually is based on the present
values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the
risks involved in the asset group. The expected future cash flows used for
impairment reviews and related fair-value calculations are based on judgmental
assessments of future production volumes, prices and costs, considering all
available information at the date of review. See Note 12—Property Impairments,
in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.



Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs

Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal
obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the
end of operations at production sites. The largest asset removal obligations
facing us involve removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around
the world, and oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska. The
estimated discounted costs of dismantling and removing these facilities are
accrued at the installation of the asset. Estimating the future asset removal
costs necessary for this accounting calculation is difficult. Most of these
removal obligations are many years in the future and the contracts and
regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices and
criteria will have to be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset
removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as well as political,
environmental, safety and public relations considerations. See Note
1—Accounting Policies and Note 13—Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued
Environmental Costs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for
additional information.

Business Acquisitions

Purchase Price Allocation

Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the
purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business.
For most assets and liabilities, purchase price allocation is accomplished by
recording the asset or liability at its estimated fair value. The most
difficult estimations of individual fair values are those involving properties,
plants and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. We use all available
information to make these fair value determinations and, for major business
acquisitions, typically engage an outside appraisal firm to assist in the fair
value determination of the acquired long-lived assets. We have, if necessary,
up to one year after the acquisition closing date to finish these fair value
determinations and finalize the purchase price allocation.

Intangible Assets and Goodwill

In connection with the acquisition of Tosco Corporation on September 14, 2001,
and the merger on August 30, 2002, we recorded material intangible assets for
tradenames, air emission permit credits, and permits to operate refineries.
These intangible assets were determined to have indefinite useful lives and so
are not amortized. This judgmental assessment of an indefinite useful life has
to be continuously evaluated in the future. If, due to changes in facts and
circumstances, management determines that these intangible assets then have
definite useful lives, amortization will have to commence at that time on a
prospective basis. As long as these intangible assets are judged to have
indefinite lives, they will be subject to periodic lower-of-cost-or-market
tests, which requires management’s judgment of the estimated fair value of
these intangible assets. See Note 6—Acquisition of Tosco Corporation, Note
3—Merger of Conoco and Phillips, and Note 12—Property Impairments, in the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.

Also in connection with the acquisition of Tosco and the merger, we recorded a
material amount of goodwill. Under the accounting rules for goodwill, this
intangible asset is not amortized. Instead, goodwill is subject to annual
reviews for impairment based on a two-step accounting test. The first step is
to compare the estimated fair value of any reporting units within the company
that have recorded goodwill with the recorded net book value (including the
goodwill) of the reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of the reporting
unit is higher than the recorded net book value, no impairment is deemed to
exist and no further testing is required that year. If, however, the estimated
fair value of the reporting unit is below the recorded net book value, then a
second step must be performed to determine the amount of the goodwill
impairment to record, if any. In this second step, the estimated fair value
from the first step is used as the purchase price in a hypothetical new
acquisition of the reporting unit. The various purchase business combination
rules are followed to determine a hypothetical purchase price allocation for
the reporting



unit’s assets and liabilities. The residual amount of goodwill that results
from this hypothetical purchase price allocation is compared with the recorded
amount of goodwill for the reporting unit, and the recorded amount is written
down to the hypothetical amount if lower. The reporting unit or units used to
evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the
manner in which the business is managed. A reporting unit is an operating
segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment. A
component is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which
discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly
reviews the operating results of that component. However, two or more
components of an operating segment shall be aggregated and deemed a single
reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. We
have determined that we have three reporting units for purposes of assigning
goodwill and testing for impairment. These are Worldwide Exploration and
Production, Worldwide Refining and Worldwide Marketing. Our Midstream,
Chemicals and Emerging Businesses operating segments were not assigned any
goodwill from the merger because the two predecessor companies’ operations did
not overlap in these operating segments so we were unable to capture
significant synergies and strategic advantages from the merger in these areas.

In our Exploration and Production operating segment, management reporting is
primarily organized based on geographic areas. All of these geographic areas
have similar business processes, distribution networks and customers, and are
supported by a worldwide exploration team and shared services organizations.
Therefore, all components have been aggregated into one reporting unit,
Worldwide Exploration and Production, which is the same as the operating
segment. In contrast, in our Refining and Marketing operating segment,
management reporting is primarily organized based on functional areas. Because
the two broad functional areas of Refining and Marketing have dissimilar
business processes and customers, we concluded that it would not be appropriate
to aggregate these components into only one reporting unit at the Refining and
Marketing operating segment level. Instead, we have identified two reporting
units within the operating segment: Worldwide Refining and Worldwide
Marketing. Components in those two reporting units have similar business
processes, distribution networks and customers. If we later reorganize our
businesses or management structure so that the components within these three
reporting units are no longer economically similar, the reporting units would
be revised and goodwill would be re-assigned using a relative fair value
approach in accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets.” Goodwill impairment testing at a lower reporting unit level could
result in the recognition of impairment that would not otherwise be recognized
at the current higher level of aggregation. In addition, the sale or
disposition of a portion of these three reporting units will be allocated a
portion of the reporting unit’s goodwill, based on relative fair values, which
will adjust the amount of gain or loss on the sale or disposition.

Because quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available,
management has to apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of
these reporting units for purposes of performing the first step of the periodic
goodwill impairment test. Management uses all available information to make
these fair value determinations, including the present values of expected
future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in
the assets and observed market multiples of operating cash flows and net
income, and may engage an outside appraisal firm for assistance. In addition,
if the first test step is not met, further judgment has to be applied in
determining the fair values of individual assets and liabilities for purposes
of the hypothetical purchase price allocation. Again, management has to use
all available information to make these fair value determinations and may
engage an outside appraisal firm for assistance. At year-end 2003, the
estimated fair values of our Worldwide Exploration and Production, Worldwide
Refining, and Worldwide Marketing reporting units, excluding those included in
discontinued operations, ranged from between 15 percent to 35 percent higher
than recorded net book values (including goodwill) of the reporting units.
However, a lower fair value estimate in the future for any of these reporting
units could result in impairment of the $15.1 billion of goodwill.



Inventory Valuation

Prior to the acquisition of Tosco in September 2001 and the merger in August
2002, our inventories on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) cost basis were
predominantly reflected on the balance sheet at historical cost layers
established many years ago, when price levels were much lower. Therefore,
prior to 2001, our LIFO inventories were relatively insensitive to current
price level changes. However, the acquisition of Tosco and the ConocoPhillips
merger added LIFO cost layers that were recorded at replacement cost levels
prevalent in late September 2001 and August 2002, respectively. As a result,
our LIFO cost inventories are now much more sensitive to
lower-of-cost-or-market impairment write-downs, whenever price levels fall. We
recorded a LIFO inventory lower-of-cost-or-market impairment in the fourth
quarter of 2001 due to a crude oil price deterioration. While crude oil is not
the only product in the company’s LIFO pools, its market value is a major
factor in lower-of-cost-or-market calculations. We estimate that additional
impairments could occur if a 60 percent/40 percent blended average of West
Texas Intermediate/Brent crude oil prices falls below $21.25 per barrel at a
reporting date. The determination of replacement cost values for the
lower-of-cost-or-market test uses objective evidence, but does involve judgment
in determining the most appropriate objective evidence to use in the
calculations.

Projected Benefit Obligations

Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit
pension and postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such
obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the
income statement. This also impacts the required company contributions into
the plans. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and
company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future
events, including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement,
mortality rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets,
future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care
services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we
engage outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these
projected benefit obligations. For Employee Retirement Income Security
Act-qualified pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of
plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in
determining required company contributions into plan assets. Due to differing
objectives and requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension
plan funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial
methods and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important
respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised benefits under
pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or
investment returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial
calculations significantly affect periodic financial statements and funding
patterns over time. Benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount
rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1 percent decrease in the
discount rate would increase annual benefit expense by $85 million, while a 1
percent decrease in the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual
benefit expense by $25 million.

OUTLOOK

After adjusting for asset dispositions, E&P’s worldwide production for 2004 is
expected to be about the same level as it was in 2003. The dispositions
contributed approximately 37,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 2003
production. For 2004, production increases in Asia Pacific and Latin America
are expected to offset net declines in the United States, Canada and the North
Sea.

In R&M, the optimization of spending related to clean fuels project initiatives
will be an important focus area during 2004. In addition, we expect our
average refinery crude oil utilization rate for 2004 to average about the same
as in 2003.



Crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which we
have no control, such as global economic conditions, political events, demand
growth, inventory levels, weather, competing fuels prices, and availability of
supply. Crude oil prices rose significantly in 2003 due to supply disruptions
during the year in several producing countries and the delays in the return of
Iraqi crude production to the market in the face of rising global oil demand.
As a result of these factors, global oil inventories remained at exceptionally
low levels throughout 2003. Low oil inventories, coupled with economic
recovery and the prospects for higher oil demand growth are expected to keep
prices elevated through the first half of 2004. U.S. natural gas prices
weakened moderately during the second half of 2003 from the very strong levels
experienced during the second quarter, but the annual average was significantly
higher in 2003 versus 2002. Prices weakened in the second half due to a strong
buildup of natural gas inventories during the summer and early fall, as mild
weather, weak industrial demand and fuel switching reduced natural gas demand.
At the same time, high prices and the startup of a mothballed regasification
terminal increased LNG imports to the United States. However, natural gas
prices rose moderately in December, reflecting continuing concerns about the
adequacy of gas supplies in the United States. Supply adequacy concerns are
expected to keep prices above historical levels in 2004.

Refining margins are subject to movements in the price of crude oil and other
feedstocks, and the prices of petroleum products, which are subject to market
factors over which we have no control, such as the U.S. and global economies;
government regulations; military, political and social conditions in oil
producing countries; seasonal factors that affect demand, such as the summer
driving months; and the levels of refining output and product inventories.
U.S. and international refining and marketing margins rose in 2003 versus 2002,
due to improved refined product demand and a series of supply disruptions.
U.S. refining margins were above the five-year historical average in 2003 as a
result of refinery outages in several regions of the United States, a product
pipeline rupture in Arizona, and labor strikes in Venezuela, which removed both
crude and refined products from the market. Combined with strong product
demand, product inventories were drawn down to extremely low levels in the
first half of the year, which elevated refining margins. Stronger demand in
the face of tight supplies also improved marketing margins in 2003 versus 2002.
The sustainability of current refining and marketing margins depends on the
continued recovery of the global economy and refined product demand growth.

In February 2003, the Venezuelan government implemented a currency exchange
control regime. The government has published legal instruments supporting the
controls, one of which establishes official exchange rates for the U.S. dollar.
The devaluation of the Venezuelan currency by approximately 17 percent in
February 2004 did not have a significant impact on our Venezuelan operations;
however, future changes in the exchange rate could have a significant impact on
our Venezuelan operations. In addition, our Venezuelan operations
remain subject to civil unrest in the country. Our Venezuelan operations contributed approximately
$150 million to our 2003 net income.

In June 2003, we and our co-venturers in the Mackenzie gas project in Canada
announced that funding and participation agreements have been reached and a
preliminary information package was submitted to relevant regulatory
authorities. The Mackenzie gas project involves natural gas production
facilities, compression and gathering pipelines in the Mackenzie Delta area,
and a pipeline system in the Mackenzie River Valley. The filing of the
information package is a key step in the process leading to the submission of
applications for the development of the natural gas fields and pipeline
facilities. Regulatory applications are expected to be filed in 2004. First
gas production is currently targeted to commence in late 2009.

In July 2003, we signed a Heads of Agreement with Qatar Petroleum for the
development of Qatargas 3, a large-scale LNG project located in Qatar and
servicing the U.S. natural gas market. This provides the framework for the
necessary agreements and the completion of key feasibility studies. Qatargas 3
would be an integrated project, jointly owned by us and Qatar Petroleum,
consisting of facilities to produce and liquefy gas from Qatar’s North field.
The LNG would be shipped from Qatar, and we would be



responsible for regasification and marketing within the United States. Average
daily gas sales volumes are projected to be approximately 1 billion cubic feet
per day with startup anticipated in the 2009 timeframe.

In late October 2003, we signed a Heads of Agreement with the Nigerian National
Petroleum Corporation, ENI and ChevronTexaco to conduct front-end engineering
and design work for an LNG facility to be constructed in Nigeria’s central
Niger Delta. The participants have agreed to form an incorporated joint
venture, Brass LNG Limited, to undertake the project. The engineering and
design studies are expected to be completed in 2005, and the facility is
targeted to be operational in 2009.

In December 2003, we signed a Statement of Intent with Qatar Petroleum
regarding the construction of a gas-to-liquids plant in Ras Laffan, Qatar. The
Statement of Intent initiates detailed technical and commercial pre-front-end
engineering and design studies and establishes principles for negotiating a
Heads of Agreement for an integrated reservoir-to-market plant. More definite
agreements are expected in 2004.

Also in December 2003, we announced the signing of an agreement with Freeport
LNG Development, L.P. to participate in its proposed LNG receiving terminal in
Quintana, Texas. We would acquire 1 billion cubic feet per day of
regasification capacity in the terminal for our use and obtain a 50 percent
interest in the general partnership managing the venture. The terminal will be
designed with a storage capacity of 6.9 billion cubic feet and a send-out
capacity of 1.5 billion cubic feet per day. Pending government approvals,
construction is scheduled to begin in the second half of 2004, with commercial
startup in mid-2007.

In addition, we and our co-venturer are pursuing a proposed LNG receiving
terminal in Harpswell, Maine. The proposal calls for construction of the
terminal at a site previously used as a U.S. Navy fuel depot. LNG would be
converted back to natural gas at the terminal for delivery through a new
pipeline that would connect the terminal to the existing pipeline grid.
Depending on receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals, construction could
begin in 2006, with the facility operational by 2009.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE “SAFE HARBOR” PROVISIONS OF THE
PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

This annual report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the
words “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “projects,” “believes,”
“estimates” and similar expressions.

We have based the forward-looking statements relating to our operations on our
current expectations, estimates and projections about ourselves and the
industries in which we operate in general. We caution you that these
statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks,
uncertainties and assumptions that we cannot predict. In addition, we have
based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future
events that may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual outcome and
results may differ materially from what we have expressed or forecast in the
forward-looking statements. Any differences could result from a variety of
factors, including the following:

•

Fluctuations in crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids
prices, refining and marketing margins and margins for our chemicals
business;

•

Changes in our business, operations, results and prospects;

•

The operation and financing of our midstream and chemicals joint ventures;



Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Financial Instrument Market Risk

We and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and
financial instruments that expose cash flows or earnings to changes in
commodity prices, foreign exchange rates or interest rates. We may use
financial and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage the risks produced
by changes in the prices of electric power, natural gas, crude oil and related
products, fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates,
or to exploit market opportunities.

Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “Authority Limitations”
document approved by our Board that prohibits the use of highly leveraged
derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity for
comparable valuations without approval from the Chief Executive Officer. The
Authority



Limitations document also authorizes the Chief Executive Officer to establish
the maximum Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company and compliance with
these limits is monitored daily. The Chief Financial Officer monitors risks
resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, while the
Executive Vice President of Commercial monitors commodity price risk. Both
report to the Chief Executive Officer. The Commercial group manages our
commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, monitors
related risks of our upstream and downstream businesses, and selectively takes
price risk to add value.

Commodity Price Risk

We operate in the worldwide crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural
gas liquids, and electric power markets and are exposed to fluctuations in the
prices for these commodities. These fluctuations can affect our revenues, as
well as the cost of operating, investing, and financing activities. Generally,
our policy is to remain exposed to market prices of commodities; however,
executive management may elect to use derivative instruments to hedge the price
risk of our crude oil and natural gas production, as well as refinery
margins.

Our Commercial group uses futures, forwards, swaps, and options in various
markets to optimize the value of our supply chain, which may move our risk
profile away from market average prices to accomplish the following objectives:

•

Balance physical systems. In addition to cash settlement prior to
contract expiration, exchange traded futures contracts also may be
settled by physical delivery of the commodity, providing another source
of supply to meet our refinery requirements or marketing demand;

•

Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally
remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert
fixed-price sales contracts, which are often requested by natural gas
and refined product consumers, to a floating market price;

•

Manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific
crude oil, natural gas, refined product and electric power
transactions; and

•

Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from these activities
to do a limited amount of trading not directly related to our physical
business. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, the
gains or losses from this activity were not material to our cash flows
or income from continuing operations.

We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially
result on a single day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions
on the derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments
held or issued, including commodity purchase and sales contracts recorded on
the balance sheet at December 31, 2003, as derivative instruments in accordance
with SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,” as amended. Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence
level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for those instruments issued or
held for trading purposes at December 31, 2003 and 2002, was immaterial to our
net income and cash flows. The VaR for instruments held for purposes other
than trading at December 31, 2003 and 2002, was also immaterial to our net
income and cash flows.



Interest Rate Risk

The following tables provide information about our financial instruments that
are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The debt tables present principal
cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity
dates; the derivative table shows the notional quantities on which the cash
flows will be calculated by swap termination date. Weighted-average variable
rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting
date. The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair
value. The fair value of the fixed-rate financial instruments is estimated
based on quoted market prices.

In October and early November 2003, we executed certain interest rate swaps
that had the effect of converting $1.5 billion of debt from fixed to floating
rate. Under SFAS 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,” these swaps were designated as hedging the exposure to changes in
the fair value of $400 million of 3.625% Notes due 2007, $750 million of 6.35%
Notes due 2009, and $350 million of 4.75% Notes due 2012. These swaps qualify
for the shortcut method of hedge accounting, so over the term of the swaps we
will not recognize gain or loss due to ineffectiveness in the hedge.

Foreign Currency Risk

We have foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from operations in over
40 countries around the world. We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to
currency rate changes, although we may choose to selectively hedge exposures to
foreign currency rate risk. Examples include firm commitments for capital
projects, certain local currency tax payments and dividends, and cash returns
from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming
year.

At December 31, 2003, we held foreign currency swaps hedging short-term
intercompany loans between European subsidiaries and a U.S. subsidiary.
Although these swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, we
elected not to utilize hedge accounting as allowed by SFAS No. 133. As a
result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency swaps is
recorded directly in earnings. Since the gain or loss on the swaps is offset
by the gain or loss from remeasuring the intercompany loans into the functional
currency of the lender or borrower, there would be no impact to income from an
adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the December 31, 2003, exchange
rates. The notional and fair market values of these positions at December 31,
2003, were as follows:

At December 31, 2002, ConocoPhillips had the following significant foreign
currency derivative contracts:

•

Approximately $194 million in foreign currency swaps hedging the
company’s European commercial paper program, with a fair value of $7.1
million;

•

Approximately $536 million in foreign currency swaps hedging
short-term intercompany loans between U.K. subsidiaries and a U.S.
subsidiary, with a fair value of $9 million; and

•

Approximately $24 million in foreign currency swaps hedging the
company’s firm purchase and sales commitments for gasoline in Germany,
with a negative fair value of $4 million.

Although these swaps hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, the
company elected not to utilize hedge accounting as allowed by SFAS No. 133. As
a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency swaps is
recorded directly in earnings. Assuming an adverse hypothetical 10 percent
change in the December 31, 2002, exchange rates, the potential foreign currency
remeasurement loss in non-cash pretax earnings from these swaps, intercompany
loans, and commercial paper would be approximately $3 million.

In addition to the intercompany loans discussed above, at December 31, 2002,
U.S. subsidiaries held long-term sterling-denominated intercompany receivables
totaling $152 million due from a U.K. subsidiary. A Norwegian subsidiary held
$198 million of intercompany U.S. dollar-denominated receivables due from its
U.S. parent at December 31, 2002. The potential foreign currency remeasurement
gains or losses in non-cash pretax earnings from a hypothetical 10 percent
change in the year-end 2002 exchange rates from these intercompany balances was
$35 million.

Report of Management

Management prepared, and is responsible for, the consolidated financial
statements and the other information appearing in this annual report. The
consolidated financial statements present fairly the company’s financial
position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. In preparing its
consolidated financial statements, the company includes amounts that are based
on estimates and judgments that management believes are reasonable under the
circumstances.

The company maintains internal controls designed to provide reasonable
assurance that the company’s assets are protected from unauthorized use and
that all transactions are executed in accordance with established
authorizations and recorded properly. The internal controls are supported by
written policies and guidelines and are complemented by a staff of internal
auditors. Management believes that the internal controls in place at December
31, 2003, provide reasonable assurance that the books and records reflect the
transactions of the company and there has been compliance with its policies and
procedures.

The company’s financial statements have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP,
independent auditors selected by the Audit and Compliance Committee of the
Board of Directors. Management has made available to Ernst & Young LLP all of
the company’s financial records and related data, as well as the minutes of
stockholders’ and directors’ meetings.

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

ConocoPhillips

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ConocoPhillips
as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated statements of
income, changes in common stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2003. Our audits also included
the condensed consolidating financial information and financial statement
schedule listed in the Index in Item 8. These financial statements, condensed
consolidating financial information and schedule are the responsibility of the
company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements, condensed consolidating financial information and
schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of ConocoPhillips at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the consolidated results of its operations and
its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. Also, in our opinion, the related condensed consolidating financial
information and financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to
the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material
respects the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2003
ConocoPhillips adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.
143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” SFAS No. 123, “Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation,” and Financial Accounting Standards Board
Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” and in
2001 ConocoPhillips changed its method of accounting for the costs of major
maintenance turnarounds.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

ConocoPhillips

Note 1—Accounting Policies



n

Inventories—

We have several valuation methods for our various types of
inventories and consistently use the following methods for each type of
inventory. Crude oil, petroleum products, and Canadian Syncrude inventories
are valued at the lower of cost or market in the aggregate, primarily on the
last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis. Any necessary lower-of-cost-or-market
write-downs are recorded as permanent adjustments to the LIFO cost basis.
LIFO is used to better match current inventory costs with current revenues
and to meet tax-conformity requirements. Costs include both direct and
indirect expenditures incurred in bringing an item or product to its
existing condition and location, but not unusual/non-recurring costs or
research and development costs. Materials, supplies and other miscellaneous
inventories are valued using the weighted-average-cost method, consistent
with general industry practice. Merchandise inventories at our retail
marketing outlets are valued using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) retail
method, consistent with general industry practice.

n

Derivative Instruments—

All derivative instruments are recorded on the
balance sheet at fair value in either accounts and notes receivable, other
assets, accounts payable, or other liabilities and deferred credits.
Recognition of the gain or loss that results from recording and adjusting
a derivative to fair value depends on the purpose for issuing or holding
the derivative. Gains and losses from derivatives that are not used as
hedges are recognized immediately in earnings. For derivative instruments
that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gains or losses
from adjusting the derivative to its fair value will be immediately
recognized in earnings and, to the extent the hedge is effective, offset
the concurrent recognition of changes in the fair value of the hedged
item. Gains or losses from derivative instruments that are designated and
qualify as a cash flow hedge will be recorded on the balance sheet in
accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) until the hedged transaction
is recognized in earnings; however, to the extent the change in the value
of the derivative exceeds the change in the anticipated cash flows of the
hedged transaction, the excess gains or losses will be recognized
immediately in earnings.

In the consolidated income statement, gains and losses from derivatives that
are held for trading and not directly related to our physical business are
recorded in other income. Gains and losses from derivatives used for other
purposes are recorded in either sales and other operating revenues, other
income, purchased crude oil and products, interest and debt expense, or
foreign currency transaction gains/losses, depending on the purpose for
issuing or holding the derivative.

n

Oil and Gas Exploration and Development—

Oil and gas exploration and
development costs are accounted for using the successful efforts method of
accounting.

Property Acquisition Costs—

Oil and gas leasehold acquisition costs are
capitalized and included in the balance sheet caption properties, plants
and equipment. Leasehold impairment is recognized based on exploratory
experience and management’s judgment. Upon discovery of commercial
reserves, leasehold costs are transferred to proved properties.

Exploratory Costs—

Geological and geophysical costs and the costs of
carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are expensed as incurred.
Exploratory well costs are capitalized pending further evaluation of
whether economically recoverable reserves have been found. If
economically recoverable reserves are not found, exploratory well costs
are expensed as dry holes. All exploratory wells are evaluated for
economic viability within one year of well completion. Exploratory wells
that discover potentially economic reserves that are in areas where a
major capital expenditure would be required before production could
begin, and where the economic viability of that major capital expenditure
depends upon the successful completion of further exploratory work in the
area, remain capitalized as long as the additional exploratory work is
under way or firmly planned.



Development Costs—

Costs incurred to drill and equip development wells,
including unsuccessful development wells, are capitalized.

Depletion and Amortization—

Leasehold costs of producing properties are
depleted using the unit-of-production method based on estimated proved
oil and gas reserves. Amortization of intangible development costs is
based on the unit-of-production method using estimated proved developed
oil and gas reserves.





Environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized, depending upon their
future economic benefit. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition
caused by past operations, and do not have a future economic benefit, are
expensed. Liabilities for these expenditures are recorded on an
undiscounted basis (unless acquired in a purchase business acquisition) when
environmental assessments or cleanups are probable and the costs can be
reasonably estimated. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from
other parties, such as state reimbursement funds, are recorded as assets
when their receipt is probable.

n

Stock-Based Compensation—

Effective January 1, 2003, we voluntarily
adopted the fair-value accounting method provided for under SFAS No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” We used the prospective
transition method provided under SFAS 123, applying the fair-value
accounting method and recognizing compensation expense equal to the
fair-market value on the grant date for all stock options granted or
modified after December 31, 2002.

Employee stock options granted prior to 2003 continue to be accounted for
under Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25, “Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees,” and related Interpretations. Because the
exercise price of our employee stock options equals the market price of the
underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is generally
recognized under APB No. 25. The following table displays pro forma
information as if the provisions of SFAS No. 123 had been applied to all
employee stock options granted:

Foreign Currency Translation—

Adjustments resulting from the process of
translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S.
dollars are included in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss in
common stockholders’ equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and
losses are included in current earnings. Most of our foreign
operations use their local currency as the functional currency.

n

Income Taxes—

Deferred income taxes are computed using the liability
method and are provided on all temporary differences between the
financial-reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and
liabilities, except for deferred taxes on income considered to be
permanently reinvested in certain foreign subsidiaries and foreign
corporate joint ventures. Allowable tax credits are applied currently
as reductions of the provision for income taxes.



n

Net Income Per Share of Common Stock—

Basic income per share of common
stock is calculated based upon the daily weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding during the year, including unallocated shares held by the stock savings feature of the ConocoPhillips Savings
Plan. Diluted income per share of common stock includes the above,
plus “in-the-money” stock options issued under our compensation plans.
Treasury stock and shares held by the Compensation and Benefits Trust
(CBT) are excluded from the daily weighted-average number of common shares outstanding in both calculations.

n

Capitalized Interest—

Interest from external borrowings is capitalized
on major projects with an expected construction period of one year or
longer. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of the underlying
asset and is amortized over the useful lives of the assets in the same
manner as the underlying assets.

n

Accounting for Sales of Stock by Subsidiary or Equity Investees—

We
recognize a gain or loss upon the direct sale of equity by our
subsidiaries or equity investees if the sales price differs from our
carrying amount, and provided that the sale of such equity is not part
of a broader corporate reorganization.

Note 2—Changes in Accounting Principles

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations,” which applies to legal obligations associated with the
retirement and removal of long-lived assets. SFAS No. 143 requires entities to
record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the
period when it is incurred (typically when the asset is installed at the
production location). When the liability is initially recorded, the entity
capitalizes the cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related
properties, plants and equipment. Over time, the liability is increased for
the change in its present value each period, and the initial capitalized cost
is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset.

Application of this new accounting principle resulted in an initial increase in
net properties, plants and equipment of $1.2 billion and an asset retirement
obligation liability increase of $1.1 billion. The cumulative effect of the
change increased 2003 net income by $145 million (after reduction of income
taxes of $21 million). The 2003 effect of the adoption increased income from
continuing operations and net income for 2003 by $32 million, or $.05 per basic
and diluted share.

We have numerous asset removal obligations that we are required to perform
under law or contract once an asset is permanently taken out of service. Most
of these obligations are not expected to be paid until several years, or
decades, in the future and will be funded from general company resources at the
time of removal. Our largest individual obligations are related to fixed-base
offshore production platforms around the world and to production facilities and
pipelines in Alaska.

SFAS No. 143 calls for measurements of asset retirement obligations to include,
as a component of expected costs, an estimate of the price that a third party
would demand, and could expect to receive, for bearing the uncertainties and
unforeseeable circumstances inherent in the obligations, sometimes referred to
as a market-risk premium. To date, the oil and gas industry has no examples of
credit-worthy third parties who are willing to assume this type of risk, for a
determinable price, on major oil and gas production facilities and pipelines.
Therefore, because determining such a market-risk premium would be an arbitrary
process, we have excluded it from our SFAS No. 143 estimates.



During 2003, our overall asset retirement obligation changed as follows:

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities,” (FIN 46) to expand existing accounting guidance
about when a company should include in its consolidated financial statements
the assets, liabilities and activities of another entity. In general, a
variable interest entity (VIE) is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any
other legal structure used for business purposes that either (a) does not have
equity investors with voting rights or (b) has equity investors that do not
provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its
activities. FIN 46 requires a VIE to be consolidated by a company if that
company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the VIE’s activities,
is entitled to receive a majority of the VIE’s residual returns, or both (the
company required to consolidate is called the primary beneficiary). It also
requires deconsolidation of a VIE if a company is not the primary beneficiary
of the VIE. The interpretation also requires disclosures about VIEs that a
company does not have to consolidate, but in which it has a significant
variable interest, and about any potential VIE when a company is unable to
obtain the information necessary to confirm if an entity is a VIE or determine
if a company is the primary beneficiary.



In December 2003, the FASB issued a revision to FIN 46 to clarify some of the
provisions and to exempt certain entities from its guidance. Under the new
guidance, special effective date provisions apply to enterprises that have
fully or partially applied FIN 46 prior to the revision. The consolidation
requirements of FIN 46, as revised, apply to all special purpose entities for
periods ending after December 15, 2003. For all other types of variable
interest entities the consolidation requirement applies for periods ending
after March 15, 2004.

We adopted FIN 46 in the third quarter of 2003, with retroactive application to
January 1, 2003, for VIEs involving synthetic leases and certain other
financing structures as discussed below. We adopted FIN 46 for such VIEs
because our work on these VIEs was complete and we believed the FASB’s
potential modifications of FIN 46 interpretive guidance was unlikely to change
the primary beneficiary determination for these VIEs. We consolidated all VIEs
created prior to February 1, 2003 (except as noted below), in which we
concluded we were the primary beneficiary. In addition, we deconsolidated an
entity where we determined we were not the primary beneficiary. The revision
of FIN 46 did not change our accounting for any of the entities we consolidated
or deconsolidated under FIN 46 in the third quarter. We continue to review FIN
46 and related guidance. If subsequent guidance or interpretation is different
from our current understanding, it is possible that our determination of VIEs
and primary beneficiaries could change.

There are two entities which could potentially be VIEs for which we were unable
to obtain sufficient information to confirm that the entities were VIEs or
determine if we are the primary beneficiary. In February 2003, we entered into
two agreements establishing separate guarantee facilities of $50 million each
for two liquefied natural gas ships that were then under construction. Subject
to the terms of each such facility, we will be required to make payments should
the charter revenue generated by the respective ship fall below certain
specified minimum thresholds, and we will receive payments to the extent that
such revenues exceed those thresholds. The net maximum future payments that we
may have to make over the 20-year terms of the two agreements could be up to an
aggregate of $100 million. Actual gross payments over the 20 years could
exceed that amount to the extent cash is received by us. In September 2003,
the first ship was delivered to its owner and the second ship is scheduled for
delivery to its owner in 2005. We have determined that the agreements give us
a variable interest in the two entities involved, but we do not have enough
information regarding these entities and their activities to confirm that the
entities are VIEs or to determine if we are the primary beneficiary. With
respect to the first ship, the amount drawn under the guarantee facility at
December 31, 2003, was less than $1 million. We continue to make efforts to
obtain the information required to complete the FIN 46 analysis. We currently
account for the guarantees under these agreements as guarantees and contingent
liabilities. See Note 16—Guarantees for additional information.

The adoption of FIN 46 for VIEs involving synthetic leases and certain other
financing structures resulted in the following:

Consolidated VIEs

•

We consolidated certain VIEs from which we lease certain ocean
vessels, airplanes, refining assets, marketing sites and office
buildings. The consolidation increased net properties, plants and
equipment by $940 million and increased assets of discontinued
operations held for sale by $726 million (both are collateral for the
debt obligations); increased cash by $225 million; increased debt by
$2.4 billion; increased minority interest by $90 million; reduced other
accruals by $263 million, and resulted in a cumulative after-tax
effect-of-adoption loss that decreased net income and common
stockholders’ equity by $240 million. However, during 2003 we
exercised our option to purchase most of these assets and as a result,
the leasing arrangements and our involvement with all but one of the
associated VIEs was terminated. See Note 14—Debt for more



information about the resulting debt redemptions. At December 31, 2003,
we continue to lease refining assets totaling $126 million, which are
collateral for the debt obligations of $126 million from a VIE. Other
than the obligation to make lease payments and residual value guarantees,
the creditors of the VIE have no recourse to our general credit. In
addition, we discontinued hedge accounting for an interest rate swap
since it had been designated as a cash flow hedge of the variable
interest rate component of a lease with a VIE that is now consolidated.
At December 31, 2003, the fair market value of the swap was a liability
of $13 million.

Ashford Energy Capital S.A. continues to be consolidated in our
financial statements under the provisions of FIN 46 because we are the
primary beneficiary. In December 2001, in order to raise funds for
general corporate purposes, Conoco and Cold Spring Finance S.a.r.l.
formed Ashford Energy Capital S.A. through the contribution of a $1
billion Conoco subsidiary promissory note and $500 million cash.
Through its initial $500 million investment, Cold Spring is entitled to
a cumulative annual preferred return, based on three-month LIBOR rates,
plus 1.27 percent. The preferred return at December 31, 2003, was 2.48
percent. In 2008, and each 10-year anniversary thereafter, Cold Spring
may elect to remarket their investment in Ashford, and if unsuccessful,
could require ConocoPhillips to provide a letter of credit in support
of Cold Spring’s investment, or in the event that such letter of credit
is not provided, then cause the redemption of their investment in
Ashford. Should ConocoPhillips’ credit rating fall below investment
grade, Ashford would require a letter of credit to support $475 million
of the term loans, as of December 31, 2003, made by Ashford to other
ConocoPhillips subsidiaries. If the letter of credit is not obtained
within 60 days, Cold Spring could cause Ashford to sell the
ConocoPhillips subsidiary notes. At December 31, 2003, Ashford held
$1.6 billion of ConocoPhillips subsidiary notes and $25 million in
investments unrelated to ConocoPhillips. We report Cold Spring’s
investment as a minority interest because it is not mandatorily
redeemable and the entity does not have a specified liquidation date.
Other than the obligation to make payment on the subsidiary notes
described above, Cold Spring does not have recourse to our general
credit.

Unconsolidated VIEs

•

Phillips 66 Capital II (Trust) was deconsolidated under the
provisions of FIN 46 because ConocoPhillips is not the primary
beneficiary. During 1997 in order to raise funds for general corporate
purposes, we formed the Trust (a statutory business trust), in which we
own all common beneficial interests. The Trust was created for the
sole purpose of issuing mandatorily redeemable preferred securities to
third-party investors and investing the proceeds thereof in an
approximate equivalent amount of subordinated debt securities of
ConocoPhillips. Application of FIN 46 required deconsolidation of the
Trust, which increased debt by $361 million since the 8% Junior
Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures due 2037 were no longer
eliminated in consolidation, and the $350 million of mandatorily
redeemable preferred securities were deconsolidated.

In 2003, we recorded a charge of $240 million (after an income tax benefit of
$145 million) for the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 46. The effect of
adopting FIN 46 increased 2003 income from continuing operations by $34
million, or $.05 per basic and diluted share. Excluding the cumulative effect,
the adoption of FIN 46 increased net income by $139 million, or $.20 per basic
and diluted share in 2003.

Stock-Based Compensation

Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted the fair-value accounting method provided
for under SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” We used the
prospective transition method provided under SFAS 123, applying the fair-value
accounting method and recognizing compensation expense for all stock options
granted or modified after December 31, 2002. See Note 1—Accounting Policies
and Note 22—Employee Benefit Plans for additional information.



Other

Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted SFAS No. 145, “Rescission of FASB
Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical
Corrections.” The adoption of SFAS No. 145 requires that gains and losses on
extinguishments of debt no longer be presented as extraordinary items in the
income statement. Accordingly, losses from the extinguishment of debt of $16
million (after reduction for income taxes of $8 million), previously reported
as an extraordinary item in 2002, have been reclassified as a $24 million
charge to other income with the tax benefit reclassified to provision for
income taxes. Similarly, in 2001, a loss from the early retirement of debt of
$10 million (after reduction for income taxes of $4 million), has been
reclassified as a $14 million charge to other income with the tax benefit
reclassified to provision for income taxes.

In December 2003, the FASB revised and reissued SFAS No. 132 (revised 2003),
“Employer’s Disclosures about Pensions and Other
Postretirement Benefits—an
amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88 and 106.” While requiring certain new
disclosures, the new Standard does not change the measurement or recognition of
employee benefit plans. We adopted the provisions of this Standard effective
December 2003, except for certain provisions regarding disclosure of
information about estimated future benefit payments which are not required
until periods ending after December 15, 2004.

Effective January 1, 2001, the company changed its method of accounting for the
costs of major maintenance turnarounds from the accrue-in-advance method to the
expense-as-incurred method to reflect the impact of a turnaround in the period
that it occurs. The new method is preferable because it results in the
recognition of costs at the time obligations are incurred. The cumulative
effect of this accounting change increased net income in 2001 by $28 million
(after reduction for income taxes of $15 million).

Note 3—Merger of Conoco and Phillips

On August 30, 2002, Conoco and Phillips combined their businesses by merging
with separate acquisition subsidiaries of ConocoPhillips (the merger). As a
result, each company became a wholly owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips. For
accounting purposes, Phillips was treated as the acquirer of Conoco, and
ConocoPhillips was treated as the successor of Phillips. Conoco’s operating
results have been included in ConocoPhillips’ consolidated financial statements
since the merger date.

Immediately after the closing of the merger, former Phillips stockholders held
approximately 56 percent of the outstanding shares of ConocoPhillips common
stock, while former Conoco stockholders held approximately 44 percent.
ConocoPhillips common stock, listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the
symbol “COP,” began trading on September 3, 2002.

The primary reasons for the merger and the principal factors that contributed
to a purchase price that resulted in the recognition of goodwill were:

•

The combination of Conoco and Phillips would create a stronger,
major, integrated oil company with the benefits of increased size and
scale, improving the stability of the combined business’ earnings in
varying economic and market climates;

•

ConocoPhillips would emerge with a global presence in both upstream
and downstream petroleum businesses, increasing its overall
international presence to over 40 countries while maintaining a strong
domestic base; and

•

Combining the two companies’ operations would provide significant
synergies and related cost savings, and improve future access to
capital.



The $16 billion purchase price attributed to Conoco for accounting purposes was
based on an exchange of Conoco shares for ConocoPhillips common shares.
ConocoPhillips issued approximately 293 million shares of common stock and
approximately 23.3 million of employee stock options in exchange for 627
million shares of Conoco common stock and 49.8 million Conoco stock options.
The common stock was valued at $53.15 per share, which was Phillips’ average
common stock price over the two-day trading period immediately before and after
the November 18, 2001, public announcement of the transaction. The Conoco
stock options, the fair value of which was determined using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model, were exchanged for ConocoPhillips stock options valued at
$384 million. Transaction-related costs, included in the purchase price, were
$78 million.

The allocation of the purchase price to specific assets and liabilities was
based, in part, upon an outside appraisal of the fair value of Conoco’s assets.
The following table summarizes the final purchase price allocation of the fair
values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of August 30, 2002:

Goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets recorded in the acquisition
are not subject to amortization. However, goodwill and intangible assets are
tested periodically for impairment as is required by SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets.”



The acquired intangible assets include $441 million assigned to marketing
tradenames, which are not subject to amortization, $95 million assigned to
refining technology, with a weighted-average amortization period of 12 years,
and $18 million assigned to other intangible assets, with a weighted-average
amortization period of eight years.

We assigned the Conoco goodwill to specific reporting units in the fourth
quarter of 2003. Previously, it had all been reported as part of Corporate and
Other. Included in the $12,721 million of goodwill is $3,841 million
attributable to recording a liability required for deferred taxes under
purchase accounting. This, and the remaining goodwill of $8,880 million, was
assigned to reporting units based on the benefits received by the units from
the synergies and strategic advantages of the merger. The $12,721 million of
goodwill has been allocated to three reporting units. See Note
11—Goodwill and
Intangibles for additional information. None of the goodwill is deductible for
tax purposes. During 2003, the balance of goodwill was adjusted upward by $642
million, primarily due to revisions in the valuation of properties, plants and
equipment, and assumed contingent liabilities.

The purchase price allocation included $246 million of in-process research and
development costs related to Conoco’s natural gas-to-liquids and other
technologies. In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 4, “Applicability of
FASB Statement No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase
Method,” the value assigned to the research and development activities was
charged to selling, general and administrative expenses in the Emerging
Businesses segment at the date of the merger, as these research and development
costs had no alternative future use.

During 2001, both Phillips and Conoco entered into other significant
transactions that are not reflected in each of their historical income
statements for the full year 2001. The pro forma results have been prepared as
if the Phillips’ September 14, 2001, acquisition of Tosco Corporation (Tosco)
(see Note 6—Acquisition of Tosco Corporation) and Conoco’s July 16, 2001, $4.6
billion acquisition of Gulf Canada Resources Limited occurred on January 1,
2001. Gulf Canada Resources Limited was a Canadian-based independent
exploration and production company with primary operations in Western Canada,
Indonesia, the Netherlands and Ecuador.

The pro forma results reflect the following:

The pro forma adjustments use estimates and assumptions based on currently
available information. Management believes that the estimates and assumptions
are reasonable, and that the significant effects of the transactions are
properly reflected.

The pro forma information does not reflect any anticipated synergies that might
be achieved from combining the operations. The pro forma information is not
intended to reflect the actual results that would have occurred had the
companies been combined during the periods presented. This pro forma
information is not intended to be indicative of the results of operations that
may be achieved by ConocoPhillips in the future.



Note 4—Discontinued Operations

During 2002 and 2003, we disposed of, or had committed to a plan to dispose of,
certain U.S. retail and wholesale marketing assets, certain U.S. refining and
related assets, certain U.S. midstream natural gas gathering and processing
assets, and exploration and production assets in the Netherlands. Some of
these planned dispositions were mandated by the FTC as a condition of the
merger. For reporting purposes, these operations are classified as
discontinued operations, and in Note 28-Segment Disclosures and Related
Information, these operations are included in Corporate and Other.

FTC—Mandated Divestitures

In the fourth quarter of 2002, we sold our propane terminal assets at Jefferson
City, Missouri, and East St. Louis, Illinois.

During 2003 we sold:

•

Our Woods Cross business unit, which includes the Woods Cross,
Utah, refinery; the Utah, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming Phillips-branded
motor fuel marketing operations (both retail and wholesale) and
associated assets; and a refined products terminal in Spokane,
Washington;

•

Certain midstream natural gas gathering and processing assets in
southeast New Mexico, and certain midstream natural gas gathering
assets in West Texas; and

•

Our Commerce City, Colorado, refinery, and related crude oil
pipelines, and our Colorado Phillips-branded motor fuel marketing
operations (both retail and wholesale).

As a result, all asset dispositions mandated by the FTC as a condition of the
merger have been completed.

Other Dispositions

In the fourth quarter of 2002, we committed to and initiated a plan to dispose
of 3,200 marketing sites that did not fit into our long-range plans. In
connection with the anticipated sale of these retail sites, we recorded charges
in 2002 totaling $1,412 million before-tax, $1,008 million after-tax, primarily
related to the impairment of properties, plants and equipment ($249 million);
goodwill ($257 million); intangible asset ($429 million); and provisions for
losses and penalties associated with various operating lease commitments ($477
million).

The intangible asset represented the Circle K tradename. Properties, plants
and equipment included land, buildings and equipment of owned retail sites and
leasehold improvements of leased sites. Fair value determinations were based
on estimated sales prices for comparable sites.

The provisions for losses and penalties associated with various operating lease
commitments included obligations for residual value guarantee deficiencies, and
future minimum rental payments that existed prior to the commitment date that
would continue after the exit plan is completed with no economic benefit. It
also included penalties incurred to cancel the contractual arrangements.

In the third quarter of 2003, we concluded the sale of all of our Exxon-branded
marketing assets in New York and New England, including contracts with
independent dealers and marketers. Approximately 230 of the 3,200 sites were
included in this package.

In the fourth quarter of 2003, we completed the sale of The Circle K
Corporation and its subsidiaries. The transaction included about 1,660 retail
marketing outlets in 16 states and the Circle K brand, as well as the
assignment of the franchise relationship with more than 350 franchised and
licensed stores. In January 2004, we signed agreements to sell our
Mobil-branded marketing assets on the East Coast in two separate



transactions. Assets in the packages include 104 company-owned and operated
sites, and 352 dealer sites. Each of the transactions is expected to close in
the second quarter of 2004. Discussions are under way with potential buyers
for the remaining sites, and we expect to complete the sales of these assets
during 2004. Based on disposals completed and signed agreements as of December
31, 2003, we recognized an additional charge in 2003 of approximately $96
million before-tax, $11 million after-tax.

Note 5—Restructuring

In 2002, as a result of the merger, we began a restructuring program to
capture the benefits of combining Conoco and Phillips by eliminating
redundancies, consolidating assets, and sharing common services and functions
across regions. In connection with this program, the company recorded
accruals in 2002 totaling $770 million for anticipated employee severance
payments and incremental pension and medical plan benefit costs associated
with the work force reductions, site closings, and Conoco employee
relocations. Of the total 2002 accrual, $337 million was reflected in the
Conoco purchase price allocation as an assumed liability, and $422 million
($253 million after-tax) related to Phillips was reflected in selling, general
and administrative expense and production and operating expense, and $11
million before-tax was included in discontinued operations.



Included in the total accruals of $770 million was $172 million related to
pension and other post-retirement benefits that will be paid in conjunction
with other retirement benefits over a number of future years. The table below
summarizes the balance of the 2002 accrual of $598 million, which consists of
severance related benefits to be provided to approximately 2,900 employees
worldwide and other merger related expenses. By the end of 2002, approximately
775 employees had been terminated. Changes in the 2002 severance related
accrual balance are summarized below.

In 2003, as individual components of the restructuring program were finalized,
we recorded an additional $350 million for severance-related benefits, site
closings, Conoco employee relocation costs, and pension and other
postretirement benefits. Of this total, $110 million was reflected as a
purchase price adjustment in the consolidated financial statements and $240
million was reflected in selling, general and administrative expense and
production and operating expense. Included in the total 2003 additional
accruals of $350 million was a $118 million expense related to pension and
other postretirement benefits that will be paid in conjunction with other
retirement benefits over a number of future years. This is reported as part
of our employee benefit plan obligations. A roll-forward of activity during
2003 is provided below for the non-pension portion of the accrual, which
primarily consists of severance-related benefits to be provided to
approximately 3,900 employees worldwide, most of whom are in the United
States, as well as other merger related expenses.

The restructuring liability at December 31 of $247 million is expected to be
expended by the end of the first quarter of 2004; except for $53 million,
classified as long-term. The remaining $194 million is included in other
accruals in the current liabilities section of the balance sheet.
Approximately 2,225 employees were terminated during 2003 and approximately
3,000 employees have been terminated since the restructuring program was
implemented.

Note 6—Acquisition of Tosco Corporation

On September 14, 2001, Tosco was merged with a subsidiary of ConocoPhillips, as
a result of which we became the owner of 100 percent of the outstanding common
stock of Tosco. Tosco’s results of operations have been included in our
consolidated financial statements since that date. Tosco’s operations included
seven U.S. refineries with a total crude oil capacity of 1.31 million barrels
per day; one 75,000-barrel-per-



day refinery located in Cork, Ireland; and various marketing, transportation,
distribution and corporate assets.

The primary reasons for our acquisition of Tosco, and the primary factors that
contributed to a purchase price that resulted in recognition of goodwill, are:

The allocation of the purchase price to specific assets and liabilities was
based, in part, upon an outside appraisal of Tosco’s long-lived assets.
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded in the acquisition are
not subject to amortization, but the goodwill and intangible assets will be
tested periodically for impairment as required by SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets.”

During the third quarter of 2002, we concluded:

•

The outside appraisal of the long-lived assets;

•

The determination of the fair value of all other Tosco assets and liabilities;

•

The tax basis calculation of Tosco’s assets and liabilities and the
related deferred tax liabilities; and

•

The allocation of Tosco goodwill to reporting units within the R&M
operating segment.

The resulting adjustments to the purchase price allocation made in 2002
increased goodwill by $341 million. The more significant adjustments to
goodwill were a $247 million reduction in the value of refinery air emission
permits to reflect a more appropriate appraisal methodology, a $70 million
liability recorded for Tosco Long-Term Incentive Plan performance units, and a
$69 million increase in deferred tax liabilities, resulting primarily from an
updated analysis of the tax bases of Tosco’s assets and liabilities. All other
adjustments in the aggregate reduced goodwill by $45 million.

Tosco Long-Term Incentive Plan performance units were derivative financial
instruments tied to our stock price and were marked-to-market each reporting
period. The resulting gains or losses from these mark-to-market adjustments
were reported in other income in the consolidated income statement. In October
2002, we and former Tosco executives negotiated a complete cancellation of the
performance units in exchange for a cash payment to the former executives.
During 2002, we recorded gains totaling $38 million, after-tax, as this
liability was marked-to-market each reporting period and eventually settled.



Note 7—Subsidiary Equity Transactions

ConocoPhillips, through various affiliates, and its unaffiliated co-venturers
received final approvals from authorities in June 2003 to proceed with the
natural gas development phase of the Bayu-Undan project in the Timor Sea. The
natural gas development phase of the project includes a pipeline from the
offshore Bayu-Undan field to Darwin, Australia, and a liquefied natural gas
facility, also located in Darwin. The pipeline portion of the project is owned
and operated by an unincorporated joint venture, while the liquefied natural
gas facility is owned and operated by Darwin LNG Pty Ltd (DLNG). Both of these
entities are consolidated subsidiaries of ConocoPhillips.

In June 2003, as part of a broad Bayu-Undan ownership interest re-alignment
with co-venturers, these entities issued equity and sold interests to the
co-venturers (as described below), which resulted in a gain of $28 million
before-tax, $25 million after-tax, in 2003. This non-operating gain is shown
in the consolidated statement of income in the line item entitled “Gain on
subsidiary equity transactions.”

DLNG—

DLNG issued 118.9 million shares of stock, valued at 1 Australian dollar
per share, to co-venturers for 118.9 million Australian dollars ($76.2 million
U.S. dollars), reducing our ownership interest in DLNG from 100 percent to
56.72 percent. The transaction resulted in a before-tax gain of $21 million in
the consolidated financial statements. Deferred income taxes were not
recognized because this was an issuance of common stock and therefore not
taxable.

Unincorporated Pipeline Joint Venture—

The co-venturers purchased pro-rata
interests in the pipeline assets held by ConocoPhillips Pipeline Australia Pty
Ltd for $26.6 million U.S. dollars and contributed the purchased assets to the
unincorporated joint venture, reducing our ownership interest from 100 percent
to 56.72 percent. The transaction resulted in a before-tax gain of $7 million.
A deferred tax liability of $1.3 million was recorded in connection with the
transaction.

Inventories valued on a LIFO basis totaled $3,224 million and $3,349 million at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The remainder of our inventories are
valued under various methods, including FIFO and weighted average. The excess
of current replacement cost over LIFO cost of inventories amounted to $1,421
million and $1,803 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

During 2003, certain inventory quantity reductions caused a liquidation of LIFO
inventory values. This liquidation increased income from continuing operations
by $24 million, of which $22 million was attributable to our R&M segment.

In the fourth quarter of 2001, the company recognized a $42 million before-tax,
$27 million after-tax, lower-of-cost-or-market write-down of its petroleum
products inventory.

Duke Energy Field Services, LLC

DEFS owns and operates gas plants, gathering systems, storage facilities and
fractionation plants. At December 31, 2003, the book value of our common
investment in DEFS was $212 million. Our 30.3 percent share of the net assets
of DEFS was $831 million. This basis difference of $619 million is being
amortized on a straight-line basis through 2014 consistent with the remaining
estimated useful lives of DEFS’ properties, plants and equipment. Included in
net income for 2003, 2002 and 2001 was after-tax income of $36 million, $35
million and $36 million, respectively, representing the amortization of the
basis difference.



DEFS supplies a substantial portion of its natural gas liquids to us and CPChem
under a supply agreement that continues until December 31, 2014. This purchase
commitment is on an “if-produced, will-purchase” basis so it has no fixed
production schedule, but has been, and is expected to be, a relatively stable
purchase pattern over the term of the contract. Natural gas liquids are
purchased under this agreement at various published market index prices, less
transportation and fractionation fees.

On December 31, 2003, DEFS redeemed the remaining $75 million of its preferred
member interests. We received our 30.3 percent share, a $23 million
distribution representing the return of our preferred member interests.

Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC

CPChem manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics. At December 31,
2003, the book value of our investment in CPChem was $1,917 million. Our 50
percent share of the total net assets of CPChem was $1,755 million. This basis
difference of $162 million is being amortized through 2020, consistent with the
remaining estimated useful lives of CPChem properties, plants and equipment.

We have multiple supply and purchase agreements in place with CPChem, ranging
in initial terms from one to 99 years, with extension options. These
agreements cover sales and purchases of refined products, solvents, and
petrochemical and natural gas liquids feedstocks, as well as fuel oils and
gases. Delivery quantities vary by product, and are generally on an
“if-produced, will-purchase” basis. All products are purchased and sold under
specified pricing formulas based on various published pricing indices,
consistent with terms extended to third-party customers.

Our investment in PP&E is recorded at cost. PP&E acquired in mergers and
acquisitions is recorded at its fair market value at the time of the merger or
acquisition. Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted SFAS No. 143, “Accounting
for Asset Retirement Obligations,” which applies to legal obligations
associated with the retirement and removal of long-lived assets. SFAS No. 143
requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement obligation in the period when it is incurred (typically when the
asset is installed at the production location). When the liability is
initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost by increasing the carrying
amount of the related PP&E. Over time, the liability is increased for the



change in its present value each period, and the initial capitalized cost is
depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Application of this new
accounting principle resulted in an initial increase in net PP&E of $1.2
billion.

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations,” and SFAS
No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” which became effective on July
1, 2001, and January 1, 2002, respectively. The Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) has requested the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) to
consider the issue of whether SFAS Nos. 141 and 142 require interests held
under oil, gas and mineral leases to be separately classified as intangible
assets on the balance sheets of companies in the extractive industries.
Historically, in accordance with SFAS No. 19, “Financial Accounting and
Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies,” we have capitalized the cost of
oil and gas leasehold interests and, consistent with industry practice,
reported these assets as part of tangible E&P properties, plants and equipment.

If such interests were deemed to be intangible assets by the EITF, mineral
rights to extract oil and gas for both proved and unproved properties would be
classified separately from E&P properties, plants and equipment as intangible
assets on our balance sheet. This interpretation by the EITF would only affect
the classification of oil and gas mineral rights on our balance sheet and would
not affect total assets, net worth, results of operations or cash flows.

E&P properties, plants and equipment at December 31, 2003 and 2002, included
approximately $10.5 billion and $10.8 billion, respectively, of mineral rights
to extract oil and gas, net of accumulated depletion, that would be
reclassified on the balance sheet as intangible assets, if the interpretation
that the SEC requested the EITF to consider was applied. We plan to continue
to classify oil and gas mineral rights as E&P properties, plants and equipment
until further guidance is provided by the EITF.

The E&P segment recognized property impairments of $245 million in 2003. These
impairments were the result of:

•

The write-down to market value of properties planned for disposition;

•

Properties failing to meet recoverability tests; and

•

International tax law changes affecting asset removal costs.


Our E&P segment recognized impairments of $49 million on four fields in 2002.
Impairment of the Janice field in the U.K. North Sea was triggered by its sale,
while the Viscount field in the U.K. North Sea was impaired following an
evaluation of development drilling results. Sales of properties in Alaska and
offshore California resulted in the remaining E&P impairments in 2002.

We initiated a plan in late 2002 to sell a substantial portion of our R&M
retail sites. The planned dispositions will result in a reduction of the
amount of gasoline volumes marketed under our “76” tradename. As a result, the
carrying value of the “76” tradename was impaired, with the $102 million
impairment determined by an analysis of the discounted cash flows based on the
gasoline volumes projected to be sold under the brand name after the planned
dispositions, compared with the volumes being sold prior to the dispositions.
We also impaired the carrying value of certain leasehold improvements
associated with leased retail sites that are held for use by comparing the
guaranteed residual values and leasehold improvements with current market
values of the related assets.

See Note 4—Discontinued Operations for information regarding the impairments
recognized in 2002 in connection with the anticipated sale of certain assets
mandated by the FTC, and the planned sale of a substantial portion of the
company’s retail marketing operations.


In the second quarter of 2001, we committed to a plan to sell our 12.5 percent
interest in the Siri oil field, offshore Denmark, triggering a write-down of
the field’s assets to fair market value. The sale closed in early 2002. We
also recorded a property impairment on a crude oil tanker that was sold in the
fourth quarter of 2001.

Accrued Environmental Costs

Total environmental accruals at December 31, 2003 and 2002, were $1,119 million
and $743 million, respectively. The 2003 increase in total accrued
environmental costs primarily resulted from evaluation of Conoco environmental
liabilities during the purchase price allocation period.

We had accrued environmental costs of $625 million and $427 million at December
31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, primarily related to cleanup at domestic
refineries and underground storage tanks at U.S. service stations, and
remediation activities required by the state of Alaska at exploration and
production sites formerly owned by Atlantic Richfield Company. We had also
accrued in Corporate and Other $367 million and $246 million of environmental
costs associated with non-operating sites at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. In addition, $127 million and $70 million were included at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, where the company has been named a
potentially responsible party under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or similar state laws. Accrued
environmental liabilities will be paid over periods extending up to 30 years.

Because a large portion of our accrued environmental costs were acquired in
various business combinations, they are discounted obligations. Expected
expenditures for acquired environmental obligations are discounted using a
weighted-average 5 percent discount factor, resulting in an accrued balance for
acquired environmental liabilities of $908 million at December 31, 2003. The
expected future undiscounted payments related to the portion of the accrued
environmental costs that have been discounted are: $131 million in 2004, $121
million in 2005, $88 million in 2006, $72 million in 2007, $67 million in 2008,
and $596 million for all future years after 2008.

$1,885 million, $653 million and $587 million, respectively.

Effective October 14, 2003, we entered into two new revolving credit
facilities, replacing a $2 billion 364-day facility that expired on that same
date. The new revolving credit facilities are a $1.5 billion 364-day facility
and a $500 million five-year facility. In addition, we have two revolving
credit facilities totaling $2 billion expiring in October 2006. In total, at
December 31, 2003, we had four bank credit facilities in place, totaling $4
billion, available for use either as direct bank borrowings or as support for
the issuance of up to $4 billion in commercial paper, a portion of which may be
denominated in other currencies (limited to euro 3 billion equivalent). At
December 31, 2003, we had no debt outstanding under these credit facilities,
but had $709 million in commercial paper outstanding. The commercial paper is
supported 100 percent by the credit facilities and the amount approximates fair
value.

At December 31, 2003, $984 million of short-term obligations were classified as
non-current, based on management’s intent to refinance the obligations on a
long-term basis through the use of existing facilities.

One of our Norwegian subsidiaries has two $300 million revolving credit
facilities expiring in June 2004, under which no borrowings were outstanding at
December 31, 2003.

Depending on the credit facility, borrowings may bear interest at a margin
above rates offered by certain designated banks in the London interbank market
or at margins above certificate of deposit or prime rates offered by certain
designated banks in the United States. The agreements call for commitment fees
on available, but unused, amounts. The agreements also contain early
termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease
to be a majority of the Board of Directors.

In the third quarter of 2003, the adoption of FIN 46 for VIEs involving
synthetic leases and certain other financing structures, was made and
retroactively applied to January 1, 2003. The application of FIN 46 increased
our balance sheet debt by approximately $2.8 billion. See Note
2—Changes in
Accounting Principles for additional information about FIN 46. With the
adoption of FIN 46:

•

The Phillips 66 Capital Trust II (Trust) is no longer consolidated,
which removed $350 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred
securities from the consolidated balance sheet and added to long-term
debt $361 million of 8% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest
Debentures due 2037. Previously this debt was eliminated in
consolidation; and

•

VIEs involving synthetic leases and certain other financing
structures in which we are the primary beneficiary were consolidated
retroactively as of January 1, 2003, which increased consolidated debt
approximately $2.4 billion. Of this $2.4 billion, approximately $1.5
billion was associated with approximately 1,000 retail store sites, the
majority of which we have sold or plan to sell, and two office
buildings that also are part of our divestiture plan.

The $2.4 billion in debt at January 1, 2003, was
comprised of the following:



—

$1,130 million of floating rate marketing lease obligations having final maturities from 2003
to 2006; and

—

$160 million of refining equipment lease obligations at 5.847% having a final
maturity in 2006.

During 2003, we reduced our commercial paper balance outstanding from $1.5
billion at December 31, 2002, to $709 million at December 31, 2003. In 2003,
we paid off the following notes and debt facilities as they were called or
matured and funded the payments with cash from operating activities and
proceeds from asset dispositions:

Also, in October and November 2003, we executed certain interest rate swaps
that had the effect of converting $1.5 billion of debt from fixed to floating
rate. The swaps were placed on $400 million of 3.625% Notes due 2007, $750
million of 6.35% Notes due 2009, and $350 million of 4.75% Notes due 2012. The
weighted average floating rate in effect on these notes at December 31, 2003,
was 2.26 percent, based on LIBOR. These swaps qualify for hedge accounting
under SFAS 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.”

At December 31, 2003, $275 million was outstanding under the ConocoPhillips
Savings Plan term loan, which will require repayment in annual installments
beginning in 2009 and continuing through 2015. Under this bank loan, any
participating bank in the syndicate of lenders may cease to participate on
December 5, 2004, by giving not less than 180 days’ prior notice to the
ConocoPhillips Savings Plan and the company. One participating lender has
given cessation notice. This note is classified as non-current, based on
management’s intent to resyndicate the loan or alternatively to refinance the
note on a long-term basis through the use of existing facilities.

Each bank participating in the ConocoPhillips Savings Plan loan has the
optional right, if our current directors or their approved successors cease to
be a majority of the Board, and upon not less than 90 days’ notice, to cease to
participate in the loan. Under the above conditions, we are required to
purchase such bank’s rights and obligations under the loan agreement if they
are not transferred to another bank of our choice. See Note 22—Employee
Benefit Plans for additional discussion of the ConocoPhillips Savings Plan.



Note 15—Sales of Receivables

At December 31, 2002, certain credit card and trade receivables had been sold
to two Qualifying Special Purpose Entities (QSPEs) in revolving-period
securitization arrangements. These arrangements provided for us to sell, and
the QSPEs to purchase, certain receivables and for the QSPEs to then issue
beneficial interests of up to $1.5 billion to five bank-sponsored entities.
All five bank-sponsored entities are multi-seller conduits with access to the
commercial paper market and purchase interests in similar receivables from
numerous other companies unrelated to us. We have no ownership interests, nor
any variable interests, in any of the bank-sponsored entities. As a result, we
do not consolidate any of these entities. Furthermore, we do not consolidate
the QSPEs because they meet the requirements of SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for
Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
Liabilities,” to be excluded from the consolidated financial statements of
ConocoPhillips.

During 2003, we purchased from the bank-sponsored entities the senior interests
of one of our two existing QSPEs and discontinued selling receivables to it.
We have consolidated this QSPE since acquiring the senior interests. Also
during 2003, the third-party beneficial interest holders approved amendments to
the other QSPE to increase the amount of third-party beneficial interests that
can be issued to $1.2 billion. These changes resulted in a net reduction of
the maximum level of senior beneficial interests that can be issued to
third-party beneficial interest holders from $1.5 billion to $1.2 billion. At
December 31, 2003 and 2002, we had sold accounts receivable of $1.2 billion and
$1.3 billion, respectively. The receivables transferred to the QSPE meets the
isolation requirements and other requirements of SFAS No. 140 to be accounted
for as sales. Accordingly, receivables transferred to the QSPEs were accounted
for as sales.

We retain beneficial interests in the QSPE that are subordinate to the
beneficial interests issued to the bank-sponsored entities. These retained
interests, which are reported on the balance sheet in accounts and notes
receivable—related parties, were $1.3 billion at both December 31, 2003 and 2002. We also retain servicing responsibility related
to the sold receivables, which gives us certain benefits, the fair
value of which approximates the fair value of the liability incurred for
continuing to service the receivables. The carrying value of the subordinated
beneficial interests approximates fair market value due to the short term of
the underlying assets, which makes stress testing unnecessary.

Total cash flows received from and paid under the securitization arrangements
were as follows:

of receivables under factoring arrangements. We retain servicing
responsibility related to these sold receivables, which gives us
certain benefits, the fair value of which approximates the fair value of the
liability incurred for continuing to service the receivables.



Note 16—Guarantees

At December 31, 2003, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under
various contractual arrangements as described below. We are required to
recognize a liability at inception for the fair value of our obligation as a
guarantor for guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. Unless
the carrying amount of the liability is noted, we have not recognized a
liability either because the guarantees were issued prior to December 31, 2002,
or because the fair value of the obligation is immaterial.

Construction Completion Guarantees

•

We have a construction completion guarantee related to debt and
bond financing arrangements secured by the Merey Sweeny, L.P. (MSLP)
joint-venture project in Texas. The maximum potential amount of future
payment under the guarantee, including joint-and-several debt at its
gross amount, is estimated to be $400 million assuming that completion
certification is not achieved. Of this amount, $200 million is
attributable to Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), because they are
joint-and-severally liable for a portion of the debt. If completion
certification is not attained by June 18, 2004, the full debt balance
could be called. MSLP is currently awaiting receipt of a permit for a
new waste water pipeline and working to resolve issues in placing its
insurance program, after which we expect to achieve completion
certification in the second quarter of 2004. The debt is non-recourse
to us upon completion certification.

•

We also issued a construction completion guarantee related to debt
financing arrangements for the Hamaca Holding LLC joint-venture project
in Venezuela. The maximum potential amount of future payments under
the guarantee is estimated to be $440 million, which could be payable
if the full debt financing capacity is utilized and startup and
completion of the Hamaca project is not achieved by October 1, 2005.
The project financing debt will become non-recourse upon startup and
completion certification.

Guarantees of Joint-Venture Debt

•

At December 31, 2003, we had guarantees of approximately $340
million outstanding for our portion of joint-venture debt obligations,
which have terms of up to 22 years. Included in these outstanding
guarantees was $156 million associated with the Polar Lights Company
joint venture in Russia. Payment will be required if a joint venture
defaults on its debt obligations.

Other Guarantees

•

In addition to the construction completion guarantee explained
above, the MSLP agreement also requires the partners in the venture to
pay cash calls as required to meet the minimum operating requirements
of the venture, in the event revenues do not cover expenses over the
next 20 years. Our maximum potential future payments under the
agreement are estimated to be $300 million, assuming MSLP does not earn
any revenue over the entire period and fixed costs cannot be reduced.
To the extent revenue is generated by the venture or fixed costs are
reduced, future required payments would be reduced accordingly.

•

In February 2003, we entered into two agreements establishing
separate guarantee facilities of $50 million each for two liquefied
natural gas ships that were then under construction. Subject to the
terms of each such facility, we will be required to make payments
should the charter revenue generated by the respective ship fall below
certain specified minimum thresholds, and we will receive payments to
the extent that such revenues exceed those thresholds. The net maximum
future payments that we may have to make over the 20-year terms of the
two agreements could be up to an aggregate of $100 million. Actual
gross payments over the 20 years could exceed that amount to the extent
cash is received by us. In the event either ship is sold or a total
loss occurs, we also may have recourse to the sales or insurance
proceeds to recoup payments made under the



guarantee facilities. In February 2003, based on the then current market
view of both long-term and short-term shipping capacity, rates, and
utilization probability, we estimated the fair value of the liability
under these guarantee facilities to be immaterial. In September 2003,
the first ship was delivered to its owner and the second ship is
scheduled for delivery to its owner in 2005. With respect to the first
ship, the amount drawn under the guarantee facility at
December 31, 2003,
was less than $1 million.

•

We have other guarantees totaling approximately $190 million, which
consist primarily of dealer and jobber loan guarantees to support our
marketing business, a guarantee supporting a lease assignment on a
corporate aircraft, a guarantee associated with a pending lawsuit and
guarantees of lease payment obligations for a joint venture. The
carrying amount recorded for these other guarantees as of December 31,
2003, was $13 million. These guarantees generally extend up to 15
years and payment would only be required if the dealer, jobber or
lessee goes into default, or if an adverse decision occurs in the
lawsuit.

Indemnifications

•

Over the years, we have entered into various agreements to sell
ownership interests in certain corporations and joint ventures. In
addition, we entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement in 1998 related to
Conoco’s separation from DuPont. These agreements typically include
indemnifications for additional taxes determined to be due under the
relevant tax law, in connection with operations for years prior to the
sale or separation. Generally, the obligation extends until the
related tax years are closed. The maximum potential amount of future
payments under the indemnifications is the amount of additional tax
determined to be due under relevant tax law and the various agreements.
There are no material outstanding claims that have been asserted under
these agreements.

•

During 2003, we sold several assets, including FTC-mandated sales
of downstream and midstream assets, certain exploration and production
assets, and downstream retail and wholesale sites, giving rise to
qualifying indemnifications. Agreements associated with these sales
include indemnifications for taxes, environmental liabilities,
underground storage tank repairs or replacements, permits and licenses,
employee claims, real estate indemnity against tenant defaults, and
litigation. The term of these indemnifications is generally indefinite
and the maximum amount of future payments is generally unlimited. The
carrying amount recorded for these indemnifications as of December 31,
2003, is $221 million. Although it is reasonably possible that future
payments may exceed amounts recorded, due to the nature of the
indemnifications, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of
the maximum potential amount of future payments. Included in the
carrying amount recorded are $81 million of environmental accruals for
known contamination that is included in asset retirement obligations
and accrued environmental costs at December 31, 2003. For additional
information about environmental liabilities, see Note 13—Asset
Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs, and Note
17—Contingencies.

•

As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent
with industry practice, we enter into numerous agreements with other
parties, which apportion future risks among the parties to the
transaction or relationship governed by the agreements. One method of
apportioning risk is the inclusion of provisions requiring one party to
indemnify the other against losses that might otherwise be incurred by
the other party in the future. Many of our agreements contain an
indemnity or indemnities that require us to perform certain acts, such
as remediation, as a result of the occurrence of a triggering event or
condition. In some instances we indemnify third parties against losses
resulting from certain events or conditions that arise out of the
operations of our equity affiliates.



The nature of these numerous indemnity obligations are diverse and each
has different terms, business purposes, and triggering events or
conditions. Consistent with customary business practice, any particular
indemnity obligation incurred is the result of a negotiated transaction
or contractual relationship for which we have accepted a certain level of
risk in return for a financial or other type of benefit. In addition,
the indemnities in each agreement vary widely in their definitions of
both triggering events and the resulting obligations contingent on those
triggering events.

With regard to indemnifications, our risk management philosophy is to
limit risk in any transaction or relationship to the maximum extent
reasonable in relation to commercial and other considerations. Before
accepting any indemnity obligation, we make an informed risk management
decision considering, among other things, the remoteness of the
possibility that the triggering event will occur, the potential costs to
perform under any resulting indemnity obligation, possible actions to
reduce the likelihood of a triggering event or to reduce the costs of
performing under the indemnity obligation, whether we are indemnified by
an unrelated third party, insurance coverage that may be available to
offset the cost of the indemnity obligation, and the benefits from the
transaction or relationship.

Because many of our indemnity obligations are not limited in duration or
potential monetary exposure, we cannot calculate a reasonable estimate of
the maximum potential amount of future payments that could be paid under
our indemnity obligations stemming from all our existing agreements. The
carrying amount recorded for these indemnifications as of December 31,
2003, was $224 million, which is for known contamination and is included
in asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs. For
additional information about environmental liabilities and contingencies,
see Note 13—Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs,
and Note 17—Contingencies.

Note 17—Contingencies

We are subject to various lawsuits and claims including, but not limited to:
actions challenging oil and gas royalty and severance tax payments; actions
related to gas measurement and valuation methods; actions related to joint
interest billings to operating agreement partners; and claims for damages
resulting from leaking underground storage tanks, or other accidental releases,
with related toxic tort claims. As a result of Conoco’s separation agreement
with DuPont, we also have assumed responsibility for current and future claims
related to certain discontinued chemicals and agricultural chemicals businesses
operated by Conoco in the past. In general, the effect on future financial
results is not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable
uncertainty exists. The ultimate liabilities resulting from such lawsuits and
claims may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are
recognized.

In the case of all known contingencies, we accrue a liability when the loss is
probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. We do not reduce these
liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. If applicable,
we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries.
Based on currently available information, we believe that it is remote that
future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed
current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our
financial statements.

As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both
with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. Estimates
that are particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent
liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters.
Estimated future



environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as
the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such
remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability
in proportion to that of other responsible parties. Estimated future costs
related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as
additional information becomes available during the administrative and
litigation processes.

Environmental—

We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and
regulations. These may result in obligations to remove or mitigate the effects
on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain
chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various sites. When we prepare
our financial statements, we record accruals for environmental liabilities
based on management’s best estimates, using all information that is available
at the time. We measure estimates and base liabilities on currently available
facts, existing technology, and presently enacted laws and regulations, taking
into consideration the likely effects of societal and economic factors. When
measuring environmental liabilities, we also consider our prior experience in
remediation of contaminated sites, other companies’ cleanup experience, and
data released by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or other
organizations. We consider unasserted claims in our determination of
environmental liabilities and we accrue them in the period that they are both
probable and reasonably estimable.

Although liability of those potentially responsible for environmental
remediation costs is generally joint and several for federal sites and
frequently so for state sites, we are usually only one of many companies cited
at a particular site. Due to the joint and several liabilities, we could be
responsible for all of the cleanup costs related to any site at which we have
been designated as a potentially responsible party. If we were solely
responsible, the costs, in some cases, could be material to our, or one of our
segments’, operations, capital resources or liquidity. However, settlements
and costs incurred in matters that previously have been resolved have not been
material to our results of operations or financial condition. We have been
successful to date in sharing cleanup costs with other financially sound
companies. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still
under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies concerned. Prior to
actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess the site
conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation.
In some instances, we may have no liability or may attain a settlement of
liability. Where it appears that other potentially responsible parties may be
financially unable to bear their proportional share, we consider this inability
in estimating our potential liability and we adjust our accruals accordingly.

As a result of various acquisitions in the past, we assumed certain
environmental obligations. Some of these environmental obligations are
mitigated by indemnifications made by others for our benefit and some of the
indemnifications are subject to dollar limits and time limits. We have not
recorded accruals for any potential contingent liabilities that we expect to be
funded by the prior owners under these indemnifications.

We are currently participating in environmental assessments and cleanups at
numerous federal Superfund and comparable state sites. After an assessment of
environmental exposures for cleanup and other costs, we make accruals on an
undiscounted basis (except those assumed in a purchase business combination,
which we record such costs on a discounted basis) for planned investigation and
remediation activities for sites where it is probable that future costs will be
incurred and these costs can be reasonably estimated. We have not reduced
these accruals for possible insurance recoveries. In the future, we may be
involved in additional environmental assessments, cleanups and proceedings.
See Note 13—Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs for a
summary of our accrued environmental liabilities.

Other Legal Proceedings—

We are a party to a number of other legal proceedings
pending in various courts or agencies for which, in some instances, no
provision has been made.



Other Contingencies—

We have contingent liabilities resulting from throughput
agreements with pipeline and processing companies. Under these agreements, we
may be required to provide any such company with additional funds through
advances and penalties for fees related to throughput capacity not utilized by
us. In addition, we have various purchase commitments for materials, supplies,
services and items of permanent investment incident to the ordinary conduct of
business.

Note 18—Financial Instruments and Derivative Contracts

Derivative Instruments

We, and certain of our subsidiaries, may use financial and commodity-based
derivative contracts to manage exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates, or to exploit market
opportunities. Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “Authority
Limitations” document approved by our Board of Directors that prohibits the use
of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient
liquidity for comparable valuations without approval from the Chief Executive
Officer. The Authority Limitations document also authorizes the Chief
Executive Officer to establish the maximum Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the
company and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. The Chief
Financial Officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates
and interest rates, while the Executive Vice President of Commercial monitors
commodity price risk. Both report to the Chief Executive Officer. The
Commercial Group manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity
flows and positions, monitors related risks of our upstream and downstream
businesses and selectively takes price risk to add value.

SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,”
as amended (Statement No. 133 or SFAS No. 133), requires companies to recognize
all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet
at fair value. Assets and liabilities resulting from derivative contracts open
at December 31, 2003, were $340 million and $268 million, respectively, and
appear as accounts and notes receivables, other assets, accounts payable, or
other liabilities and deferred credits on the balance sheet.

The accounting for changes in fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a
derivative instrument depends on whether it meets the qualifications for, and
has been designated as, a SFAS No. 133 hedge, and the type of hedge. At this
time, we are not using SFAS No. 133 hedge accounting for commodity derivative
contracts, but we are using hedge accounting for the interest-rate derivatives
noted below. All gains and losses, realized or unrealized, from derivative
contracts not designated as SFAS No. 133 hedges have been recognized in the
income statement. Gains and losses from derivative contracts held for trading
not directly related to our physical business, whether realized or unrealized,
have been reported net in other income.

SFAS No. 133 also requires purchase and sales contracts for commodities that
are readily convertible to cash (e.g., crude oil, natural gas, and gasoline) to
be recorded on the balance sheet as derivatives unless the contracts are for
quantities we expect to use or sell over a reasonable period in the normal
course of business (the normal purchases and normal sales exception), among
other requirements, and we have documented our intent to apply this exception.
Except for contracts to buy or sell natural gas, we generally apply this
exception to eligible purchase and sales contracts; however, we may elect not
to apply this exception (e.g., when another derivative instrument will be used
to mitigate the risk of the purchase or sale contract but hedge accounting will
not be applied). When this occurs, both the purchase or sales contract and the
derivative contract mitigating the resulting risk will be recorded on the
balance sheet at fair value in accordance with the preceding paragraphs. Most
of our contracts to buy or sell natural gas are recorded on the balance sheet
as derivatives, except for certain long-term contracts to sell our natural gas
production, which either have been designated normal purchase/normal sales, or
do not meet the SFAS No. 133 definition of a derivative.



Interest Rate Derivative Contracts—

During the fourth quarter of 2003, we
executed interest rate swaps that had the effect of converting $1.5 billion of
debt from fixed to floating rates. These swaps qualified for and have been
designated as fair-value hedges using the short-cut method of hedge accounting
provided by SFAS No. 133, which permits the assumption that changes in the
value of the derivative perfectly offset changes in the value of the debt;
therefore, no gain or loss is recognized due to hedge ineffectiveness.

Currency Exchange Rate Derivative Contracts—

We have foreign currency exchange
rate risk resulting from operations in over 40 countries. We do not
comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency rate changes, although we may
choose to selectively hedge exposures to foreign currency rate risk. Examples
include firm commitments for capital projects, certain local currency tax
payments and dividends, short-term intercompany loans between subsidiaries
operating in different countries, and cash returns from net investments in
foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year. Hedge accounting is
not currently being used for any of our foreign currency derivatives.

Commodity Derivative Contracts—

We operate in the worldwide crude oil, refined
product, natural gas, natural gas liquids, and electric power markets and are
exposed to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities. These
fluctuations can affect our revenues as well as the cost of operating,
investing, and financing activities. Generally, our policy is to remain
exposed to market prices of commodity purchases and sales; however, executive
management may elect to use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk of
our crude oil and natural gas production, as well as refinery margins.

Our Commercial group uses futures, forwards, swaps, and options in various
markets to optimize the value of our supply chain, which may move our risk
profile away from market average prices to accomplish the following objectives:

•

Balance physical systems. In addition to cash settlement prior to
contract expiration, exchange traded futures contracts may also be
settled by physical delivery of the commodity, providing another source
of supply to meet our refinery requirements or marketing demand;

•

Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally
remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert
fixed-price sales contracts, which are often requested by natural gas
and refined product consumers, to a floating market price;

•

Manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific
crude oil, natural gas, refined product and electric power
transactions; and

•

Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from these activities
to do a limited amount of trading not directly related to our physical
business. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
the gains or losses from this activity were not material to our cash
flows or income from continuing operations.

At December 31, 2003, we were not using hedge accounting for any commodity
derivative contracts.

Credit Risk

Our financial instruments that are potentially exposed to concentrations of
credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, over-the-counter derivative
contracts, and trade receivables. Our cash equivalents, which are placed in
high-quality money market funds and time deposits with major international
banks and financial institutions, are generally not maintained at levels
material to our financial position. The credit risk from our over-the-counter
derivative contracts, such as forwards and swaps, derives from the counterparty
to the transaction, typically a major bank or financial institution. We
closely monitor these credit exposures against predetermined credit limits,
including the continual exposure adjustments that result from market movements.
Individual counterparty exposure is managed within these limits, and



includes the use of cash-call margins when appropriate, thereby reducing the
risk of significant non-performance. We also use futures contracts, but
futures have a negligible credit risk because they are traded on the New York
Mercantile Exchange or the International Petroleum Exchange of London Limited.

Our trade receivables result primarily from our petroleum operations and
reflect a broad national and international customer base, which limits our
exposure to concentrations of credit risk. The majority of these receivables
have payment terms of 30 days or less, and we continually monitor this exposure
and the creditworthiness of the counterparties. We do not generally require
collateral to limit the exposure to loss; however, we will sometimes use
letters of credit, prepayments, and master netting arrangements to mitigate
credit risk with counterparties that both buy from and sell to us, as these
agreements permit the amounts owed by us or owed to others to be offset against
amounts due us.

Note 19—Preferred Stock and Other Minority Interests

Company-Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred

Securities of Phillips 66 Capital Trusts

During 1996 and 1997, we formed two statutory business trusts, Phillips 66
Capital I (Trust I) and Phillips 66 Capital II (Trust II), with ConocoPhillips
owning all the common stock. The trusts were created for the sole purpose of
issuing securities and investing the proceeds thereof in an equivalent amount
of our subordinated debt securities. We established the trusts to raise funds
for general corporate purposes.

On May 31, 2002, we redeemed all of our outstanding 8.24% Junior Subordinated
Deferrable Interest Debentures due 2036 held by Trust I. This triggered the
redemption of $300 million of Trust I’s 8.24% Trust Originated Preferred
Securities at par value, $25 per share. A loss of $8 million before-tax, $6
million after-tax, was incurred during the second quarter of 2002 as a result
of the redemption.

Trust II has outstanding $350 million of 8% Capital Securities (Capital
Securities). The sole asset of Trust II is $361 million of the company’s 8%
Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures due 2037 (Subordinated Debt
Securities II) purchased by Trust II on January 17, 1997. The Subordinated
Debt Securities II are due January 15, 2037, and are redeemable in whole, or in
part, at our option on or after January 15, 2007, at 103.94 percent declining
annually until January 15, 2017, when they can be called at par, $1,000 per
share, plus accrued and unpaid interest. When we redeem the Subordinated Debt
Securities II, Trust II is required to apply all redemption proceeds to the
immediate redemption of the Capital Securities. We fully and unconditionally
guarantee Trust II’s obligations under the Capital Securities.

Subordinated Debt Securities II are unsecured obligations of ours that are
subordinate and junior in right of payment to all our present and future senior
indebtedness.

Effective January 1, 2003, with the adoption of FIN 46, Trust II was
deconsolidated because we are not the primary beneficiary. Application of FIN
46 required deconsolidation of Trust II, which had the effect of increasing
debt by $361 million since the Subordinated Debt Securities II were no longer
eliminated in consolidation, and eliminating the $350 million of mandatorily
redeemable preferred securities. Prior to the adoption of FIN 46, the
subordinated debt securities and related income statement effects were
eliminated in the company’s consolidated financial statements. See Note
2—Changes in Accounting Principles for additional information.

Other Minority Interests

The minority limited partner in Conoco Corporate Holdings L.P., a limited-life
entity that must be liquidated in 2019, is entitled to a cumulative annual 7.86
percent priority return on its investment. The net minority interest in Conoco
Corporate Holdings held by the limited partner was $141 million at December 31,
2003 and 2002, and is callable without penalty beginning in the fourth quarter
of 2004.

The minority interest owner in Ashford Energy Capital S.A. is entitled to a
cumulative annual preferred return on its investment, based on three-month
LIBOR rates plus 1.27 percent. The preferred return at December 31, 2003 and
2002, was 2.48 percent and 2.70 percent, respectively. At December 31, 2003
and 2002, the minority interest was $496 million and $504 million,
respectively.

Ashford Energy Capital S.A. continues to be consolidated in our financial
statements under the provisions of FIN 46 because we are the primary
beneficiary. See Note 2—Changes in Accounting Principles for additional
information.



The remaining minority interest amounts relate to consolidated operating joint
ventures that have minority interest owners. The largest amount relates to the
Bayu-Undan project. See Note 7-Subsidiary Equity Transactions.

Preferred Stock

We have 500 million shares of preferred stock authorized, par value $.01 per
share, none of which was issued or outstanding at December 31, 2003.

Note 20—Preferred Share Purchase Rights

Our Board of Directors authorized and declared a dividend of one preferred
share purchase right for each common share outstanding, and authorized and
directed the issuance of one right per common share for any newly issued
shares. The rights, which expire June 30, 2012, will be exercisable only if a
person or group acquires 15 percent or more of the company’s common stock or
commences a tender offer that would result in ownership of 15 percent or more
of the common stock. Each right would entitle stockholders to buy one
one-hundredth of a share of preferred stock at an exercise price of $300. In
addition, the rights enable holders to either acquire additional shares of
ConocoPhillips common stock or purchase the stock of an acquiring company at a
discount, depending on specific circumstances. We may redeem the rights in
whole, but not in part, for one cent per right.

Note 21—Non-Mineral Leases

The company leases ocean transport vessels, railcars, corporate aircraft,
service stations, computers, office buildings and other facilities and
equipment. Certain leases include escalation clauses for adjusting rentals to
reflect changes in price indices, as well as renewal options and/or options to
purchase the leased property for the fair market value at the end of the lease
term. There are no significant restrictions on us imposed by the leasing
agreements in regards to dividends, asset dispositions or borrowing ability.
Leased assets under capital leases were not significant in any period
presented.

At December 31, 2003, future minimum rental payments due under non-cancelable
leases, including those associated with discontinued operations, were:

crude oil tankers that are currently under construction. The charters will be
accounted for as operating leases upon delivery, which is expected in the first
quarter of 2004. Upon delivery, the base term of the charter agreements is 12
years,



with certain renewal options by ConocoPhillips. The total operating lease
commitment over the 12-year term for the two tankers would be $87 million on an
estimated bareboat basis.

For both U.S. and international pensions, the overall expected long-term rate
of return is developed from the expected future return of each asset class,
weighted by the expected allocation of pension assets to that asset class. We
rely on a variety of independent market forecasts in developing the expected
rate of return for each class of assets.

We use a December 31 measurement date for the majority of our plans.

During 2003, we recorded a benefit to other comprehensive income related to
minimum pension liability adjustments totaling $280 million ($175 million net
of tax), resulting in accumulated other comprehensive loss due to minimum
pension liability adjustments at December 31, 2003, of $89 million ($61 million
net of tax). During 2002, we recorded charges to other comprehensive loss
totaling $149 million ($93 million net of tax), resulting in accumulated other
comprehensive loss due to minimum pension liability adjustments at December 31,
2002, of $369 million ($236 million net of tax).

For our tax-qualified pension plans with projected benefit obligations in
excess of plan assets, the projected benefit obligation, the accumulated

As a result of the ConocoPhillips merger, we recognized settlement losses of
$120 million and special termination benefits of $9 million in 2003, and we
recorded curtailment losses of $23 million and special termination benefits of
$98 million in 2002. During 2001, we recorded a curtailment gain of $2 million
and settlement losses of $10 million.

In determining net pension and other postretirement benefit costs, we have
elected to amortize net gains and losses on a straight-line basis over 10
years. Prior service cost is amortized on a straight-line basis over the
average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits
under the plan.

We have multiple non-pension postretirement benefit plans for health and life
insurance. The health care plans are contributory, with participant and
company contributions adjusted annually; the life insurance plans are
non-contributory. For most groups of retirees, any increase in the annual
health care escalation rate above 4.5 percent is borne by the participant. The
weighted-average health care cost trend rate for those participants not subject
to the cap is assumed to decrease gradually from 10 percent in 2004 to 5.5
percent in 2015.

The assumed health care cost trend rate impacts the amounts reported. A
one-percentage-point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would
have the following effects on the 2003 amounts:

In December 2003, President Bush signed into law the Medicare Prescription
Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act). The Act expanded
Medicare to include, for the first time, coverage for prescription drugs. We
sponsor retiree medical programs for most groups of employees in the United
States, and we expect that this legislation will eventually reduce our costs
for some of these programs. At this point, our investigation into our response
to the legislation is preliminary, as we await guidance from various
governmental and regulatory agencies concerning the requirements that must be
met to obtain these cost reductions, as well as the manner in which such
savings should be measured. Because of various uncertainties related to our
response to this legislation and the appropriate accounting methodology for
this event, we have elected to defer financial recognition of this legislation
until the FASB issues final accounting guidance. When issued, that final
guidance could require us to change previously reported information. This
deferral is permitted under FASB Staff Position No. FAS 106-1, “Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement
and Modernization Act of 2003.”

Plan Assets

The company follows a policy of broadly diversifying pension plan assets across
asset classes, investment managers, and individual holdings. Asset classes
that are considered appropriate include U.S. equities, non-U.S. equities, U.S.
fixed income, non-U.S. fixed income, real estate, and private equity
investments. Plan fiduciaries may consider and add other asset classes to the
investment program from time to time. Any use of leverage is prohibited. At
December 31, 2003, there were no shares of company stock included in plan
assets, compared with 4,300 shares at year-end 2002. Our funding policy for
U.S. plans is to contribute at least the minimum required by the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Contributions to foreign plans are
dependent upon local laws and tax regulations. In 2004, we expect to
contribute approximately $400 million to our domestic qualified and
non-qualified benefit plans and $100 million to our international qualified and
non-qualified benefit plans.

Weighted-average asset allocations at December 31 by asset category are as

The above asset allocations are all within guidelines established by the plan

A portion of the U.S. pension plan assets are held as a participating interest
in an insurance annuity contract. This participating interest is calculated as
the market value of investments held under this contract, less the accumulated
benefit obligation covered by the contract, and was valued at $169 million and
$198 million at December 31, 2003, and December 31, 2002, respectively. At
both December 31, 2003, and December 31, 2002, the participating interest
consisted of 62 percent debt securities and 38 percent equity securities. The
participating interest is not available for meeting general pension benefit
obligations in the near term. No future company contributions are required and
no new benefits are being accrued under this insurance annuity contract.

Defined Contribution Plans

Prior to the close of business on December 31, 2002, most U.S. employees
(excluding retail service station employees) were eligible to participate in
either the company-sponsored Thrift Plan of Phillips Petroleum Company, the
Long-Term Stock Savings Plan of Phillips Petroleum Company, the Tosco
Corporation Capital Accumulation Plan, and/or the Thrift Plan for Employees of
Conoco Inc. The new ConocoPhillips Savings Plan (CPSP) was created at the
close of business on December 31, 2002, with the merger of the Thrift Plan of
Phillips Petroleum Company into the Long-Term Stock Savings Plan of Phillips
Petroleum Company. The Thrift Plan of Phillips Petroleum Company became the
thrift feature of the CPSP, and the Long-Term Stock Savings Plan became the
stock savings feature. On the same date, most of the accounts in the Tosco
Corporation Capital Accumulation Plan were transferred into the CPSP. On
October 3, 2003, the assets of the Thrift Plan for Employees of Conoco Inc.
were merged into the CPSP, resulting in the CPSP becoming the primary defined
contribution plan for ConocoPhillips.

At December 31, 2003, employees could deposit up to 30 percent of their pay in
the thrift feature of the CPSP to a choice of 31 investment funds.
ConocoPhillips matched $1 for each $1 deposited, up to 1.25 percent of pay.
Company contributions charged to expense for the CPSP and the predecessor
plans, excluding the stock savings feature (discussed below), were $19 million
in 2003, $40 million in 2002, and $14 million in 2001.

The stock savings feature of the CPSP is a leveraged employee stock ownership
plan. Employees may elect to participate in the stock savings feature by
contributing 1 percent of their salaries and receiving an allocation of shares
of common stock proportionate to their contributions.

In 1990, the Long-Term Stock Savings Plan of Phillips Petroleum Company (now
the stock savings feature of the CPSP) borrowed funds that were used to
purchase previously unissued shares of company common stock. Since the company
guarantees the CPSP’s borrowings, the unpaid balance is reported as a liability
of the company and unearned compensation is shown as a reduction of common
stockholders’ equity. Dividends on all shares are charged against retained
earnings. The debt is serviced by the CPSP from company contributions and
dividends received on certain shares of common stock held by the plan,
including all unallocated shares. The shares held by the stock savings feature
of the CPSP are released for allocation to participant accounts based on debt
service payments on CPSP borrowings. In addition, during the period from 2004
through 2008, when no debt principal payments are scheduled to occur, the
company has committed to make direct contributions of stock to the stock
savings feature of the CPSP, or make prepayments on CPSP borrowings, to ensure
a certain minimum level of stock allocation to participant accounts.



We recognize interest expense as incurred and compensation expense based on the
fair market value of the stock contributed or on the cost of the unallocated
shares released, using the shares-allocated method. We recognized total CPSP
expense related to the stock savings feature of $76 million, $39 million and
$33 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, all of which was compensation
expense. In 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, we made cash contributions to
the CPSP of $0.2 million, $2 million and $17 million. In 2003, 2002 and 2001,
we contributed 1,483,780 shares, 771,479 shares and 292,857 shares,
respectively, of company common stock from the Compensation and Benefits Trust.
The shares had a fair market value of $80 million, $41 million and $17
million, respectively. Dividends used to service debt were $28 million each in
2003, 2002 and 2001.

These dividends reduced the amount of expense recognized each period. Interest
incurred on the CPSP debt in 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $5 million, $7 million and
$17 million, respectively.

The total CPSP stock savings feature shares as of December 31 were:

The fair value of unallocated shares at December 31, 2003, and 2002, was $464
million and $373 million, respectively.

We have several defined contribution plans for our international employees,
each with its own terms and eligibility depending on location. Total
compensation expense recognized for these international plans was approximately
$20 million in 2003, and was not significant in 2002 and 2001 because the
majority of these plans were acquired in the merger.

Stock-Based Compensation Plans

Under the Phillips Omnibus Securities Plan approved by shareholders in 1993,
stock options and stock awards for certain employees were authorized for up to
eight-tenths of 1 percent (0.8 percent) of the total outstanding shares as of
December 31 of the year preceding the awards. Any shares not issued in the
current year were available for future grant. Upon the adoption of the
Phillips 2002 Omnibus Securities Plan discussed below, the number of shares
available for issuance under the Phillips Omnibus Securities Plan was limited
to 700,000. The term of the Phillips Omnibus Securities Plan ended on December
31, 2002.

In 2001, shareholders approved the Phillips 2002 Omnibus Securities Plan, which
has a term of five years, from January 1, 2002, through December 31, 2006, and
which is authorized to issue approximately 18,000,000 shares of company common
stock. The two plans also provided for non-stock-based awards.

Stock options granted under provisions of the plans and earlier plans permit
purchase of our common stock at exercise prices equivalent to the average
market price of the stock on the date the options were granted. The options
have terms of 10 years and normally become exercisable in increments of up to
one-third on each anniversary date following the date of grant. Stock
Appreciation Rights (SARs) may, from time to time, be affixed to the options.
Options exercised in the form of SARs permit the holder to receive stock, or a
combination of cash and stock, subject to a declining cap on the exercise
price.

The merger was a change-in-control event that resulted in a lapsing of
restrictions on, and payout of, stock and stock option awards under the plans.
We offered to exchange certain stock awards under the plans with new awards in
the form of restricted stock units. These new restricted stock units were
converted, at the time of the merger, into awards based on the same number of
shares of our common stock.

Conoco had several stock-based compensation plans that were assumed in the
merger: the 1998 Stock and Performance Incentive Plan; the 1998 Key Employee
Stock Performance Plan; the 1998 Global Performance Sharing Plan; and the 2001
Global Performance Sharing Plan. Upon the merger, outstanding stock options
under these plans were converted to ConocoPhillips stock options at the merger
exchange ratio of 0.4677.

The Conoco plans award stock options at exercise prices equivalent to the
average market price of the stock on the date the option was granted. Awards
have option terms of 10 years and become exercisable based on various formulas,
including those that become exercisable one year from date of grant, and those
that become exercisable in increments of one-third on each anniversary date
following date of grant. In total, there were 10.3 million shares of company
stock at December 31, 2003, available for issuance under the Conoco plans.

In August 2002, we issued 23.3 million vested stock options to replace
unexercised Conoco stock options at the time of the merger. These options had
a weighted-average exercise price of $47.65 per option, and a Black-Scholes
option-pricing model value of $16.50 per option. In September 2001, we issued
4.7 million vested stock options to replace unexercised Tosco stock options at
the time of the acquisition. These options had a weighted-average exercise
price of $23.15 per option, and a Black-Scholes option-pricing model value of
$32.51 per option.

Compensation and Benefits Trust (CBT)

The CBT is an irrevocable grantor trust, administered by an independent trustee
and designed to acquire, hold and distribute shares of our common stock to fund
certain future compensation and benefit obligations of the company. The CBT
does not increase or alter the amount of benefits or compensation that will be
paid under existing plans, but offers us enhanced financial flexibility in
providing the funding requirements of those plans. We also have flexibility in
determining the timing of distributions of shares from the CBT to fund
compensation and benefits, subject to a minimum distribution schedule. The
trustee votes shares held by the CBT in accordance with voting directions from
eligible employees, as specified in a trust agreement with the trustee.



We sold 29.2 million shares of previously unissued company common stock to the
CBT in 1995 for $37 million of cash, previously contributed to the CBT by us,
and a promissory note from the CBT to us of $952 million. The CBT is
consolidated by ConocoPhillips, therefore the cash contribution and promissory
note are eliminated in consolidation. Shares held by the CBT are valued at
cost and do not affect earnings per share or total common stockholders’ equity
until after they are transferred out of the CBT. In 2003 and 2002, shares
transferred out of the CBT were 1,483,780 and 771,479, respectively. At
December 31, 2003, 25.3 million shares remained in the CBT. All shares are
required to be transferred out of the CBT by January 1, 2021.

Current assets, long-term assets, current liabilities and long-term liabilities
included deferred taxes of $-0- million, $53 million, $209 million and $8,565
million, respectively, at December 31, 2003, and $68 million, $41 million, $40
million and $8,361 million, respectively, at December 31, 2002.

We have operating loss and credit carryovers in multiple taxing jurisdictions.
These attributes generally expire between 2004 and 2013 with some carryovers,
including the alternative minimum tax, having indefinite carryforward periods.

Valuation allowances have been established for certain operating loss and
credit carryforwards that reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will,
more likely than not, be realized. Uncertainties that may affect the
realization of these assets include tax law changes and the future level of
product prices and costs. During 2003, valuation allowances increased
$298 million. This reflects increases of $498 million primarily
related to foreign tax loss carryforwards, partially offset by
decreases of $200 million, primarily related to foreign tax loss
carryforwards that have expired or that have been utilized. Based on our historical taxable income, its expectations
for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management expects
that remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to
reversing deferred tax liabilities and as offsets to the tax consequences of
future taxable income.

The Conoco purchase price allocation for the merger resulted in deferred tax
liabilities of $3,841 million. Included in this amount is a valuation
allowance for certain deferred tax assets of $251 million, for which
subsequently recognized tax benefits, if any, will be allocated to goodwill.



At December 31, 2003, and December 31, 2002, income considered to be
permanently reinvested in certain foreign subsidiaries and foreign corporate
joint ventures totaled approximately $2,046 million and $2,171 million,
respectively. Deferred income taxes have not been provided on this income,
as we do not plan to initiate any action that would require the payment of
income taxes. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional
tax that might be payable on this foreign income if distributed.

The amounts of U.S. and foreign income from continuing operations before income
taxes, with a reconciliation of tax at the federal statutory rate with the

(a)

Our Exploration and Production (E&P) segment sells natural gas to Duke
Energy Field Services, LLC (DEFS) and crude oil to the Malaysian Refining
Company Sdn. Bhd (Melaka), among others, for processing and marketing.
Natural gas liquids, solvents and petrochemical feedstocks are sold to
Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem) and refined products are
sold primarily to CFJ Properties. Also, we charge several of our
affiliates including CPChem, MSLP, Hamaca Holding LLC, and Venture Coke
Company for the use of common facilities, such as steam generators, waste
and water treaters, and warehouse facilities.



(b)

We purchase natural gas and natural gas liquids from DEFS and CPChem for
use in our refinery processes and other feedstocks from various
affiliates. We purchase crude oil from Petrozuata C.A. and refined
products from Melaka. We also pay fees to various pipeline equity
companies for transporting finished refined products.

(c)

We pay processing fees to various affiliates, the most significant being
MSLP. Additionally, we pay contract drilling fees to deepwater drillship
affiliates, crude oil transportation fees to pipeline equity companies,
and commissions to the receivable monetization companies.

(d)

We pay and/or receive interest to/from various affiliates including the
receivable monetization companies and MSLP.

Elimination of our equity percentage share of profit or loss included in our
inventory at December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, on the purchases from related
parties described above was not material. Additionally, elimination of our
profit or loss included in the related parties inventory at December 31, 2003,
2002, and 2001, on the revenues from related parties described above were not
material.

Note 28-Segment Disclosures and Related Information

We have organized our reporting structure based on the grouping of similar
products and services, resulting in five operating segments:



Corporate and Other includes general corporate overhead; all interest income
and expense; preferred dividend requirements of capital trusts; discontinued
operations; restructuring charges; goodwill resulting from the merger of Conoco
and Phillips that had not yet been allocated to the operating segments; certain
eliminations; and various other corporate activities. Corporate assets include
all cash and cash equivalents.

We evaluate performance and allocate resources based on net income. Segment
accounting policies are the same as those in Note 1-Accounting Policies.
Intersegment sales are at prices that approximate market.

Note 29-New Accounting Standards

In December 2003, the FASB revised and reissued SFAS No. 132 (revised 2003),
“Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits-an
amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, and 106,” which revises and requires
additional disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit
plans. It does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans
required by previous Financial Accounting Board Standards. We adopted the
provisions of this Standard effective December 2003. Certain provisions of
this Standard regarding disclosure of information about foreign plans and
disclosure of estimated future benefit payments are not required until 2004.
The adoption of the



provisions applicable to 2003 did not have an impact on our results of
operations or financial position, nor will the adoption of the additional
provisions in 2004 have an impact on our results of operations or financial
position.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of Liabilities and Equity,” to address the
balance sheet classification of certain financial instruments that have
characteristics of both liabilities and equity. This statement was immediately
effective for all contracts created or modified after May 31, 2003, and became
effective July 1, 2003, for all previously existing contracts. On November 7,
2003, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 150-3, which deferred certain
provisions of SFAS No. 150. As a result of adopting this new accounting
standard in the third quarter of 2003, and the subsequent November 7, 2003,
deferral of certain provisions, there was no impact on our 2003 financial
statements. We continue to monitor the deferral status of SFAS No. 150.



Oil and Gas Operations

(Unaudited)

Exploration and Production

In accordance with SFAS No. 69, “Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing
Activities,” and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC), we are making certain supplemental disclosures about our oil and gas
exploration and production operations. While this information was developed
with reasonable care and disclosed in good faith, it is emphasized that some of
the data is necessarily imprecise and represents only approximate amounts
because of the subjective judgments involved in developing such information.
Accordingly, this information may not necessarily represent our current
financial condition or our expected future results.

Our disclosures by geographic area include the United States (U.S.), European
North Sea (Norway and the United Kingdom), Asia Pacific, Canada and Other
Areas. When we use equity accounting for operations that have proved reserves,
these oil and gas operations are shown separately and designated as Equity
Affiliates. In 2003 and 2002, these consisted of two heavy-oil projects in
Venezuela, an oil development project in Northern Russia and a heavy-oil
project in Canada. In 2001, this consisted of a heavy-oil project in
Venezuela.

Amounts in 2002 were impacted by the merger of Conoco and Phillips (the merger)
in late August 2002.

n

Purchases in 2002 were primarily related to the merger.

n

At the end of 2000, Other Areas included 2 million barrels of reserves
in Venezuela in which we had an economic interest through risk-service
contracts. These properties were sold in June 2001. Our net
production related to these contracts was approximately 400,000
barrels in 2001 and 1,200,000 barrels in 2000.

n

In addition to conventional crude oil, natural gas and natural gas
liquids (NGL) proved reserves, we have proved oil sands reserves in
Canada, associated with a Syncrude project totaling 265 million
barrels at the end of 2003. For internal management purposes, we view
these reserves and their development as part of our total exploration
and production operations. However, U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission regulations define these reserves as mining related.
Therefore, they are not included in our tabular presentation of proved
crude oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. These oil sands reserves
also are not included in the standardized measure of discounted future
net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserve quantities.

n

Natural gas liquids reserves include estimates of natural gas liquids to
be extracted from our leasehold gas at our gas processing plants or
facilities. Estimates are based at the wellhead and assume full
extraction. Production above differs from natural gas liquids production
per day delivered for sale primarily due to:

(1)

Natural gas consumed at the lease.

(2)

Natural gas liquids production delivered for sale includes only
natural gas liquids extracted from our leasehold gas and sold by our
Exploration and Production (E&P) segment, whereas the production above
also includes natural gas liquids extracted from our leasehold gas at
equity-affiliate or third-party facilities.

n

Purchases in 2002 were related to the merger.

Includes $63 million and $27 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, for a Syncrude oil project in Canada that is defined as a mining operation by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regulations.



n

Results of operations for producing activities consist of all the
activities within the E&P organization, except for pipeline and marine
operations, liquefied natural gas operations, a Canadian Syncrude
operation, and crude oil and gas marketing activities, which are
included in Other earnings. Also excluded are non-E&P activities,
including our Midstream segment, downstream petroleum and chemical
activities, as well as general corporate administrative expenses and
interest.



n

The provision for income taxes is computed by adjusting each country’s
income before income taxes for permanent differences related to the oil and
gas producing activities that are reflected in our consolidated income tax
expense for the period, multiplying the result by the country’s statutory
tax rate and adjusting for applicable tax credits. In 2003, this included a
$105 million benefit related to the repeal of the Norway Removal Grant Act,
a $95 million benefit related to the reduction in the Canada and Alberta
provincial tax rates, a $46 million benefit related to the impairment of
Angola Block 34, and a $27 million benefit related to the re-alignment
agreement of the Bayu-Undan project in the Timor Sea.

n

Other earnings consist of activities within the E&P segment that are not
a part of the “Results of operations for producing activities.” These
non-producing activities include pipeline and marine operations, liquefied
natural gas operations, a Canadian Syncrude operation, and crude oil and
gas marketing activities.

Capitalized costs include the cost of equipment and facilities for oil
and gas producing activities. These costs include the activities of our
E&P organization, excluding pipeline and marine operations, liquefied
natural gas operations, a Canadian Syncrude operation, and crude oil and
natural gas marketing activities.

n

Proved properties include capitalized costs for oil and gas leaseholds
holding proved reserves; development wells and related equipment and
facilities (including uncompleted development well costs); and support
equipment.

n

Unproved properties include capitalized costs for oil and gas leaseholds
under exploration (including where petroleum liquids and natural gas were
found but determination of the economic viability of the required
infrastructure is dependent upon further exploratory work under way or
firmly planned) and for uncompleted exploratory well costs, including
exploratory wells under evaluation.



n

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows

Relating to Proved Oil and Gas Reserve Quantities

Amounts are computed using year-end prices and costs (adjusted only for
existing contractual changes), appropriate statutory tax rates and a prescribed
10 percent discount factor. Continuation of year-end economic conditions also
is assumed. The calculation is based on estimates of proved reserves, which
are revised over time as new data become available. Probable or possible
reserves, which may become proved in the future, are not considered. The
calculation also requires assumptions as to the timing of future production of
proved reserves, and the timing and amount of future development, including
dismantlement, and production costs.

While due care was taken in its preparation, we do not represent that this data
is the fair value of our oil and gas properties, or a fair estimate of the
present value of cash flows to be obtained from their development and
production.

During the fourth quarter, in connection with the consolidation requirements of FASB Interpretation No. 46 for certain variable interest entities created before February 1, 2003, we made an additional adjustment of
$18 million, or 3 cents per share, both on a basic and diluted basis, to Cumulative Effect of Changes in Accounting Principles. This adjustment was effective as of January 1, 2003, and as a result, the first and
second quarter results have been restated from those disclosed in
Note 2—Changes in Accounting Principles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in our third quarter 2003 Form 10-Q.



Condensed Consolidating Financial Information

In connection with the merger of ConocoPhillips Holding Company (formerly named
Conoco Inc.) and ConocoPhillips Company (formerly named Phillips Petroleum
Company) with wholly owned subsidiaries of ConocoPhillips, and to simplify our
credit structure, the companies have established various cross guarantees.
With the new organizational structure, ConocoPhillips Company is the direct or
indirect parent of former Conoco and Phillips subsidiaries and is wholly owned
by ConocoPhillips Holding Company, which is wholly owned by ConocoPhillips.
ConocoPhillips and ConocoPhillips Holding Company have fully and
unconditionally guaranteed the payment obligations of ConocoPhillips Company
with respect to its publicly held debt securities. Similarly, ConocoPhillips
and ConocoPhillips Company have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the
payment obligations of ConocoPhillips Holding Company with respect to the
publicly held debt securities of ConocoPhillips Holding Company. In addition,
ConocoPhillips Company and ConocoPhillips Holding Company have fully and
unconditionally guaranteed the payment obligations of ConocoPhillips with
respect to its publicly held debt securities. All guarantees are joint and
several. The following condensed consolidating financial statements present
the results of operations, financial position and cash flows for:

•

ConocoPhillips, ConocoPhillips Holding Company, ConocoPhillips
Company, (in each case, reflecting investments in subsidiaries
utilizing the equity method of accounting);

•

All other non-guarantor subsidiaries of ConocoPhillips Holding
Company and ConocoPhillips Company; and

•

The consolidating adjustments necessary to present ConocoPhillips’
results on a consolidated basis.

During 2003, Tosco Corporation, Bayway Refining Company and Marcus Hook
Refining Company were merged into ConocoPhillips Company. Previously reported
prior period information has been restated to reflect this reorganization of
companies under common control.

This condensed consolidating financial information should be read in
conjunction with our accompanying consolidated financial statements.
