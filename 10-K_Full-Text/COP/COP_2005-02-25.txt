Items 1 and 2.    BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES

CORPORATE STRUCTURE

ConocoPhillips is an international, integrated energy company. ConocoPhillips was incorporated in
the state of Delaware on November 16, 2001, in connection with, and in anticipation of, the merger
between Conoco Inc. (Conoco) and Phillips Petroleum Company (Phillips). The merger between Conoco
and Phillips (the merger) was consummated on August 30, 2002, at which time Conoco and Phillips
combined their businesses by merging with separate acquisition subsidiaries of ConocoPhillips. As
a result of the merger, Conoco and Phillips each became wholly owned subsidiaries of
ConocoPhillips. For accounting purposes, Phillips was designated as the acquirer of Conoco and
ConocoPhillips was treated as the successor of Phillips. Accordingly, Phillips’ operations and
results are presented in this Form 10-K for all periods prior to the close of the merger. From the
merger date forward, the operations and results of ConocoPhillips reflect the combined operations
of the two companies. Subsequent to the merger, Conoco was renamed ConocoPhillips Holding Company,
and Phillips was renamed ConocoPhillips Company, but for ease of reference, those companies will be
referred to respectively in this document as Conoco and Phillips. Effective January 1, 2005,
ConocoPhillips Holding Company was merged into ConocoPhillips Company.

Our business is organized into six operating segments:

•

Exploration and Production (E&P)—

This segment primarily explores for, produces and
markets crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis.

•

Midstream—

This segment gathers and processes natural gas produced by ConocoPhillips and
others, and fractionates and markets natural gas liquids, primarily in the United States,
Canada and Trinidad. The Midstream segment includes our 30.3 percent equity investment in
Duke Energy Field Services, LLC, a joint venture with Duke Energy.

•

Refining and Marketing (R&M)—

This segment purchases, refines, markets and transports
crude oil and petroleum products, mainly in the United States, Europe and Asia.

•

LUKOIL Investment—

This segment consists of our equity investment in the ordinary shares
of LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia. Our
investment was 10 percent at December 31, 2004.



•

Chemicals—

This segment manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a
worldwide basis. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in
Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC, a joint venture with ChevronTexaco Corporation.

•

Emerging Businesses—

This segment encompasses the development of new businesses beyond
our traditional operations, including new technologies related to natural gas conversion
into clean fuels and related products (e.g., gas-to-liquids), technology solutions, power
generation, and emerging technologies.

At December 31, 2004, ConocoPhillips employed approximately 35,800 people.

SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

For operating segment and geographic information, see Note 27—Segment Disclosures and Related
Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein by
reference.

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION (E&P)

This segment explores for, produces and markets crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids on
a worldwide basis. It also mines deposits of oil sands in Canada to extract the bitumen and
upgrade it into a synthetic crude oil. Operations to liquefy and transport natural gas are also
included in the E&P segment. At December 31, 2004, our E&P operations were producing in the United
States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Venezuela, Indonesia, offshore Timor Leste in the Timor
Sea, Australia, Vietnam, China, Nigeria, the United Arab Emirates, and Russia.

The E&P segment does not include the results or statistics from our equity investment in LUKOIL,
which are reported in a separate segment (LUKOIL Investment). As a result, references to results,
production, prices and other statistics throughout the E&P segment exclude those related to our
equity investment in LUKOIL.

The information listed below appears in the supplemental oil and gas operations disclosures on
pages 168 through 186 and is incorporated herein by reference:

In 2004, E&P’s worldwide production, including its share of equity affiliates’ production other
than LUKOIL, averaged 1,542,000 barrels-of-oil-equivalent (BOE) per day, a 3 percent decrease from
1,590,000 BOE per day in 2003. During 2004, 629,000 BOE per day were produced in the United
States, a 7 percent decrease from 674,000 BOE per day in 2003. Production from our international
E&P operations averaged 913,000 BOE per day in 2004, down slightly from 916,000 BOE per day in
2003. In addition, our Canadian Syncrude mining operations had net production of 21,000 barrels
per day in 2004, compared with 19,000 barrels per day in 2003. The decreased production mainly
reflects the impact of



asset dispositions during 2003 and 2004, as well as normal field production declines. The impact
of these items was partially offset by the ramp-up of oil production from the Su Tu Den field in
Vietnam since startup in late 2003, the ramp-up of liquids production from the Bayu-Undan field in
the Timor Sea since startup in February 2004, and the startup of the Hamaca upgrader in Venezuela
in the fourth quarter of 2004. We convert our natural gas production to BOE based on a 6:1 ratio:
six thousand cubic feet of natural gas equals one barrel-of-oil-equivalent.

E&P’s worldwide annual average crude oil sales price increased 31 percent in 2004, from $27.52 per
barrel to $36.06 per barrel. E&P’s annual average worldwide natural gas sales price also
increased, going from $4.08 per thousand cubic feet in 2003 to $4.61 per thousand cubic feet in
2004.

At December 31, 2004, E&P held, including its share of equity affiliates other than LUKOIL, a
combined 43.2 million net developed and undeveloped acres, compared with 52.6 million net acres at
year-end 2003. The decrease in acreage primarily reflects the assignment of our interests in
Barbados and Brazil, in addition to the sale of Petrovera. At year-end 2004, E&P held acreage in
22 countries, including acreage held by equity affiliates.

Our finding-and-development-cost-per-BOE metric reported in prior years was calculated by dividing
the net reserve change for each reporting period (excluding production and sales) into the costs
incurred for the period, as reported in the “Costs Incurred” disclosure required by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 69, “Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities.” Due
to the timing of proved reserve additions and the timing of the related costs incurred to find and
develop such proved reserves, this metric often includes quantities of proved reserves for which a
majority of the costs of development have not yet been incurred. Conversely, the metric also often
includes costs to develop proved reserves that had been added in earlier years. Because this
metric may not necessarily represent total finding and development costs for projects under way or
may not be indicative of expected future finding and development costs, we discontinued reporting
it in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

E&P—U.S. OPERATIONS

In 2004, U.S. E&P operations contributed 40 percent of E&P’s worldwide liquids production, compared
with 43 percent in 2003. U.S. E&P contributed 42 percent of natural gas production in both years.

Alaska

Greater Prudhoe Area

The Greater Prudhoe Area is comprised of the Prudhoe Bay field and satellites, as well as the
Greater Point McIntyre Area fields. We have a 36.1 percent interest in all fields within the
Greater Prudhoe Area, all of which are operated by BP p.l.c.

The Prudhoe Bay field is the largest oil field on Alaska’s North Slope. It is the site of a large
waterflood and enhanced oil recovery operation, as well as a gas processing plant that processes
and reinjects natural gas back into the reservoir. Our net crude oil production from the Prudhoe
Bay field averaged 109,600 barrels per day in 2004, compared with 121,500 barrels per day in 2003,
while natural gas liquids production averaged 23,100 barrels per day in 2004, compared with 23,000
barrels per day in 2003. Normal field production declines and facility maintenance were the main
causes of the lower production rates in 2004.



Prudhoe Bay satellite fields, including Aurora, Borealis, Polaris, Midnight Sun, and Orion,
produced 14,600 net barrels per day of crude oil in 2004, compared with 16,200 net barrels per day
in 2003. Borealis contributed the biggest share in 2004, producing 8,000 net barrels per day. All
Prudhoe Bay satellite fields produce through the Prudhoe Bay production facilities.

The Greater Point McIntyre Area (GPMA) primarily is made up of the Point McIntyre, Niakuk, and
Lisburne fields. The fields within the GPMA generally produce through the Lisburne Production
Center. Net crude oil production for GPMA averaged 17,800 barrels per day in 2004, compared with
18,200 barrels per day in 2003. The bulk of this production came from the Point McIntyre field,
which is approximately seven miles north of the Prudhoe Bay field and extends into the Beaufort
Sea.

In January 2005, the Governor of Alaska announced that effective February 1, 2005, most satellite
fields surrounding the Prudhoe Bay field would no longer qualify for a state production tax
incentive that was intended to encourage development of these marginal deposits. Beginning in
February, these satellite fields bear the same production tax rate as Prudhoe Bay.

Greater Kuparuk Area

We operate the Greater Kuparuk Area, which is comprised of the Kuparuk field and four satellite
fields: Tarn, Tabasco, Meltwater, and West Sak. Our ownership interest is 55.2 percent in the
Kuparuk field, which is located about 40 miles west of Prudhoe Bay. Field installations include
three central production facilities that separate oil, natural gas and water. The natural gas is
either used for fuel or compressed for reinjection. Our net crude oil production from the Kuparuk
field averaged 67,900 barrels per day in 2004, compared with 78,600 barrels per day in 2003.

Other fields within the Greater Kuparuk Area produced 19,300 net barrels per day of crude oil in
2004, compared with 21,800 net barrels per day in 2003, primarily from the Tarn, Tabasco, and
Meltwater satellites. We have a 55.3 percent interest in Tarn and Tabasco and a 55.4 percent
interest in Meltwater.

The Greater Kuparuk Area also includes the West Sak heavy-oil field. Our net crude oil production
from West Sak averaged 5,500 barrels per day in 2004, compared with 3,800 barrels per day in 2003.
We have a 52.2 percent interest in this field.

During 2004, we and our co-venturers announced plans for the expansion of the West Sak development.
The development program includes two drill sites: Drill Site 1E, which is an existing drill site,
and Drill Site 1J, which will be the first stand-alone West Sak drill site. Plans call for the
drilling of 13 wells at Drill Site 1E and 31 wells at Drill Site 1J. The development projects also
include expansion of facilities at Drill Site 1E, and the construction of new facilities, pipelines
and power lines for Drill Site 1J. Drill Site 1E, which started up in July 2004, is expected to
average 4,100 net barrels of oil per day in 2005. First production from Drill Site 1J, expected in
late 2005, is expected to add approximately 800 net barrels per day. Peak production from Drill
Site 1J is expected to occur in 2007.

Western North Slope

The Alpine field, located west of the Kuparuk field, began production in November 2000. In 2004,
the field produced at a net rate of 63,500 barrels of oil per day, compared with 64,500 barrels per
day in 2003. We are the operator and hold a 78 percent interest in Alpine.

During 2004, the Alpine Capacity Expansion Phase I was completed. As a result, Alpine’s gross
crude oil production capacity increased approximately 5,000 barrels per day, along with an increase
in the site’s produced-water capacity. Originally designed to process about 10,000 barrels per day
of produced water, the site can now process about 100,000 barrels per day. The completion of Phase
II is scheduled for 2005,



after which Alpine’s crude oil production capacity is expected to be further expanded by
approximately 30,000 gross barrels per day with increased seawater injection rates to boost
reservoir pressure.

In January 2003, ConocoPhillips and the U.S. Department of Interior Bureau of Land Management (BLM)
signed a Memorandum of Understanding that provides for completion of an Environmental Impact
Statement (EIS) for Alpine satellites, as well as future potential developments in the northeast
corner of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A) and near the Alpine oil field. The BLM
issued a favorable EIS Record of Decision in November 2004. In December 2004, we and our
co-venturers announced that the companies approved the development of two Alpine satellite oil
fields—Fiord and Nanuq. The project will include two satellite drill sites—CD 3 on the Fiord oil
field, and CD 4 on the Nanuq oil field—located within an 8-mile radius of the Alpine oil field.
Plans call for the drilling of approximately 40 wells, with first production scheduled for late
2006 and peak production in 2008. The oil will be processed through the existing Alpine
facilities. The companies intend to seek state, local and federal permits for additional Alpine
satellite developments in the NPR-A. A final decision to move forward on these satellite oil
fields is not expected to be made until the outcomes of remaining permits are known.

Cook Inlet

Our assets in Alaska also include the North Cook Inlet field, the Beluga River natural gas field,
and the Kenai liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility.

We have a 100 percent interest in the North Cook Inlet field. Net production in 2004 averaged 94
million cubic feet per day, compared with 112 million cubic feet per day in 2003. Production from
the North Cook Inlet field is used to supply our share of gas to the Kenai LNG plant (discussed
below).

Our interest in the Beluga River field is 33 percent. Net production averaged 63 million cubic
feet per day in 2004, the same as in 2003. Gas from the Beluga River field is sold to local
utilities and industrial consumers, and used as back-up supply to the Kenai LNG plant.

We have a 70 percent interest in the Kenai LNG plant, which supplies LNG to two utility companies
in Japan. Using two tankers, the company transports the LNG to Japan, where it is reconverted to
dry gas at the receiving terminal. We sold 38.6 net billion cubic feet of LNG to Japan in 2004,
compared with 44.0 billion cubic feet in 2003.

Exploration

During the 2004 winter drilling season, we drilled six North Slope exploration and appraisal wells.
This activity resulted in two successful appraisal wells in the NPR-A and
one successful appraisal well in the West Sak field. We expensed the other three wells
as dry holes. In addition, successful exploratory production tests were run in two wells, one each
in the Alpine and Prudhoe Bay fields. During 2004, we completed evaluation of six wells drilled in
prior drilling seasons, with five of those determined to be successful and one expensed as a dry
hole. We were also the successful bidder on 71 tracts covering over 808,000 gross acres
(approximately 484,000 net acres) at the June 2004 Bureau of Land Management oil and gas lease sale
for the Northwest Planning Area of the NPR-A. As a result of this additional acreage, we now have
under lease approximately 1.3 million net exploration acres in the NPR-A.

Transportation

We transport the petroleum liquids that we produce on the North Slope to market through the
Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS), an 800-mile pipeline, marine terminal, spill response and
escort vessel system that ties the North Slope of Alaska to the port of Valdez in south-central
Alaska. We have a 28.3 percent ownership interest in TAPS. We also have ownership interests in
the Alpine, Kuparuk and Oliktok pipelines on the North Slope.



The owners of TAPS approved plans to upgrade the pipeline’s pump stations. The project is expected
to be substantially completed in 2005. The project is expected to reduce operating costs and
extend the economic life of the pipeline through increased efficiencies, while maintaining safety
and environmental performance standards.

We continue to evaluate a gas pipeline project to deliver natural gas from Alaska’s North Slope to
the Lower 48. Given the size of the project and risk associated with it, we continue to believe
that risk mitigation mechanisms and improvements in project economics are necessary before this
project can proceed. The Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline Act was passed by Congress and signed by the
President in October 2004. This legislation was designed to help facilitate and streamline the
federal regulatory process and provides up to $18 billion in federal loan guarantees. Also
approved was tax legislation granting seven-year depreciation to the Alaska portion of the pipeline
and confirming the existing 15 percent enhanced oil recovery tax credit would apply to the gas
treating plant. This federal legislation, along with gaining a fiscal contract with the state of
Alaska, is an integral part of moving the project forward. Also in 2004, ConocoPhillips, along
with BP and ExxonMobil, entered into negotiations with the state of Alaska under the Stranded Gas
Development Act and submitted a detailed proposal to the state in December. These negotiations are
ongoing.

Our wholly owned subsidiary, Polar Tankers Inc., manages the marine transportation of our Alaska
North Slope production. Polar Tankers operates six ships in the Alaskan trade, chartering
additional third-party-operated vessels, as necessary. Beginning with the

Polar Endeavour

in 2001,
Polar Tankers has brought into service a new Endeavour Class tanker each year since: the

Polar
Resolution

in 2002; the

Polar Discovery

in 2003; and the

Polar Adventure

in 2004. These
125,000-deadweight-ton, double-hulled crude oil tankers are the first four of five Endeavour Class
tankers that we are adding to our Alaska-trade fleet. The fifth and final tanker is scheduled to
be in Alaska North Slope service by 2006.

Lower 48 States

Gulf of Mexico

At year-end 2004, our portfolio of producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico included four fields
operated by us and four fields operated by our co-venturers. At December 31, 2004, we had 28
leases in production or under development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.

We hold a 16 percent interest in the Ursa field located in the Mississippi Canyon area. Ursa
utilizes a tension-leg platform in approximately 3,900 feet of water. We also own a 16 percent
interest in the Princess field, a northern, subsalt extension of the Ursa field. Our total net
production from both fields in 2004 averaged 21,000 barrels per day of liquids and 30 million cubic
feet per day of natural gas, compared with 15,900 barrels per day of liquids and 20 million cubic
feet per day of natural gas in 2003.

We operate and hold a 75 percent interest in the Garden Banks 783 and 784 leases, which contain the
Magnolia field discovered in 1999. Installation of a tension-leg platform, located in
approximately 4,700 feet of water, was completed during 2004. First oil production began in
December 2004, with the remaining well completions scheduled through the first half of 2005. Peak
production of 48,000 net BOE per day is expected during 2005.

We have a 16.8 percent interest in the K2 discovery. K2, located in Green Canyon Block 562, was
company-sanctioned for development in the first quarter of 2004. The development will utilize a
subsea tieback to a nearby third-party platform. First production is expected in the second half
of 2005, with peak net production of 7,000 BOE per day expected during 2007.

During 2004, we sold our interest in the Lorien discovery located in Green Canyon Block 199.



Onshore

Our onshore Lower 48 production primarily consists of natural gas, with the majority of the
production located in the Lobo Trend in South Texas, the San Juan Basin of New Mexico, and the
Guymon-Hugoton Trend in the Panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma. We also have oil and natural gas
production from the Permian Basin in West Texas and southeast New Mexico. Other positions and
production are maintained in other parts of Texas and Oklahoma, the Arkansas/Louisiana/Texas area,
and onshore Gulf Coast area. In addition to our coalbed methane production from the San Juan
Basin, we also hold coalbed methane acreage positions in the Uinta Basin in Utah and the Black
Warrior Basin in Alabama. Our interest in the coalbed methane acreage position in the Powder River
Basin in Wyoming was sold in early 2005.

Activities in 2004 primarily were centered on continued optimization and development of these
assets. Combined production from Lower 48 onshore fields in 2004 averaged a net 1,184 million
cubic feet per day of natural gas and 54,100 barrels per day of liquids, compared with 1,237
million cubic feet per day of natural gas and 57,000 barrels per day of liquids in 2003.

E&P—NORTHWEST EUROPE

In 2004, E&P operations in Northwest Europe contributed 29 percent of E&P’s worldwide liquids
production, compared with 30 percent in 2003. Our Northwest European assets are principally
located in the Norwegian and U.K. sectors of the North Sea. Northwest Europe operations
contributed 34 percent of natural gas production in both years.

Norway

The Ekofisk Area is located approximately 200 miles offshore Norway in the center of the North Sea.
The Ekofisk Area is comprised of four producing fields: Ekofisk, Eldfisk, Embla, and Tor. Ekofisk
serves as a hub for petroleum operations in the area, with surrounding developments utilizing the
Ekofisk infrastructure. Net production in 2004 from the Ekofisk Area was 127,400 barrels of
liquids per day and 125 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, compared with 126,500 barrels of
liquids per day and 127 million cubic feet of natural gas per day in 2003. We are operator and
hold a 35.1 percent interest in Ekofisk.

In 2003, we and our co-venturers approved a plan for further development of the Ekofisk Area. The
project consists of two interrelated components: construction of a new platform, Ekofisk 2/4M, and
modification of the existing Ekofisk Complex to increase processing capacity. Construction began
in 2003, and during 2004 the 2/4M platform progressed on schedule. Production from the new
platform is projected to begin in the fall of 2005.

We also have ownership interests in other producing fields in the Norwegian North Sea, and
Norwegian Sea, including a 24.3 percent interest in the Heidrun field, a 10.3 percent interest in
the Statfjord field, a 23.3 percent interest in the Huldra field, a 1.6 percent interest in the
Troll field, a 9.1 percent interest in the Visund field, a 6.4 percent interest in the Grane field,
and a 2.4 percent interest in the Oseberg area. Production from these and other fields in the
Norwegian sector of the North Sea and the Norwegian Sea averaged a net 87,700 barrels of liquids
per day and 176 million cubic feet of natural gas per day in 2004, compared with 93,300 barrels of
liquids per day and 149 million cubic feet of natural gas per day in 2003.

We and our co-venturers received approval from Norwegian authorities in October 2004 for the
Alvheim North Sea development. The development plans include a floating production storage and
offloading vessel and subsea installations. Production from the field is expected to commence in
2007. We have a 20 percent interest in the project.



Transportation

We have interests in the transportation and processing infrastructure in the Norwegian North Sea,
including a 35.1 percent interest in the Norpipe Oil Pipeline System, a 2.3 percent interest in
Gassled, which owns most of the Norwegian gas transportation system, and a 1.6 percent interest in
the southern part of the planned Langeled gas pipeline.

Exploration

Three partner-operated exploration wells were drilled in 2004. All three were near-field
exploration wells in the Heidrun and Visund licenses. The drilling near Heidrun resulted in one
discovery and one dry hole. The well in the Visund area was a hydrocarbon discovery. In 2005,
seven to eight wells are planned to be drilled in Norway and Denmark.

United Kingdom

We are a joint operator of the Britannia natural gas/condensate field, in which we have a 58.7
percent interest. Our net production from Britannia averaged 347 million cubic feet of natural gas
per day and 15,500 barrels of liquids per day in 2004, compared with 391 million cubic feet of
natural gas per day and 14,500 barrels of liquids per day in 2003. Oil and gas production from
Britannia is delivered by pipeline to Scotland. Development drilling in the Britannia field is
expected to continue into the year 2007.

In December 2003, we approved a plan for the development of two new Britannia satellite fields: the
Callanish and Brodgar fields. The U.K. government approved the development plan in early 2004.
The development plan involves producing the fields via subsea manifolds and two new pipelines to
Britannia. A new platform, bridge-linked to Britannia, will also be installed to separate
production prior to processing on the Britannia platform. Drilling began in the second half of
2004, with the pipelines, manifolds and installation of the bridge-linked platform anticipated for
2006. First production is targeted for 2007. We have a 75 percent interest in the Brodgar field
and an 83.5 percent interest in the Callanish field.

We operate and hold a 36.5 percent interest in the Judy/Joanne fields, which together comprise
J-Block. Additionally, the Jade field produces from a wellhead platform and pipeline tied to the
J-Block facilities. We are the operator of, and hold a 32.5 percent interest in, Jade. Together,
these fields produced a net 14,100 barrels of liquids per day and 118 million cubic feet of natural
gas per day in 2004, compared with 18,100 barrels of liquids per day and 118 million cubic feet of
natural gas per day in 2003.

ConocoPhillips continues to supply gas from J-Block to Enron Capital and Trade Resources Limited
(Enron Capital), which was placed in Administration in the United Kingdom on November 29, 2001.
ConocoPhillips has been paid all amounts currently due and payable by Enron Capital in respect of
the J-Block gas sales agreement. We believe that Enron Capital will continue to pay the amounts
due for gas supplied by us in accordance with the terms of the gas sales agreement. We do not
currently expect that we will have to curtail sales of gas under the gas sales agreement or shut in
production as a result of the Administration of Enron Capital. However, in the event that the
arrangements for the processing of Enron Capital’s gas are terminated or Enron Capital goes into
liquidation, there may be additional risk of production being reduced or shut-in.

We have various ownership interests in 13 producing gas fields in the southern North Sea, in the
Rotliegendes and Carboniferous areas. Net production in 2004 averaged 306 million cubic feet per
day of natural gas and 1,400 barrels of liquids per day, compared with 371 million cubic feet per
day of natural gas and 2,000 barrels per day of liquids in 2003.

The Valkyrie development was brought into production in 2004. This is a single well development
drilled from a nearby platform. We are the operator with a 50 percent interest.



During 2004, we received approval from the U.K. government for development of the Saturn Unit Area
in the southern North Sea. First gas production from the Saturn Unit Area is expected in the
fourth quarter of 2005, with net production expected to increase to a maximum rate of approximately
73 million cubic feet per day within a year following startup. Initially, the development will
consist of three wells from a six-slot wellhead platform. We are the operator of the Saturn Unit
Area and have an interest of 42.9 percent.

During 2004, we concluded the development of the CMS3 area in the southern sector of the U.K. North
Sea with the completion of the Boulton H-1 well. This development consists of five natural gas
reservoirs developed as a single, unitized project. Collectively, these fields are known as CMS3
due to their utilization of the production and transportation facilities of the
ConocoPhillips-operated Caister Murdoch System (CMS). We are the operator of CMS3 and hold a 59.5
percent interest.

Also during 2004, we received internal and co-venturer approvals for the Munro development, and are
working toward U.K. governmental approval in the first quarter of 2005. Munro is a single well
development which would tie into the Hawksley subsea manifold (part of CMS3). We are the operator
of Munro with a 46 percent interest.

We also have ownership interests in several other producing fields in the U.K. North Sea, including
a 23.4 percent interest in the Alba field, a 40 percent interest in the MacCulloch field, a 30
percent interest in the Miller field, an 11.5 percent interest in the Armada field, and a 4.8
percent interest in the Statfjord field. Production from these and the other remaining fields in
the U.K. sector of the North Sea averaged a net 38,800 barrels of liquids per day and 47 million
cubic feet of natural gas per day in 2004, compared with 44,500 barrels of liquids per day and 61
million cubic feet of natural gas per day in 2003.

We have a 24 percent interest in the Clair field development in the Atlantic Margin. First
production from Clair is expected in early 2005, with plateau production expected in 2006
at a net rate of 14,400 BOE per day.

Transportation

The Interconnector pipeline, which connects the United Kingdom and Belgium, facilitates marketing
natural gas produced in the United Kingdom throughout Europe. Our 10 percent equity share of the
Interconnector pipeline allows us to ship approximately 200 million net cubic feet of natural gas
per day to markets in continental Europe.

We operate two terminals in the United Kingdom: the Teesside oil terminal (in which we have a 29.3
percent interest) and the Theddlethorpe gas terminal (in which we have a 50 percent interest).

Exploration

In the U.K. sector of the North Sea, we participated in two wells in the southern North Sea and one
well on a structure adjacent to the Callanish field in the central North Sea during 2004. All
three of these wells were successful in locating commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. The
planned drilling program for 2005 includes seven to eight exploration and appraisal wells.

E&P—CANADA

In 2004, E&P operations in Canada contributed 4 percent of E&P’s worldwide liquids production
(excluding Syncrude production), compared with 5 percent in 2003. Canadian operations contributed
13 percent of natural gas production in both years.



Oil and Gas Operations

Western Canada

Operations in western Canada encompass properties in Alberta, northeastern British Columbia and
southwestern Saskatchewan. We separate our holdings in western Canada into four geographic
regions. The north region contains a mix of oil and natural gas, and primarily is accessible only
in the winter. The central and west regions mainly produce natural gas. The south region has
shallow gas and medium-to-heavy oil. Production from these oil and gas operations in western
Canada averaged a net 35,000 barrels per day of liquids and 433 million cubic feet per day of
natural gas in 2004, compared with 30,300 barrels per day of liquids and 435 million cubic feet per
day of natural gas in 2003.

In February 2004, we sold our 46.7 percent interest in Petrovera, a joint venture that produced
heavy oil.

Surmont

The Surmont lease is located about 35 miles south of Fort McMurray, Alberta. We own a 43.5 percent
interest and are the operator. In May 2003, we received regulatory approval to develop the Surmont
project from the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board and in late 2003, our Board of Directors
approved the project. In 2003, we classified 223 million barrels as proved crude oil reserves from
our Canadian operations, the majority of which related to the Surmont heavy-oil project.
Consistent with our practice and in accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
guidelines that require the use of year-end prices for reserve estimation, due to low December 31,
2004, Canadian bitumen values, we removed all of the crude oil reserves for the Surmont project
from the proved category at year-end 2004. Despite this revision, the Surmont project remains an
economically viable and important component of our E&P project portfolio.

The Surmont project uses an enhanced thermal oil recovery method called steam assisted gravity
drainage. This process involves heating the oil by the injection of steam deep into the oil sands
through a horizontal well bore, effectively lowering the viscosity and enhancing the flow of the
oil, which is then recovered via gravity drainage into a lower horizontal well bore and pumped to
the surface. Over the life of this 30+ year project, we anticipate that approximately 500
production and steam-injection well pairs will be drilled. Construction of the facilities and
development drilling began in 2004. Commercial production is expected to begin in late 2006, with
peak production expected in 2012. We anticipate using our share of the heavy oil produced as a
feedstock in our U.S. refineries.

Transportation

We are working with three other energy companies, as members of the Mackenzie Delta Producers’
Group, on the development of the Mackenzie Valley pipeline, which is proposed to transport onshore
gas production from the Mackenzie Delta in northern Canada to established markets in North America.
Initial design capacity for the Mackenzie Valley pipeline is proposed to be 1.2 billion cubic feet
per day, but capacity would be expandable with additional compression. We would hold a 16 percent
interest in the pipeline and a 75 percent interest in the development of the Parsons Lake gas
field. The Parsons Lake gas field would be one of the primary fields in the Mackenzie Delta that
would anchor the pipeline development. Regulatory applications for the project were submitted in
2004, and first gas production is currently targeted for the 2009 timeframe.

Exploration

We hold exploration acreage in three areas of Canada: offshore eastern Canada, the foothills of
western Alberta, and the Mackenzie Delta/Beaufort Sea. In eastern Canada, we hold a 20 percent
interest in deepwater Nova Scotia, EL 2359. As part of our evaluation, we are waiting on the
results from drilling on adjacent blocks. In deepwater Newfoundland, we converted our large
Laurentian permit into specific exploration licenses. Exploration of these licenses began in 2004
with a 2D seismic survey, and a larger



3D seismic program is planned for 2005. In the foothills, we drilled four wildcat exploratory
wells in 2004. One was successful, and the other three are being tested. In the Mackenzie
Delta/Beaufort Sea, we participated in the Umiak well. This well will be tested during the first
quarter of 2005 and an appraisal well is also planned.

Other Canadian Operations

Syncrude Canada Ltd.

We own a 9.03 percent interest in Syncrude Canada Ltd., a joint venture created by a number of
energy companies for the purpose of mining shallow deposits of oil sands, extracting the bitumen,
and upgrading it into a light sweet crude oil called Syncrude. The primary plant and facilities
are located at Mildred Lake, about 25 miles north of Fort McMurray, Alberta, together with an
auxiliary mining and extraction facility approximately 20 miles from the Mildred Lake plant.
Syncrude Canada Ltd. holds eight oil sands leases and the associated surface rights, of which our
share is approximately 23,000 net acres. Our net share of production averaged 21,000 barrels per
day in 2004, compared with 19,000 barrels per day in 2003.

The development of the Stage III expansion-mining project continued in 2004, which is expected to
increase our Syncrude production. The new mine was completed and started up in the fourth quarter
of 2003. The upgrader expansion project is expected to be fully operational by mid-2006.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s regulations define this project as mining-related and
not part of conventional oil and gas operations. As such, Syncrude operations are not included in
our proved oil and gas reserves or production as reported in our supplemental oil and gas
information.

E&P—SOUTH AMERICA

In 2004, E&P operations in South America were comprised of interests in Venezuela and Brazil.
South American operations contributed 9 percent of E&P’s worldwide liquids production in 2004,
compared with 8 percent in 2003.

Venezuela

Petrozuata and Hamaca

Petrozuata is a Venezuelan Corporation formed under an Association Agreement between a wholly owned
subsidiary of ConocoPhillips that has a 50.1 percent non-controlling equity interest and a
subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), the national oil company of Venezuela. The
Association Agreement has a term of 35 years, that began in 2001.

The project is an integrated operation that produces heavy crude oil from reserves in the Zuata
region of the Orinoco Oil Belt, transports it to the Jose industrial complex on the north coast of
Venezuela, and upgrades it into heavy, processed crude oil and light, processed crude oil.
Associated products produced are liquefied petroleum gas, sulfur, petroleum coke and heavy gas oil.
The processed crude oil produced by Petrozuata is used as a feedstock for our Lake Charles,
Louisiana, refinery, as well as the Cardon refinery in Venezuela operated by PDVSA. Our net
production was 59,600 barrels of heavy crude oil per day in 2004, compared with 51,600 barrels per
day in 2003, and is included in equity affiliate production.

In 1997, we entered into an agreement to purchase up to 104,000 barrels per day of the
Petrozuata-upgraded crude oil for a market-based formula price over the term of the joint venture
in the event that Petrozuata is unable to sell the production for higher prices. All upgraded
crude oil sales are denominated in U.S. dollars.



The Hamaca project also involves the development of heavy-oil reserves from the Orinoco Oil Belt.
We own a 40 percent interest in the Hamaca project, which has a 35-year term, beginning in 2004,
and is operated by Petrolera Ameriven on behalf of the owners. The other participants in Hamaca
are PDVSA and ChevronTexaco Corporation. Our interest is held through a joint limited liability
company, Hamaca Holding LLC, for which we use the equity method of accounting. Net production
averaged 32,600 barrels per day of heavy crude oil in 2004, compared with 22,100 barrels per day in
2003, and is included in equity affiliate production.

Construction of the heavy-oil upgrader, pipelines and associated production facilities for the
Hamaca project at the Jose industrial complex began in 2000. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we
began producing on-specification medium-grade crude oil for export at the planned ramp-up capacity
of the plant. Our net oil production from the Hamaca field is expected to be approximately 56,100
barrels per day in 2005.

In October 2004, the President of Venezuela made a public statement that the reduction in the
royalty rate to 1 percent from 16.67 percent for a period of nine years, or until revenues exceed
three times the initial investment, would no longer apply to extra-heavy crude oil producing and
processing projects. This statement was later confirmed in writing by the Ministry of Energy and
Mines (MEM) to the Petrozuata and Hamaca project representatives. Consequently, Petrozuata and
Hamaca began paying royalties at the higher rate effective October 2004. As a result, 2005
production estimates were reduced by approximately 20,000 net barrels per day and our proved
reserves at year-end 2004 were reduced 46 million barrels.

Gulf of Paria

In 2003, the Venezuelan authorities approved the original development plan for Phase I of the
Corocoro field. Venezuelan authorities did not approve a development plan addendum submitted in
2004. However, in early 2005 verbal agreement of requirements to progress the project was
achieved. We will be working with the Venezuelan government and co-venturers to finalize the terms
agreed and move the project forward to development. We operate the field with a 32.2 percent
interest.

Plataforma Deltana Block 2

We acquired a 40 percent interest in Plataforma Deltana Block 2 in 2003. The block is co-venturer
operated and holds a gas discovery made by PDVSA in 1983. Two appraisal wells were completed in
2004, and a third was completed in January 2005. All appraisal wells indicated that the target
zones were natural gas bearing. In addition, a new natural gas/condensate discovery was made in a
deeper zone. Development of the field may include a well platform, a 170-mile pipeline to shore,
and an LNG plant. The LNG would be shipped to the U.S. market.

Exploration

Wildcat exploratory activity in both the Gulf of Paria East and West Blocks was commercially
unsuccessful in 2004, which resulted in a full impairment of our leasehold investment in these
blocks. However, we are still pursuing evaluation plans to assess future potential.

Brazil

Exploration

We had concession agreements on two deepwater exploration blocks (BM-ES-11 and BM-PAMA-3) offshore
Brazil. During 2003 and 2004, further evaluation led to the write-off of our leasehold investments
in both blocks. By the end of 2004, we had ceased all operations in Brazil and exited the country.



E&P—ASIA PACIFIC

In 2004, E&P operations in the Asia Pacific area contributed 10 percent of E&P’s worldwide liquids
production, compared with 6 percent in 2003. Asia Pacific operations contributed 9 percent of
natural gas production in both years.

Indonesia

We operate nine Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) in Indonesia and have a non-operator interest
in four others. Our assets are concentrated in two core areas: the West Natuna Sea and onshore
South Sumatra. A potentially emerging area is offshore East Java. We are a party to five
long-term, U.S.-dollar-denominated natural gas contracts that are based on oil price benchmarks.
In addition, in 2004 we began supplying natural gas to markets on the Indonesian island of Batam
and new contracts were signed to supply natural gas to domestic markets in West Java and East Java.
These are U.S.-dollar-denominated, fixed-price contracts. Production from Indonesia in 2004 averaged a net 250 million cubic feet per day of natural gas and
15,400 barrels per day of oil, compared with 255 million cubic feet per day of natural gas and
16,000 barrels per day of oil in 2003.

Offshore Assets

We operate three offshore PSCs: South Natuna Sea Block B, Nila, and Ketapang. We also hold a
non-operator interest in the Pangkah PSC offshore East Java.

The South Natuna Sea Block B PSC, in which we have a 40 percent interest, has two currently
producing oil fields and 16 gas fields in various stages of development (seven of which have
recoverable oil or condensate volumes). In late 2004, oil production began from the Belanak oil
and gas field through a new floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel and related
facilities. Also in Block B, we began development of the Kerisi and Hiu fields, with construction
contract awards under way, and we began the preliminary engineering phase of the North Belut field
development.

In the Pangkah PSC, in which we have a 22 percent interest, the development of the Ujung Pangkah
field was approved by the Indonesian government in late 2004 following the signing of contracts for
the supply of natural gas to markets in East Java.

Onshore Assets

We operate six onshore PSCs. Four are in South Sumatra: Corridor PSC, Corridor TAC, South Jambi
‘B’, and Sakakemang JOB. We also operate Block A PSC in Aceh, and Warim in Papua. We hold
non-operator interests in the Banyumas PSC in Java and the Bentu and Korinci-Baru PSCs in Sumatra.

The Corridor PSC is located onshore South Sumatra and we have a 54 percent interest. We operate
six oil fields and six natural gas fields, and supply natural gas from the Grissik and Suban gas
processing plants to the Duri steamflood in central Sumatra operated by Caltex and to markets in
Singapore and Batam.

In August 2004, we announced the signing of a gas sales agreement with PT Perusahaan Gas Negara
(Persero) Tbk. (PGN), the Indonesian state-owned gas transportation company, to supply natural gas
for delivery to the industrial markets in West Java and Jakarta. The agreement calls for us to
supply approximately 850 billion net cubic feet of gas over a 17-year period commencing in the
first quarter of 2007. At the contracted rates, initial gas deliveries are about 65 million net
cubic feet per day, ramping up to approximately 140 million net cubic feet per day in 2012, and
continuing at that level until the contract terminates in 2023.

Following the execution of the West Java gas sales agreement with PGN in August, we began the
development of the Suban Phase II project, which is an expansion of the existing Suban gas plant in
the Corridor PSC.



The South Jambi ‘B’ PSC is also located in South Sumatra, and we have a 45 percent interest. In
2004, we completed the construction of the South Jambi shallow gas project for supply of natural
gas to Singapore from the South Jambi B Block, with first production occurring in June 2004.

Transportation

We are a 35 percent owner of TransAsia Pipeline Company Pvt. Ltd., a consortium company, which has
a 40 percent ownership in PT Transportasi Gas Indonesia, an Indonesian limited liability company,
which owns and operates the Grissik to Duri, and Grissik to Singapore, natural gas pipelines.

Exploration

In Indonesia, a total of 11 exploration and appraisal wells were drilled during 2004, of which five
were successful. In the Pangkah PSC, two appraisal wells confirmed a western extension of the
Ujung Pangkah field. In the Ketapang PSC, an appraisal well of the Bukit Tua field provided data
for progressing a development plan in 2005. In Sumatra, two appraisal wells were successful in
finding additional gas volumes in both the Korinci-Baru and the Bentu PSCs.

China

Our combined net production of crude oil from the Xijiang facilities averaged 10,400 barrels per
day in 2004, compared with 10,900 barrels per day in 2003. The Xijiang development consists of
three fields located approximately 80 miles from Hong Kong in the South China Sea. The facilities
include two manned platforms and a FPSO facility.

Production from Phase I development of the Peng Lai 19-3 field in Bohai Bay Block 11-05 began in
late 2002. In 2004, the field produced 15,000 net barrels of oil per day, compared with 14,800
barrels per day in 2003. We have a 49 percent interest, with the remainder held by the China
National Offshore Oil Corporation. The Phase I development utilizes one wellhead platform and a
FPSO facility.

In December 2004, our Board of Directors approved the second phase of development of the Peng Lai
19-3 field, as well as concurrent development through the same facilities of the nearby Peng Lai
25-6 field. The “Overall Development Program” for both fields was submitted to the Chinese
government in November 2004, and was approved in January 2005. Construction activities have since
begun. The second phase will include multiple wellhead platforms and a larger FPSO facility.

Vietnam

We have a 23.25 percent interest in Block 15-1 in the Cuu Long Basin in the South China Sea. First
production from Block 15-1 began in the fourth quarter of 2003 with the startup of the Su Tu Den
development. Net production in 2004 was 20,800 barrels of oil per day. The oil is being processed
through a 1 million barrel FPSO vessel.

We have a 36 percent interest in the Rang Dong field in Block 15-2 in the Cuu Long Basin. All
wellhead platforms produce into a FPSO vessel. Net production in 2004 was 11,800 barrels of
liquids per day and 16 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. Development of the central part
of the field is under way, with two additional platforms and additional production and injection
wells expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2005.

Transportation

We own a 16.33 percent interest in the Nam Con Son gas pipeline. This 242-mile transportation
system links gas supplies from the Nam Con Son Basin to gas markets in southern Vietnam.



Exploration

An oil discovery was made on the Su Tu Vang prospect in Block 15-1 in the third quarter of 2001,
with successful appraisal drilling conducted in 2004. Development scenarios are currently under
evaluation, with preliminary engineering commencing in early 2005. The commerciality of the
northeast portion of Su Tu Den is also being evaluated, with additional appraisal drilling planned
for 2005. In addition to these areas, a successful exploration well was drilled in the Su Tu Trang
southeast area of the block in the fourth quarter of 2003. A 3D seismic study was conducted on
this area in 2004 and is currently under interpretation. Additional appraisal drilling is
scheduled for 2005 to further define this gas condensate discovery. We also own interests in
offshore Blocks 5-3, 133 and 134. Our interest in Block 16-2 was relinquished in April 2004 after
unsuccessful exploratory activity.

Timor Sea and Australia

Bayu-Undan

We are the operator and hold a 56.7 percent interest in the unitized Bayu-Undan field, located in
the Timor Sea, which is being developed in two phases. Phase I is a gas-recycle project, where
condensate and natural gas liquids are separated and removed and the dry gas reinjected back into
the reservoir. This phase began production in February 2004, and averaged a net rate of 28,100
barrels of liquids per day in 2004.

Phase II involves the installation of a natural gas pipeline from the field to Darwin, and
construction of an LNG facility located at Wickham Point, Darwin, to meet gross contracted sales of
up to 3 million tons of LNG per year for a period of 17 years to customers in Japan. During 2004,
construction of the LNG facility proceeded, as did the laying of the pipeline. The first LNG cargo
is scheduled for delivery in early 2006. We have a 56.7 percent controlling interest in the
pipeline and LNG facility. Our net share of natural gas production from the Bayu-Undan field is
expected to be approximately 100 million cubic feet per day initially, then ramping up to
approximately 260 net million cubic feet per day by 2009.

Greater Sunrise

We and our co-venturers evaluated commercial development options and LNG markets in the Asia
Pacific region and the North American West Coast during 2004. The focus in 2004 was on an onshore
LNG facility located at Darwin, although other alternatives, such as a floating LNG facility and an
onshore plant in Timor-Leste, were also considered. Further progress on the project will require
resolution of the maritime border dispute between Australia and Timor-Leste and ratification of the
International Unitization Agreement by Timor-Leste. We have a 30 percent, non-operator interest in
Greater Sunrise.

Athena/Perseus

A cooperative field development agreement for the Athena/Perseus (WA-17-L) gas field, located
offshore western Australia, was executed in early 2001. In 2004, our net share of production was
35 million cubic feet of natural gas per day.

Malaysia

Exploration

In 2000, we acquired interests in deepwater Blocks G and J located off the east Malaysian state of
Sabah. We participated in four exploration wells in the blocks. The Gumusut 1 well, in which we
have a 40 percent interest, was drilled in Block J in 2003 and resulted in an oil discovery.
Further exploratory drilling is planned. In September 2004, we successfully completed the drilling
of the Malikai discovery, in which we have a 35 percent interest, in Block G. Appraisal of the
Malikai discovery is anticipated in 2005. In addition, we plan to acquire a 40 percent interest in
the Kebabangan discovery in early 2005. Appraisal work is planned for 2005.



E&P—AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST

Nigeria

At year-end 2004, we were producing from four onshore Oil Mining Leases (OMLs), in which we have a
20 percent non-operator interest. Our interest in a shallow-water offshore OML was sold in the
second quarter of 2004. Together, in 2004 these leases produced a net 30,100 barrels of oil per
day and 71 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, compared with 36,900 barrels per day and 63
million cubic feet per day in 2003. In 2004, we continued development of projects in the onshore
OMLs to supply feedstock natural gas under a gas sales contract with Nigeria LNG Limited, which
owns an LNG facility on Bonny Island.

We have a 20 percent interest in a 480-megawatt gas-fired power plant being constructed in Kwale,
Nigeria, to supply electricity to Nigeria’s national electricity supplier under a 20-year
agreement. When operational, the plant is expected to consume 68 million gross cubic feet per day
of natural gas, sourced from proved natural gas reserves in the OMLs. The plant is targeted to
become fully operational in 2005.

In October 2003, ConocoPhillips, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Eni and
ChevronTexaco signed a Heads of Agreement to conduct front-end engineering and design work for a
new LNG facility that would be constructed in Nigeria’s central Niger Delta. The co-venturers
agreed to form an incorporated joint venture, Brass LNG Limited, to undertake the project. These
front-end studies are expected to be completed in 2006, and the LNG facility is targeted to become
operational in 2010.

Exploration

We also have production sharing contracts on deepwater Nigeria Oil Prospecting Licenses (OPLs),
including OPL 318 with a 50 percent interest, OPL 248 with a 28.8 percent interest, OPL 220 with a
47.5 percent interest, OPL 214 with a 20 percent interest, and OPL 250 with a 6.375 percent
interest. We drilled the first exploration wells on both OPL 248 and OPL 250 in 2004. Neither of
these wells encountered significant hydrocarbons and were classified as dry holes. The first
exploration wells on both OPL 214 and OPL 318 are planned for 2005.

Cameroon

Exploration

In December 2002, we announced a successful test of an exploratory well offshore Cameroon. The
Coco Marine No. 1 well was located in exploration permit PH 77, offshore in the Douala Basin.
Contractor interests in the permit are held 50 percent by ConocoPhillips and 50 percent by a
subsidiary of Petronas Carigali. We serve as the operator of the consortium. Seismic data was
analyzed during 2004, and we plan an appraisal well and further exploratory drilling in 2005.

Libya

We are participating in discussions with our co-venturers and Libyan authorities regarding terms in
connection with our anticipated re-entry into the country.

Qatar

In July 2003, we signed a Heads of Agreement with Qatar Petroleum for the development of Qatargas
3, a large-scale LNG project located in Qatar and servicing the U.S. natural gas markets. The
agreement provided the framework for the necessary project agreements and the completion of
feasibility studies, both of which were advanced in 2004. Qatargas 3 is planned as an integrated
project, jointly owned by ConocoPhillips (30 percent) and Qatar Petroleum. It would consist of the
facilities to produce gas from Qatar’s offshore North field, yielding approximately 7.8 million
gross tons per year of LNG from a new facility located in Ras Laffan Industrial City. The LNG
would be shipped from Qatar to the United States



in a fleet of new LNG carriers. We would purchase the LNG and be responsible for regasification
and marketing within the United States. The project could result in sales of natural gas of up to
1 billion cubic feet per day. Startup of the Qatargas 3 project is estimated to be in the 2009
timeframe.

In December 2003, we signed a Statement of Intent with Qatar Petroleum regarding the construction
of a gas-to-liquids (GTL) plant in Ras Laffan, Qatar. The agreement initiates the detailed
technical and commercial pre-front-end engineering and design studies and established principles
for negotiating a Heads of Agreement for an integrated reservoir-to-market GTL project.
Negotiations on more definitive agreements and progress on the studies continued in 2004.

Dubai

In Dubai, United Arab Emirates, we operate Dubai’s four large, offshore oil fields. We are using
advanced horizontal drilling techniques and advanced reservoir drainage technology to enhance the
recovery rates and efficiencies in these late-life fields.

Iraq

We, along with LUKOIL, will cooperate with the Iraqi government to confirm LUKOIL’s rights under
its production sharing agreement (PSA) relating to the West Qurna field in Iraq. Subject to
confirmation and the consents of governmental authorities and the parties to the contract, we
expect to enter into further agreements regarding the assignment of a 17.5 percent interest in the
PSA to us by LUKOIL.

E&P—RUSSIA AND CASPIAN SEA REGION

Russia

Polar Lights

We have a 50 percent ownership interest in Polar Lights Company, a Russian limited liability
company established in January 1992 to develop fields in the Timan-Pechora basin in Northern
Russia. Our net production from Polar Lights averaged 13,300 barrels of oil per day in 2004,
compared with 13,600 barrels per day in 2003, and is included in equity affiliate production.

LUKOIL Joint Venture

We have entered into an arrangement with LUKOIL under which it is anticipated that we will acquire
a 30 percent economic interest and a 50 percent voting interest in a joint venture to develop oil
and gas resources in the northern part of Russia’s Timan-Pechora province. We anticipate that our
acquisition of a 30 percent interest will be completed in the first half of 2005. While this joint venture
will be included in our E&P segment, our equity investment in LUKOIL is reflected in the LUKOIL Investment segment.

Other

In late 2004 we signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Gazprom to undertake a joint study on the
development of the Shtokman gas field in the Barents Sea. The cooperative study will include the
evaluation of LNG feasibility and transportation to the United States and European markets.

Caspian Sea

In the North Caspian Sea, we have an 8.33 percent interest in the Republic of Kazakhstan’s North
Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement (NCPSA), which includes the Kashagan field. During 2003,
we exercised our pre-emptive rights to acquire a proportionate share of BG International’s 16.67
percent interest in the project. Discussions continue with the Republic of Kazakhstan government
to conclude the sale.



Detailed design, procurement and construction activities continued on the Kashagan oil field
development following approval by the Republic of Kazakhstan for the development plan and budget in
February 2004. First commercial production is targeted for 2008. The initial production phase of
the contract is for 20 years, with options to extend the agreement an additional 20 years.

Exploration

The contracting companies plan to continue to explore other structures within the North Caspian Sea
license. The exploration area consists of 10.5 blocks, totaling nearly 2,000 square miles. In
2002, we and our co-venturers announced a new hydrocarbon discovery on the Kalamkas More prospect
located approximately 40 miles southwest of the Kashagan field. Exploratory drilling continued in
2003 with three additional wells drilled. The Aktote #1 and the Kashagan Southwest #1 were
announced as discoveries in November 2003.

During 2004, the successful completion of the first offshore exploration well on the Kairan
prospect was announced. Data analysis and additional studies are being conducted to evaluate the
discovery. The testing of the Kairan-1 exploration well brings the Exploration Period under the
NCPSA to a close. During 2004, appraisal of the Aktote discovery began with the successful
drilling of the Aktote-2 appraisal well.

In the South Caspian Sea offshore Azerbaijan, we have a 20 percent interest in the Zafar Mashal
prospect. The first exploratory well was completed in the third quarter of 2004 and the prospect
declared non-commercial.

E&P—OTHER

In late 2003, we signed an agreement with Freeport LNG Development, L.P. (Freeport LNG) to
participate in its proposed LNG receiving terminal in Quintana, Texas. This agreement gives us 1
billion cubic feet per day of regasification capacity in the terminal and a 50 percent interest in
the general partnership managing the venture. The terminal will be designed with a storage
capacity of 6.9 billion cubic feet and a send-out capacity of 1.5 billion cubic feet per day.
Freeport LNG received conditional approval in June 2004 from the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) to construct and operate the facility. Final approval from FERC was received in
January 2005. Construction began in early 2005, and commercial startup is expected in 2008.

We are pursuing three other proposed LNG regasification terminals. The Beacon Port Terminal would be
located in federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico, 56 miles south of the Louisiana mainland. Also in
the Gulf of Mexico is the proposed Compass Port Terminal, to be located approximately 11 miles
offshore Alabama. The third proposed facility would be a joint venture located in
the Port of Long Beach, California. Each of these projects are in the initial regulatory
permitting process.

The Commercial organization optimizes the commodity flows of our E&P segment. This group markets
our crude oil and natural gas production, with commodity buyers, traders and marketers in offices
in Houston, London, Singapore and Calgary.

Natural Gas Pricing

Compared with the more global nature of crude oil commodity pricing, natural gas prices have
historically varied more in different regions of the world. We produce natural gas from regions
around the world that have significantly different supply, demand and regulatory circumstances,
typically resulting in significantly lower average sales prices than in the Lower 48 region of the
United States. Moreover,



excess supply conditions that exist in certain parts of the world cannot easily serve to mitigate
the relatively high-price conditions in the U.S. Lower 48 states and other markets because of a
lack of infrastructure and because of the difficulties in transporting the natural gas. We, along
with other companies in the oil and gas industry, are planning long-term projects in regions of
excess supply to install the infrastructure required to produce and liquefy natural gas for
transportation by tanker and subsequent regasification in regions where market demand is strong,
such as to the U.S. Lower 48 states or certain parts of Asia, but where supplies are not as
plentiful. Due to the significance of the overall investment in these long-term projects, the
natural gas sales prices (to a third-party LNG facility) or transfer prices (to a company-owned LNG
facility) in the areas of excess supply are expected to remain well below sales prices for natural
gas that is produced closer to areas of high demand and which can be transferred to existing
natural gas pipeline networks, such as in the U.S. Lower 48.

E&P—RESERVES

We have not filed any information with any other federal authority or agency with respect to our
estimated total proved reserves at December 31, 2004. No difference exists between our estimated
total proved reserves for year-end 2003 and year-end 2002, which are shown in this filing, and
estimates of these reserves shown in a filing with another federal agency in 2004.

DELIVERY COMMITMENTS

We sell crude oil and natural gas from our E&P producing operations under a variety of contractual
arrangements, some of which specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity. Our
Commercial organization also enters into natural gas sales contracts where the source of the
natural gas used to fulfill the contract can be the spot market, or a combination of our reserves
and the spot market. Worldwide, we are contractually committed to deliver approximately 5.4
trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 167 million barrels of crude oil in the future, including
1.0 trillion cubic feet related to the minority interests of consolidated subsidiaries. These
contracts have various expiration dates through the year 2025. Although these delivery commitments
could be fulfilled utilizing proved reserves in the United States, the Timor Sea, Nigeria,
Indonesia, and the United Kingdom, we anticipate that some of them will be fulfilled with purchases
in the spot market. A portion of the natural gas delivery commitment relates to proved undeveloped
reserves in the Timor Sea and Indonesia. The Timor Sea reserves are expected to convert from
proved undeveloped to proved developed in 2006 upon completion of the liquefied natural gas
infrastructure in the region. A portion of the Indonesian reserves are expected to convert to
proved developed in 2007, when additional wells are drilled and the expansion of the Suban gas
plant is completed.

MIDSTREAM

Our Midstream business is conducted through owned and operated assets as well as through our 30.3
percent equity investment in Duke Energy Field Services, LLC (DEFS). The Midstream businesses
purchase raw natural gas from producers and gather natural gas through extensive pipeline gathering
systems. The gathered natural gas is then processed to extract natural gas liquids. The remaining
“residue” gas is marketed to electrical utilities, industrial users, and gas marketing companies.
Most of the natural gas liquids are fractionated—separated into individual components like ethane,
butane and propane—and marketed as chemical feedstock, fuel, or blendstock. Total natural gas
liquids extracted in 2004, including our share of DEFS’, was 194,000 barrels per day, compared with
215,000 barrels per day in 2003.



DEFS markets a substantial portion of its natural gas liquids to ConocoPhillips and Chevron
Phillips Chemical Company LLC (a joint venture between ConocoPhillips and ChevronTexaco) under a
supply agreement that continues until December 31, 2014. This purchase commitment is on an
“if-produced, will-purchase” basis and so it has no fixed production schedule, but has had, and is
expected over the remaining term of the contract to have, a relatively stable purchase pattern.
Under this agreement, natural gas liquids are purchased at various published market index prices,
less transportation and fractionation fees.

DEFS is headquartered in Denver, Colorado. At December 31, 2004, DEFS owned and operated 55
natural gas liquids extraction plants, owned an equity interest in another nine, and had two
classified in discontinued operations. Also at year end, DEFS’ gathering and transmission systems
included approximately 59,000 miles of pipeline. In 2004, DEFS’ raw natural gas throughput
averaged 6.4 billion cubic feet per day, and natural gas liquids extraction averaged 363,000
barrels per day, compared with 6.6 billion cubic feet per day and 353,000 barrels per day,
respectively, in 2003. DEFS’ assets are primarily located in the Gulf Coast area, West Texas,
Oklahoma, the Texas Panhandle, the Rocky Mountain area, and western Canada.

Outside of DEFS, our U.S. natural gas liquids business included the following assets as of December
31, 2004:

•

A 50 percent interest in a natural gas liquids extraction plant in San Juan County, New
Mexico, with a gross plant inlet capacity of 500 million cubic feet per day. We also have
minor interests in two other natural gas liquids extraction plants.

•

A 25,000-barrel-per-day capacity natural gas liquids fractionation plant in Gallup, New
Mexico.

•

A 22.5 percent equity interest in Gulf Coast Fractionators, which owns a natural gas
liquids fractionation plant in Mont Belvieu, Texas (with our net share of capacity at
25,000 barrels per day).

•

A 40 percent interest in a fractionation plant in Conway, Kansas (with our net share of
capacity at 42,000 barrels per day).

During 2004, we sold certain Midstream assets located primarily in Texas, Louisiana and New Mexico.
This reflected our strategy to divest properties that did not support our natural gas production,
while focusing on DEFS as the most effective vehicle for generating income from the processing of
third-party natural gas. Included in the dispositions was a 700-mile intrastate natural gas and
liquids pipeline system in Louisiana.

Our Canadian natural gas liquids business includes the following assets:

•

A 92 percent operating interest in the 2.4-billion-cubic-feet-per-day Empress natural
gas processing and fractionation facilities near Medicine Hat, Alberta, with natural gas
liquids production capacity of 50,000 barrels per day.

•

A 100 percent interest in a 580-mile Petroleum Transmission Company pipeline from
Empress to Winnipeg and five related pipeline terminals.

•

Two underground natural gas liquids storage facilities, comprised of the Richardson
caverns with an approximate one-million-barrel capacity and the Dewdney caverns with an
approximate three-million-barrel capacity, along with 800 million cubic feet of natural gas
storage capacity.

A 10 percent interest in the 1,902-mile Cochin liquefied petroleum gas pipeline, originating in
Edmonton, Alberta, and ending in Sarnia, Ontario, and a terminal storage system that transports
propane, ethane and ethylene was sold in the fourth quarter of 2004.



Canadian natural gas liquids extracted averaged 45,000 barrels per day in 2004, the same as 2003.

We also own a 39 percent equity interest in Phoenix Park Gas Processors Limited, a joint venture
primarily with the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited, which processes gas in
Trinidad and markets natural gas liquids throughout the Caribbean and into the U.S. Gulf Coast.
Phoenix Park’s facilities include a 1.35-billion-cubic-feet-per-day gas processing plant and a
46,000-barrel-per-day natural gas liquids fractionator. Our share of natural gas liquids extracted
averaged 6,000 barrels per day in 2004.

In Syria, we have a service contract with the Syrian Petroleum Company that expires on December 31,
2005. Our current plan is to honor that contract to its termination date. We expect our presence
in Syria to end in 2006, once the formalities of closing out the service contract are accomplished.
We have no plans to seek additional business in Syria.

REFINING AND MARKETING (R&M)

R&M operations encompass refining crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products (such as
gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels), buying, selling and transporting crude oil, and buying,
transporting, distributing and marketing petroleum products. R&M has operations in the United
States, Europe and Asia Pacific.

The R&M segment does not include the results or statistics from our equity investment in LUKOIL,
which are reported in a separate segment (LUKOIL Investment). As a result, references to results,
refinery crude oil throughput capacities and other statistics throughout the R&M segment exclude
those related to our equity investment in LUKOIL.

The Commercial organization optimizes the commodity flows of our R&M segment. This organization
selects and procures feedstocks for R&M’s refineries. Commercial also facilitates supplying a
portion of the gas and power needs of the R&M facilities. Commercial has buyers, traders and
marketers in offices in Houston, London, Singapore and Calgary.

In December 2002, we committed to and initiated a plan to sell approximately 3,200 marketing sites
that did not fit into our long-range plans. In the third quarter of 2003, we concluded the sale of
all of the Exxon-branded marketing assets in New York and New England, including contracts with
independent dealers and marketers. Approximately 230 of the 3,200 sites were included in this
package. In the fourth quarter of 2003, we concluded the sale of our Circle K subsidiary,
representing approximately 1,660 sites, as well as the assignment of the franchise relationship
with more than 350 franchised and licensed stores. Other, smaller dispositions also occurred
during 2003. During the second quarter of 2004, we sold our Mobil-branded marketing assets on the
East Coast in two separate transactions. Assets in the packages included approximately 100
company-owned-and-operated sites, and 350 dealer sites. The majority of the remaining sites are
under contracts expected to close in 2005.

During the second quarter of 2004, we performed a review of the crude oil refining capacities for
our worldwide refining operations. We utilize a “barrels-per-calendar-day” methodology, which
includes allowances for maintenance turnarounds, regulatory constraints, crude oil quality and
reliability. As a result of this review, effective July 1, 2004, R&M’s total U.S. crude oil
capacity was revised downward slightly, from 2,168,000 barrels per day to 2,160,000 barrels per
day, while R&M’s international refining capacity decreased from 447,000 barrels per day to 428,000
barrels per day.

northwest United States.

Marketing

In the United States, R&M markets gasoline, diesel fuel, and aviation fuel through approximately
13,300 outlets in 46 states. The majority of these sites utilize the Conoco, Phillips 66 or 76
brands.

Wholesale

In our wholesale operations, we utilize a network of marketers and dealers operating approximately
12,300 outlets. We place a strong emphasis on the wholesale channel of trade because of its lower
capital requirements and higher return on capital. Our refineries and transportation systems
provide strategic support to these operations. We also buy and sell petroleum products in the spot
market. Our refined products are marketed on both a branded and unbranded basis.



In addition to automotive gasoline and diesel fuel, we produce and market aviation gasoline, which
is used by smaller, piston-engine aircraft. Aviation gasoline and jet fuel are sold through
independent marketers at approximately 570 Phillips 66 branded locations in the United States.

Retail

In our retail operations, we own and operate approximately 330 sites under the Phillips 66, Conoco
and 76 brands. Company-operated retail operations are focused in 10 states, mainly in the
Midcontinent, Rocky Mountain, and West Coast regions. Most of these outlets market merchandise
through the Kicks 66, Breakplace, or Circle K brand convenience stores.

At December 31, 2004, CFJ Properties, our 50/50 joint venture with Flying J, owned and operated 98
truck travel plazas that carry the Conoco and/or Flying J brands. The merger of Conoco and
Phillips triggered change of control provisions in the joint venture agreement, giving Flying J the
option to purchase our interest in CFJ Properties at fair value. Flying J elected not to exercise
their purchase option. As a result, we plan to continue as a co-venturer in CFJ Properties.

Transportation

Pipelines and Terminals

At December 31, 2004, we had approximately 32,500 miles of common-carrier crude oil, raw natural
gas liquids and products pipeline systems in the United States, including those partially owned
and/or operated by affiliates. We also owned and/or operated 66 finished product terminals, 10
liquefied petroleum gas terminals, seven crude oil terminals and one coke exporting facility.

Tankers

At December 31, 2004, we had under charter 16 double-hulled crude oil tankers, with capacities
ranging in size from 650,000 to 1,100,000 barrels. These tankers are utilized to transport
feedstocks to certain of our U.S. refineries. We also have a domestic fleet of both owned and
chartered boats and barges providing inland and ocean-going waterway transportation. The
information above excludes the operations of the company’s subsidiary, Polar Tankers Inc., which is
discussed in the E&P section, as well as an owned tanker on lease to a third party for use in the
North Sea.

Specialty Businesses

We manufacture and sell a variety of specialty products including petroleum cokes, lubes (such as
automotive and industrial lubricants), solvents, and pipeline flow improvers to commercial,
industrial and wholesale accounts worldwide.

Lubricants are marketed under the Conoco, Phillips 66, 76 Lubricants and Kendall Motor Oil brands.
The distribution network consists of over 5,000 outlets, including mass merchandise stores, fast

ConocoPhillips’ share at December 31, 2004.

Humber Refinery

Our wholly owned Humber refinery is located in North Lincolnshire, United Kingdom. The refinery’s
crude oil processing capacity is 221,000 barrels per day. Crude oil processed at the refinery is
supplied primarily from the North Sea and includes lower-cost, acidic crudes. The refinery also
processes other intermediate feedstocks, mostly vacuum gas oils and residual fuel oil. The
refinery’s location on the east coast of England provides for cost-effective North Sea crude
imports and product exports to European and world markets.

The Humber refinery is a fully integrated refinery that produces a full slate of light products and
fuel oil. The refinery also has two coking units with associated calcining plants, which upgrade
the heavy “bottoms” and imported feedstocks into light-oil products and high-value graphite and
anode petroleum cokes. Approximately 70 percent of the light oils produced in the refinery are
marketed in the United Kingdom, while the other products are exported to the rest of Europe and the
United States.

Whitegate Refinery

The Whitegate refinery is located in Cork, Ireland, and has a crude oil processing capacity of
71,000 barrels per day. Crude oil processed by the refinery is light sweet crude sourced mostly
from the North Sea. The refinery primarily produces transportation fuels and fuel oil, which are
distributed to the inland market via truck and sea, as well as being exported to the European
market. We also operate a deepwater crude oil and products storage complex with a
7.5-million-barrel capacity in Bantry Bay, Cork, Ireland.



MiRO Refinery

The Mineraloel Raffinerie Oberrhein GmbH (MiRO) refinery in Karlsruhe, Germany, is a joint-venture
refinery with a crude oil processing capacity of 283,000 barrels per day. We have an 18.75 percent
interest in MiRO, giving us a net capacity share of 53,000 barrels per day. Approximately 45
percent of the refinery’s crude oil feedstock is low-cost, high-sulfur crude. The MiRO complex is
a fully integrated refinery producing gasoline, middle distillates, and specialty products, along
with a small amount of residual fuel oil. The refinery has a high capacity to convert lower-cost
feedstocks into higher value products, primarily with a fluid catalytic cracker and a delayed
coker. The refinery produces both fuel grade and specialty calcined cokes. The refinery processes
crude and other feedstocks supplied by each of the partners in proportion to their respective
ownership interests.

Czech Republic Refineries

Through our participation in Èeská rafinérská, a.s. (CRC), we have a 16.33 percent ownership in two
refineries in the Czech Republic, giving us a net capacity share of 27,000 barrels per day. The
refinery at Litvinov has a crude oil processing capacity of 103,000 barrels per day and processes
Russian export blend crude oil delivered by pipeline. Litvinov includes both hydrocracking and
visbreaking, producing a high yield of transport fuels and petrochemical feedstocks and only a
small amount of fuel oil. The Kralupy refinery has a crude oil processing capacity of 63,000
barrels per day and processes low-sulfur crude, mostly from the Mediterranean. Kralupy has a new
fluidized catalytic cracking unit, which gives the refinery a high yield of transport fuels. The
two refineries complement each other and are run on an overall optimized basis, with certain
intermediate streams moving between the two plants. CRC processes crude and other feedstocks
supplied by ConocoPhillips and the other partners, with each partner receiving their proportionate
share of the resulting products. We market our share of these finished products in both the Czech
Republic and in neighboring markets.

Melaka Refinery

The refinery in Melaka, Malaysia, is a joint venture with Petronas, the Malaysian state oil
company. We own a 47 percent interest in the joint venture. The refinery has a rated crude oil
processing capacity of 119,000 barrels per day, of which our share is 56,000 barrels per day.
Crude oil processed by the refinery is sourced mostly from the Middle East. The refinery produces
a full range of refined petroleum products. The refinery capitalizes on our proprietary coking
technology to upgrade low-cost feedstocks to higher-margin products. Our share of refined products
is distributed by truck to the company’s “ProJET” retail sites in Malaysia, or transported by sea,
primarily to Asian markets.

Marketing

R&M has marketing operations in 15 European countries. R&M’s European marketing strategy is to
sell primarily through owned, leased or joint-venture retail sites using a low-cost, high-volume,
low-price strategy. We also market aviation fuels, liquid petroleum gases, heating oils,
transportation fuels and marine bunkers to commercial customers and into the bulk or spot market.

We use the “JET” brand name to market retail and wholesale products in our wholly owned operations
in Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, Norway,
Poland, Slovakia, Sweden and the United Kingdom. In addition, various joint ventures, in which we
have an equity interest, market products in Switzerland and Turkey under the “Coop” and “Tabas” or
“Turkpetrol” brand names, respectively.

As of December 31, 2004, R&M had approximately 2,100 marketing outlets in its European operations,
of which about 1,480 were company-owned, and 620 were dealer-owned. Through our joint venture
operations in Turkey and Switzerland, we also have interests in approximately 810 additional sites.



The company’s largest branded site networks are in Germany and the United Kingdom, which account
for approximately 63 percent of our total European branded units.

As of December 31, 2004, R&M had 143 marketing outlets in our wholly owned Thailand operations in
Asia. In addition, through a joint venture in Malaysia with Sime Darby Bhd., a company that has a
major presence in the Malaysian business sector, we also have an interest in another 43 retail
sites. In Thailand and Malaysia, retail products are marketed under the “JET” and “ProJET” brands,
respectively.

LUKOIL INVESTMENT

In September 2004, we made a joint announcement with LUKOIL, an international integrated oil and
gas company headquartered in Russia, of an agreement to form a broad-based strategic alliance,
whereby we would become a strategic equity investor in LUKOIL. Together, we also announced our
intention to form a joint venture between the two companies to develop resources in the northern
part of Russia’s Timan-Pechora oil and gas province and the intention of the two companies to
jointly seek the right to develop the West Qurna oil field in Iraq.

In the announcement, we disclosed that we were the successful bidder in an auction of 7.6 percent
of LUKOIL’s authorized and issued ordinary shares held by the Russian government. The transaction
closed on October 7, 2004. By year-end 2004, we had increased our ownership in LUKOIL to 10
percent. Under the Shareholder Agreement between the two companies, we had the right to nominate a
representative to the LUKOIL Board of Directors (Board). In January 2005, our nominee was elected
to the LUKOIL Board, and certain amendments to LUKOIL’s corporate charter that require unanimous
Board consent for certain key decisions were approved. In addition, the Shareholder Agreement
allows us to increase our ownership interest in LUKOIL to 20 percent and limits our ability to sell
our LUKOIL shares for a period of four years, except in certain circumstances. Once we reach 12.5
percent ownership, we have the right to nominate a second representative to the LUKOIL Board. We
use the equity method of accounting for our investment in LUKOIL. We estimate that our net share
of LUKOIL’s proved reserves at December 31, 2004, was 880 million barrels of oil equivalent.

As reported in LUKOIL’s 2003 annual report, the majority of its upstream production is sourced
within Russia, with 68 percent from the western Siberia region, 14 percent from the Timan-Pechora
region and 13 percent from the Urals region. Outside of Russia, LUKOIL has projects in Azerbaijan,
Kazakhstan, Egypt and Iraq. Downstream, LUKOIL has seven refineries with a net crude oil
throughput capacity of approximately 1.2 million barrels daily. In addition, LUKOIL has an
interest in approximately 4,600 retail sites in Russia and Europe, and another approximately 2,000
in the northeast United States.

CHEMICALS

Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem) is a 50/50 joint venture with ChevronTexaco
Corporation. We use the equity method of accounting for our investment in CPChem.

CPChem is headquartered in The Woodlands, Texas. CPChem uses natural gas liquids and other
feedstocks to produce petrochemicals such as ethylene, propylene, styrene, benzene and paraxylene.
These products are then marketed and sold, or used as feedstocks to produce plastics and commodity
chemicals, such as polyethylene, polystyrene, and cyclohexane.



CPChem’s domestic production facilities are located at Baytown, Borger, Conroe, La Porte, Orange,
Pasadena, Port Arthur and Old Ocean, Texas; St. James, Louisiana; Pascagoula, Mississippi;
Marietta, Ohio; and Guayama, Puerto Rico. CPChem also has one pipe fittings plant and nine plastic
pipe plants in eight states.

Major international production facilities, including CPChem’s joint-venture facilities, are located
in Belgium, China, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea and Qatar. In addition, there is one
plastic pipe plant in Mexico.

CPChem has research and technical facilities in Oklahoma, Ohio and Texas, as well as in Singapore
and Belgium.

Construction of a major olefins and polyolefins complex in Mesaieed, Qatar, called “Q-Chem I,” was
completed in 2003. The facility completed performance testing and became fully operational in
2004. It has an annual capacity of approximately 1.1 billion pounds of ethylene, 1 billion pounds
of polyethylene and 100 million pounds of 1-hexene. CPChem has a 49 percent interest, with a Qatar
state firm owning the remaining 51 percent interest.

CPChem has also signed an agreement for the development of a second complex to be built in
Mesaieed, Qatar, called “Q-Chem II.” The facility will be designed to produce polyethylene and
normal alpha olefins, on a site adjacent to the newly constructed Q-Chem I complex. CPChem and
Qatar Petroleum entered into a separate agreement with Atofina (now Total Petrochemical) and Qatar
Petrochemical Company to jointly develop an ethane cracker in northern Qatar at Ras Laffan
Industrial City. Request for final approval of the Q-Chem II projects by CPChem’s Board of
Directors is expected in 2005, with startup anticipated in 2008.

In 2003, CPChem formed a 50 percent-owned joint venture company to develop an integrated styrene
facility in Al Jubail, Saudi Arabia. The facility, to be built on a site adjacent to the existing
aromatics complex owned by Saudi Chevron Phillips Company (SCP), another 50 percent-owned CPChem
joint venture, will include feed fractionation, an olefins cracker, and ethylbenzene and styrene
monomer processing units. Construction of the facility will be in conjunction with an expansion of
SCP’s benzene plant. Construction began in the fourth quarter of 2004 and operational startup is
anticipated in late 2007.

EMERGING BUSINESSES

Emerging Businesses encompass the development of new businesses beyond our traditional operations.

Gas-to-liquids (GTL)

The GTL process refines natural gas into a wide range of transportable products. Our GTL research
facility is located in Ponca City, Oklahoma, and includes laboratories, pilot plants, and a
demonstration plant to facilitate technology advancements. The 400-barrel-per-day demonstration
plant, designed to produce clean fuels from natural gas, operated during 2004 as planned. The
plant will be operated in 2005 as necessary to obtain technical data for commercial applications.

Technology Solutions

Our Technology Solutions businesses provide both upstream and downstream technologies and services
that can be used in our operations or licensed to third parties. Downstream, major product lines
include sulfur removal technologies (S Zorb SRT), alkylation technologies (ReVAP), and delayed
coking (ThruPlus) technologies. We also offer a gasification technology (E-Gas) that uses
petroleum coke, coal,



and other low-value hydrocarbon as feedstock, resulting in high-value synthesis gas that can be
used for a slate of products, including power, hydrogen and chemicals.

Power Generation

The focus of our power business is on developing integrated projects in support of the company’s
E&P and R&M strategies and business objectives. The projects that enable these strategies are
included within their respective E&P and R&M segments. The projects and assets that have a
significant merchant component are included in the Emerging Businesses segment.

The power business completed development of a 730-megawatt, gas-fired combined heat and power plant
in North Lincolnshire, United Kingdom. The facility provides steam and electricity to the Humber
refinery and steam to a neighboring refinery, as well as merchant power into the U.K. market.
Construction began in 2002, and the project was placed in commercial operations in October 2004.

We also own or have an interest in gas-fired cogeneration plants in Orange and Corpus Christi,
Texas, and a petroleum coke-fired plant in Lake Charles, Louisiana.

Emerging Technology

Emerging Technology focuses on developing new business opportunities designed to provide growth
options for ConocoPhillips well into the future. Example areas of interest include advanced
hydrocarbon processes, energy conversion technologies, new petroleum-based products, and renewable
fuels.

COMPETITION

We compete with private, public and state-owned companies in all facets of the petroleum and
chemicals businesses. Some of our competitors are larger and have greater resources. Each of the
segments in which we operate is highly competitive. No single competitor, or small group of
competitors, dominates any of our business lines.

Upstream, our E&P segment competes with numerous other companies in the industry to locate and
obtain new sources of supply, and to produce oil and natural gas in an efficient, cost-effective
manner. Based on reserves statistics published in the September 13, 2004, issue of the

Oil and Gas
Journal

, our E&P segment had, on a BOE basis, the eighth-largest total of worldwide reserves of
non-government-controlled companies. We deliver our oil and natural gas production into the
worldwide oil and natural gas commodity markets. The principal methods of competing include
geological, geophysical and engineering research and technology; experience and expertise; and
economic analysis in connection with property acquisitions.

The Midstream segment, through our equity investment in DEFS and our consolidated operations,
competes with numerous other integrated petroleum companies, as well as natural gas transmission
and distribution companies, to deliver the components of natural gas to end users in the commodity
natural gas markets. DEFS is a large producer of natural gas liquids in the United States. DEFS’
principle methods of competing include economically securing the right to purchase raw natural gas
into its gathering systems, managing the pressure of those systems, operating efficient natural gas
liquids processing plants, and securing markets for the products produced.

Downstream, our R&M segment competes primarily in the United States, Europe and the Asia Pacific
region. Based on the statistics published in the December 20, 2004, issue of the

Oil and Gas
Journal

, our R&M segment had the largest U.S. refining capacity of 14 large refiners of petroleum
products.



Worldwide, it ranked fifth among non-government-controlled companies. In the Chemicals segment,
through our equity investment, CPChem generally ranks within the top 10 producers of many of its
major product lines, based on average 2004 production capacity, as published by industry sources.
Petroleum products, petrochemicals and plastics are delivered into the worldwide commodity markets.
Elements of downstream competition include product improvement, new product development, low-cost
structures, and manufacturing and distribution systems. In the marketing portion of the business,
competitive factors include product properties and processibility, reliability of supply, customer
service, price and credit terms, advertising and sales promotion, and development of customer
loyalty to ConocoPhillips’ or CPChem’s branded products.

GENERAL

At the end of 2004, we held a total of 1,692 active patents in 70 countries worldwide, including
697 active U.S. patents. During 2004, we received 51 patents in the United States and 121 foreign
patents. Our products and processes generated licensing revenues of $28 million in 2004. The
overall profitability of any business segment is not dependent on any single patent, trademark,
license, franchise or concession. Company-sponsored research and development activities charged
against earnings were $126 million, $136 million and $355 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

The environmental information contained in Management’s Discussion and Analysis on pages 77 through
80 under the caption, “Environmental” is incorporated herein by reference. It includes information
on expensed and capitalized environmental costs for 2004 and those expected for 2005 and 2006.

International and domestic political developments and government regulation at all levels are prime
factors that may materially affect our operations. Such political developments and regulation may
affect prices; production levels; asset ownership; allocation and distribution of raw materials and
products, including their import, export and ownership; the amount of tax and timing of payment;
and the cost and compliance for environmental protection. The occurrences and effects of such
events are not predictable.

Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The following is a description of reportable legal proceedings, including those involving
governmental authorities under federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials
into the environment for this reporting period. The following proceedings include those matters
that arose during the fourth quarter of 2004 and those matters previously reported in
ConocoPhillips’ 2003 Form 10-K and our first-, second- and third-quarter 2004 Forms 10-Q that have
not been resolved. While it is not possible to accurately predict the final outcome of these
pending proceedings, if any one or more of such proceeding was decided adversely to ConocoPhillips,
there would be no material effect on our consolidated financial position. Nevertheless, such
proceedings are reported pursuant to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s regulations.

In December 2004, the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency (PSCAA) notified us of their intent to seek
civil penalties in the amount of $203,000 for alleged violations of various PSCAA regulations at
our Tacoma Terminal in the state of Washington. We are currently assessing these allegations and
expect to work with the PSCAA towards a resolution of this matter.

In December 2004, the San Luis Obispo Air Pollution Control District (SLOAPCD) notified us of their
intent to seek civil penalties in the amount of $2,700,000 for alleged violations of various
SLOAPCD regulations at the Santa Maria facility of our San Francisco refinery. We are currently
assessing these allegations and expect to work with the SLOAPCD towards a resolution of this
matter.

We participated in negotiations throughout 2004 with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA), U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the states of Louisiana, Illinois, Pennsylvania, New
Jersey, and the Northwest Clean Air Agency (the state of Washington) to settle allegations arising
out of the EPA’s national enforcement initiative, as well as other related Clean Air Act regulation
issues. In January 2005, we entered into a consent decree with the United States and the local
agency and states named above. In the consent decree, we agreed to reduce air emissions from
refineries in Washington, California, Texas, Louisiana, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey by
approximately 47,000 tons per year over the next eight years. We plan to spend an estimated $525
million over that time period to install control technology and equipment to reduce emissions from
stacks, vents, valves, heaters, boilers, and flares. The consent decree requires us to pay a civil
penalty of $4.5 million in addition to at least $10 million to be spent on supplemental
environmental projects in Illinois, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, Washington, and New Jersey.

The U.S. Coast Guard and Washington State Department of Ecology are investigating the possible
sources of an alleged oil spill in Puget Sound. In November 2004, the U.S. Attorney and the U.S.
Coast Guard offices in Seattle, Washington, issued subpoenas to Polar Tankers, Inc., a subsidiary
of ConocoPhillips Company, for records related to the vessel Polar Texas. On December 23, 2004,
the Governor of the state of Washington and the U.S. Coast Guard publicly announced that they
believed the Polar Texas was the source of the alleged spill. Based on everything presently known
by the company, we do not believe that we are the source of the alleged spill. The company is
fully cooperating with the governmental authorities.

On August 24, 2003, the Contra Costa County District Attorney’s Office in California issued a
demand letter to ConocoPhillips seeking civil penalties in the amount of $524,000 for 31 alleged
violations of the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) regulations at the Rodeo
facility of our San Francisco refinery. On October 12, 2004, we entered into a settlement with the
BAAQMD to resolve the alleged violations. We paid a civil penalty of $350,000 to the BAAQMD.



In August 2004 Polar Tankers, Inc., a subsidiary of ConocoPhillips Company, self-reported to the
U.S. Coast Guard that a company employee had disclosed to management potential environmental
violations onboard the vessel Polar Alaska. The potential violations related to allegations that
certain actions may have resulted in one or more wastewater streams being discharged potentially
having concentrations of oil exceeding an applicable regulatory limit of 15 parts per million. On
September 1, 2004, the United States Attorney’s office in Anchorage issued a subpoena to
ConocoPhillips Company and Polar Tankers, Inc. for records relating to the company’s report of
potential violations. The company is fully cooperating with the governmental authorities.

On March 2, 2004, the BAAQMD notified us of their intent to seek civil penalties in the amount of
$750,000 for 17 alleged violations of various BAAQMD regulations at our Rodeo facility and carbon
plant located in the San Francisco area. We are currently assessing these allegations and expect
to work with the BAAQMD towards a negotiated resolution of this matter.

In December 2003, we entered into an Administrative Consent Order and Notice of Noncompliance with
the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection for alleged violations of State II and
Hazardous Waste requirements at various retail gasoline outlets formerly owned by us. This Consent
Agreement provides for the payment of a civil administrative penalty in the amount of $106,250.

In November 2003, the EPA issued us a notice of violation for alleged violations of the gasoline
Reid Vapor Pressure rules in 1999, 2000 and 2001 at our Wood River and Billings refineries. The
alleged violations have been resolved as part of the January 2005 consent decree we entered into
with the United States and other parties named above.

In August of 2003, EPA Region 6 issued a Show Cause Order alleging violations of the Clean Water
Act at the Borger refinery. The alleged violations relate primarily to discharges of selenium and
reported exceedances of permit limits for whole effluent toxicity. We met with the EPA staff on
several occasions to discuss the allegations. We believe the EPA staff is evaluating the
information presented at the meetings. The EPA has not yet proposed a penalty amount.

On December 31, 2002, we received a Revised Proposed Agreed Order, which amended the June 24, 2002,
Proposed Agreed Order, from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ), proposing a
penalty of $458,163 in connection with alleged air emission violations at our Borger refinery as a
result of an inspection conducted by the TCEQ in October 2000. On March 19, 2003, the TCEQ issued
a recalculation of the proposed penalty in the amount of $467,834. We agreed to resolve this
matter for $410,000.

On December 17, 2002, the DOJ notified ConocoPhillips of various alleged violations of the National
Pollution Discharge Elimination System permit for the Sweeny refinery. DOJ asserts that these
alleged violations occurred at various times during the period beginning January 1997 through July
2002. A consent decree was lodged with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas,
Houston Division on October 4, 2004, proposing a civil penalty of $610,000 and a Supplemental
Environmental Project (SEP) valued at approximately $90,000. Under the SEP, ConocoPhillips will
donate approximately 128 acres of land it owns near the Sweeny refinery to the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service for inclusion in the San Bernard National Wildlife Refuge. We await the court’s
approval and entry of the consent decree.



On July 15, 2002, the United States filed a Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act (CERCLA) cost recovery action against Conoco Inc. and seven other defendants alleging
that the United States had incurred unreimbursed response costs at the Lowry Superfund Site located
in Arapahoe County, Colorado. The United States seeks recovery of approximately $12.3 million in
past response costs and a declaratory judgment for future CERCLA response cost liability. The
defendants filed counterclaims seeking declaratory relief that certain response actions taken by
the government were inconsistent with the National Contingency Plan. The defendants’
counterclaims, if successful, will reduce the total amount of response costs that are reimbursable
to the government.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Merger of Conoco and Phillips

On August 30, 2002, Conoco Inc. (Conoco) and Phillips Petroleum Company (Phillips) combined their
businesses by merging with wholly owned subsidiaries of a new company named ConocoPhillips (the
merger). The merger was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, with Phillips
designated as the acquirer for accounting purposes. Because Phillips was designated as the
acquirer, its operations and results are presented in this annual report for all periods prior to
the close of the merger. From the merger date forward, the operations and results of
ConocoPhillips reflect the combined operations of the two companies.

Business Environment and Executive Overview

ConocoPhillips is an international, integrated energy company. We are the third largest integrated
energy company in the United States, based on market capitalization. We have approximately 35,800
employees worldwide, and at year-end 2004 had assets of $93 billion. Our stock is listed on the
New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “COP.” Our business is organized into six operating
segments:

•

Exploration and Production (E&P) —This segment primarily explores for, produces and
markets crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis.

•

Midstream—This segment gathers and processes natural gas produced by ConocoPhillips and
others, and fractionates and markets natural gas liquids, primarily in the United States,
Canada and Trinidad. The Midstream segment includes our 30.3 percent equity investment in
Duke Energy Field Services, LLC (DEFS), a joint venture with Duke Energy Corporation.

•

Refining and Marketing (R&M) —This segment purchases, refines, markets and transports
crude oil and petroleum products, mainly in the United States, Europe and Asia.

•

LUKOIL Investment—This segment consists of our equity investment in the ordinary shares
of LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia. Our
investment was 10 percent at December 31, 2004.



•

Chemicals—This segment manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide
basis. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in Chevron
Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem), a joint venture with ChevronTexaco Corporation.

•

Emerging Businesses—This segment encompasses the development of new businesses beyond
our traditional operations, including new technologies related to natural gas conversion
into clean fuels and related products (e.g., gas-to-liquids), technology solutions, power
generation, and emerging technologies.

Crude oil and natural gas prices, along with refining margins, play the most significant roles in
our profitability. Accordingly, our overall earnings depend primarily upon the profitability of
our E&P and R&M segments. Crude oil and natural gas prices, along with refining margins, are
driven by market factors over which we have no control. However, from a competitive perspective,
there are other important factors that we must manage well to be successful, including:

•

Adding to our proved reserve base.

We add to our proved reserve base in three primary ways:

o

Successful exploration and development of new fields.

o

Acquisition of existing fields.

o

Applying new technologies and processes to boost recovery from existing fields.

Through a combination of all three methods listed above, we have been successful in the past
in maintaining or adding to our production and proved reserve base, and we anticipate being
able to do so in the future. In the three years ending December 31, 2004, our reserve
replacement exceeded 200 percent, excluding the impact of our equity investment in LUKOIL.
The replacement rate was primarily attributable to the merger of Conoco and Phillips, and
extensions and discoveries. Improved recovery also positively contributed to our reserve
replacement success. Although it cannot be assured, going forward, we expect
to more than replace our production over the next three years, excluding the impact of our equity investment
in LUKOIL. This expectation is based on our current slate of exploratory and improved
recovery projects.

•

Operating our producing properties and refining and marketing operations safely,
consistently and in an environmentally sound manner.

Safety is our first priority and
we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone who has a role in our
operations. Maintaining high utilization rates at our refineries, minimizing downtime in
producing fields, and maximizing the development of our reserves all enable us to capture
the value the market gives us in terms of prices and margins. During 2004, our worldwide
refinery utilization rate was 94 percent, compared with 95 percent in 2003. Finally, our
operations are conducted in a manner that emphasizes our environmental stewardship.

•

Controlling costs and expenses.

Since we cannot control the prices of the
commodity products we sell, keeping our operating and overhead costs low, within the
context of our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, is a high priority. We
monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to senior management
monthly, on both an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit basis. Because low operating and
overhead costs are critical to maintaining competitive positions in our industries, cost
control is a component of our variable compensation programs.

•

Selecting the appropriate projects in which to invest our capital dollars.

We
participate in capital-intensive industries. As a result, we must often invest significant
capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields, develop newly discovered fields,
maintain existing fields, or continue to maintain and improve our refinery complexes. We
invest in those projects that are expected to provide an adequate financial return on
invested dollars. However, there are often long lead times



from the time we make an investment to the time that investment is operational and begins
generating financial returns. Our capital expenditures and investments in 2004 totaled $9.5
billion, and we anticipate capital expenditures and investments to be approximately $7.9
billion in 2005. The 2005 amount excludes any discretionary expenditures that may be made
to further increase our equity investment in LUKOIL. Excluding investments in LUKOIL, we
project that 2005 capital expenditures will be higher than 2004 due to ongoing development
projects, cost increases and new opportunities.

•

Managing our asset portfolio.

We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire
assets that will contribute to future growth at competitive prices. We also continually
assess our assets to determine if any no longer fit our growth strategy and should be sold
or otherwise disposed. This management of our asset portfolio is important to ensuring our
long-term growth and maintaining adequate financial returns. During 2004 we substantially
completed the asset disposition program that we announced at the time of the merger. Also
during 2004, we acquired a 10 percent interest in LUKOIL, a major Russian integrated energy
company.

•

Hiring, developing and retaining a talented workforce.

We want to attract,
train, develop and retain individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our
business strategy and who support our values and ethics.

Our key performance indicators are shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the
operating segment sections that follow. These include crude oil and natural gas prices and
production, natural gas liquids prices, refining capacity utilization, and refinery output.

Other significant factors that can and/or do affect our profitability include:

•

Property and leasehold impairments.

As mentioned above, we participate in
capital-intensive industries. At times, these investments become impaired when our reserve
estimates are revised downward, when crude oil or natural gas prices decline significantly
for long periods of time, or when a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down
to fair market value. Property impairments in 2004 totaled $164 million, compared with
$252 million in 2003. We may also invest large amounts of money in exploration blocks
which, if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful, could lead to material impairment of
leasehold values.

•

Goodwill.

As a result of mergers and acquisitions, at year-end 2004 we had $15
billion of goodwill on our balance sheet. Although our latest tests indicate that no
goodwill impairment is currently required, future deterioration in market conditions could
lead to goodwill impairments that would have a substantial negative affect on our
profitability.

•

Tax jurisdictions.

As a global company, our operations are located in countries
with different tax rates and fiscal structures. Accordingly, our overall effective tax
rate can vary significantly between periods based on the “mix” of earnings within our
global operations.

Segment Analysis

The E&P segment’s results are most closely linked to crude oil and natural gas prices. These are
commodity products, the prices of which are subject to factors external to our company and over
which we have no control. We benefited from favorable crude oil prices in 2004, which contributed
significantly to what we view as strong results from this segment in 2004. Industry crude oil
prices were approximately $10 per barrel higher in 2004, versus 2003, averaging $41.42 per barrel
for West Texas Intermediate. The increase primarily was due to strong global consumption
associated with the robust global economic recovery and particularly strong demand growth in China,
as well as oil supply disruptions in Iraq and in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico due to hurricane activity,
with little excess OPEC production capacity available to replace lost supplies. Industry U.S.
natural gas prices were moderately higher in 2004, versus 2003,



averaging approximately $6.13 per thousand cubic feet for Henry Hub. Natural gas prices rose in
2004 due primarily to higher oil prices, continued concerns regarding the adequacy of U.S. natural
gas supplies, and hurricane activity disrupting production in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. At year-end
2004, we estimated that a $1 per barrel change in crude oil prices would have an estimated $180
million annual impact on net income. For natural gas, the corresponding impact is approximately
$50 million for a 10 cent per thousand cubic feet price change.

The Midstream segment’s results are most closely linked to natural gas liquids prices. The most
important factor on the profitability of this segment is the results from our 30.3 percent equity
investment in DEFS. Higher natural gas liquids prices improved results from this segment in 2004.
During 2004, we sold some of our non-DEFS Midstream assets located in the Lower 48 states that are
not associated with our E&P operations.

Refining margins, refinery utilization, cost control, and marketing margins primarily drive the R&M
segment’s results. Refining margins are subject to movements in the cost of crude oil and other
feedstocks, and the sales prices for refined products, which are subject to market factors over
which we have no control. Refining margins in 2004 were improved over 2003, resulting in improved
R&M profitability. Industry U.S. refining margins were sharply higher in 2004 versus 2003 due to
robust U.S. refined product demand and concerns regarding the adequacy of refined product supplies
in the U.S. market in light of tightening gasoline specifications and the ban on methyl
tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) in New York and Connecticut. Industry U.S. marketing margins declined
in 2004 versus 2003, as wholesale and retail prices did not keep pace with rising gasoline and
diesel spot market prices, which rose in part as a consequence of the increase in crude oil prices.
At year-end 2004, we estimated that a 25 cent per barrel change in worldwide refining margins
would have an estimated $125 million annual impact on net income. For U.S. marketing margins, the
corresponding impact is approximately $100 million for a 1 cent per gallon margin change. Our
refineries operated at 94 percent of capacity in 2004, and our goal in 2005 is to operate at an
even higher level.

The LUKOIL Investment segment consists of our investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL. In
October 2004, we closed on a transaction to acquire 7.6 percent of LUKOIL’s shares held by the
Russian government for approximately $2 billion. During the remainder of the year, we acquired
additional shares in the open market for an additional $641 million, bringing our equity ownership
interest in LUKOIL to 10 percent by year-end 2004.

The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in CPChem. The chemicals and plastics
industry is mainly a commodity-based industry where the margins for key products are based on
market factors over which CPChem has little or no control. The chemicals and plastics industry had
been in a cyclical downturn that began in late 2000. In this difficult market environment, CPChem
placed great emphasis on safety, cost control and managing its capacity utilization. In addition,
CPChem is investing in feedstock-advantaged areas in the Middle East with access to large, growing
markets, such as Asia. During 2004, margins improved in the chemicals and plastics industries,
leading to improved results from this segment.

The Emerging Businesses segment represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside
our normal scope of operations. We do not expect the results from this segment to be material to
our consolidated results. However, the businesses in this segment allow us to support our primary
segments by staying current on new technologies that could become important drivers of
profitability in future years.



At December 31, 2004, we had a debt-to-capital ratio of 26 percent, compared with 34 percent at the
end of 2003. The decrease was due to a $2.8 billion reduction in debt during 2004, along with
increased equity reflecting strong earnings. If market conditions permit, we are targeting to
lower our debt-to-capital ratio over the next several years to the low-20-percent range. This
should improve our cost of capital and further position us for growth opportunities in the future.

2004 vs. 2003

Net income was $8,129 million in 2004, compared with $4,735 million in 2003. The improved results
in 2004 primarily were due to:

•

Improved refining margins in our R&M segment.

•

Higher crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices in our E&P and Midstream
segments.

•

Improved margins in the Chemicals segment.

•

Initial equity earnings from our investment in LUKOIL.

See the “Segment Results” section for additional information on our segment results.



2003 vs. 2002

Net income was $4,735 million in 2003, compared with a net loss of $295 million in 2002. The
improved results in 2003 were primarily due to:

•

Increased E&P and R&M production volumes as a result of the merger.

•

Higher crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids prices in our E&P segment.

•

Improved refining and marketing margins in our R&M segment.

•

Lower impairments and lease loss accruals related to discontinued operations.

•

Lower merger-related expenses in 2003, compared with 2002.

Income Statement Analysis

2004 vs. 2003

Sales and other operating revenues increased 30 percent in 2004, while purchased crude oil, natural
gas and products increased 34 percent. These increases mainly were due to:

•

Higher petroleum products prices.

•

Higher prices for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids.

•

Increased volumes of natural gas bought and sold by our commercial organization in its
role of optimizing the commodity flows of our E&P segment.

•

Higher excise, value added and other similar taxes.

Equity in earnings of affiliates increased 183 percent in 2004. The increase reflects initial
equity earnings from our investment in LUKOIL, as well as improved results from:

•

Our heavy-oil joint ventures in Venezuela (Hamaca and Petrozuata), due to higher crude
oil prices and higher production volumes.

•

Our chemicals joint venture, Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC, due to higher
volumes and margins.

•

Our midstream joint venture, Duke Energy Field Services, LLC, reflecting higher natural
gas liquids prices.

•

Our joint-venture refinery in Melaka, Malaysia, due to improved refining margins in the
Asia Pacific region.

•

Our joint-venture delayed coker facilities at the Sweeny, Texas, refinery, Merey Sweeny
LLP, due to wider heavy-light crude oil differentials.

Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) increased 9 percent in 2004, primarily due to new
fields onstream for a full year for the first time in 2004, including the Bayu-Undan field in the
Timor Sea; the Su Tu Den field, offshore Vietnam; and the Grane field in the Norwegian North Sea.
In addition, foreign currency rates and the Norway Removal Grant Act increased DD&A in 2004. In
2005, we expect DD&A to increase by approximately 15 percent over 2004 levels, reflecting new
projects in the E&P segment, including a full year’s production from the Magnolia field in the Gulf
of Mexico and the Belanak field, offshore Indonesia, as well as new production from the Clair field
in the Atlantic Margin and continued ramp-up at the Bayu-Undan field.



Interest and debt expense declined 35 percent in 2004. The decrease primarily was due to lower
average debt levels during 2004 and an increased amount of interest being capitalized on major
capital projects.

Our effective tax rate for 2004 was 44 percent, compared with 45 percent for 2003. The decrease in
the effective tax rate in 2004, compared with 2003, mainly was due to the impact of a higher
proportion of income in lower tax rate jurisdictions, partially offset by reduced benefits from tax
rate reductions.

We adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 143, “Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations,” (SFAS No. 143) effective January 1, 2003. As a result, we recognized a
benefit of $145 million for the cumulative effect of this accounting change. Also effective
January 1, 2003, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46 (revised
December 2003), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” (FIN 46(R)) for variable interest
entities involving synthetic leases and certain other financing structures created prior to
February 1, 2003. This resulted in a charge of $240 million for the cumulative effect of this
accounting change. We recognized a net $95 million charge in 2003 for the cumulative effect of
these two accounting changes.

2003 vs. 2002

The merger affects the comparability of the 2003 and 2002 periods. 2003 includes a full year of
ConocoPhillips’ operations, while 2002 includes only four months of combined operations. Prior to
August 30, 2002, our results reflect Phillips’ operations only. Accordingly, when comparing 2003
with 2002, the merger significantly increased:

•

Sales revenues and purchase costs due to higher volumes of products being bought and sold.

•

Equity earnings due to an increased number of equity affiliates.

•

Production and operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses due
to the increased size and scope of operations following the merger, partially offset by
lower merger-related costs in 2003.

•

Depreciation, depletion and amortization due to the increased depreciable asset base.

•

Taxes other than income taxes due to higher gasoline sales, production volumes and
property and payroll taxes.

•

Interest and debt expense due to higher debt levels following the merger.

In addition to the merger impact, sales and other operating revenues and purchase costs increased
because of higher prices for key products such as crude oil, natural gas, automotive gasoline and
distillates.

A higher net gain on asset sales was primarily responsible for the increase in other income in
2003. During 2003, we sold several E&P operations that did not fit into our long-term growth
strategy. In addition, 2003 included gains attributable to insurance demutualization benefits.

Selling, general and administrative expenses in 2002 included a $246 million charge for the
write-off of in-process research and development costs acquired in the merger. The absence of such
a significant charge in the 2003 period reduced the impact of the merger on this line item.

Accretion on discounted liabilities increased $123 million in 2003, reflecting accretion expense on
environmental liabilities assumed in the merger and discounted obligations associated with the
retirement and removal of long-lived assets that became effective January 1, 2003, with the
adoption of SFAS No. 143. See Note 2—Changes in Accounting Principles, in the Notes to Financial
Statements, for additional information.



In addition to the merger impact, interest and debt expense also increased in 2003 because of the
adoption of FIN 46(R). The adoption of FIN 46(R) for variable interest entities involving
synthetic leases and certain other financing structures, effective January 1, 2003, resulted in
increased balance sheet debt, which resulted in higher interest expense in 2003. See Note
2—Changes in Accounting Principles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for
additional information.

During 2003, we recognized a $28 million gain on subsidiary equity transactions related to our E&P
Bayu-Undan development in the Timor Sea. See Note 6—Subsidiary Equity Transactions, in the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.

Our effective tax rate in 2003 was 45 percent, compared with 67 percent in 2002. The lower
effective tax rate in 2003 primarily was the result of a higher proportion of income in
lower-tax-rate jurisdictions and the one-time impact of tax law changes in certain international
jurisdictions. Contributing to the higher effective tax rate in 2002 was a write-off of in-process
research and development costs, as well as the partial impairment of an exploration prospect, both
without corresponding tax benefits in 2002.

Our discontinued operations had income of $237 million in 2003, compared with a net loss of $993
million in 2002. The net loss in 2002 reflected charges totaling $1,008 million after-tax related
to the impairment of properties, plants and equipment; goodwill; intangible assets; and provisions
for losses associated with various operating lease commitments. For additional information about
our discontinued operations, see Note 4—Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Restructuring Accruals

As a result of the merger, we began a restructuring program in September 2002 to capture the
benefits of combining Conoco and Phillips by eliminating redundancies, consolidating assets, and
sharing common services and functions across regions. The restructuring program was essentially
completed during 2004. The information in Note 5—Restructuring, in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements, is incorporated herein by reference.

Syncrude produced






The E&P segment explores for, produces and markets crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids
on a worldwide basis. It also mines deposits of oil sands in Canada to extract the bitumen and
upgrade it into a synthetic crude oil. At December 31, 2004, our E&P operations were producing in
the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Nigeria, Venezuela, offshore Timor Leste in
the Timor Sea, Australia, China, Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates, Vietnam, and Russia.

2004 vs. 2003

Net income from the E&P segment increased 33 percent in 2004. The increase primarily was due to
higher crude oil prices and, to a lesser extent, higher natural gas and natural gas liquids prices.
Increased sales prices were partially offset by lower crude oil and natural gas production, as
well as higher exploration expenses and lower net gains on asset dispositions. The 2003 period
included a net benefit of $142 million for the cumulative effect of accounting changes (SFAS No.
143 and FIN 46(R)), as well as benefits of $233 million from changes in certain international
income tax and site restoration laws and equity realignment of certain Australian operations.
Included in 2004 is a $72 million benefit related to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities
from the 2003 Canadian graduated tax rate reduction and a 2004 Alberta provincial tax rate change.

If crude oil and natural gas prices in 2005 do not remain at the historically strong levels
experienced in 2004, E&P’s earnings would be negatively impacted in 2005. See the “Business
Environment and Executive Overview” section for additional discussion of crude oil and natural gas
prices, including estimates of our E&P segment’s sensitivities to crude oil and natural gas prices.

Proved reserves at year-end 2004 were
7.61 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with 7.85
billion BOE at year-end 2003. This excludes the estimated 880 million
BOE reported in the LUKOIL Investment segment. Our Canadian Syncrude mining
operations had an additional 258 million barrels of proved oil sands reserves at the end of 2004,
compared with 265 million barrels at year-end 2003.

2003 vs. 2002

Net income from the E&P segment increased 146 percent in 2003, compared with 2002. The improvement
reflects higher production volumes, primarily due to the merger; higher crude oil and natural gas
prices; and an increased net gain on asset sales. These items were partially offset by higher
production and operating expenses; depreciation, depletion and amortization; and taxes other than
income taxes, all the result of the larger size and scope of our operations following the merger.

In addition, 2003 included benefits of $233 million in our international E&P operations from
changes in income tax and site restoration laws, as well as an equity realignment of certain
Australian operations. Also, the cumulative effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 143 and the
adoption of FIN 46(R) for variable interest entities involving synthetic leases and certain other
financing structures increased E&P’s net income by $142 million in 2003.

ConocoPhillips’ proved reserves at year-end 2003 were 7.85 billion barrels of oil equivalent, a
slight increase over 7.81 billion barrels at year-end 2002. Our Canadian Syncrude mining
operations had an additional 265 million barrels of proved oil sands reserves at the end of 2003,
compared with 272 million barrels at year-end 2002.



U.S. E&P

2004 vs. 2003

Net income from our U.S. E&P operations increased 24 percent in 2004. The increase was mainly the
result of higher crude oil prices and, to a lesser extent, higher natural gas and natural gas
liquids prices, partially offset by lower crude oil and natural gas production volumes and lower
net gains on asset dispositions. In addition, the 2003 period included a net benefit of $142
million for the cumulative effect of accounting changes (SFAS No. 143 and FIN 46(R)).

U.S. E&P production on a BOE basis averaged 629,000 barrels per day in
2004, down 7 percent from 674,000 BOE per day in 2003. The decreased production primarily was the
result of the impact of 2003 asset dispositions, normal field production declines, and planned
maintenance activities during 2004.

2003 vs. 2002

Net income from our U.S. E&P operations increased 105 percent in 2003, compared with 2002. The
improvement reflects higher crude oil and natural gas prices, higher production volumes, and a net
$143 million benefit from the cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 143 and FIN 46(R).

U.S. E&P production averaged 674,000 BOE per day in 2003, an increase of 15 percent from 587,000
BOE per day in 2002. The increased production primarily was the result of the merger, as well as
increased production from the Borealis satellite field at Kuparuk and from the Alpine field,
partially offset by normal field production declines and the impact of asset dispositions.

International E&P

2004 vs. 2003

Net income from our international E&P operations increased 43 percent in 2004. The increase
primarily was due to higher crude oil prices and, to a lesser extent, higher natural gas and
natural gas liquids prices and higher natural gas liquids volumes. Higher prices were partially
offset by increased exploration expenses.

International E&P production averaged 913,000 BOE per day in 2004, down slightly from 916,000 BOE
per day in 2003. This excludes the estimated 38,000 barrels per day reported in the LUKOIL
Investment segment. Production was favorably impacted in 2004 by the startup of production from
the Su Tu Den field in Vietnam in late 2003, the ramp-up of liquids production from the Bayu-Undan
field in the Timor Sea since startup in February 2004, and the startup of the Hamaca upgrader in
Venezuela in the fourth quarter of 2004. These items were more than offset by the impact of asset
dispositions, normal field production declines, and planned maintenance. In addition, our Syncrude
mining operations produced 21,000 barrels per day in 2004, compared with 19,000 barrels per day in
2003.



2003 vs. 2002

Net income from our international E&P operations increased 225 percent in 2003, compared with 2002.
Increased production volumes following the merger accounted for the majority of the earnings
improvement. Higher crude oil and natural gas prices contributed to the remaining increase.

International E&P’s production averaged 916,000 BOE per day
in 2003, compared with 482,000 BOE per day in 2002. In addition, our Syncrude mining
operations produced 19,000 barrels per day in 2003, compared with 8,000 barrels per day in 2002.
The merger was the primary reason for the production increase.

International E&P’s net income in 2003 also was favorably impacted by the following items:

•

In Norway, the Norway Removal Grant Act (1986) was repealed in the second quarter of
2003. Prior to its repeal, this Act required the Norwegian government to contribute to
the cost of removing offshore oil and gas production facilities. Now, the co-venturers
in the facilities must fund all removal costs, but can deduct the removal costs, as
incurred, under the Petroleum Tax Act, at the marginal tax rate in effect at the time of
removal. These changes required us: to recognize an additional liability for the
government’s share, prior to repeal of the Act, of the future removal costs, with a
corresponding increase in properties, plants and equipment (PP&E); and to establish a net
deferred tax asset for the temporary differences between the financial basis and tax
basis of all of our Norwegian removal assets and liabilities. Some of the increases in
PP&E were on shut-in fields, which led to immediate impairments of those properties. The
overall impact on 2003 results was a net after-tax benefit of $87 million.

•

In the Timor Sea region, ConocoPhillips and its co-venturers received final approvals
from authorities to proceed with the natural gas development phase of the Bayu-Undan
project in the second quarter of 2003. This approval allowed a broad ownership interest
re-alignment among the co-venturers to proceed, which included our sale of a 10 percent
interest in the project and the issuance of equity by previously wholly owned
subsidiaries. In addition, the ratification of the Australia/Timor Leste treaty lowered
the company’s deferred tax liability position. The net result of these events was an
after-tax benefit of $51 million in 2003. See Note 6—Subsidiary Equity Transactions, in
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.

•

In November 2003, the Canadian Parliament enacted federal tax rate reductions for oil
and gas producers. As a result, we recognized a $95 million benefit upon revaluation of
our deferred tax liability in the fourth quarter.

The Midstream segment purchases raw natural gas from producers and gathers natural gas through
an extensive network of pipeline gathering systems. The natural gas is then processed to extract
natural gas liquids from the raw gas stream. The remaining “residue” gas is marketed to electrical
utilities, industrial users, and gas marketing companies. Most of the natural gas liquids are
fractionated—separated into individual components like ethane, butane and propane—and marketed as
chemical feedstock, fuel, or blendstock. The Midstream segment consists of our 30.3 percent
interest in Duke Energy Field Services, LLC (DEFS), as well as our other natural gas gathering and
processing operations, and natural gas liquids fractionation and marketing businesses, primarily in
the United States, Canada and Trinidad.

2004 vs. 2003

Net income from the Midstream segment increased 81 percent in 2004. The improvement was primarily
attributable to improved results from DEFS, which had:

•

Higher gross margins, primarily reflecting higher natural gas liquids prices.

•

A $23 million (gross) charge in 2003 for the cumulative effect of accounting changes,
mainly related to the adoption of SFAS No. 143; partially offset by investment impairments
and write-downs of assets held for sale during 2004.

Our Midstream operations outside of DEFS had higher earnings in 2004 as well, reflecting the impact
of higher natural gas liquids prices that more than offset the effect of asset dispositions in
2004.

Included in the Midstream segment’s net income was a benefit of $36 million in 2004, the same as
2003, representing the amortization of the excess amount of our 30.3 percent equity interest in the
net assets of DEFS over the book value of our investment in DEFS.



2003 vs. 2002

Net income from the Midstream segment increased 136 percent in 2003, compared with 2002. The
increase primarily was attributable to improved results from DEFS and the addition of midstream
operations following the merger. DEFS’ results mainly increased because of higher natural gas
liquids prices in 2003. In addition, DEFS’ results in 2002 included higher costs for gas imbalance
adjustment accruals.

Included in the Midstream segment’s 2003 net income was a basis-difference benefit of $36 million,
compared with $35 million in 2002, representing the amortization of the excess amount of our 30.3
percent equity interest in the net assets of DEFS over the book value of our investment in DEFS.

Weighted-average crude oil capacity for the period. Actual capacity at year-end 2004 and 2002 was 2,160,000 and 2,166,000 barrels per day, respectively, in the United States and 428,000 and 440,000 barrels per day, respectively, internationally.



The R&M segment’s operations encompass refining crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum
products (such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels), buying and selling crude oil and
petroleum products, and transporting, distributing and marketing petroleum products. R&M has
operations in the United States, Europe and Asia Pacific.

2004 vs. 2003

Net income from the R&M segment increased 116 percent in 2004, primarily due to higher refining
margins. This was partially offset by lower U.S. marketing margins, and higher maintenance
turnaround and utility costs. The 2003 period included a $125 million net charge for the
cumulative effect of accounting changes (FIN 46(R)).

2003 vs. 2002

Net income from our R&M segment increased substantially in 2003, compared with 2002. The improved
results primarily were due to significantly higher U.S. refining margins. The addition of refining
and marketing assets in the merger also contributed to the higher 2003 earnings, as did increased
wholesale gasoline margins. Partially offsetting the improvements was a net charge of $125 million
for the cumulative effect of the adoption of FIN 46(R) for variable interest entities involving
synthetic leases and certain other financing structures.

U.S. R&M

2004 vs. 2003

Net income from our U.S. R&M operations increased 115 percent in 2004, primarily due to higher
refining margins, partially offset by lower marketing margins, and higher maintenance turnaround
and utility costs. The 2003 period included a $125 million net charge for the cumulative effect of
accounting change (FIN 46(R)).

Our U.S. refining capacity utilization rate was 95 percent in 2004, compared with 96 percent in
2003. The lower capacity utilization was due to increased maintenance downtime.

2003 vs. 2002

Net income from our U.S. R&M operations increased significantly in 2003, compared with 2002. The
improved results mainly were due to significantly higher refining margins. The addition of
refining and marketing assets in the merger also contributed to the higher 2003 earnings, as did
increased wholesale gasoline margins. Partially offsetting the margin improvements in 2003 was a
net charge of $125 million for the cumulative effect of the adoption of FIN 46(R) for variable
interest entities involving synthetic leases and certain other financing structures, along with
higher utility costs.

Our U.S. refineries ran at a crude oil capacity utilization rate of 96 percent in 2003, compared
with 91 percent in 2002. The rate in 2002 was lowered by higher maintenance turnaround activity,
the impact of tropical storms on our Gulf Coast refineries, and the loss of Venezuelan crude oil
supply in the fourth quarter due to the economic and political instability in that country during
the quarter.



International R&M

2004 vs. 2003

Net income from the international R&M operations increased 119 percent in 2004, with the
improvement primarily attributable to higher refining margins, partially offset by negative foreign
currency impacts on operating costs.

Our international crude oil refining capacity utilization rate was 91 percent in 2004, compared
with 94 percent in 2003. Beginning in the third quarter of 2004, we changed our crude oil capacity
utilization statistic at the Humber refinery to make it consistent with our other refineries. This
change has been applied to the operating statistics for 2003 and 2002.

2003 vs. 2002

Net income from our international R&M operations increased substantially in 2003, compared with
2002. The improvement was due to the larger size and scope of our international refining and
marketing operations following the merger, along with higher international refining margins.
Included in international R&M’s net income in 2003 was a net foreign currency gain of $18 million,
compared with a net gain of $9 million in 2002.

Our international crude oil capacity utilization rate was 94 percent in 2003, compared with 83
percent in 2002. The lower utilization rate in 2002 primarily was the result of the Humber
refinery in the United Kingdom being shut down for an extended period of time in the fourth quarter
due to a power outage and subsequent downtime.

method. In October 2004, we closed on a transaction to acquire 7.6 percent of LUKOIL’s shares held
by the Russian government. During the remainder of 2004, we increased our ownership interest to 10
percent.

In addition to our estimate of our fourth-quarter weighted-average 8.6 percent equity share of LUKOIL’s earnings,
this segment also reflects the amortization of the basis difference between our equity interest in
the net assets of LUKOIL and the historical cost of our investment in LUKOIL. In addition, this
segment will include the costs associated with the employees seconded to LUKOIL.



Because LUKOIL’s accounting cycle close and preparation of U.S. GAAP financial statements occurs
subsequent to our accounting cycle close, our equity earnings and statistics for 2004 from our
LUKOIL investment are an estimate, based on market indicators, historical production trends of
LUKOIL, and other factors. Any difference between the estimate and actual results will be recorded
in a subsequent period. This estimate-to-actual adjustment will then be a recurring component of
future period results.

Chemicals

The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent interest in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC
(CPChem), which we account for using the equity method of accounting. CPChem uses natural gas
liquids and other feedstocks to produce petrochemicals such as ethylene, propylene, styrene,
benzene, and paraxylene. These products are then marketed and sold, or used as feedstocks to
produce plastics and commodity chemicals, such as polyethylene, polystyrene and cyclohexane.

2004 vs. 2003

Net income from the Chemicals segment increased $242 million in 2004, compared with 2003. The
improvement reflects that CPChem had improved equity earnings from Qatar Chemical Company Ltd.
(Q-Chem), an olefins and polyolefins complex in Qatar, and Saudi Chevron Phillips Company, an
aromatics complex in Saudi Arabia. Results from CPChem’s consolidated operations also improved
from higher ethylene and benzene margins, as well as increased ethylene, polyethylene and normal
alpha olefins sales volumes.

2003 vs. 2002

The worldwide chemicals industry experienced an economic downturn beginning in the second half of
2000, and the downturn continued through 2003. The downturn led to excess production capacity in
the industry and pressured margins on key products. The chemicals industry has also been impacted
by high energy prices, which negatively impacts both utility and feedstock costs.

The Emerging Businesses segment includes the development of new businesses outside our traditional
operations. These activities include gas-to-liquids (GTL) operations, power generation, technology
solutions such as sulfur removal technologies, and emerging technologies, such as renewable fuels
and emission management technologies.

2004 vs. 2003

Emerging Businesses incurred a net loss of $102 million in 2004, compared with a net loss of $99
million in 2003. Contributing to the higher losses in 2004 were lower domestic power margins and
higher maintenance costs, as well as increased costs associated with the Immingham power plant
project in the United Kingdom, which entered the initial commissioning phase of the project during
2004. Prior to the initial commissioning phase, most costs associated with this project were
capitalized as construction costs. This project completed the initial commissioning phase and began
commercial operations in October 2004. Partially offsetting these items were lower research and
development costs, compared with 2003, which included the costs of a demonstration GTL plant then
under construction. Construction of the GTL plant was substantially completed during the second
quarter of 2003.

2003 vs. 2002

Emerging Businesses incurred a net loss of $99 million in 2003, compared with a net loss of $310
million in 2002. The net loss in 2003 was less than that in 2002 as a result of a $246 million
write-off of purchased in-process research and development costs in the third quarter of 2002
related to Conoco’s GTL and other technologies. In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 4,
“Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase
Method,” value assigned to research and development activities in the purchase price allocation
that have no alternative future use are required to be charged to expense at the date of the
consummation of the combination. The $246 million charge was the same on both a before-tax and
after-tax basis, because there was no tax basis in the assigned value prior to its write-off.

2004 vs. 2003

After-tax net interest consists of interest and debt expense, net of interest income and
capitalized interest, as well as premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt and costs
associated with the receivables



monetization program. Net interest decreased 19 percent in 2004, primarily due to lower average
debt levels, an increased amount of interest being capitalized in 2004, lower charges for premiums
paid on the early retirement of debt, and lower costs associated with the receivables monetization
program.

After-tax corporate general and administrative expenses increased 23 percent in 2004. The increase
reflects higher compensation costs, which includes increased stock-based compensation due to an
increase in both the number of units issued and higher stock prices in the 2004 period.

Discontinued operations net income declined 91 percent in 2004, reflecting asset dispositions
completed during 2003 and 2004.

Beginning with the second quarter of 2004, we no longer separately identify merger-related costs
because these activities have been substantially completed.

The category “Other” consists primarily of items not directly associated with the operating
segments on a stand-alone basis, including certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses,
and environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation. Results from Other were
lower in 2004, mainly due to the inclusion in the 2003 period of gains related to insurance
demutualization benefits, negative foreign currency transaction impacts, higher environmental costs
and increased minority interest expense.

2003 vs. 2002

Net interest increased 53 percent in 2003, compared with 2002. The increase in 2003 mainly was due
to our higher debt levels following the merger, the impact of the adoption of FIN 46(R) for
variable interest entities involving synthetic leases and certain other financing structures, and
increased premiums on the early retirement of debt. The adoption of FIN 46(R) at January 1, 2003,
increased debt, which resulted in higher interest expense.

Income from discontinued operations was $237 million in 2003, compared with a loss of $993 million
in 2002. The net loss in 2002 reflects charges totaling $1,008 million after-tax related to the
impairment of properties, plants and equipment; goodwill; intangible assets; and provisions for
losses associated with various operating lease commitments. For additional information about our
discontinued operations, see Note 4—Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

On an after-tax basis, merger-related costs were $223 million in 2003, compared with $307 million
in 2002. Included in these costs were employee relocation expenses, transition labor costs, and
other charges directly associated with the merger.

Results from Other were improved in 2003, compared with 2002, because of higher foreign currency
transaction gains and an after-tax gain of $34 million in the first quarter of 2003, representing
beneficial interests we had in certain insurance companies as a result of the conversion of those
companies from mutual companies to stock companies, a process known as demutualization. These
beneficial interests arose from our prior purchase and ownership of various insurance policies and
contracts issued by the mutual companies. Prior to the demutualizations, our mutual ownership
interests in these insurance companies were not recognized because the ownership interests in the
mutual companies were neither capable of valuation nor marketable. Included in Other in 2003 was a
net foreign currency transaction gain of $67 million, after-tax, compared with a net gain of $21
million in 2002.

To meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding
sources, primarily cash generated from operating activities. In addition, during 2004 we raised
approximately $1.6 billion in funds from the sale of assets. During 2004, available cash was used
to support the company’s ongoing capital expenditures and investments program, repay debt and pay
dividends. In September 2004, our Board of Directors (Board) declared a quarterly dividend of $.50
per share, which represented a 16 percent increase from the previous quarter’s dividend rate.
Total dividends paid on our common stock in 2004 were $1.2 billion. During 2004, cash and cash
equivalents increased $897 million to $1,387 million. In early 2005, a portion of this cash was
used to repay $544 million of commercial paper that had been outstanding at December 31, 2004.

In addition to cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from asset sales, we also rely on
our commercial paper and credit facility programs, as well as our $5 billion universal shelf
registration statement, to support our short- and long-term liquidity requirements. We anticipate
that these sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our funding requirements through 2006,
including our capital spending program and required debt payments.

Our cash flows from operating activities increased in each of the annual periods from 2002 through
2004. In addition to favorable market conditions, major acquisitions and mergers played a
significant role in the upward trend of our cash flows from operating activities. The most
significant event during this period was the merger of Conoco and Phillips on August 30, 2002.
Phillips was designated as the acquirer for accounting purposes, so 2002 operating cash flows
included eight months (January through August) of Phillips’ activity only and four months of
ConocoPhillips’ activity (September through December), while 2003 included the first full year of
ConocoPhillips’ activity. Absent any other significant acquisitions or mergers during 2005, we
expect that market conditions will be the most important factor affecting our 2005 cash flows, when
compared with 2004.



Significant Sources of Capital

Operating Activities

During 2004 cash of $11,959 million was provided by operating activities, an increase of $2,603
million from 2003. This increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an
increase in income from continuing operations, partially offset by an increase in working capital.
The working capital increase primarily was driven by higher accounts receivable and a higher
retained interest in receivables sold to a Qualifying Special Purpose Entity (QSPE), partly offset
by higher accounts payable. Contributing to the increase in accounts receivable and accounts
payable were higher sales and purchase prices, respectively. For additional information on income
from continuing operations, see the Results of Operations section. For additional information on
receivables sold to a QSPE, see Receivables Monetization in the Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
section.

Our cash flows from operating activities for both the short- and long-term are highly dependent
upon prices for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, as well as refining and marketing
margins. During 2003 and particularly in 2004, we benefited from high crude oil and natural gas
prices, as well as strong refining margins. The sustainability of these prices and margins are
driven by market conditions over which we have no control. In addition, the level of our
production volumes of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids also impacts our cash flows.
These production levels are impacted by such factors as acquisitions and dispositions of fields,
field production decline rates, new technologies, operating efficiency, the addition of proved
reserves through exploratory success, and the timely and cost-effective development of those proved
reserves.

We will need to continue to add to our proved reserve base through exploration and development of
new fields, or by acquisition, and to apply new technologies and processes to boost recovery from
existing fields in order to maintain or increase production and proved reserves. We have been
successful in the past in maintaining or adding to our production and proved reserve base and, although it cannot be assured,
anticipate being able to do so in the future. Our barrel-of-oil-equivalent (BOE) production, after
adjusting our 2003 production for approximately 60,000 BOE per day for assets sold in 2003 and
early 2004, has increased in each of the past three years (2002, 2003 and 2004). Excluding the
impact of our equity investment in LUKOIL on our production, we expect our 2005 production level to
be approximately 4 percent higher than our 2004 level of 1.54 million BOE per day. In 2006, we expect our production level to increase an additional 4
percent over our projected 2005 BOE production level. Beyond 2006, we estimate our BOE production
to grow at an average annual rate of approximately 3 percent for the period 2007 through 2010.
These projections are tied to projects currently scheduled to begin production or ramp-up in those
years and exclude our Canadian Syncrude mining operations.

Excluding the impact of our equity investment in LUKOIL on our proved oil and gas reserves, our
reserve replacement over the three-year period ending December 31, 2004, exceeded 200 percent.
Contributing to our success during this three-year period were proved reserves added by the merger
of Conoco and Phillips, volumes added through extensions and discoveries, and improved recovery.
Although it cannot be assured,
going forward, we expect to more than replace our production over the next
three years. This expectation is based on our current slate of exploratory and improved recovery
projects.
As discussed in Critical Accounting Policies, engineering estimates of proved reserves are
imprecise and therefore each year reserves may be revised upward or downward due to the impact of
changes in oil and gas prices or as more technical data becomes available on the reservoirs. In
2004 and 2002, revisions decreased our reserves, while in 2003, revisions increased reserves. It
is not possible to reliably predict how revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future.
The net addition of proved undeveloped reserves accounted for 64 percent, 76 percent and 34 percent
of our total net additions in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.



During these years, we converted,
on average, approximately 13 percent per year of our proved undeveloped reserves to proved
developed reserves. Of the proved undeveloped reserves we had at December 31, 2004, we estimate
that the average annual conversion rate for these reserves for the following three years will be
in the 25 percent range. For additional information related to the development of proved
undeveloped reserves, see the discussion under the E&P section of Capital Spending. The projections and actual results noted above exclude the impact of our equity
investment in LUKOIL, and the anticipated production and reserve replacement results are subject to
risks, including reservoir performance; operational downtime; finding and development execution;
obtaining management, Board and third-party approval of development projects in a timely manner;
regulatory changes; geographical location; market prices; and environmental issues; and therefore,
cannot be assured.

Asset Sales

Following the merger, we initiated an asset disposition program. Our ultimate target was to raise
approximately $4.5 billion by the end of 2004. During 2004, proceeds from asset sales were $1.6
billion, bringing total proceeds to approximately $5.0 billion since the program began. While we
will continue to have modest asset disposition activity, this asset disposition program was
essentially completed at the end of the second quarter of 2004. Proceeds from these asset sales
were used primarily to pay off debt.

Commercial Paper and Credit Facilities

While the stability of our cash flows from operating activities benefits from geographic diversity
and the effects of upstream and downstream integration, our operating cash flows remain exposed to
the volatility of commodity crude oil and natural gas prices and refining and marketing margins, as
well as periodic cash needs to finance tax payments and crude oil, natural gas and petroleum
product purchases. Our primary funding source for short-term working capital needs is a $5 billion
commercial paper program, a portion of which may be denominated in other currencies (limited to
euro 3 billion equivalent). Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days. At
December 31, 2004, we had $544 million of commercial paper outstanding, compared with $709 million
of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2003.

Effective October 12, 2004, we entered into two new revolving credit facilities totaling $5 billion
to replace our previously existing $1.5 billion 364-day facility that was set to expire on October
13, 2004; two revolving credit facilities totaling $2 billion expiring in October 2006; and a $500
million facility expiring in October 2008. The two new facilities include a $2.5 billion four-year
facility expiring in October 2008 and a $2.5 billion five-year facility expiring in October 2009.
Both facilities are available for use as direct bank borrowings or as support for our $5 billion
commercial paper program. In addition, the five-year facility may be used to support issuances of
letters of credit totaling up to $750 million. The facilities are broadly syndicated among
financial institutions and do not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants
requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or ratings. The credit agreements do contain a
cross-default provision relating to our, or any of our consolidated subsidiaries’, failure to pay
principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more. There were no outstanding
borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2004.

One of our Norwegian subsidiaries had two $300 million revolving credit facilities that expired in
June 2004, which were not renewed.



Moody’s Investor Service has maintained a rating of A3 on our senior long-term debt; and Standard
and Poors’ Rating Service and Fitch have maintained ratings of A-. We do not have any ratings
triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic event of default in the event
of a downgrade of our credit rating and thereby impact our access to liquidity. In the event that
our credit rating deteriorated to a level that would prohibit us from accessing the commercial
paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our $5 billion revolving credit
facilities. Based on our commercial paper balance of $544 million and having issued $173 million
of letters of credit at year-end, we had access to $4.3 billion in borrowing capacity as of
December 31, 2004, which provides liquidity to cover daily operations. In addition, at year-end
2004 our $1.4 billion cash balance and $720 million of remaining capacity related to our
receivables monetization program also supported our liquidity position.

Shelf Registration

In late 2002, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission for various types of debt and equity securities. As a result, we have
available to issue and sell a total of $5 billion of various types of securities under the
universal shelf registration statement.

Minority Interests

At December 31, 2004, we had outstanding $1,105 million of equity held by minority interest owners,
including a minority interest of $504 million in Ashford Energy Capital S.A. The remaining
minority interest amounts related to controlled-operating joint ventures with minority interest
owners. The largest of these, $542 million, was related to the Bayu-Undan liquefied natural gas
project in the Timor Sea. During the third quarter of 2004, a $141 million net minority interest
in Conoco Corporate Holdings L.P. was retired.

In December 2001, in order to raise funds for general corporate purposes, Conoco and Cold Spring
Finance S.a.r.l. formed Ashford Energy Capital S.A. through the contribution of a $1 billion Conoco
subsidiary promissory note and $500 million cash by Cold Spring. Through its initial $500 million
investment, Cold Spring is entitled to a cumulative annual preferred return based on three-month
LIBOR rates, plus 1.32 percent. The preferred return at December 31, 2004, was 3.34 percent. In
2008, and at each 10-year anniversary thereafter, Cold Spring may elect to remarket their
investment in Ashford, and if unsuccessful, could require ConocoPhillips to provide a letter of
credit in support of Cold Spring’s investment, or in the event that such letter of credit is not
provided, then cause the redemption of their investment in Ashford. Should ConocoPhillips’ credit
rating fall below investment grade, Ashford would require a letter of credit to support $475
million of the term loans, as of December 31, 2004, made by Ashford to other ConocoPhillips
subsidiaries. If the letter of credit is not obtained within 60 days, Cold Spring could cause
Ashford to sell the ConocoPhillips subsidiary notes. At December 31, 2004, Ashford held $1.7
billion of ConocoPhillips subsidiary notes and $25 million in investments unrelated to
ConocoPhillips. We report Cold Spring’s investment as a minority interest because it is not
mandatorily redeemable and the entity does not have a specified liquidation date. Other than the
obligation to make payment on the subsidiary notes described above, Cold Spring does not have
recourse to our general credit.

Receivables Factoring

At December 31, 2003, we had sold $226 million of receivables under factoring arrangements. We
retained servicing responsibility for these sold receivables, which gives us certain benefits, the
fair value of which approximates the fair value of the liability incurred for continuing to service
the receivables. At December 31, 2004, we had no receivables outstanding under similar
arrangements. See Note 14—Sales of Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
for additional information.



Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Receivables Monetization

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, certain credit card and trade receivables had been sold to a QSPE in
a revolving-period securitization arrangement. This arrangement provides for us to sell, and the
QSPE to purchase, certain receivables, and for the QSPE to then issue beneficial interests of up to
$1.2 billion to five bank-sponsored entities. All five bank-sponsored entities are multi-seller
conduits with access to the commercial paper market and purchase interests in similar receivables
from numerous other companies unrelated to us. We have no ownership interests, nor any variable
interests, in any of the bank-sponsored entities. As a result, we do not consolidate any of these
entities. Furthermore, we do not consolidate the QSPE because it meets the requirements of SFAS
No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
Liabilities,” to be excluded from the consolidated financial statements of ConocoPhillips.

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the QSPE had issued beneficial interests to the bank-sponsored
entities of $480 million and $1.2 billion, respectively. The receivables transferred to the QSPE
met the isolation and other requirements of SFAS No. 140 to be accounted for as sales and were
accounted for accordingly.

We retain beneficial interests in this QSPE that are subordinate to the beneficial interests issued
to the bank-sponsored entities. These retained interests, which are reported on the balance sheet
in accounts and notes receivable—related parties, were $3.2 billion at December 31, 2004, and $1.3
billion at December 31, 2003. We also retain servicing responsibility related to the sold
receivables, which gives us certain rights and abilities, the fair value of which approximates the
fair value of the liability incurred for continuing to service the receivables. The carrying value
of the subordinated beneficial interests in the QSPE approximates fair market value due to the very
short term of the underlying assets. See Note 14—Sales of Receivables, in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.

Preferred Securities

In 1997, we formed a statutory business trust, Phillips 66 Capital II (Trust II), with
ConocoPhillips owning all of the common securities of the trust. The sole purpose of the trust was
to issue preferred securities to outside investors, investing the proceeds thereof in an equivalent
amount of subordinated debt securities of ConocoPhillips. The trust was established to raise funds
for general corporate purposes.

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, Trust II had $350 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred
securities outstanding, whose sole asset was $361 million of ConocoPhillips’ subordinated debt
securities, which bear interest at 8 percent. Distributions on the trust preferred securities are
paid by the trust with funds from interest payments made by ConocoPhillips on the subordinated debt
securities. We made interest payments of $29 million in both 2004 and 2003. In addition, we
guaranteed the payment obligations of the trust on the trust preferred securities to the extent we
made interest payments on the subordinated debt securities. When we redeem the subordinated debt
securities, Trust II is required to apply all the redemption proceeds to the immediate redemption
of the preferred securities. See Note 2—Changes in Accounting Principles and Note 18—Preferred
Stock and Other Minority Interests, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for
additional information.

Affiliated Companies

As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry practice, we
invest in, and enter into, numerous agreements with other parties to pursue business opportunities,
which share costs and apportion risks among the parties as governed by the agreements. At December
31, 2004, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual arrangements
as described below.



•

Hamaca

:

The Hamaca project involves the development of heavy-oil reserves from the
Orinoco Oil Belt. We own a 40 percent interest in the Hamaca project, which is operated by
Petrolera Ameriven on behalf of the owners. The other participants in Hamaca are Petroleos
de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) and ChevronTexaco Corporation. Our interest is held through a
jointly owned limited liability company, Hamaca Holding LLC, for which we use the equity
method of accounting. Hamaca Holding LLC revenues for 2004 were approximately $625
million, expenses were approximately $413 million and cash provided by operating activities
was approximately $324 million. We have a 57.1 percent non-controlling ownership interest
in Hamaca Holding LLC. In the second quarter of 2001, we, along with our co-venturers in
the Hamaca project, secured approximately $1.1 billion in a joint debt financing. The
Export-Import Bank of the United States provided a guarantee supporting a 17-year-term $628
million bank facility. The joint venture also arranged a $470 million 14-year-term
commercial bank facility for the project. Total debt of $957 million was outstanding under
these credit facilities at December 31, 2004. Of this amount, $383 million is recourse to
ConocoPhillips. The proceeds of these joint financings were used to primarily fund a
heavy-oil upgrader. The remaining necessary funding was provided by capital contributions
from the co-venturers on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary to successfully complete
construction. Once completion certification is achieved (required by October 1, 2005), the
joint project financings will become non-recourse with respect to the co-venturers and the
lenders under those facilities can then look only to the Hamaca project’s cash flows for
payment.

•

Merey Sweeny L.P. (MSLP)

:

MSLP is a limited partnership in which we and PDVSA
each own an indirect 50 percent interest. During 1999, MSLP issued $350 million of 8.85
percent bonds due 2019 that we, along with PDVSA, were jointly-and-severally liable for
under a construction completion guarantee. In May 2004, MSLP achieved completion
certification. As a result, the construction completion guarantee related to the debt and
bond financing arrangements secured by MSLP expired and the debt became non-recourse to
ConocoPhillips and the bondholders can look only to MSLP cash flows for payment.

•

Other

:

At December 31, 2004, we had guarantees of approximately $250 million
outstanding for our portion of other joint-venture debt obligations, which have terms of up
to 20 years. Payment would be required if a joint venture defaults on its debt
obligations. Included in these outstanding guarantees was $95 million associated with the
Polar Lights Company joint venture in Russia.

For additional information about guarantees see Note 15—Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Capital Requirements

For information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the “Capital Spending” section.

Our balance sheet debt at December 31, 2004, was $15.0 billion. This reflects debt reductions of
approximately $2.8 billion during 2004. The debt reduction primarily resulted from repayment in
April of the $1,350 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.90% Notes due 2004 at maturity, the
redemption in August 2004 of the $1,150 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.5% Notes due
2005, and a reduction of $165 million in our outstanding commercial paper balance to $544 million
at December 31, 2004. The 8.5% Notes were redeemed at a premium of $58 million plus accrued
interest. In addition, we have given notice to redeem in March 2005 our $400 milion 3.625% Notes due 2007.
Going forward, we have no significant mandatory debt retirements until payment of the
$1,250 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.45% Notes due in 2006, at maturity.



On February 4, 2005, we announced a stock repurchase program that provides for the repurchase of up
to $1 billion of the company’s common stock over a period of up to two years. The program will
serve as a means of offsetting dilution to shareholders from the company’s stock-based compensation
programs. Acquisitions for the share repurchase program will be made at management’s discretion at
prevailing prices, subject to market conditions and other factors. Purchases may be increased,
decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice. Shares of stock repurchased under the
plan will be held as treasury shares.

Represents any agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms. The
majority of the purchase obligations are market-based contracts. Includes: (1) our commercial activities of $34,880 million, of which $16,243
million are primarily related to the supply of crude oil to our refineries and the optimization of the supply chain, $7,176 million primarily related
to the supply of unfractionated NGLs to fractionators, optimization of NGL assets, and for resale to customers, $4,919 million primarily related to
natural gas for resale to customers, $3,378 million related to transportation, $1,351 million of futures, $1,284 million related to product purchases
and $529 million related to the purchase side of exchange agreements; (2) $27,615 million of purchase commitments for products, mostly natural gas
and natural gas liquids, from CPChem over the remaining term of 96 years; and (3) purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where
we are the operator, of which some of the obligations will be reimbursed by our co-owners in these properties. Does not include: (1) purchase
commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator; (2) our agreement to purchase up to 104,000 barrels per day of
Petrozuata crude oil for a market-based formula price over the term of the Petrozuata joint venture (about 35 years) in the event that Petrozuata is
unable to sell the production for higher prices; and (3) an agreement to purchase up to 165,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan Merey, or equivalent,
crude oil for a market price over a remaining 15-year term if a variety of conditions are met.

***

Does not include: (1) Taxes—the company’s consolidated balance sheet reflects liabilities related to income, excise, property, production, payroll
and environmental taxes. We anticipate the current liability of $3,154 million for accrued income and other taxes will be paid in the next year. We
have other accrued tax liabilities whose resolution may not occur for several years, so it is not possible to determine the exact timing or amount of
future payments. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes; (2) Pensions—for the 2005 through 2009 time period, we expect to contribute
an average of $415 million per year to our qualified and non-qualified pension and postretirement medical plans in the United States and an average
of $135 million per year to our non-U.S. plans, which are expected to be in excess of required minimums in many cases. Our required minimum funding
in 2005 is expected to be $60 million in the United States and $90 million outside the United States; and (3) Interest—we anticipate payments of $894
million in 2005, $1,672 million for the period 2006 through 2007, $1,496 million for the period 2008 through 2009, and $8,259 million for the
remaining years to total $12,321 million.

Discretionary expenditures in 2005 for potential additional equity
investment in LUKOIL to increase our ownership percentage up to 20 percent,
from 10 percent at December 31, 2004, are not included in our 2005 budget
amounts.

**

Excludes discontinued operations.

Our capital spending for continuing operations for the three-year period ending December 31,
2004, totaled $20.1 billion, including $2.6 billion in 2004 relating to our purchase of a 10
percent interest in LUKOIL, an international integrated oil and gas company headquartered in
Russia. Spending was primarily focused on the growth of our E&P segment, with 65 percent of total
spending for continuing operations in this segment.

Excluding discretionary expenditures for potential additional investment in LUKOIL, our capital
budget for 2005 is $7.9 billion. Included in this amount is approximately $500 million to acquire
an interest in a joint venture with LUKOIL to develop oil and gas resources in Russia’s
Timan-Pechora province. Also included are approximately $345 million in capitalized interest and
approximately $145 million that will be funded by minority interests in the Bayu-Undan gas export
project. We plan to direct approximately 76 percent of our 2005 capital budget to E&P and 21
percent to R&M.

E&P

Capital spending for continuing operations for E&P during the three-year period ending December 31,
2004, totaled $13 billion. The expenditures over the three-year period supported several key
exploration and development projects including:

•

The West Sak and Alpine projects and drilling of National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska
(NPR-A) and satellite field prospects on Alaska’s North Slope.



Capital expenditures for construction of our Endeavour Class tankers and an additional interest in
the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System were also included in the E&P segment.

UNITED STATES

Alaska

During the three year-period ending December 31, 2004, we made capital expenditures for the
construction of double-hulled Endeavour Class tankers for use in transporting Alaskan crude oil to
the U.S. West Coast and Hawaii. We expect the fifth and final Endeavour Class tanker will be in
Alaska North Slope service in 2006.

We continued development drilling in the Greater Kuparuk Area, the Greater Prudhoe Area, the Alpine
field and the development of West Sak’s heavy-oil accumulations. In addition, we increased oil
production capacity at the Alpine field with the completion of Alpine Capacity Expansion-Phase I
and a significant portion of Phase II in the third quarter of 2004. We expect to complete the
final component of Phase II in 2005. We also participated in exploratory drilling on the North
Slope and we were the successful bidder on 71 tracts covering approximately 484 thousand net acres,
at the June 2004 Bureau of Land Management oil and gas lease sale for the Northwest Planning Area
of the NPR-A.

During 2004, we and our co-venturers in the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System began a project to upgrade
the pipeline’s pump stations that is expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2005 and
anticipated to be fully complete by the third quarter of 2006.

Lower 48 States

In the Lower 48, we continued to explore or develop our acreage positions in the deepwater Gulf of
Mexico, South Texas, the San Juan Basin, the Permian Basin, and the Texas Panhandle. In the Gulf
of Mexico, we began production in late 2004 from the Magnolia field, and we sanctioned and began
development of the K2 discovery in Green Canyon Block 562 in 2004.

Onshore capital was focused on natural gas developments in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico and the
Lobo Trend of South Texas. In addition, Lower 48 is pursuing select opportunities in its other
producing basins.



CANADA

In Canada, capital spending in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin continued to focus on
development and exploration in the eastern foothills of the Rocky Mountains and the western edge of
our core areas in Alberta, Northeast British Columbia and Southwest Saskatchewan.

We continued with development of the Stage III expansion-mining project in the Canadian province of
Alberta, which is expected to increase our Canadian Syncrude production. The Aurora Train 2
project (the new mine) started up in late-October 2003. The upgrader expansion project is expected
to be fully operational by mid-2006.

In 2004, we continued with development of the Surmont heavy-oil project. Over the life of this 30+
year project, we anticipate that approximately 500 production and steam-injection well pairs will
be drilled, with our share of the project costs estimated at $1 billion. During 2004, our capital
expenditures associated with development of the Surmont project were approximately $33 million.

SOUTH AMERICA

At our Hamaca project in Venezuela, construction of an upgrader to convert heavy crude oil into a
medium-grade crude oil became fully operational in the fourth quarter of 2004.

NORTHWEST EUROPE

In the U.K. and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea, funds were invested during the three-year
period ending December 31, 2004, for development of the Ekofisk Area growth project, expected to be
completed in the third quarter of 2005; the Grane field in the Norwegian North Sea, where
production began late in the third quarter of 2003; the U.K. Clair field, where production is expected to begin in
early 2005, the CMS3 area, comprising five natural gas fields in the southern sector of the U.K.
North Sea, where the final field began production in 2004; and the Britannia satellite fields,
Callanish and Brodgar, where production is expected in 2007.

AFRICA

In Nigeria, we made capital expenditures for the ongoing development of onshore oil and natural gas
fields, and for ongoing exploration activities both onshore and on deepwater leases.

CASPIAN SEA

In 2002, following a discovery well drilled in 2000, we and our co-venturers, and the government of
the Republic of Kazakhstan, declared the Kashagan field on the Kazakhstan shelf in the North
Caspian Sea to be commercial. In February 2004, the Republic of Kazakhstan approved a development
plan for the field and construction activities began. Additional exploratory drilling through 2004
has resulted in the discovery of a total of five fields in the area. In May 2002, we along with
the other remaining co-venturers, completed the acquisition of proportionate interests of two
co-venturers’ rights, which increased our ownership interest from 7.14 percent to 8.33 percent.

During 2003, we exercised our pre-emptive rights to acquire a proportionate share of B.G.
International’s interest in the North Caspian Sea license that includes the Kashagan field.
Discussions continue with the Republic of Kazakhstan government to conclude the sale.



In the South Caspian, drilling was completed in 2004 on the Zafar-Mashal #1 exploration well in
Azerbaijan waters. The well was declared non-commercial and was written off to dry hole expense.

ASIA PACIFIC

Timor Sea

In the Timor Sea, we continued with development activities associated with Phase I of the
Bayu-Undan gas recycle project, where condensate and natural gas liquids are separated and removed
and the dry gas re-injected into the reservoir. Production of liquids began from Phase I in
February of 2004. All Phase I development drilling is expected to be complete by April 2005.

In June of 2003, we received approval from the Timor Sea Designated Authority for Phase II, the
development of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant near Darwin, Australia, as well as a gas
pipeline from Bayu-Undan to the LNG facility. Construction activities continued through 2004, and
the first LNG cargo from the 3.52-million-ton-per-year facility is scheduled for delivery in early
2006.

Indonesia

In Indonesia, funds were used to construct the Belanak floating production, storage and offloading
(FPSO) facility and develop the Belanak field in the South Natuna Sea Block B, where commercial oil
production began in late 2004. Also, in Block B we began development of the Kerisi and Hiu fields,
and we began the preliminary engineering phase of the North Belut field development. In South
Sumatra, following the execution of the West Java gas sales agreement in August, we began the
development of the Suban Phase II project, which is an expansion of the existing Suban gas plant.
Also in South Sumatra, we completed the construction of the South Jambi shallow gas project in the
South Jambi B Block, where first production began in June 2004.

China

In late-December 2002, we began production from Phase I of our Peng Lai 19-3 development located on
Block 11/05 in China’s Bohai Bay. In late 2004, we approved development plans for the second phase
of the Peng Lai 19-3 oil field, as well as concurrent development of the nearby 25-6 field. In
early 2005, the Chinese government also approved the development. The development of Peng Lai 19-3
and Peng Lai 25-6 will include multiple wellhead platforms and a larger FPSO facility.

Vietnam

In Vietnam’s Block 15-1, the Su Tu Den Phase I southwest area development project was approved in
December 2001, and production from this area began in the fourth quarter of 2003. Water injection
facilities were put into service in 2004, and preliminary engineering for the nearby Su Tu Vang
development began in early 2005.

In 2004, we continued the development of the Rang Dong field on Block 15-2, including the
development of the central part of the field, where two additional platforms and additional
production and injection wells are expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2005.

2005 Capital Budget

E&P’s 2005 capital budget is $6.0 billion, 15 percent higher than actual expenditures in 2004.
Twenty-four percent of E&P’s 2005 capital budget is planned for the United States, with 51 percent
of that slated for Alaska.



We plan to spend $751 million in 2005 for our Alaskan operations. A majority of the capital
spending will fund Prudhoe Bay, Greater Kuparuk and Western North Slope operations—including
additional work on the Alpine capacity expansion projects, two Alpine satellite and West Sak field
developments, construction to complete our fifth and final Endeavour Class tanker, and exploration
activities.

In the Lower 48, offshore capital expenditures will be focused on continued development of the K2
and Ursa fields and the completion of Magnolia wells in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Onshore
capital will focus primarily on developing natural gas reserves within core areas, including the
San Juan Basin of New Mexico and the Lobo Trend of South Texas.

E&P is directing $4.6 billion of its 2005 capital budget to international projects. Included in
this amount is approximately $500 million for a 30 percent economic interest in a joint venture
with LUKOIL to develop oil and gas resources in the northern part of Russia’s Timan-Pechora
province. Closing on the joint-venture arrangement is expected in the first half of 2005. The
majority of the remaining funds will be directed to developing other major long-term projects,
including the Bayu-Undan gas development project in the Timor Sea; the Kashagan project in the
Caspian Sea; the Britannia satellites, Ekofisk Area growth, Alvheim and Saturn projects in the
North Sea; the Bohai Bay project in China; the Syncrude expansion, Surmont heavy-oil and the
Mackenzie Delta gas projects in Canada; the Belanak, Kerisi-Hiu and Suban Phase II projects in
Indonesia; the Corocoro project in Venezuela; and the Qatargas 3 LNG project in Qatar.

PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES

Excluding the impact of our equity investment in LUKOIL, costs incurred for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and gas
reserves were $2,351 million, $2,002 million, and $1,631 million, respectively. During these
years, we converted, on average, approximately 13 percent per year of our proved undeveloped
reserves to proved developed reserves. Although it cannot be assured,
estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved
undeveloped reserves for the years 2005 through 2007 are projected to be $2,223 million, $1,668
million, and $851 million, respectively, excluding the impact of our equity investment in LUKOIL. Of our 2,232 million BOE
proved undeveloped reserves at year-end 2004, approximately 82 percent were associated with 12
major developments. Of these 12, three are expected to have an aggregate of approximately 300
million BOE convert from proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves during 2005, 2006
and 2007 (with expected year of conversion noted parenthetically) as follows:

•

Nigeria natural gas reserves (2005).

•

Bayu-Undan field in the Timor Sea (natural gas for 2006).

•

Brodgar field in the United Kingdom (2007).

The remaining nine developments are currently producing and are expected to have additional proved
reserves convert from undeveloped to developed over time as development activities continue and/or
production facilities are expanded or upgraded:

•

The Hamaca and Petrozuata heavy-oil projects in Venezuela.

•

The Ekofisk, Eldfisk, Heidrun and Visund fields in the North Sea and Norwegian Sea.

•

Indonesia natural gas reserves.



•

The Prudhoe Bay field on Alaska’s North Slope.

•

The Magnolia field in the Gulf of Mexico.

In addition, proved undeveloped reserves added in 2004 for the Kashagan field in Kazakhstan are
expected to be converted to proved developed in 2008 with completion of the first phase of the
project.

R&M

Capital spending for continuing operations for R&M during the three-year period ending December 31,
2004, was primarily for clean fuels projects to meet new environmental standards, refinery-upgrade
projects to improve product yields, and the operating integrity of key processing units, as well as
for safety projects. During this three-year period, R&M capital spending for continuing operations
was $3.4 billion, representing 17 percent of our total capital spending for continuing operations.

Key projects during the three-year period included:

In 2004, we continued to expend funds related to clean fuels, safety and environmental projects in
the United States, including investing in a new diesel hydrotreater at the Rodeo facility of our
San Francisco refinery. The new diesel hydrotreater is expected to produce reformulated California
highway diesel an estimated one year ahead of the June 2006 deadline.

The integration of certain refining assets purchased adjacent to our Wood River refinery in
Illinois was completed in the second quarter of 2004. Integration of the assets enables the
refinery to process heavier, lower cost crude oil.

Internationally, we continued to invest in our ongoing refining and marketing operations, including
a replacement reformer at our Humber refinery in the United Kingdom and marketing growth in select
countries in Europe and Asia.

2005 Capital Budget

R&M’s 2005 capital budget for continuing operations is $1.6 billion, a 21 percent increase over
actual spending in 2004. Domestic spending is expected to consume 87 percent of the R&M budget.



We plan to direct about $1.3 billion of the R&M capital budget to domestic refining, of which
approximately 65 percent will go toward domestic clean fuels projects in order to comply with new
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards for refined products. Worldwide, clean fuels spending for our R&M refining business
is expected to be $814 million, or approximately 60 percent of the total refining budget. Our U.S.
marketing and transportation businesses are expected to spend about $143 million, while the
remaining budget will fund projects in our international refining and marketing businesses in
Europe and the Asia Pacific region.

Emerging Businesses

Capital spending for Emerging Businesses during the three-year period ending December 31, 2004, was
primarily for construction of the Immingham combined heat and power cogeneration plant near the
company’s Humber refinery in the United Kingdom. The plant began commercial operations in October
2004.

Contingencies

Legal and Tax Matters

We accrue for contingencies when a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated.
Based on currently available information, we believe that it is remote that future costs related to
known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a
material adverse impact on the company’s financial statements.

Environmental

We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state, and local environmental laws and
regulations, as are other companies in the petroleum exploration and production industry; and
refining, marketing and transportation of crude oil and refined products businesses. The most
significant of these environmental laws and regulations include, among others, the:



•

Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground
injection wells.

•

U.S. Department of the Interior regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas
operations in U.S. waters and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting
from operations, as well as potential liability for pollution damages.

These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of
discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases, require permits in
association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect
substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and
time-consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and
the agency’s processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting
process are beyond the control of the applicant.

Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar
environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in
some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to
the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international
borders.

The ultimate financial impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly
known nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water quality
standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However, environmental laws and
regulations, including those that may arise to address concerns about global climate change, are
expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in
other countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air emission
compliance and remediation obligations in the United States.

For example, the EPA has promulgated rules regarding the
sulfur content in highway diesel fuel, which become applicable in June 2006. In April 2003, the
EPA proposed a rule regarding emissions from non-road diesel engines and limiting non-road diesel
fuel sulfur content. The non-road rule, as promulgated in June 2004, significantly reduces
non-road diesel fuel sulfur content limits as early as 2007. We are evaluating and developing
capital strategies for future integrated compliance of our diesel fuel for the highway and non-road
markets.

Additional areas of potential air-related impact are the proposed revisions to the National Ambient
Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and the Kyoto Protocol. In July 1997, the EPA promulgated more
stringent revisions to the NAAQS for ozone and particulate matter. Since that time, final adoption
of these revisions has been the subject of litigation (

American Trucking Association, Inc. et al.
v. United States Environmental Protection Agency

) that eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court
during the fall of 2000. In February 2001, the U.S. Supreme Court remanded this matter, in part, to
the EPA to address the implementation provisions relating to the revised ozone NAAQS. The EPA
responded by promulgating a revised implementation rule for its new 8-hour NAAQS on April 30, 2004.
Several environmental groups have since filed challenges to this new rule. Depending upon the
outcomes of the various challenges, area designations, and the resulting State Implementation
Plans, the revised NAAQS could result in substantial future environmental expenditures for us.

In 1997, an international conference on global warming concluded an agreement, known as the Kyoto
Protocol, which called for reductions of certain emissions that contribute to increases in
atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. The United States has not ratified the treaty codifying
the Kyoto Protocol but may in the future ratify, support or sponsor either it or other climate
change related emissions reduction programs. Other countries where we have interests, or may have
interests in the future, have made commitments to the Kyoto Protocol and are in various stages of
formulating applicable regulations.



Because considerable uncertainty exists with respect to the regulations that would ultimately
govern implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, it currently is not possible to accurately estimate
our future compliance costs under the Kyoto Protocol, but they could be substantial. The Kyoto
Protocol became effective as to its ratifying countries in February 2005.

We also are subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation
obligations associated with current and past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA
and RCRA and their state equivalents. Remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility
arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at numerous past and present
ConocoPhillips-owned and/or operated petroleum-marketing outlets throughout the United States.
Federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases
be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. In addition to other cleanup standards,
many states adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) for both soil and
groundwater. MTBE standards continue to evolve, and future environmental expenditures associated
with the remediation of MTBE-contaminated underground storage tank sites could be substantial.

At RCRA permitted facilities, we are required to assess environmental conditions. If conditions
warrant, we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior operations. In contrast to
CERCLA, which is often referred to as “Superfund,” the cost of corrective action activities under
RCRA corrective action programs typically is borne solely by us. Over the next decade, we
anticipate that significant ongoing expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be required,
but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to vary significantly from the
range of such expenditures we have experienced over the past few years. Longer term, expenditures
are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly.

We, from time to time, receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the
EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under
CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost
recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits
assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by
us, but allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31, 2003, we
reported we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and comparable state laws at 61
sites around the United States. At December 31, 2004, we had resolved 9 of these sites and had
received 12 new notices of potential liability, leaving 64 unresolved sites where we have been
notified of potential liability.

For most Superfund sites, our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site
remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus that attributable to
all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively low. Although liability of those
potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for
state sites, other potentially responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had
the financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where potentially
responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability has not increased materially.
Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA
or the state agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally
assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In
some instances, we may have no liability or attain a settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs
generally occur after the parties obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are
relatively few sites where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of
anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor such costs at all
CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive or
financial condition.



Expensed environmental costs were $623 million in 2004 and are expected to be about $610 million in
2005 and $620 million in 2006. Capitalized environmental costs were $652 million in 2004 and are
expected to be about $1,096 million and $769 million in 2005 and 2006, respectively.

Remediation Accruals

We accrue for remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and
reasonable estimates of the liability can be made. These accrued liabilities are not reduced for
potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties and are not discounted (except those
assumed in a purchase business combination, which we do record on a discounted basis).

Many of these liabilities result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require us to
undertake certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or once
conducted, operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips-generated waste was disposed. The accrual
also includes a number of sites we identified that may require environmental remediation, but which
are not currently the subject of CERCLA, RCRA or state enforcement activities. If applicable, we
accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may
incur significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect
to these costs, and under adverse changes in circumstances, potential liability may exceed amounts
accrued as of December 31, 2004.

Remediation activities vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the
mix of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse regulatory agencies
and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of potentially liable third parties.
Therefore, it is difficult to develop reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs.

At December 31, 2004, our balance sheet included a total environmental accrual related to
continuing operations of $1,061 million, compared with $1,119 million at December 31, 2003. We
expect to incur a substantial majority of these expenditures within the next 30 years.

Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses,
environmental costs and liabilities are inherent in our operations and products, and there can be
no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do
not expect any material adverse affect upon our results of operations or financial position as a
result of compliance with environmental laws and regulations.

Other

We have deferred tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, loss carryforwards, and credit
carryforwards. Valuation allowances have been established for certain foreign operating and
domestic capital loss carryforwards that reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more
likely than not, be realized. Uncertainties that may affect the realization of these assets
include tax law changes and the future level of product prices and costs. Based on our historical
taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management
expects that the net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax
liabilities and as reductions in future taxable income.



NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND EMERGING ISSUES

New Accounting Standards

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153,
“Exchange of Nonmonetary Assets an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29.” This amendment eliminates the
Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 29 exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar
productive assets and replaces it with an exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not
have commercial substance. This Statement is effective on a prospective basis beginning July 1,
2005. We continue to evaluate this standard.

Also in December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based
Payment,” (SFAS No. 123(R), which supercedes APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and
replaces SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” that we adopted at the beginning
of 2003. SFAS No. 123(R) prescribes the accounting for a wide range of share-based compensation
arrangements, including share options, restricted share plans, performance-based awards, share
appreciation rights, and employee share purchase plans, and generally requires the fair value of
share-based awards to be expensed in the income statement. We are studying the provisions of this
new pronouncement to determine the impact, if any, on our financial statements. For more
information on our adoption of SFAS No. 123 and its effect on net income, see Note 1—Accounting
Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs an amendment of ARB No. 43,
Chapter 4.” This Statement requires that items, such as idle facility expense, excessive spoilage,
double freight, and re-handling costs, be recognized as current-period charges. We are required to
implement this Statement in the first quarter of 2006. We are analyzing the provisions of this
standard to determine the effects, if any, on our financial statements.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of Liabilities and Equity,” to address the balance sheet classification of certain
financial instruments that have characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The Statement,
already effective for contracts created or modified after May 31, 2003, was originally intended to
become effective July 1, 2003, for all contracts existing at May 31, 2003. However, on November 7,
2003, the FASB issued an indefinite deferral of certain provisions of SFAS No. 150. We continue to
monitor and assess the FASB’s modifications of SFAS No. 150, but do not anticipate any material
impact to our financial statements.

Emerging Issues

At a November 2004 meeting, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) discussed Issue No. 04-13,
“Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty,” which addresses
accounting issues that arise when one company both sells inventory to and buys inventory from
another company in the same line of business. This draft encompasses
our buy/sell transactions described in the Revenue
Recognition section of Note 1—Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. Depending on the EITF’s conclusions on this issue,
it is possible that we could have to decrease sales and other
operating revenues for 2004, 2003 and 2002 by $15,492 million,
$11,673 million and $4,371 million, respectively, with a
corresponding decrease in purchased crude oil, natural gas and
products on our consolidated income statement. We
believe any impact to our income from continuing operations and net
income would result from LIFO inventory and would not be material
to our financial statements. Additionally, these transactions have no
impact on reported volumes for the production of crude oil, natural
gas and natural gas liquids or refinery throughput and are not a
significant component of reported volumes for sales of petroleum
products.

The FASB is currently reviewing the accounting guidance provided in SFAS No. 19, “Financial
Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies,” relating to exploratory costs that
have



been capitalized, or “suspended,” on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether
potential economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered. For additional information, see Note
9—Properties, Plants and Equipment, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

In June 2004, the FASB published the Exposure Draft, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143.” This interpretation clarifies that an
entity is required to recognize a liability for a legal obligation to perform asset retirement
activities when the retirement is conditional on a future event if the liability’s fair value can
be reasonably estimated. If the liability’s fair value cannot be reasonably estimated, then the
entity must disclose (a) a description of the obligation, (b) the fact that a liability has not
been recognized because the fair value cannot be reasonably estimated, and (c) the reasons why the
fair value cannot be reasonably estimated. Depending on the FASB’s conclusions on this issue, it
is possible that we would need to reconsider our asset retirement obligations and related
disclosures for certain of our downstream assets (primarily refineries).

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note
1—Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for descriptions of our
major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and
uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different
amounts would have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been
used. These critical accounting policies are discussed with the Audit
and Finance Committee at least annually. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting policies, along with the
discussions of contingencies and of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in this report, address
all important accounting areas where the nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material
due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or
the susceptibility of such matters to change.

Oil and Gas Accounting

Accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rules that are
unique to the oil and gas industry. The acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic
information, prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to
accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition costs and
exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet, pending determination of whether
proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on the prospect.

Property Acquisition Costs

For individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for impairment based on
exploration and drilling efforts to date. For leasehold acquisition costs that individually are
relatively small, management exercises judgment and determines a percentage probability that the
prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold
information with others in the geographic area. For prospects in areas that have had limited, or
no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally
judged to be quite high. This judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition
cost, and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a
periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense. This judgmental
probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the
leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent
leaseholds, and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. By the end of
the contractual period of the leasehold, the impairment probability percentage will have been
adjusted to



100 percent if the leasehold is expected to be abandoned, or will have been adjusted to
zero percent if there is an oil or gas discovery that is under development. See the supplemental
Oil and Gas Operations disclosures about Costs Incurred and Capitalized Costs for more information
about the amounts and geographic locations of costs incurred in acquisition activity, and the amounts on the balance
sheet related to unproved properties. At year-end 2004, the book value of the pools of property
acquisition costs, that individually are relatively small and thus subject to the above-described
periodic leasehold impairment calculation, was approximately $604 million and the accumulated
impairment reserve was approximately $116 million. The weighted average judgmental percentage
probability of ultimate failure was approximately 69 percent and the weighted average amortization
period was approximately 2.7 years. If that judgmental percentage were to be raised by 5 percent
across all calculations, the pretax leasehold impairment expense in 2005, would increase by $11
million. The remaining $2,617 million of capitalized unproved property costs at year-end 2004
consisted of individually significant leaseholds, mineral rights held into perpetuity by title
ownership, exploratory wells currently drilling, and suspended exploratory wells, which management
periodically assesses for impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date on the
individual prospects. Of this amount, approximately $1.7 billion is concentrated in nine major
projects, of which management expects approximately $500 million to move to proved properties in
2005. See the following discussion of Exploratory Costs for more information on suspended
exploratory wells.

Exploratory Costs

For exploratory wells, drilling costs are temporarily capitalized, or “suspended,” on the balance
sheet, pending a determination of whether a sufficient quantity of potentially economic oil and gas
reserves have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify completion of the find as a
producing well.

Accounting rules require this judgment to be made within one year of well completion in areas not
requiring major infrastructure capital expenditures. If a judgment is made that the well did not
encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are expensed as a dry hole
and reported in exploration expense. If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic
quantities of oil and gas in areas where major infrastructure capital expenditures (e.g., a
pipeline or offshore platform) are required before production can begin, and the economic viability
of those capital expenditures depends upon the successful completion of further exploratory
drilling work in the area, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as
additional exploratory drilling work is under way or firmly planned. In these situations,
recoverable reserves are considered economic if the quantity found justifies completion of the find
as a producing well, without considering the major infrastructure capital expenditures that will
need to be made. Once all additional exploratory drilling and testing work has been completed, the
economic viability of the overall project, including any major infrastructure capital expenditures
that will need to be made, is evaluated within one year of the last exploratory well completion.
If economically viable, internal company approvals are obtained to move the project into the
development phase. Often, the ability to move the project into the development phase and record
proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the
timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long
as the company is actively pursuing such approvals and permits and believes they will be obtained.
Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the
development phase and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves. For complex
exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the
balance sheet for several years while we perform additional drilling work on the potential oil and
gas field, or we seek government or co-venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental
permitting.

Unlike leasehold acquisition costs, there is no periodic impairment assessment of suspended
exploratory well costs. Management continuously monitors the results of the additional appraisal
drilling and seismic work and expenses the suspended well costs as dry holes when it judges that
the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term.



Included in total suspended
well costs at year-end 2004 was $70 million related to eight exploratory wells in areas where major capital expenditures will be required and no further exploratory
drilling is planned, but for which we are actively pursuing those activities necessary to classify
the reserves as proved. These costs were suspended between 1999 and 2003. At year-end 2004, we
were awaiting government approval of the development plan for the Bohai Bay Phase II project in
China. Suspended well costs associated with this project represented $42 million of the $70
million total. This project was approved by the government in early 2005, which will allow us to
book proved reserves in 2005, at which time the suspended well costs will be reclassified as part
of the capitalized costs of the project. In addition, suspended amounts at year-end 2004 also
included $28 million related to projects where infrastructure decisions are dependent on
environmental permitting and production capacity, or where we are continuing to assess reserves and
their potential development. During 2004 and 2003, additions to suspended wells in areas where
major capital expenditures will be required and no further exploratory drilling is planned were $7
million and $22 million, respectively. Had these amounts been expensed, they would not have had a
material impact on our trend of exploration expenses or our financial statements. At year-end 2004
and 2003, we did not have any amounts suspended that were associated with areas not requiring major
capital expenditures before production could begin, where more than one year had elapsed since the
completion of drilling.

For additional information on suspended wells, see Note 9—Properties, Plants and Equipment, in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Proved Oil and Gas Reserves and Canadian Syncrude Reserves

Engineering estimates of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves in oil and gas fields
and in-place crude bitumen volumes in oil sand mining operations are inherently imprecise and
represent only approximate amounts because of the subjective judgments involved in developing such
information. Reserve estimates are based on subjective judgments involving geological and
engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production or mining plan, historical
extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and operating
approval limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the
quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and
processing the hydrocarbons. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates,
accounting rules require disclosure of “proved” reserve estimates due to the importance of these
estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a company’s exploration
and production (E&P) operations. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the
engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as “proved.” Our
reservoir engineering department has policies and procedures in place that are consistent with
these authoritative guidelines. We have qualified and experienced internal engineering personnel
who make these estimates for our E&P segment. Proved reserve estimates are updated annually and
take into account recent production and seismic information about each field or oil sand mining
operation. Also, as required by authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when a field
or oil sand mining operation will be permanently shutdown for economic reasons is based on an
extrapolation of sales prices and operating costs prevalent at the balance sheet date. This
estimated date when production will end affects the amount of estimated recoverable reserves.
Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also
changes. Year-end 2004 estimated reserves related to our LUKOIL Investment segment were based on
LUKOIL’s year-end 2003 oil and gas reserves. Because LUKOIL’s accounting cycle close and
preparation of U.S. GAAP financial statements occurs subsequent to our accounting cycle close, our
10 percent equity share of LUKOIL’s oil and gas proved reserves at year-end 2004 have been
estimated based on the prior year report without any provision for potential 2004 reserve additions
and include adjustments to conform to our reserve policy and provide for estimated 2004 production.
Any differences between the estimate and actual reserve computations will be recorded in a
subsequent period. This estimate-to-actual adjustment will then be a recurring component of future
period reserves.



The judgmental estimation of proved reserves also is important to the income statement because the
proved oil and gas reserve estimate for a field or the estimated in-place crude bitumen volume for
an oil sand mining operation serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of
depreciation, depletion and amortization of the capitalized costs for that asset. At year-end
2004, the net book value of productive E&P properties, plants and equipment subject to a
unit-of-production calculation, including our Canadian Syncrude bitumen oil sand assets, was
approximately $29.5 billion and the depreciation, depletion and amortization recorded on these
assets in 2004 was approximately $2.6 billion. The estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves
on these fields were 4.7 billion BOE at the beginning of 2004 and were 4.8
billion BOE at the end of 2004. The estimated proved reserves on the
Canadian Syncrude assets were 265 million barrels at the beginning of 2004 and were 258 million
barrels at the end of 2004. If the judgmental estimates of proved reserves used in the
unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax
depreciation, depletion and amortization in 2004 would have been increased by an estimated $174
million. Impairments of producing oil and gas properties in 2004, 2003 and 2002 totaled $67
million, $225 million and $49 million, respectively. Of these writedowns, only $52 million in
2004, $19 million in 2003 and $23 million in 2002 were due to downward revisions of proved
reserves. The remainder of the impairments resulted either from properties being designated as
held for sale or from the repeal of the Norway Removal Grant Act (1986) that increased asset
removal obligations.

Impairment of Assets

Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and
circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be
generated by an asset group. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows is
less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated
fair value. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment
of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the
cash flows of other groups of assets—generally on a field-by-field basis for exploration and
production assets, at an entire complex level for downstream assets, or at a site level for retail
stores. Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair
value usually is based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates
commensurate with the risks involved in the asset group. The expected future cash flows used for
impairment reviews and related fair-value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of
future production volumes, prices and costs, considering all available information at the date of
review. See Note 11—Property Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for
additional information.

Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs

Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we have material legal obligations to remove
tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operations at production sites.
Our largest asset removal obligations involve removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas
platforms around the world, and oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska. The
estimated discounted costs of dismantling and removing these facilities are accrued at the
installation of the asset. Estimating the future asset removal costs necessary for this accounting
calculation is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many years, or decades, in the
future and the contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what removal practices
and criteria must be met when the removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and
costs are changing constantly, as well as political, environmental, safety and public relations
considerations. See Note 1—Accounting Policies, Note 12—Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued
Environmental Costs, and Note 28—New Accounting Standards and Emerging Issues, in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.



Business Acquisitions

Purchase Price Allocation

Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the
various assets and liabilities of the acquired business. For most assets and liabilities, purchase
price allocation is accomplished by recording the asset or liability at its estimated fair value.
The most difficult estimations of individual fair values are those involving properties, plants and
equipment and identifiable intangible assets. We use all available information to make these fair
value determinations and, for major business acquisitions, typically engage an outside appraisal
firm to assist in the fair value determination of the acquired long-lived assets. We have, if
necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date to finish these fair value
determinations and finalize the purchase price allocation.

Intangible Assets and Goodwill

In connection with the acquisition of Tosco Corporation on September 14, 2001, and the merger of
Conoco and Phillips on August 30, 2002, we recorded material intangible assets for trademarks and
tradenames, air emission permit credits, and permits to operate refineries. These intangible
assets were determined to have indefinite useful lives and so are not amortized. This judgmental
assessment of an indefinite useful life has to be continuously evaluated in the future. If, due to
changes in facts and circumstances, management determines that these intangible assets then have
definite useful lives, amortization will have to commence at that time on a prospective basis. As
long as these intangible assets are judged to have indefinite lives, they will be subject to
periodic lower-of-cost-or-market tests, which requires management’s judgment of the estimated fair
value of these intangible assets. See Note 3—Merger of Conoco and Phillips, and Note 11—Property
Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.

Also in connection with the acquisition of Tosco and the merger of Conoco and Phillips, we recorded
a material amount of goodwill. Under the accounting rules for goodwill, this intangible asset is
not amortized. Instead, goodwill is subject to annual reviews for impairment based on a two-step
accounting test. The first step is to compare the estimated fair value of any reporting units
within the company that have recorded goodwill with the recorded net book value (including the
goodwill) of the reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is higher than
the recorded net book value, no impairment is deemed to exist and no further testing is required
that year. If, however, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the recorded net
book value, then a second step must be performed to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment
to record, if any. In this second step, the estimated fair value from the first step is used as
the purchase price in a hypothetical new acquisition of the reporting unit. The various purchase
business combination rules are followed to determine a hypothetical purchase price allocation for
the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities. The residual amount of goodwill that results from
this hypothetical purchase price allocation is compared with the recorded amount of goodwill for
the reporting unit, and the recorded amount is written down to the hypothetical amount if lower.
The reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined
primarily from the manner in which the business is managed. A reporting unit is an operating
segment or a component that is one level below an operating segment. A component is a reporting
unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available
and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. However, two or
more components of an operating segment shall be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if
the components have similar economic characteristics. Within our Exploration and Production
segment and our Refining and Marketing segment, we determined that we have one and two reporting
units, respectively, for purposes of assigning goodwill and testing for impairment. These are
Worldwide Exploration and Production, Worldwide Refining and Worldwide Marketing. Our Midstream,
Chemicals and Emerging Businesses operating segments were not assigned any goodwill from the merger
because the two predecessor companies’ operations did not overlap in these



operating segments so we were unable to capture significant synergies and strategic advantages from
the merger in these areas.

In our Exploration and Production operating segment, management reporting is primarily organized
based on geographic areas. All of these geographic areas have similar business processes,
distribution networks and customers, and are supported by a worldwide exploration team and shared
services organizations. Therefore, all components have been aggregated into one reporting unit,
Worldwide Exploration and Production, which is the same as the operating segment. In contrast, in
our Refining and Marketing operating segment, management reporting is primarily organized based on
functional areas. Because the two broad functional areas of Refining and Marketing have dissimilar
business processes and customers, we concluded that it would not be appropriate to aggregate these
components into only one reporting unit at the Refining and Marketing operating segment level.
Instead, we identified two reporting units within the operating segment: Worldwide Refining and
Worldwide Marketing. Components in those two reporting units have similar business processes,
distribution networks and customers. If we later reorganize our businesses or management structure
so that the components within these three reporting units are no longer economically similar, the
reporting units would be revised and goodwill would be re-assigned using a relative fair value
approach in accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” Goodwill
impairment testing at a lower reporting unit level could result in the recognition of impairment
that would not otherwise be recognized at the current higher level of aggregation. In addition,
the sale or disposition of a portion of these three reporting units will be allocated a portion of
the reporting unit’s goodwill, based on relative fair values, which will adjust the amount of gain
or loss on the sale or disposition.

Because quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available, management must apply
judgment in determining the estimated fair value of these reporting units for purposes of
performing the first step of the periodic goodwill impairment test. Management uses all available
information to make these fair value determinations, including the present values of expected
future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the assets and
observed market multiples of operating cash flows and net income, and may engage an outside
appraisal firm for assistance. In addition, if the first test step is not met, further judgment
must be applied in determining the fair values of individual assets and liabilities for purposes of
the hypothetical purchase price allocation. Again, management must use all available information
to make these fair value determinations and may engage an outside appraisal firm for assistance.
At year-end 2004, the estimated fair values of our Worldwide Exploration and Production, Worldwide
Refining, and Worldwide Marketing reporting units ranged from between 18 percent to 59 percent
higher than recorded net book values (including goodwill) of the reporting units. However, a lower
fair value estimate in the future for any of these reporting units could result in impairment of
the $15.0 billion of goodwill.

Use of Equity Method Accounting for Investment in LUKOIL

In October 2004, we purchased 7.6 percent of the outstanding ordinary shares of LUKOIL from the
Russian government. During the remainder of 2004, we purchased additional shares of LUKOIL on the
open market and reached an ownership level of 10 percent in LUKOIL by the end of 2004. On January
24, 2005, LUKOIL held an extraordinary general meeting of stockholders at which our nominee to the
LUKOIL Board of Directors was elected under the cumulative voting rules in Russia, and certain
amendments to LUKOIL’s charter were approved which provide protections to preserve the significant
influence of major stockholders in LUKOIL, such as ConocoPhillips. In addition, during the first
quarter of 2005, the two companies began the secondment of managerial personnel between the two
companies. Significant progress is also being made on advancing the major oil and gas joint
venture between the two companies in the Timan-Pechora region of
northern Russia, over which we expect to have joint control with LUKOIL.



Based on the overall facts and circumstances surrounding our investment in LUKOIL, we concluded
that we have significant influence over the operating and financial policies of LUKOIL and thus
applied the equity method of accounting in the fourth quarter of 2004. Determination of whether
one company has significant influence over another, the criterion required by APB Opinion No. 18,
“The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock,” in order to use equity method
accounting, is a judgmental accounting decision based on the overall facts and circumstances of
each situation. Under the equity method of accounting, we estimate and record our weighted-average
ownership share of LUKOIL’s net income (determined in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP)) each period as equity earnings on our income
statement, with a corresponding increase in our recorded investment in LUKOIL. Cash dividends
received from LUKOIL each period reduce our recorded investment in LUKOIL. The use of
equity-method accounting also requires us to supplementally report our ownership share of LUKOIL’s
oil and gas disclosures in our report.

If future facts and circumstances were to change to where we no longer believe we have significant
influence over LUKOIL’s operating and financial policies, we would have to change our accounting
classification for the investment to an available-for-sale equity security under SFAS No. 115,
“Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.” If that unlikely event were to
occur, our investment in LUKOIL would be marked to market each period, based on LUKOIL’s publicly
traded share price, with the offset recorded as a component of other comprehensive income.
Additionally, we would no longer record our ownership share of LUKOIL’s net income each period and
any cash dividends received would be reported as dividend income when declared by LUKOIL. We also
would no longer be able to supplementally report our ownership share of LUKOIL’s oil and gas
disclosures.

During the fourth quarter of 2004, we recorded $74 million of equity-method earnings from our 8.6
percent weighted-average ownership level in LUKOIL during the quarter and as of December 31, 2004,
supplementally reported an estimated 770 million barrels of crude oil and 661 billion cubic feet of
natural gas proved reserves from our ownership level of 10 percent at year-end 2004. Because
LUKOIL’s accounting cycle close and preparation of U.S. GAAP financial statements occurs subsequent
to our accounting cycle close, we have used all available information to estimate LUKOIL’s U.S.
GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2004 for purposes of our equity-method accounting. Any
differences between our estimate and the actual LUKOIL U.S. GAAP net income will be recorded in
2005 equity earnings. In addition, we used all available information to estimate our share of
LUKOIL’s oil and gas disclosures. If, instead of equity-method accounting, we had been required to
follow the requirements of SFAS No. 115 for our investment in LUKOIL, the mark-to-market adjustment
to reflect LUKOIL’s publicly-traded share price at year-end 2004 would have been a pretax charge
against other comprehensive income of approximately $17 million. Also, $19 million of acquisition
related costs would have been expensed and $74 million of equity earnings would not have been
recorded.

At the end of 2004, our cost of investment in LUKOIL shares exceeds our 10 percent share of
LUKOIL’s historical U.S. GAAP balance sheet equity by an estimated $659 million. Under the
accounting guidelines of APB Opinion No. 18, the basis difference between the cost of our
investment and the amount of underlying equity in the historical net assets of LUKOIL is accounted
for as if LUKOIL were a consolidated subsidiary. In other words, a hypothetical purchase price
allocation is performed to determine how LUKOIL assets and liabilities would have been adjusted in
a hypothetical push-down accounting exercise to reflect the actual cost of our investment in
LUKOIL’s shares. Once these hypothetical push-down adjustments have been identified, the nature of
the hypothetically adjusted assets or liabilities determines the future amortization pattern for
the basis difference. We have up to one year after a stock purchase to finalize this hypothetical
purchase price allocation, but have preliminarily decided to associate the basis difference
primarily with LUKOIL’s developed property, plant and equipment base. The earnings we recorded for
our LUKOIL investment in the fourth quarter of 2004 thus included a reduction



for the amortization of this basis difference. When finalizing this preliminary purchase price
allocation in 2005, we will use all available information to make this estimate.

Inventory Valuation

Our LIFO cost inventories are sensitive to lower-of-cost-or-market impairment write-downs, whenever
price levels fall. While crude oil is not the only product in the company’s LIFO pools, its market
value is a major factor in lower-of-cost-or-market calculations. We estimate that impairments
could occur if a 70 percent/30 percent blended average of West Texas Intermediate/Brent crude oil
prices falls below $20.80 per barrel at a reporting date. The determination of replacement cost
values for the lower-of-cost-or-market test uses objective evidence, but does involve judgment in
determining the most appropriate objective evidence to use in the calculations.

Projected Benefit Obligations

Determination of the projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and
postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance
sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement. This also impacts the required
company contributions into the plans. The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations
and company contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events, including
estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality rates, lump-sum election rates,
rates of return on plan assets, future health care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of
health care services by retirees. Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage
outside actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligations. For
Employee Retirement Income Security Act-qualified pension plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary
care on behalf of plan participants in the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in
determining required company contributions into plan assets. Due to differing objectives and
requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan funding regulations
promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods and assumptions for the two purposes
differ in certain important respects. Ultimately, we will be required to fund all promised
benefits under pension and postretirement benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment
returns, but the judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect
periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Benefit expense is particularly
sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets assumptions. A 1 percent decrease in the
discount rate would increase annual benefit expense by $105 million, while a 1 percent decrease in
the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by $35 million.

OUTLOOK

E&P’s production for 2005 is expected to be approximately 4 percent higher than the level achieved
in 2004. This projection excludes the impact of our equity investment in LUKOIL. For 2005,
production increases in Asia Pacific, South America and the United States are expected to offset
net declines in the North Sea.

In R&M, the optimization of spending related to clean fuels project initiatives will be an
important focus area during 2005. We expect our average refinery crude oil utilization rate for
2005 to average in the upper nineties. This projection excludes the impact of our equity
investment in LUKOIL.

In January 2005, the Governor of Alaska announced that effective February 1, 2005, most satellite
fields surrounding the Prudhoe Bay field would no longer qualify for a state production tax
incentive that was intended to encourage development of marginal deposits. Beginning in February,
these satellite fields bear the same production tax rate as Prudhoe Bay. This administrative
change is anticipated to increase our production tax obligations by approximately $40 million in
2005.



In the first quarter of 2004, in regards to our Magnolia project in the Gulf of Mexico and on
behalf of the Garden Banks 783/784 unit, we filed an application for royalty relief with the
Minerals Management Service (MMS). Royalty relief may be granted if the value of the project using
the MMS economic model and criteria is insufficient to recover the project investment without the
relief. There is no assurance that such relief will be granted.

In February 2003, the Venezuelan government implemented a currency exchange control regime. The
government has published legal instruments supporting the controls, one of which establishes
official exchange rates for the U.S. dollar. The devaluation of the Venezuelan currency by
approximately 17 percent in February 2004 did not have a significant impact on our Venezuelan
operations; however, future changes in the exchange rate could have a significant impact on our
Venezuelan operations.

In Libya, we are participating in discussions with our co-venturers and Libyan authorities
regarding terms in connection with our anticipated re-entry into that country.

In the second quarter of 2004, Norwegian authorities ordered us to modify our facilities at two
Ekofisk Area installations—Ekofisk and Eldfisk—and had initially given us until October 1, 2004, to
submit a binding plan for implementing measures to ensure workers are not disturbed by noise from
other sleeping workers while they are resting. The Norwegian
Petroleum Safety Authority contended
we were not in compliance with regulatory requirements for rest and restitution on the installations
where there are shared sleeping quarters. We appealed this order and the response deadline was
deferred by the Norwegian authorities to December 31, 2004. Concurrently, the Petroleum Safety
Authority put the appeal on hold pending further meetings and a letter describing plans that will
ensure necessary restitution and rest. On February 3, 2005, we received an official note from the
Petroleum Safety Authority stating that our letter of December 28, 2004, presented plans that will
meet the intention of their order. Consequently, our appeal will not need to be processed further,
and the case is closed.

The Mackenzie gas project involves natural gas production facilities for three anchor fields,
including the Parsons Lake field operated by us; compression and gathering pipelines in the
Mackenzie Delta area; and a pipeline system in the Mackenzie River Valley. In September 2004, the
National Energy Board in Canada confirmed the Commercial Discovery Declaration (CDD) for the
Parsons Lake field. The CDD meets our development planning expectations, which is an important
milestone in the regulatory approval process toward obtaining a production license. The main
regulatory applications were filed in October 2004, triggering the start of the formal
environmental and regulatory review process. This filing sets the stage for regulatory hearings in
2005, leading toward a regulatory decision in 2006. First gas production is currently targeted to
commence in the 2009 timeframe.

In early July 2004, we announced the finalization of our transaction with Freeport LNG Development,
L.P. (Freeport LNG) to participate in a proposed LNG receiving terminal in Quintana, Texas.
Freeport LNG received conditional approval in June 2004 from the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) to construct and operate the facility and received final approval from the FERC
in January 2005. Construction began in early 2005, and commercial startup is expected in 2008. We
do not have any limited partner ownership interest in the facility, but we do have a 50 percent
interest in the general partnership managing the venture. In addition, we have contractual rights
to two-thirds of the LNG regasification capacity in the facility, or 1 billion cubic feet per day.
We entered into a credit agreement with Freeport LNG, whereby we will provide loan financing of
approximately $600 million for the construction of the facility.



We are pursuing three other proposed LNG regasification terminals. The Beacon Port Terminal would be
located in federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico, 56 miles south of the Louisiana mainland. Also in
the Gulf of Mexico is the proposed Compass Port Terminal, to be located approximately 11 miles
offshore Alabama. The third proposed facility would be a joint venture located in
the Port of Long Beach, California. Each of these projects are in the initial regulatory
permitting process.

In July 2003, we signed a Heads of Agreement with Qatar Petroleum for the development of Qatargas
3, a large-scale LNG project located in Qatar and servicing the U.S. natural gas market. This
provides the framework for the necessary agreements and the completion of key feasibility studies,
both of which were advanced in 2004. Qatargas 3 would be an integrated project, jointly owned by
Qatar Petroleum and us, consisting of facilities to produce and liquefy gas from Qatar’s North
field. The LNG would be shipped from Qatar, and we would be responsible for regasification and
marketing within the United States. Average daily gas sales volumes are projected to be
approximately 1 billion cubic feet per day with startup anticipated in the 2009 timeframe.

In late October 2003, we signed a Heads of Agreement with the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation, ENI and ChevronTexaco to conduct front-end engineering and design (FEED) work for an
LNG facility to be constructed in Nigeria’s central Niger Delta. The participants formed an
incorporated joint venture, Brass LNG Limited, to undertake the project. The FEED contract was
awarded to Bechtel in the fourth quarter 2004. These engineering and design studies are expected
to be completed in 2006. The LNG facility is targeted to be operational in 2010.

In December 2003, we signed a Statement of Intent with Qatar Petroleum regarding the construction
of a gas-to-liquids plant in Ras Laffan, Qatar. The Statement of Intent initiates technical and
commercial pre-FEED studies and establishes principles for negotiating a Heads of Agreement for an
integrated reservoir-to-market plant. Negotiations on more definitive agreements and progress on
the studies continue in 2005.

On February 24, 2005, ConocoPhillips and Duke Energy Corporation (Duke) agreed to terms to
restructure their respective ownership levels in DEFS, which would cause DEFS to become a jointly
controlled venture, owned 50 percent by each company. This restructuring has been approved by the
Boards of Directors of both owners. We will increase our current 30.3 percent ownership in DEFS to
50 percent through a series of direct and indirect transfers of Midstream assets from
ConocoPhillips to Duke, a disproportionate cash distribution to Duke from the sale of DEFS’ general
partner interest in TEPPCO Partners, L.P., and a final cash payment to Duke of approximately $200
million, which we expect to fund from our general liquidity resources.

We anticipate recording our equity share of the financial gain from DEFS’ sale of the general
partner interest in TEPPCO in the first quarter of 2005. The restructuring is expected to have the
effect of significantly reducing the favorable basis difference in our investment in DEFS which, in
turn, will significantly reduce the basis difference amortization reported in equity method
earnings (see Note 8—Investments and Long-Term Receivables for more information on our basis
difference in the DEFS investment). We anticipate that this reduction in basis difference
amortization and the loss of earnings from the transfer of certain of our Midstream assets to Duke
and DEFS will be approximately offset by our increased 50 percent share of the remaining DEFS
earnings going forward.

The restructuring is expected to close in the second quarter of 2005, subject to normal regulatory
approvals. Once completed, our Midstream segment will consist primarily of our 50 percent equity
method interest in DEFS.

Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Financial Instrument Market Risk

We and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments
that expose cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates or
interest rates. We may use financial and commodity-based derivative contracts to manage the risks
produced by changes in the prices of electric power, natural gas, crude oil and related products,
fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, or to exploit market
opportunities.

Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an “Authority Limitations” document approved by
our Board that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without
sufficient liquidity for comparable valuations without approval from the Chief Executive Officer.
The Authority Limitations document also authorizes the Chief Executive Officer to establish the
maximum Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company and compliance with these limits is monitored
daily. The Chief Financial Officer monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates
and interest rates, while the Executive Vice President of Commercial monitors commodity price risk.
Both report to the Chief Executive Officer. The Commercial
organization manages our commercial
marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, monitors related risks of our upstream and
downstream businesses, and selectively takes price risk to add value.

Commodity Price Risk

We operate in the worldwide crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, and
electric power markets and are exposed to fluctuations in the prices for these commodities. These
fluctuations can affect our revenues, as well as the cost of operating, investing, and financing
activities. Generally, our policy is to remain exposed to market prices of commodities; however,
executive management may elect to use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk of our crude
oil and natural gas production, as well as refinery margins.

Our Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps, and options in various markets to optimize the
value of our supply chain, which may move our risk profile away from market average prices to
accomplish the following objectives:

•

Balance physical systems. In addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration,
exchange traded futures contracts also may be settled by physical delivery of the
commodity, providing another source of supply to meet our refinery requirements or
marketing demand.

•

Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market
prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed-price sales contracts, which are often
requested by natural gas and refined product consumers, to a floating market price.

•

Manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil, natural
gas, refined product and electric power transactions.

•

Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from these activities to do a limited
amount of trading not directly related to our physical business. For the 12 months ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003, the gains or losses from this activity were not material to our
cash flows or income from continuing operations.



We use a VaR model to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single day
from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative financial instruments and
derivative commodity instruments held or issued, including commodity purchase and sales contracts
recorded on the balance sheet at December 31, 2004, as derivative instruments in accordance with
SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended. Using
Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, the VaR for
those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at December 31, 2004 and 2003, was immaterial
to our net income and cash flows. The VaR for instruments held for purposes other than trading at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, was also immaterial to our net income and cash flows.

Interest Rate Risk

The following tables provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to
changes in interest rates. The debt tables present principal cash flows and related
weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates; the derivative table shows the notional
quantities on which the cash flows will be calculated by swap termination date. Weighted-average
variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date. The
carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of the
fixed-rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market prices.

During the fourth quarter of 2003, we executed certain interest rate swaps that had the effect of
converting $1.5 billion of debt from fixed to floating rate. Under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” these swaps were designated as hedging the exposure
to changes in the fair value of $400 million of 3.625% Notes due 2007, $750 million of 6.35% Notes
due 2009, and $350 million of 4.75% Notes due 2012. These swaps qualify for the shortcut method of
hedge accounting, so over the term of the swaps we will not recognize gain or loss due to
ineffectiveness in the hedge.

Foreign Currency Risk

We have foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from operations in over 40 countries around
the world. We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency rate changes, although we may
choose to selectively hedge exposures to foreign currency rate risk. Examples include firm
commitments for capital projects, certain local currency tax payments and dividends, and cash
returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year.

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, we held foreign currency swaps hedging short-term intercompany loans
between European subsidiaries and a U.S. subsidiary. Although these swaps hedge exposures to
fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting as allowed by SFAS No.
133. As a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign currency swaps is recorded
directly in earnings. Since the gain or loss on the swaps is offset by the gain or loss from
remeasuring the intercompany loans into the functional currency of the lender or borrower, there
would be no impact to income from an adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the December 31,
2004 or 2003, exchange rates. The notional and fair market values of these positions at December
31, 2004 and 2003, were as follows:

Report of Management

Management prepared, and is responsible for, the consolidated financial statements and the other
information appearing in this annual report. The consolidated financial statements present fairly
the company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In preparing its consolidated
financial statements, the company includes amounts that are based on estimates and judgments that
management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The company’s financial statements
have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm appointed
by the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors and ratified by stockholders.
Management has made available to Ernst & Young LLP all of the company’s financial records and
related data, as well as the minutes of stockholders’ and directors’ meetings.

Assessment of Internal
Control over Financial Reporting

Management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting. ConocoPhillips’ internal control system was designed to provide reasonable
assurance to the company’s management and directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation
of published financial statements.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.
Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with
respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2004. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

.
Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2004, the company’s internal control
over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

Ernst & Young LLP has
issued an audit report on our
assessment of the company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Consolidated Financial Statements

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

ConocoPhillips

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ConocoPhillips as of December 31,
2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in common stockholders’
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004. Our
audits also included the condensed consolidating financial information and financial statement
schedule listed in the Index at Item 8. These financial statements, condensed consolidating
financial information and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements, condensed consolidating
financial information and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of ConocoPhillips at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and
the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Also, in our opinion, the related condensed consolidating financial information and financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
present fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2003 ConocoPhillips adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations,” SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” and Financial Accounting
Standards Board Interpretation No. 46(R), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.”

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the effectiveness of ConocoPhillips’ internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report dated February 25, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

ConocoPhillips

We have audited
management’s assessment, included under the heading
“Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting” in the accompanying “Report of Management,” that
ConocoPhillips maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
ConocoPhillips’ management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that ConocoPhillips maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based
on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, ConocoPhillips maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the
COSO criteria.



We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the 2004 consolidated financial statements of ConocoPhillips and our report
dated February 25, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

ConocoPhillips

Note 1—Accounting Policies



have the same general terms and conditions as typical commercial contracts including:
separate title transfer, transfer of risk of loss, separate gross billing and cash settlement
for both the buy and sell sides of the transaction, and non-performance by one party does not
relieve the other party of its obligation to perform (except in events of force majeure). We
account for such transactions at fair value based on the guidance contained in the following:

Depending on the EITF’s conclusions on this issue, it is possible that we could have to
decrease sales and other operating revenues for 2004, 2003 and 2002
by $15,492 million, $11,673
million and $4,371 million, respectively, with a corresponding decrease in purchased crude oil,
natural gas and products on our consolidated income statement. We believe any impact to our
income from continuing operations and net income would result from LIFO inventory and would
not be material to our financial statements.

Our Commercial organization uses commodity derivative contracts (such as futures and options) in
various markets to optimize the value of our supply chain and balance physical systems. In
addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration, exchange-traded futures contracts may
also be settled by physical delivery of the commodity, providing another source of supply to
meet our refinery requirements or marketing demand. See Note 1—Accounting Policies—Derivative
Instruments, for additional information on our accounting for, and reporting of, commodity
derivative contracts.

Revenues from the production of natural gas properties, in which we have an interest with other
producers, are recognized based on the actual volumes we sold during the period. Any
differences between volumes sold and entitlement volumes, based on our net working interest,
which are deemed to be non-recoverable through remaining production, are recognized as accounts
receivable or accounts payable, as appropriate. Cumulative differences between volumes sold
and entitlement volumes are generally not significant. Revenues associated with royalty fees
from licensed technology are recorded based either upon volumes produced by the licensee or
upon the successful completion of all substantive performance requirements related to the
installation of licensed technology.

n

Shipping and Handling Costs—

Our Exploration and Production
segment includes shipping and handling costs in production
and operating expenses, while the Refining and Marketing
segment records shipping and handling costs in purchased
crude oil, natural gas and products. Freight costs billed to
customers are recorded as a component of revenue.



Property Acquisition Costs—

Oil and gas leasehold acquisition costs are capitalized and
included in the balance sheet caption properties, plants and equipment. Leasehold
impairment is recognized based on exploratory experience and management’s judgment. Upon
discovery of commercial reserves, leasehold costs are transferred to proved properties.

Exploratory Costs—

Geological and geophysical costs and the costs of carrying and retaining
undeveloped properties are expensed as incurred. Exploratory well costs are capitalized
pending further evaluation of whether economically recoverable reserves have been found of a
sufficient quantity to justify completion of the find as a producing well. If economically
recoverable reserves are not found, exploratory well costs are expensed as dry holes.
Exploratory wells in



areas not requiring major capital expenditures are evaluated for economic viability within
one year of well completion. This determination of the success of drilling results
corresponds with the time period of reporting proved oil and gas reserves for the find.
Exploratory wells that discover economic reserves that are in areas where a major
infrastructure capital expenditure (e.g., a pipeline or offshore platform) would be required
before production could begin, and where the economic viability of that major capital
expenditure depends upon the successful completion of further exploratory drilling work in
the area, remain capitalized as long as the additional exploratory drilling work is under
way or firmly planned. In these situations, the well is considered to have found economic
reserves if recoverable reserves have been found of a sufficient quantity to justify
completion of the find as a producing well, assuming that the major infrastructure capital
expenditure had already been made. Once all additional exploratory drilling and testing
work has been completed on projects requiring major infrastructure capital expenditures, the
economic viability of the overall project is evaluated within one year of the last
exploratory well completion. If considered to be economically viable, internal company
approvals are then obtained to move the project into the development stage. Often, the
ability to move the project into the development phase and record proved reserves is
dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the timing of which
is ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as the
company is actively pursuing such approvals and permits, and believes they will be obtained.
Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into
development stage, which corresponds with the time period of reporting proved oil and gas
reserves for the find. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have
exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while we perform
additional drilling work on the potential oil and gas field, or we seek government or
co-venturer approval of development plans or seek environmental permitting.

Unlike leasehold acquisition costs, there is no periodic impairment assessment of suspended
exploratory well costs. Management continuously monitors the results of the additional
appraisal drilling and seismic work and expenses the suspended well costs as dry holes when
it judges that the potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term.

See Note 9—Properties, Plants and Equipment, for additional information on suspended wells.

Development Costs—

Costs incurred to drill and equip development wells, including
unsuccessful development wells, are capitalized.

Depletion and Amortization—

Leasehold costs of producing properties are depleted using the
unit-of-production method based on estimated proved oil and gas reserves. Amortization of
intangible development costs is based on the unit-of-production method using estimated
proved developed oil and gas reserves.

n

Syncrude Mining Operations—

Capitalized costs, including support facilities, include the
cost of the acquisition and other capital costs incurred. Capital costs are depreciated using
the unit-of-production method based on the applicable portion of proven reserves associated
with each mine location and its facilities.

n

Capitalized Interest—

Interest from external borrowings is capitalized on major projects
with an expected construction period of one year or longer. Capitalized interest is added to
the cost of the underlying asset and is amortized over the useful lives of the assets in the
same manner as the underlying assets.



n

Intangible Assets Other Than Goodwill—

Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are
amortized by the straight-line method over their useful lives. Intangible assets that have
indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment.
Each reporting period, we evaluate the remaining useful lives of intangible assets not being
amortized to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support indefinite useful
lives. Intangible assets are considered impaired if the fair value of the intangible asset is
lower than cost. The fair value of intangible assets is determined based on quoted market
prices in active markets, if available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value
of intangible assets is determined based upon the present values of expected future cash flows
using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the asset, or upon estimated
replacement cost, if expected future cash flows from the intangible asset are not determinable.

n

Goodwill—

Goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually
for impairment. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less
than the recorded book value of the reporting unit’s assets
(including goodwill), less liabilities, then a hypothetical
purchase price allocation is performed on the reporting unit’s
assets and liabilities using the fair value of the reporting unit
as the purchase price in the calculation. If the amount of
goodwill resulting from this hypothetical purchase price
allocation is less than the recorded amount of goodwill, the
recorded goodwill is written down to the new amount. For purposes
of goodwill impairment calculations, reporting units within our
Exploration and Production segment and our Refining and Marketing
segment have been determined to be Worldwide Exploration and
Production, Worldwide Refining and Worldwide Marketing. Because
quoted market prices are not available for the company’s reporting
units, the fair value of the reporting units is determined based
upon consideration of several factors, including the present
values of expected future cash flows using discount rates
commensurate with the risks involved in the operations and
observed market multiples of operating cash flows and net income.

n

Depreciation and Amortization—

Depreciation and amortization of
properties, plants and equipment on producing oil and gas
properties, certain pipeline assets (those which are expected to
have a declining utilization pattern), and on Syncrude mining
operations are determined by the unit-of-production method.
Depreciation and amortization of all other properties, plants and
equipment are determined by either the
individual-unit-straight-line method or the group-straight-line
method (for those individual units that are highly integrated with
other units).

n

Impairment of Properties, Plants and Equipment—

Properties, plants
and equipment used in operations are assessed for impairment
whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible
significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be
generated by an asset group. If, upon review, the sum of the
undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of
the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated
fair value through additional amortization or depreciation
provisions and reported as Property Impairments in the periods in
which the determination of impairment is made. Individual assets
are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which
there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of
the cash flows of other groups of assets—generally on a
field-by-field basis for exploration and production assets, at an
entire complex level for refining assets or at a site level for
retail stores. The fair value of impaired
assets is determined based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available, or upon the
present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks
involved in the asset group. Long-lived assets committed by management for disposal within one
year are accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or fair value, less cost to sell.





n

Guarantees—

The fair value of a guarantee is determined and recorded as a liability at the time
the guarantee is given. The initial liability is subsequently reduced as we are released from
exposure under the guarantee. We amortize the guarantee liability over the relevant time
period, if one exists, based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each type of guarantee.
In cases where the guarantee term is indefinite, we reverse the liability when we have
information that the liability is essentially relieved or amortize it over an appropriate time
period as the fair value of our guarantee exposure declines over time. We amortize the
guarantee liability to the related income statement line item based on the nature of the
guarantee. When it becomes probable that we will have to perform on a guarantee, we accrue a
separate liability, if it is reasonably estimable, based on the facts and circumstances at that
time.

n

Stock-Based Compensation—

Effective January 1, 2003, we voluntarily adopted the fair-value
accounting method prescribed by SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” We
used the prospective transition method, applying the fair-value accounting method and
recognizing compensation expense equal to the fair-market value on the grant date for all
stock options granted or modified after December 31, 2002.

Employee stock options granted prior to 2003 continue to be accounted for under APB Opinion No.
25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related Interpretations. Because the
exercise price of our employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on
the date of grant, no compensation expense is generally recognized under APB Opinion No. 25.
The following table displays pro forma information as if the provisions of SFAS No. 123 had
been applied to all employee stock options granted:

Income Taxes—

Deferred income taxes are computed using the liability method and are provided

assets and liabilities, except for deferred taxes on income considered to be permanently
reinvested in certain foreign subsidiaries and foreign corporate joint ventures. Allowable
tax credits are applied currently as reductions of the provision for income taxes.



n

Net Income Per Share of Common Stock—

Basic income per share of common stock is calculated based
upon the daily weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year, including
unallocated shares held by the stock savings feature of the ConocoPhillips Savings Plan.
Diluted income per share of common stock includes the above, plus “in-the-money” stock options
issued under our compensation plans. Treasury stock and shares held by the Compensation and
Benefits Trust are excluded from the daily weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
in both calculations.

n

Accounting for Sales of Stock by Subsidiary or Equity Investees—

We recognize a gain or loss
upon the direct sale of equity by our subsidiaries or equity investees if the sales price
differs from our carrying amount, and provided that the sale of such equity is not part of a
broader corporate reorganization.

Note 2—Changes in Accounting Principles

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,”
which applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement and removal of long-lived assets.
SFAS No. 143 requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement
obligation when it is incurred (typically when the asset is installed at the production location).
When the liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost by increasing the
carrying amount of the related properties, plants and equipment. Over time, the liability
increases for the change in its present value, while the capitalized cost depreciates over the
useful life of the related asset.

Application of this new accounting principle resulted in an initial increase in net properties,
plants and equipment of $1.2 billion and an asset retirement obligation liability increase of $1.1
billion. The cumulative effect of the change increased 2003 net income by $145 million (after
reduction of income taxes of $21 million). Excluding the cumulative-effect benefit, application of
the new accounting principle increased income from continuing operations and net income for 2003 by
$32 million, or $.05 per basic and diluted share, compared with the previous accounting method.

We have numerous asset removal obligations that we are required to perform under law or contract
once an asset is permanently taken out of service. Most of these obligations are not expected to
be paid until several years, or decades, in the future and will be funded from general company
resources at the time of removal. Our largest individual obligations are related to fixed-base
offshore production platforms around the world and to production facilities and pipelines in
Alaska.

SFAS No. 143 calls for measurements of asset retirement obligations to include, as a component of
expected costs, an estimate of the price that a third party would demand, and could expect to
receive, for bearing the uncertainties and unforeseeable circumstances inherent in the obligations,
sometimes referred to as a market-risk premium. To date, the oil and gas industry has no examples
of credit-worthy third parties who are willing to assume this type of risk, for a determinable
price, on major oil and gas production facilities and pipelines. Therefore, because determining
such a market-risk premium would be an arbitrary process, we excluded it from our SFAS No. 143
estimates.



During 2004 and 2003, our overall asset retirement obligation changed as follows:

No. 143.

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

During 2003, the FASB issued and then revised Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities,” (FIN 46(R)) to expand existing accounting guidance about when a
company should include in its consolidated financial statements the assets, liabilities and
activities of another entity. Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted FIN 46(R), which causes us to
consolidate all variable interest entities (VIEs) where we conclude we are the primary beneficiary.
In addition, we deconsolidated one entity in 2003 where we determined that we were not the primary
beneficiary.

In general, a VIE is any legal structure used for business purposes that either (a) has an
insufficient amount of equity to carry out its principal activities without additional subordinated
financial support, (b) has a group of equity owners that are unable to make significant decisions
about its activities, or (c) has a group of equity owners that do not have the obligation to absorb
losses or the right to receive returns generated by its operations. FIN 46(R) requires a VIE to be
consolidated by a company if that company is obligated to absorb a majority of the risk of loss
from the VIE’s activities, is entitled to receive a majority of the VIE’s residual returns, or both
(the company required to consolidate is called the primary beneficiary). It also requires
deconsolidation of a VIE if a company is not the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The
interpretation also requires disclosures about VIEs that a company does not consolidate, but in
which it has a significant variable interest, and about any potential VIE when a company is unable
to obtain the information necessary to confirm if an entity is a VIE or determine if a company is
the primary beneficiary.



In February 2003, we entered into two agreements establishing separate guarantee facilities of
$50 million each for two liquefied natural gas ships that were then under construction. Subject to
the terms of each facility, we will be required to make payments should the charter revenue
generated by the respective ship fall below certain specified minimum thresholds, and we will
receive payments to the extent that such revenues exceed those thresholds. The net maximum future
payments over the 20-year terms of the two agreements could be up to an aggregate of $100 million.
Actual gross payments over the 20 years could exceed that amount to the extent cash is received by
us. In September 2003, the first ship was delivered to its owner and the second ship is scheduled
for delivery to its owner in mid-2005. At December 31, 2003, we reported these two entities could
potentially be VIEs, but that we had been unable to obtain sufficient information to confirm that
the entities were VIEs or to determine if we were the primary beneficiary. In the first quarter of
2004, we received the required information related to the entity associated with the first ship and
determined that it was a VIE; however, because we are not the primary beneficiary we did not
consolidate the entity. In regard to the first ship, the amount drawn under the guarantee facility
at December 31, 2004, was less than $1 million. With regard to the second ship, we expect to have
a variable interest in the associated entity once the ship is delivered to its owner in mid-2005.
At that time, we will determine if the entity is a VIE, and if we are the primary beneficiary. We
currently account for these agreements as guarantees and contingent liabilities. See Note
15—Guarantees for additional information.

The adoption of FIN 46(R) resulted in the following:

Consolidated VIEs

•

We consolidated certain VIEs from which we lease certain ocean vessels, airplanes,
refining assets, marketing sites and office buildings. The consolidation increased net
properties, plants and equipment by $940 million and increased assets of discontinued
operations held for sale by $726 million (both are collateral for the debt obligations);
increased cash by $225 million; increased debt by $2.4 billion; increased minority interest
by $90 million; reduced other accruals by $263 million, and resulted in a cumulative
after-tax effect-of-adoption loss that decreased net income and common stockholders’ equity
by $240 million. However, during 2003 we exercised our option to purchase most of these
assets and as a result, the leasing arrangements and our involvement with all but one of
the associated VIEs was terminated. At December 31, 2004, we continue to lease refining
assets totaling $121 million, which are collateral for the debt obligations of $118 million
from a VIE. Other than the obligation to make lease payments and residual value
guarantees, the creditors of the VIE have no recourse to our general credit. In addition,
we discontinued hedge accounting for an interest rate swap since it had been designated as
a cash flow hedge of the variable interest rate component of a lease with a VIE that is now
consolidated. At December 31, 2004, the fair market value of the swap was a liability of
$7 million.

•

Ashford Energy Capital S.A. continues to be consolidated in our financial statements
under the provisions of FIN 46(R) because we are the primary beneficiary. In December
2001, in order to raise funds for general corporate purposes, Conoco and Cold Spring
Finance S.a.r.l. formed Ashford Energy Capital S.A. through the contribution of a $1 billion
Conoco subsidiary promissory note and $500 million cash. Through its initial $500 million
investment, Cold Spring is entitled to a cumulative annual preferred return, based on
three-month LIBOR rates, plus 1.32 percent. The preferred return at December 31, 2004, was
3.34 percent. In 2008, and each 10-year anniversary thereafter, Cold Spring may elect to
remarket their investment in Ashford, and if unsuccessful, could require ConocoPhillips to
provide a letter of credit in support of Cold Spring’s investment, or in the event that such
letter of credit is not provided, then cause the redemption of their investment in Ashford.
Should ConocoPhillips’ credit rating fall below investment grade, Ashford would require a
letter of credit to support $475 million of the term loans, as of December 31, 2004, made by
Ashford to other ConocoPhillips subsidiaries. If the



letter of credit is not obtained within 60 days, Cold Spring could cause Ashford to
sell the ConocoPhillips subsidiary notes. At December 31, 2004, Ashford held $1.7 billion
of ConocoPhillips subsidiary notes and $25 million in investments unrelated to
ConocoPhillips. We report Cold Spring’s investment as a minority interest because it is not
mandatorily redeemable and the entity does not have a specified liquidation date. Other
than the obligation to make payment on the subsidiary notes described above, Cold Spring
does not have recourse to our general credit.

Unconsolidated VIEs

•

Phillips 66 Capital II (Trust) was deconsolidated under the provisions of FIN 46(R)
because ConocoPhillips is not the primary beneficiary. During 1997 in order to raise funds
for general corporate purposes, we formed the Trust (a statutory business trust), in which
we own all common beneficial interests. The Trust was created for the sole purpose of
issuing mandatorily redeemable preferred securities to third-party investors and investing
the proceeds thereof in an approximate equivalent amount of subordinated debt securities of
ConocoPhillips. Application of FIN 46(R) required deconsolidation of the Trust, which
increased debt in 2003 by $361 million since the 8% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest
Debentures due 2037 were no longer eliminated in consolidation, and the $350 million of
mandatorily redeemable preferred securities were deconsolidated.

In 2003, we recorded a charge of $240 million (after an income tax benefit of $145 million)
for the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 46(R). The effect of adopting FIN 46(R) increased 2003
income from continuing operations by $34 million, or $.05 per basic and diluted share. Excluding
the cumulative effect, the adoption of FIN 46(R) increased net income by $139 million, or $.20 per
basic and diluted share in 2003.

Stock-Based Compensation

Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted the fair-value accounting method provided for under SFAS No.
123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” We used the prospective transition method provided
under SFAS 123, applying the fair-value accounting method and recognizing compensation expense for
all stock options granted or modified after December 31, 2002. See Note 1—Accounting Policies and
Note 21—Employee Benefit Plans for additional information.

Other

In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS 109-1, “Application of FASB
Statement No. 109, ‘Accounting for Income Taxes,’ to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production
Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act 2004” and FSP No. 109-2, “Accounting and
Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004.” See Note 22—Taxes for additional information.

In April 2004, the FASB issued FSPs FAS 141-1 and FAS 142-1, which amended SFAS No. 141,
“Business Combinations,” and SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” respectively, to
remove mineral rights as an example of an intangible asset. In September 2004, the FASB issued FSP
FAS 142-2, which confirmed that the scope exception in paragraph 8(b) of SFAS No. 142 extends to
the disclosure provision for oil-and-gas producing entities.

In March 2004, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue 03-6, “Participating Securities and the
Two-Class Method under FASB Statement No. 128, Earnings per Share,” that explained how to
determine whether a security should be considered a “participating security” and how earnings
should be allocated to a participating security when using the two-class method for computing basic
earnings per share. The



adoption of this standard in the second quarter of 2004 did not have a material effect on our
earnings per share calculations for the periods presented in this report.

In January 2004 and May 2004, the FASB issued FSPs FAS 106-1 and FAS 106-2, respectively, regarding
accounting and disclosure requirements related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003. See Note 21—Employee Benefit Plans for additional information.

In December 2003, the FASB revised and reissued SFAS No. 132 (revised 2003), “Employer’s
Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits—an amendment of FASB Statements No.
87, 88 and 106.” While requiring certain new disclosures, the new Statement does not change the
measurement or recognition of employee benefit plans. We adopted the provisions of this Standard
effective December 2003, except for certain provisions regarding disclosure of information about
estimated future benefit payments that were adopted effective December 2004.

Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted SFAS No. 145, “Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and
64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections.” The adoption of SFAS No. 145
requires that gains and losses on extinguishments of debt no longer be presented as extraordinary
items in the income statement. Accordingly, losses from the extinguishment of debt of $16 million
(after reduction for income taxes of $8 million), previously reported as an extraordinary item in
2002, have been reclassified as a $24 million charge to other income with the tax benefit
reclassified to provision for income taxes.

Note 3—Merger of Conoco and Phillips

On August 30, 2002, Conoco and Phillips combined their businesses by merging with separate
acquisition subsidiaries of ConocoPhillips (the merger). As a result, each company became a wholly
owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips. For accounting purposes, Phillips was treated as the acquirer
of Conoco, and ConocoPhillips was treated as the successor of Phillips. Conoco’s operating results
have been included in ConocoPhillips’ consolidated financial statements since the merger date.

The $16 billion purchase price attributed to Conoco for accounting purposes was based on an
exchange of Conoco shares for ConocoPhillips common shares. ConocoPhillips issued approximately
293 million shares of common stock and approximately 23.3 million employee stock options in
exchange for 627 million shares of Conoco common stock and 49.8 million Conoco stock options. The
common stock was valued at $53.15 per share, which was Phillips’ average common stock price over
the two-day trading period immediately before and after the November 18, 2001, public announcement
of the transaction. The Conoco stock options, the fair value of which was determined using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model, were exchanged for ConocoPhillips stock options valued at $384
million. Transaction-related costs, included in the purchase price, were $78 million.

The primary reasons for the merger and the principal factors that contributed to a purchase price
that resulted in the recognition of goodwill were:

•

The combination of Conoco and Phillips would create a stronger, major, integrated
oil company with the benefits of increased size and scale, improving the stability of the
combined business’ earnings in varying economic and market climates.

•

ConocoPhillips would emerge with a global presence in both upstream and downstream
petroleum businesses, increasing its overall international presence to over 40 countries
while maintaining a strong domestic base.



•

Combining the two companies’ operations would provide significant synergies and related
cost savings, and improve future access to capital.

Note 4—Discontinued Operations

During 2002, 2003 and 2004, we disposed of, or committed to a plan to dispose of, certain U.S.
retail and wholesale marketing assets, certain U.S. refining and related assets, certain U.S.
midstream natural gas gathering and processing assets, and exploration and production assets in the
Netherlands. Some of these planned dispositions were mandated by the FTC as a condition of the
merger. For reporting purposes, these operations are classified as discontinued operations, and in
Note 27—Segment Disclosures and Related Information, these operations are included in Corporate and
Other.

FTC-Mandated Divestitures

In the fourth quarter of 2002, we sold our propane terminal assets at Jefferson City, Missouri, and
East St. Louis, Illinois.

During 2003 we sold:

•

Our Woods Cross business unit, which includes the Woods Cross, Utah, refinery; the Utah,
Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming Phillips-branded motor fuel marketing operations (both retail
and wholesale) and associated assets; and a refined products terminal in Spokane,
Washington.

•

Certain midstream natural gas gathering and processing assets in southeast New Mexico,
and certain midstream natural gas gathering assets in West Texas.

•

Our Commerce City, Colorado, refinery, and related crude oil pipelines, and our Colorado
Phillips-branded motor fuel marketing operations (both retail and wholesale).

As a result, all asset
dispositions mandated by the FTC as a condition of the merger have been completed.

Other Dispositions

In the fourth quarter of 2002, we committed to and initiated a plan to dispose of approximately
3,200 marketing sites that did not fit into our long-range plans. In connection with the
anticipated sale of these retail sites, we recorded charges in 2002 totaling $1,412 million
before-tax, $1,008 million after-tax, primarily related to the impairment of properties, plants and
equipment ($249 million); goodwill ($257 million); intangible asset ($429 million); and provisions
for losses and penalties associated with various operating lease commitments ($477 million).

The intangible asset represented the Circle K tradename and brand. Properties, plants and
equipment included land, buildings and equipment of owned retail sites and leasehold improvements
of leased sites. Fair value determinations were based on estimated sales prices for comparable
sites. The provisions for losses and penalties associated with various operating lease commitments
included obligations for residual value guarantee deficiencies, and future minimum rental payments
that existed prior to the commitment date that would continue after the exit plan is completed with
no economic benefit. It also included penalties incurred to cancel the contractual arrangements.



In the third quarter of 2003, we concluded the sale of all of our Exxon-branded marketing assets in
New York and New England, including contracts with independent dealers and marketers.
Approximately 230 of the 3,200 sites were included in this package. In the fourth quarter of 2003,
we completed the sale of The Circle K Corporation and its subsidiaries. The transaction included
about 1,660 retail marketing outlets in 16 states and the Circle K brand, as well as the assignment
of the franchise relationship with more than 350 franchised and licensed stores. Based on
disposals completed and signed agreements as of December 31, 2003, we recognized a net additional
charge in 2003 of approximately $96 million before-tax.

During the second quarter of 2004, we sold our Mobil-branded marketing assets on the East Coast in
two separate transactions. Assets in these packages included approximately 100 company-owned and
operated sites, and contracts with independent dealers and marketers covering an additional 350
sites. As a result of these and other transactions during 2004, we recorded a net before-tax gain
on asset sales of $178 million in 2004. We also recorded additional impairments in 2004 totaling
$96 million before-tax.

Of the approximately 270 sites remaining to be sold at December 31, 2004, approximately 200 sites
are under contracts expected to close in 2005.

Note 5—Restructuring

In 2002, as a result of the merger, we began a restructuring program to capture the benefits of
combining Conoco and Phillips by eliminating redundancies, consolidating assets, and sharing
common services and functions across regions. In connection with this program, the company
recorded accruals in 2002 totaling $770 million for anticipated employee severance payments and
incremental pension and medical plan benefit costs associated with the work force reductions, site
closings, and Conoco employee relocations. Of the total 2002 accrual, $337 million was reflected
in the Conoco purchase price allocation as an assumed liability, and $422 million ($253 million
after-tax) related to Phillips was reflected in selling, general and administrative expense and
production and operating expense, and $11 million before-tax was included in discontinued
operations.

Included in the total accruals of $770 million was $172 million related to pension and other
postretirement benefits that will be paid in conjunction with other retirement benefits over a
number of future years. The table below summarizes the balance of the 2002 accrual of $598
million, which consists of severance related benefits to be provided to approximately 2,900
employees worldwide and other merger-related expenses. At the end of 2002, approximately 775
employees had been terminated. Changes in the 2002 severance related accrual balance is summarized
below.

In 2003, as individual components of the restructuring program were finalized, we recorded an
additional $350 million for severance-related benefits, site closings, Conoco employee relocation
costs, and pension and other postretirement benefits. Of this total, $110 million was reflected
as a purchase price adjustment in the consolidated financial statements and $240 million was
reflected in selling, general and administrative expense and production and operating expense.
Included in the total 2003 additional accruals of $350 million was a $118 million expense related
to pension and other postretirement benefits to be paid in conjunction with other retirement
benefits over a number of future years. This is reported as part of our employee benefit plan
obligations. A roll-forward of activity during 2003 is provided below for the non-pension portion
of the accrual, which primarily consisted of severance-related benefits to be provided to
approximately 3,900 employees worldwide, most of whom were in the United States, as well as other
merger-related expenses. At the end of 2003 approximately 2,225 employees had been terminated.

Included in the total accrual of $46 million was a $4 million expense related to pension and
postretirement benefits. A roll-forward of activity during 2004 is provided below for the
non-pension portion of the accruals, which primarily consisted of severance-related benefits to be
provided based on agreed upon payment schedules to approximately 3,950 employees worldwide, most
of whom were in the United States, as well as other merger-related expenses.

The ending accrual balance at December 31, 2004, of $89 million is expected to be extinguished
within one year, except for $54 million, which is classified as long-term. Approximately 950
employees were terminated during 2004, and all 3,950-employee terminations under the restructuring
program have now been completed.

Note 6—Subsidiary Equity Transactions

ConocoPhillips, through various affiliates, and its unaffiliated co-venturers received final
approvals from authorities in June 2003 to proceed with the natural gas development phase of the
Bayu-Undan project in the Timor Sea. The natural gas development phase of the project includes a
pipeline from the offshore Bayu-Undan field to Darwin, Australia, and a liquefied natural gas
facility, also located in Darwin. The pipeline portion of the project is owned and operated by an
unincorporated joint venture, while the liquefied natural gas facility is owned and operated by
Darwin LNG Pty Ltd (DLNG). Both of these entities are consolidated subsidiaries of ConocoPhillips.

In June 2003, as part of a broad Bayu-Undan ownership interest re-alignment with co-venturers,
these entities issued equity and sold interests to the co-venturers (as described below), which
resulted in a gain of $28 million before-tax, $25 million after-tax, in 2003. This non-operating
gain is shown in the consolidated statement of income in the line item entitled gain on subsidiary
equity transactions.

DLNG—

DLNG issued 118.9 million shares of stock, valued at 1 Australian dollar per share, to
co-venturers for 118.9 million Australian dollars ($76.2 million U.S. dollars), reducing our
ownership interest in DLNG from 100 percent to 56.72 percent. The transaction resulted in a
before-tax gain of $21 million in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred income taxes
were not recognized because this was an issuance of common stock and therefore not taxable.

Unincorporated Pipeline Joint Venture—

The co-venturers purchased pro-rata interests in the pipeline
assets held by ConocoPhillips Pipeline Australia Pty Ltd for $26.6 million U.S. dollars and
contributed the purchased assets to the unincorporated joint venture, reducing our ownership
interest from 100 percent to 56.72 percent. The transaction resulted in a before-tax gain of $7
million. A deferred tax liability of $1.3 million was recorded in connection with the transaction.

Inventories valued on a LIFO basis totaled $2,988 million and $3,224 million at December 31, 2004
and 2003, respectively. The remainder of our inventories is valued under various methods,
including FIFO and weighted average. The excess of current replacement cost over LIFO cost of
inventories amounted to $2,220 million and $1,421 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

During 2004, certain inventory quantity reductions caused a liquidation of LIFO inventory values.
This liquidation increased net income by $62 million, of which $54 million was attributable to our
R&M segment. In 2003, a liquidation of LIFO inventory values increased income from continuing
operations by $24 million, of which $22 million was attributable to our R&M segment.

significant affiliated companies for which we use the equity method of accounting include, among
others, the following companies:

•

LUKOIL—10 percent ownership interest accounted for under the equity method because we
concluded that the facts and circumstances surrounding our ownership interest indicate that
we have an ability to exercise significant influence over its operating and financial
policies—explores for and produces crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids;
refines, markets and transports

LUKOIL

LUKOIL is an international, integrated energy company headquartered
in Russia, with worldwide petroleum exploration and production, and petroleum refining, marketing,
supply and transportation. In September 2004, we made a joint
announcement with LUKOIL, of an agreement to form a broad-based strategic alliance, whereby we
would become a strategic equity investor in LUKOIL. Together, we also announced our intention to
form a joint venture between the two companies to develop resources in the northern part of
Russia’s Timan Pechora oil and gas province and the intention of the two companies to jointly seek
the right to develop the West Qurna oil field in Iraq.



In the announcement, we disclosed that we were the successful bidder in an auction of 7.6 percent
of LUKOIL’s authorized and issued ordinary shares held by the Russian government for a price of
$1,988 million, or $30.76 per share. The transaction closed on October 7, 2004. We increased our
ownership in LUKOIL to 10 percent by the end of 2004 through open market purchases. Under the
Shareholder Agreement between the two companies, we had the right to nominate a representative to
the LUKOIL Board of Directors (Board). During the January 24, 2005, extraordinary general meeting
of LUKOIL shareholders, all charter amendments reflected
in the Shareholder Agreement were passed and ConocoPhillips’ nominee was elected to LUKOIL’s Board.
In addition, the Shareholder Agreement allows us to increase our ownership interest in LUKOIL to
20 percent and limits our ability to sell our LUKOIL shares for a period of four years, except in
certain circumstances. Once we reach 12.5 percent ownership, we have the right to nominate a
second representative to the LUKOIL Board.

Under the terms of the joint-venture arrangements, we will pay an acquisition price to LUKOIL of
approximately $500 million for a 30 percent economic interest in a joint venture to develop oil and
gas resources in the northern part of Russia’s Timan-Pechora province. Under the joint-venture
arrangements, we will have a 50 percent voting interest. The exact amount of the acquisition price
will be established at closing, which is anticipated in the first half of 2005.

Our equity share of the results of LUKOIL for the period from
October 7, 2004, to December 31,
2004, has been estimated because LUKOIL’s accounting cycle close and preparation of U.S. GAAP
financial statements occurs subsequent to our accounting cycle close. This estimate is based on
market indicators and historical production trends of LUKOIL, and other factors. Any difference
between the estimated and actual results for this period will be included in our results for 2005.
At December 31, 2004, the book value of our ordinary share investment in LUKOIL was $2,723 million.
Our 10 percent share of the net assets of LUKOIL was estimated to be $2,064 million. This basis
difference is $659 million, a majority of which is being amortized, on a unit-of-production basis. Included in
net income for 2004, was after-tax expense of $11 million, representing the amortization of this
basis difference. On December 31, 2004, the closing price of LUKOIL shares on the London Stock
Exchange was $30.75 per share, making the aggregate total market value of our LUKOIL investment
$2,613 million at that date.

Duke Energy Field Services, LLC

DEFS owns and operates gas plants, gathering systems, storage facilities and fractionation
plants. At December 31, 2004, the book value of our common investment in DEFS was $242 million.
Our 30.3 percent share of the net assets of DEFS was $814 million. This basis difference of $572
million is being amortized on a straight-line basis through 2014 consistent with the remaining
estimated useful lives of DEFS’ properties, plants and equipment. Included in net income for 2004,
2003 and 2002 was after-tax income of $36 million, $36 million and $35 million, respectively,
representing the amortization of the basis difference.

DEFS supplies a substantial portion of its natural gas liquids to us and CPChem under a supply
agreement that continues until December 31, 2014. This purchase commitment is on an “if-produced,
will-purchase” basis so it has no fixed production schedule, but has been, and is expected to be, a
relatively stable purchase pattern over the term of the contract. Natural gas liquids are
purchased under this agreement at various published market index prices, less transportation and
fractionation fees.



Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC

CPChem manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics. At December 31, 2004, the book value
of our investment in CPChem was $2,140 million. Our 50 percent share of the total net assets of
CPChem was $1,988 million. This basis difference of $152 million is being amortized through 2020,
consistent with the remaining estimated useful lives of CPChem properties, plants and equipment.

During 2004, we received two distributions from CPChem totaling $87.5 million, redeeming a portion
of our preferred member principal, leaving $37.5 million as our remaining preferred member
interest.

We have multiple supply and purchase agreements in place with CPChem, ranging in initial terms from
one to 99 years, with extension options. These agreements cover sales and purchases of refined
products, solvents, and petrochemical and natural gas liquids feedstocks, as well as fuel oils and
gases. Delivery quantities vary by product, and are generally on an “if-produced, will-purchase”
basis. All products are purchased and sold under specified pricing formulas based on various
published pricing indices, consistent with terms extended to third-party customers.

PP&E is recorded at cost. Effective January 1, 2003, we
adopted SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” which applies to legal
obligations associated with the retirement and removal of long-lived assets. SFAS No. 143 requires
entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period
when it is incurred (typically when the asset is installed at the production location). When the
liability is initially recorded, the entity capitalizes the cost by increasing the carrying amount
of the related PP&E. Over time, the liability increases for the change in its present value, while
the capitalized cost depreciates over the useful life of the related asset. Application of this
new accounting principle initially increased net PP&E $1.2 billion.



Suspended Wells

In September 2004, the EITF discussed Issue No. 04-9, “Accounting for Suspended Well Costs,” as it
relates to SFAS No. 19, “Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies.”
SFAS No. 19 requires that the costs of exploratory wells be capitalized, or “suspended,” on the
balance sheet, pending a determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have
been discovered. The discussion centered on whether certain circumstances would permit the
continued capitalization of the costs for an exploratory well beyond one year, in the absence of
plans for another exploratory well. The EITF removed the issue from its agenda, and requested that
the FASB consider an amendment to SFAS No. 19 to clarify when it is permissible to continue to
capitalize exploratory well costs beyond one year if (a) the well had found a sufficient quantity
of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well, assuming the required capital
expenditures would be made, and (b) the company was making sufficient progress assessing the
reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. In February 2005, the FASB
posted FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS No. 19-a, “Accounting for Suspended Well Costs,” on its Web site
for comment. The proposed FSP provides for continued capitalization past one year if a company is
making sufficient progress on assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of
the project. The proposed FSP also provides disclosure requirements about capitalized exploratory
well costs. We estimate that if the proposed FSP were adopted prospectively on January 1, 2002, net
income would not have changed in 2004, 2003, or 2002. We believe that the adoption of the FSP as
proposed would not result in the write-off of any well suspended as of December 31, 2004. We plan
to continue to monitor the deliberations of the FASB on this issue.

The following table reflects the net changes in suspended exploratory well costs during 2004, 2003
and 2002.

Included in total suspended well costs at year-end 2004 was $70 million related to eight
exploratory wells in areas where major capital expenditures will be required and no further
exploratory drilling is planned, but for which we are actively pursuing those activities necessary
to classify the reserves as proved. These costs were suspended between 1999 and 2003. At year-end
2004, we were awaiting government approval of the development plan for the Bohai Bay Phase II
project in China. Suspended well costs associated with this project represented $42 million of the
$70 million total. This project was approved by the government in early 2005, which will allow us
to book proved reserves in 2005, at which time the suspended well costs will be reclassified as
part of the capitalized costs of the project. The remaining $28 million related to projects where infrastructure decisions are dependent on
environmental permitting and production capacity, or where we are continuing to assess reserves and
their potential development. At December 31, 2004, we did not have any amounts suspended that were
associated with areas not requiring major capital expenditures
before production could begin, where more than one year had elapsed since the completion of
drilling.

air emission credits. This impairment totaled $41 million before-tax, $26 million after-tax, and
was recorded in the property impairments line of the consolidated income statement. The impairment
was related to the reduced market value of certain air credits. We also impaired an intangible
asset related to a marketing brand name. These intangible assets are included in the R&M segment.

The E&P segment recognized property impairments totaling $67 million in 2004, primarily related to
the write-down to market value of properties planned for disposition and for properties failing to
meet recoverability tests. The Midstream segment also recognized property impairments related to
planned asset dispositions.

In R&M, we reduced the carrying value of certain indefinite-lived intangible assets. See Note
10—Goodwill and Intangibles for additional information. Other impairments in R&M during 2004
primarily were related to assets planned for disposition.


The E&P segment recognized property impairments of $245 million in 2003. These impairments were
the result of the write-down to market value of properties planned for disposition; properties
failing to meet recoverability tests; and international tax law changes affecting asset removal
costs.


The E&P segment recognized impairments of $49 million in 2002, triggered by asset sales and
evaluation of development drilling results.

We initiated a plan in late 2002 to sell a substantial portion of our R&M retail sites. The
planned dispositions resulted in a reduction of the amount of gasoline volumes marketed under our
“76” trademark. As a result, the carrying value of the “76” trademark was impaired, with the $102
million impairment determined by an analysis of the discounted cash flows based on the gasoline
volumes projected to be sold under the brand name after the planned dispositions, compared with the
volumes being sold prior to the dispositions. We also impaired the carrying value of certain
leasehold improvements associated with



leased retail sites that are held for use by comparing the guaranteed residual values and leasehold
improvements with current market values of the related assets.

discontinued operations.

Accrued Environmental Costs

Total environmental accruals at December 31, 2004 and 2003, were $1,061 million and $1,119 million,
respectively. The 2004 decrease in total accrued environmental costs is due primarily to payments
on accrued environmental costs, partially offset by new accruals and accretion.

We had accrued environmental costs of $606 million and $625 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, primarily related to cleanup at domestic refineries and underground storage tanks at
U.S. service stations, and remediation activities required by the state of Alaska at exploration
and production sites. We had also accrued in Corporate and Other $337 million and $367 million of
environmental costs associated with non-operating sites at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. In addition, $118 million and $127 million were included at December 31, 2004 and
2003, respectively, where the company has been named a potentially responsible party under the
Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or similar state
laws. Accrued environmental liabilities will be paid over periods extending up to 30 years.

Because a large portion of our accrued environmental costs were acquired in various business
combinations, they are discounted obligations. Expected expenditures for acquired environmental
obligations are discounted using a weighted-average 5 percent discount factor,
resulting in an accrued balance for acquired environmental liabilities of $863 million at December
31, 2004. The expected future undiscounted payments related to the portion of the accrued
environmental costs that have been discounted are: $114 million in 2005, $137 million in 2006, $103
million in 2007, $97 million in 2008, $94 million in 2009, and $443 million for all future years
after 2009.

Effective October 12, 2004, we entered into two new revolving credit facilities totaling $5 billion
to replace our previously existing $1.5 billion 364-day facility that was set to expire on October
13, 2004; two revolving credit facilities totaling $2 billion expiring in October 2006; and a $500
million facility expiring in October 2008. The two new facilities include a $2.5 billion four-year
facility expiring in October 2008 and a $2.5 billion five-year facility expiring in October 2009.
Both facilities are available for use as direct bank borrowings or as support for our $5 billion
commercial paper program. In addition, the five-year facility may be used to support issuances of
letters of credit totaling up to $750 million. The facilities are broadly syndicated among
financial institutions and do not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants
requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or ratings. The credit agreements do contain a
cross-default provision relating to our, or any of our consolidated subsidiaries’, failure to pay
principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more. At December 31, 2004, we
had no outstanding borrowings under these facilities, but had $544 million in commercial paper
outstanding and $173 million in letters of credit had been issued.

One of our Norwegian subsidiaries had two $300 million revolving credit facilities that expired in
June 2004, which were not renewed.

Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain
designated banks in the London interbank market or at a margin above the overnight federal funds
rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks in the United States. The agreements call
for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. The agreements also contain early
termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of
the Board of Directors.

During 2004, we reduced our commercial paper balance outstanding from $709 million at December
31, 2003, to $544 million at December 31, 2004. Also in 2004, we paid off the $1,350 million
aggregate principal amount of our 5.90% Notes due 2004 when they matured in April, and in August,
we redeemed the $1,150 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.5% Notes due 2005 at a premium
of $58 million plus accrued interest. The payments were funded primarily with cash from operating
activities. In addition, we have given notice to redeem in March 2005 our $400 million 3.625% Notes due 2007.

On October 14, 2004, we amended and restated the ConocoPhillips Savings Plan term loan. This loan
will require repayment in semi-annual installments beginning in 2009 and continuing through 2015.
Under this loan, any participating bank in the syndicate of lenders may cease to participate on
December 4, 2009, by giving not less than 180 days’ prior notice to the ConocoPhillips Savings Plan
and the company. At December 31, 2004, $253 million was outstanding under this term loan. Each
bank participating in the ConocoPhillips Savings Plan loan has the optional right, if our current
directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board, and upon not less than
90 days’ notice, to cease to participate in the loan. Under the above conditions, we are required
to purchase such bank’s rights and obligations under the loan agreement if they are not transferred
to another bank of our choice. See Note 21—Employee Benefit Plans for additional discussion of the
ConocoPhillips Savings Plan.

Note 14—Sales of Receivables

At December 31, 2004, certain credit card and trade receivables had been sold to a Qualifying
Special Purpose Entity (QSPE) in a revolving-period securitization arrangement. This arrangement
provided for us to sell, and the QSPE to purchase, certain receivables and for the QSPE to then
issue beneficial interests of up to $1.2 billion to five bank-sponsored entities. All five
bank-sponsored entities are multi-seller conduits with access to the commercial paper market and
purchase interests in similar receivables from numerous



other companies unrelated to us. We have no ownership interests, nor any variable interests, in
any of the bank-sponsored entities. As a result, we do not consolidate any of these entities.
Furthermore, we do not consolidate the QSPE because it meets the requirements of SFAS No. 140,
“Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities,” to
be excluded from the consolidated financial statements of ConocoPhillips.

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the QSPE had issued beneficial interests to the bank-sponsored
entities of $480 million and $1.2 billion, respectively. The receivables transferred to the QSPE
met the isolation and other requirements of SFAS No. 140 to be accounted for as sales and were
accounted for accordingly.

We retain beneficial interests in the QSPE that are subordinate to the beneficial interests issued
to the bank-sponsored entities. These retained interests, which are reported on the balance sheet
in accounts and notes receivable—related parties, were $3.2 billion at December 31, 2004, and $1.3
billion at December 31, 2003. We also retain servicing responsibility related to the sold
receivables, which gives us certain rights and abilities, the fair value of which approximates the
fair value of the liability incurred for continuing to service the receivables. The carrying value
of our subordinated beneficial interests in the QSPE approximates fair market value due to the very
short term of the underlying assets, which makes fair value stress testing for disclosure purposes
unnecessary.

Total QSPE cash flows received from and paid under the securitization arrangements were as follows:

The decrease in cash flow activity in 2004 was primarily due to reductions in the average level of
beneficial interests issued to the bank-sponsored entities.

At December 31, 2003, we had sold $226 million of receivables under factoring arrangements. We
retained servicing responsibility related to those sold receivables, which gave us certain
benefits, the fair value of which approximated the fair value of the liability incurred for
continuing to service the receivables. At December 31, 2004, we had no receivables outstanding
under similar arrangements.

Note 15—Guarantees

At December 31, 2004, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual
arrangements as described below. We are required to recognize a liability at inception for the
fair value of our obligation as a guarantor for guarantees issued or modified after December 31,
2002. Unless the carrying amount of the liability is noted, we have not recognized a liability
either because the guarantees were issued prior to December 31, 2002, or because the fair value of
the obligation is immaterial.



Construction Completion Guarantees

•

In May 2004, the Merey Sweeny, L.P. (MSLP) joint-venture project at the Sweeny
refinery in Old Ocean, Texas, achieved completion certification. As a result, the
previously disclosed construction completion guarantee related to the debt and
bond-financing arrangements secured by MSLP expired and the debt became non-recourse to
ConocoPhillips.

•

We issued a construction completion guarantee related to debt financing arrangements for
the Hamaca Holding LLC joint-venture project in Venezuela. The maximum potential amount of
future payments under the guarantee is estimated to be $410 million, which could be payable
if the full debt financing capacity is utilized and startup and completion of the Hamaca
project is not achieved by October 1, 2005. The project financing debt will be
non-recourse upon startup and completion certification.

Guarantees of Joint-Venture Debt

•

At December 31, 2004, we had guarantees of about $250 million outstanding for our
portion of joint-venture debt obligations, which have terms of up to 20 years. Payment
would be required if a joint venture defaults on its debt obligations. Included in these
outstanding guarantees was $95 million associated with the Polar Lights Company joint
venture in Russia.

Other Guarantees

•

The MSLP joint-venture project agreement requires the partners in the venture to
pay cash calls to cover operating expenses in the event that the venture does not have
enough cash to cover operating expenses after setting aside the amount required for debt
service over the next 20 years. Although there is no maximum limit stated in the
agreement, the intent is to cover short-term cash deficiencies should they occur. Our
maximum potential future payments under the agreement are currently estimated to be $100
million, assuming such a shortfall exists at some point in the future due to an extended
operational disruption. If such an operational disruption did occur, MSLP has business
interruption insurance and would be entitled to insurance proceeds subject to deductibles
and certain limits.

•

In February 2003, we entered into two agreements establishing separate guarantee
facilities of $50 million each for two liquefied natural gas ships. Subject to the terms
of each such facility, we will be required to make payments should the charter revenue
generated by the respective ship fall below certain specified minimum thresholds, and we
will receive payments to the extent that such revenues exceed those thresholds. The net
maximum future payments that we may have to make over the 20-year terms of the two
agreements could be up to an aggregate of $100 million. Actual gross payments over the 20
years could exceed that amount to the extent cash is received by us. In the event either
ship is sold or a total loss occurs, we also may have recourse to the sales or insurance
proceeds to recoup payments made under the guarantee facilities.

At the time of the agreement, based on the then current market view of both long-term
and short-term shipping capacity, rates and utilization probability, we estimated the fair
value of the liability under these guarantee facilities to be immaterial. In September 2003, the first
ship was delivered to its owner and the second ship is scheduled for delivery to its owner
in mid-2005. With respect to the first ship, the amount drawn under the guarantee facility
at December 31, 2004, was less than $1 million.



•

We have other guarantees totaling $340 million, which consist primarily of dealer and jobber
loan guarantees to support our marketing business, a guarantee to fund the short-term cash
liquidity deficits of a lubricants joint venture, a guaranteed revenue deficiency payment to
a pipeline joint venture, two small construction completion guarantees, a guarantee
supporting a lease assignment on a corporate aircraft, a guarantee associated with a pending
lawsuit and guarantees of the lease payment obligations of a joint venture. The carrying
amount recorded for these other guarantees, as of December 31, 2004, was $19 million. These
guarantees generally extend up to 15 years and payment would only be required if the dealer,
jobber or lessee goes into default, if the lubricants joint venture has cash liquidity
issues, if the pipeline joint venture has revenue below a certain threshold, if construction
projects are not completed, if guaranteed parties default on lease payments, or if an
adverse decision occurs in the lawsuit.

Indemnifications

•

Over the years, we have entered into various agreements to sell ownership interests in
certain corporations and joint ventures. These agreements typically include
indemnifications for additional taxes determined to be due under the relevant tax law, in
connection with operations for years prior to the sale. Generally, the obligation extends
until the related tax years are closed. The maximum potential amount of future payments
under the indemnifications is the amount of additional tax determined to be due under
relevant tax law and the various agreements. There are no material outstanding claims that
have been asserted under these arrangements.

•

During 2003 and 2004, we sold several assets, including FTC-mandated sales of downstream
and midstream assets, certain exploration and production assets, and downstream retail and
wholesale sites, giving rise to qualifying indemnifications. Agreements associated with
these sales include indemnifications for taxes, environmental liabilities, underground
storage tank repairs or replacements, permits and licenses, employee claims, real estate
indemnity against tenant defaults, and litigation. The terms of these indemnifications
vary greatly. The majority of these indemnifications are related to environmental issues,
the term is generally indefinite and the maximum amount of future payments is generally
unlimited. The carrying amount recorded for these indemnifications, as of December 31,
2004, was $236 million. We amortize the indemnification liability over the relevant time
period, if one exists, based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each type of
indemnity. In cases where the indemnification term is indefinite, we will reverse the
liability when we have information that the liability is essentially relieved or amortize
the liability over an appropriate time period as the fair value of our indemnification
exposure declines. Although it is reasonably possible that future payments may exceed
amounts recorded, due to the nature of the indemnifications, it is not possible to make a
reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments. Included in the
carrying amount recorded were $119 million of environmental accruals for known
contamination that is included in asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental
costs at December 31, 2004. For additional information about environmental liabilities,
see Note 12—Asset Retirement and Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs, and Note
16—Contingencies and Commitments.

•

As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with industry practice,
we enter into numerous agreements with other parties, which apportion future risks among
the parties to the transaction or relationship governed by the agreements. One method of
apportioning risk is the inclusion of provisions requiring one party to indemnify the other
against losses that might otherwise be incurred by the other party in the future. Many of
our agreements contain an indemnity or indemnities that require us to perform certain acts,
such as remediation, as a result of the occurrence of a triggering event or condition. In
some instances we indemnify third parties



against losses resulting from certain events or conditions that arise out of the
operations of our equity affiliates.

The nature of these numerous indemnity obligations are diverse and each has different
terms, business purposes, and triggering events or conditions. Consistent with customary
business practice, any particular indemnity obligation incurred is the result of a
negotiated transaction or contractual relationship for which we have accepted a certain
level of risk in return for a financial or other type of benefit. In addition, the
indemnities in each agreement vary widely in their definitions of both triggering events and
the resulting obligations contingent on those triggering events.

With regard to indemnifications, our risk management philosophy is to limit risk in any
transaction or relationship to the maximum extent reasonable in relation to commercial and
other considerations. Before accepting any indemnity obligation, we make an informed risk
management decision considering, among other things, the likelihood that the triggering
event will occur, the potential cost to perform under any resulting indemnity obligation,
possible actions to reduce the likelihood of a triggering event or to reduce the costs of
performing under the indemnity obligation, whether we are indemnified by an unrelated third
party, insurance coverage that may be available to offset the cost of the indemnity
obligation, and the benefits from the transaction or relationship.

Because many of our indemnity obligations are not limited in duration or potential monetary
exposure, we cannot calculate a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of
future payments that might have to be paid under indemnity obligations stemming from our
agreements that existed prior to December 31, 2002. The carrying amount recorded for these
indemnifications, as of December 31, 2004, was $237 million, which is for known
contamination and is included in asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental
costs. For additional information about environmental liabilities and contingencies, see
Note 12—Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs, and Note
16—Contingencies and Commitments.

Note 16—Contingencies and Commitments

In the case of all known contingencies, we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the
amount is reasonably estimable. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or
third-party recoveries. If applicable, we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other
third-party recoveries.

Based on currently available information, we believe that it is remote that future costs related to
known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a
material adverse impact on our financial statements. As we learn new facts concerning
contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other
potential exposures. Estimates that are particularly sensitive to future changes include
contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters. Estimated
future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain
magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be
required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible
parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events
evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation
processes.



Environmental—

We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. These
may result in obligations to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement,
storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various
sites. When we prepare our financial statements, we record accruals for environmental liabilities
based on management’s best estimates, using all information that is available at the time. We
measure estimates and base liabilities on currently available facts, existing technology, and
presently enacted laws and regulations, taking into consideration the likely effects of societal
and economic factors. When measuring environmental liabilities, we also consider our prior
experience in remediation of contaminated sites, other companies’ cleanup experience, and data
released by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or other organizations. We consider
unasserted claims in our determination of environmental liabilities and we accrue them in the
period that they are both probable and reasonably estimable.

Although liability of those potentially responsible for environmental remediation costs is
generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, we are usually
only one of many companies cited at a particular site. Due to the joint and several liabilities,
we could be responsible for all of the cleanup costs related to any site at which we have been
designated as a potentially responsible party. If we were solely responsible, the costs, in some
cases, could be material to our, or one of our segments’, results of operations, capital resources
or liquidity. However, settlements and costs incurred in matters that previously have been
resolved have not been material to our results of operations or financial condition. We have been
successful to date in sharing cleanup costs with other financially sound companies. Many of the
sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state
agencies concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess the
site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some
instances, we may have no liability or may attain a settlement of liability. Where it appears that
other potentially responsible parties may be financially unable to bear their proportional share,
we consider this inability in estimating our potential liability and we adjust our accruals
accordingly.

As a result of various acquisitions in the past, we assumed certain environmental obligations.
Some of these environmental obligations are mitigated by indemnifications made by others for our
benefit and some of the indemnifications are subject to dollar limits and time limits. We have not
recorded accruals for any potential contingent liabilities that we expect to be funded by the prior
owners under these indemnifications.

We are currently participating in environmental assessments and cleanups at numerous federal
Superfund and comparable state sites. After an assessment of environmental exposures for cleanup
and other costs, we make accruals on an undiscounted basis (except those assumed in a purchase
business combination, which we record such costs on a discounted basis) for planned investigation
and remediation activities for sites where it is probable that future costs will be incurred and
these costs can be reasonably estimated. We have not reduced these accruals for possible insurance
recoveries. In the future, we may be involved in additional environmental assessments, cleanups
and proceedings. See Note 12—Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs for a
summary of our accrued environmental liabilities.

Legal Proceedings—

We apply our knowledge, experience, and professional judgment to the specific
characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the
legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of
potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track trial settings, as
well as the status and pace of settlement discussions in individual matters. Based on our
professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available
information about current developments in all our cases, we believe that there is only a remote
likelihood that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current
accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.



Other Contingencies—

We have contingent liabilities resulting from throughput agreements with
pipeline and processing companies not associated with financing arrangements. Under these
agreements, we may be required to provide any such company with additional funds through advances
and penalties for fees related to throughput capacity not utilized by ConocoPhillips. In addition,
we have performance obligations that are secured by unused letters of credit and various purchase
commitments for materials, supplies, services and items of permanent investment incident to the
ordinary conduct of business.

Long-Term Throughput Agreements and Take-or-Pay Agreements—

We have certain throughput agreements
and take-or-pay agreements that are in support of financing arrangements. The agreements
typically provide for natural gas or crude oil transportation to be used in the ordinary course of
the company’s business. The aggregate amounts of estimated payments under these various agreements
are 2005—$92 million; 2006—$98 million;
2007—$98 million; 2008—$98 million;
2009—$98 million; and 2010 and
after—$553 million. Total payments under the agreements were $86 million in
2004, $64 million in 2003 and $18 million in 2002.

Note 17—Financial Instruments and Derivative Contracts

Derivative Instruments

We, and certain of our subsidiaries, may use financial and commodity-based derivative contracts to
manage exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest
rates, or to exploit market opportunities. Our use of derivative instruments is governed by an
“Authority Limitations” document approved by our Board of Directors that prohibits the use of
highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity for comparable
valuations without approval from the Chief Executive Officer. The Authority Limitations document
also authorizes the Chief Executive Officer to establish the maximum Value at Risk (VaR) limits for
the company and compliance with these limits is monitored daily. The Chief Financial Officer
monitors risks resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, while the
Executive Vice President of Commercial monitors commodity price risk. Both report to the Chief
Executive Officer. The Commercial organization manages our commercial marketing, optimizes our
commodity flows and positions, monitors related risks of our upstream and downstream businesses and
selectively takes price risk to add value.

SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended (Statement
No. 133 or SFAS No. 133), requires companies to recognize all derivative
instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value. Assets and
liabilities resulting from derivative contracts open at December 31, 2004, were $479 million and
$322 million, respectively, and appear as accounts and notes receivables, prepaid expenses and
other current assets, other assets, accounts payable, other accruals, or other liabilities and
deferred credits on the balance sheet.

The accounting for changes in fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends
on whether it meets the qualifications for, and has been designated as, a SFAS No. 133 hedge, and
the type of hedge. At this time, we are not using SFAS No. 133 hedge accounting for commodity
derivative contracts, but we are using hedge accounting for the interest-rate derivatives noted
below. All gains and losses, realized or unrealized, from derivative contracts not designated as
SFAS No. 133 hedges have been recognized in the income statement. Gains and losses from derivative
contracts held for trading not directly related to our physical business, whether realized or
unrealized, have been reported net in other income.



SFAS No. 133 also requires purchase and sales contracts for commodities that are readily
convertible to cash (e.g., crude oil, natural gas, and gasoline) to be recorded on the balance
sheet as derivatives unless the contracts are for quantities we expect to use or sell over a
reasonable period in the normal course of business (the normal purchases and normal sales
exception), among other requirements, and we have documented our intent to apply this exception.
Except for contracts to buy or sell natural gas, we generally apply this exception to eligible
purchase and sales contracts; however, we may elect not to apply this exception (e.g., when another
derivative instrument will be used to mitigate the risk of the purchase or sale contract but hedge
accounting will not be applied). When this occurs, both the purchase or sales contract and the
derivative contract mitigating the resulting risk will be recorded on the balance sheet at fair
value in accordance with the preceding paragraphs. Most of our contracts to buy or sell natural
gas are recorded on the balance sheet as derivatives, except for certain long-term contracts to
sell our natural gas production, which either have been designated normal purchase/normal sales, or
do not meet the SFAS No. 133 definition of a derivative.

Interest Rate Derivative Contracts—

During the fourth quarter of 2003, we executed interest rate
swaps that had the effect of converting $1.5 billion of debt from fixed to floating rates. These
swaps, which we continue to hold, have qualified for and been designated as fair-value hedges using
the short-cut method of hedge accounting provided by SFAS No. 133, which permits the assumption
that changes in the value of the derivative perfectly offset changes in the value of the debt;
therefore, no gain or loss has been recognized due to hedge ineffectiveness.

Currency Exchange Rate Derivative Contracts—

We have foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting
from operations in over 40 countries. We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency
rate changes, although we may choose to selectively hedge exposures to foreign currency rate risk.
Examples include firm commitments for capital projects, certain local currency tax payments and
dividends, short-term intercompany loans between subsidiaries operating in different countries, and
cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year.
Hedge accounting is not currently being used for any of our foreign currency derivatives.

Commodity Derivative Contracts—

We operate in the worldwide crude oil, refined product, natural gas,
natural gas liquids, and electric power markets and are exposed to fluctuations in the prices for
these commodities. These fluctuations can affect our revenues as well as the cost of operating,
investing, and financing activities. Generally, our policy is to remain exposed to market prices
of commodity purchases and sales; however, executive management may elect to use derivative
instruments to hedge the price risk of our crude oil and natural gas production, as well as
refinery margins.

Our Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps, and options in various markets to
optimize the value of our supply chain, which may move our risk profile away from market average
prices to accomplish the following objectives:

•

Balance physical systems. In addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration,
exchange traded futures contracts may also be settled by physical delivery of the
commodity, providing another source of supply to meet our refinery requirements or
marketing demand.

•

Meet customer needs. Consistent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market
prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed-price sales contracts, which are often
requested by natural gas and refined product consumers, to a floating market price.

•

Manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil, natural
gas, refined product and electric power transactions.



•

Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from these activities to do a limited amount of
trading not directly related to our physical business. For the 12 months ended December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, the gains or losses from this activity were not material to our cash
flows or income from continuing operations.

At December 31, 2004, we were not using hedge accounting for any commodity derivative contracts.

Credit Risk

Our financial instruments that are potentially exposed to concentrations of credit risk
consist primarily of cash equivalents, over-the-counter derivative contracts, and trade
receivables. Our cash equivalents, which are placed in high-quality commercial paper, money market
funds and time deposits with major international banks and financial institutions, are generally
not maintained at levels material to our financial position. The credit risk from our
over-the-counter derivative contracts, such as forwards and swaps, derives from the counterparty to
the transaction, typically a major bank or financial institution. We closely monitor these credit
exposures against predetermined credit limits, including the continual exposure adjustments that
result from market movements. Individual counterparty exposure is managed within these limits, and
includes the use of cash-call margins when appropriate, thereby reducing the risk of significant
non-performance. We also use futures contracts, but futures have a negligible credit risk because
they are traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange or the International Petroleum Exchange of
London Limited.

Our trade receivables result primarily from our petroleum operations and reflect a broad national
and international customer base, which limits our exposure to concentrations of credit risk. The
majority of these receivables have payment terms of 30 days or less, and we continually monitor
this exposure and the creditworthiness of the counterparties. We do not generally require
collateral to limit the exposure to loss; however, we will sometimes use letters of credit,
prepayments, and master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk with counterparties that both
buy from and sell to us, as these agreements permit the amounts owed by us or owed to others to be
offset against amounts due us.

Note 18—Preferred Stock and Other Minority Interests

Company-Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred

Securities of Phillips 66 Capital Trusts

In 1997, we formed a statutory business trust, Phillips 66 Capital II (Trust II), with
ConocoPhillips owning all of the common securities of the trust. The sole purpose of the trust was
to issue preferred securities to outside investors, investing the proceeds thereof in an equivalent
amount of subordinated debt securities of ConocoPhillips. The trust was established to raise funds
for general corporate purposes.

Trust II has outstanding $350 million of 8% Capital Securities (Capital Securities). The sole
asset of Trust II is $361 million of the company’s 8% Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest
Debentures due 2037 (Subordinated Debt Securities II). The Subordinated Debt Securities II are due
January 15, 2037, and are redeemable in whole, or in part, at our option on or after January 15,
2007, at 103.94 percent declining annually until January 15, 2017, when they can be called at par,
$1,000 per share, plus accrued and unpaid interest. When we redeem the Subordinated Debt
Securities II, Trust II is required to apply all redemption proceeds to the immediate redemption of
the Capital Securities. We fully and unconditionally guarantee Trust II’s obligations under the
Capital Securities. Subordinated Debt Securities II are unsecured
obligations that are subordinate and junior in right of payment to all our present and future
senior indebtedness.

Effective January 1, 2003, with the adoption of FIN 46(R), Trust II was deconsolidated because we
were not the primary beneficiary. This had the effect of increasing consolidated debt by $361
million, since the Subordinated Debt Securities II were no longer eliminated in consolidation. It
also removed the $350 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities from our consolidated
balance sheet. Prior to the adoption of FIN 46(R), the subordinated debt securities and related
income statement effects were eliminated in the company’s consolidated financial statements. See
Note 2—Changes in Accounting Principles for additional information.

Other Minority Interests

In July 2004, we retired the minority interest in Conoco Corporate Holdings L.P. The minority
limited partner in Conoco Corporate Holdings L.P., a limited-life entity, was entitled to a
cumulative annual 7.86 percent priority return on its investment. That net minority interest was
$141 million at December 31, 2003.



The minority interest owner in Ashford Energy Capital S.A. is entitled to a cumulative annual
preferred return on its investment, based on three-month LIBOR rates plus 1.32 percent. The
preferred return at December 31, 2004 and 2003, was 3.34 percent and 2.48 percent, respectively.
At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the minority interest was $504 million and $496 million,
respectively. Ashford Energy Capital S.A. continues to be consolidated in our financial statements
under the provisions of FIN 46(R) because we are the primary beneficiary. See Note 2—Changes in
Accounting Principles for additional information.

The remaining minority interest amounts relate to consolidated operating joint ventures that have
minority interest owners. The largest amount relates to the Bayu-Undan project. See Note
6—Subsidiary Equity Transactions.

Preferred Stock

We have 500 million shares of preferred stock authorized, par value $.01 per share, none of which
was issued or outstanding at December 31, 2004.

Note 19—Preferred Share Purchase Rights

In 2002, our Board of Directors authorized and declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase
right for each common share outstanding, and authorized and directed the issuance of one right per
common share for any newly issued shares. The rights have certain anti-takeover effects. The
rights will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire ConocoPhillips
on terms not approved by the Board of Directors. However, since the rights may either be redeemed
or otherwise made inapplicable by ConocoPhillips prior to an acquiror obtaining beneficial
ownership of 15 percent or more of ConocoPhillips’ common stock, the rights should not interfere
with any merger or business combination approved by the Board of Directors prior to that
occurrence. The rights, which expire June 30, 2012, will be exercisable only if a person or group
acquires 15 percent or more of the company’s common stock or commences a tender offer that would
result in ownership of 15 percent or more of the common stock. Each right would entitle
stockholders to buy one one-hundredth of a share of preferred
stock at an exercise price of $300. If an acquiror obtains 15 percent or more of ConocoPhillips’
common stock, then each right will be adjusted so that it will entitle the holder (other than the
acquiror, whose rights will become void) to purchase, for the then exercise price, a number of
shares of ConocoPhillips’ common stock equal in value to two times the exercise price of the right.
In addition, the rights enable holders to purchase the stock of an acquiring company at a
discount, depending on specific circumstances. We may redeem the rights in whole, but not in part,
for one cent per right.

Note 20—Non-Mineral Leases

The company leases ocean transport vessels, railcars, corporate aircraft, service stations,
computers, office buildings and other facilities and equipment. Certain leases include escalation
clauses for adjusting rentals to reflect changes in price indices, as well as renewal options
and/or options to purchase the leased property for the fair market value at the end of the lease
term. There are no significant restrictions imposed on us by the leasing agreements in regards to
dividends, asset dispositions or borrowing ability. Leased assets under capital leases were not
significant in any period presented.



At December 31, 2004, future minimum rental payments due under non-cancelable leases, including

For both U.S. and international pensions, the overall expected long-term rate of return is
developed from the expected future return of each asset class, weighted by the expected allocation
of pension assets to that asset class. We rely on a variety of independent market forecasts in
developing the expected rate of return for each class of assets.

We use a December 31 measurement date for the majority of our plans.

During 2004, we recorded a benefit to other comprehensive income related to minimum pension
liability adjustments totaling $8 million ($1 million net of tax), resulting in accumulated other
comprehensive loss due to minimum pension liability adjustments at December 31, 2004, of $81
million ($60 million net of tax). During 2003, we recorded a benefit to other comprehensive income
totaling $280 million ($175 million net of tax), resulting in accumulated other
comprehensive loss due to minimum pension liability adjustments at December 31, 2003, of $89
million ($61 million net of tax).



For our tax-qualified pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets,
the projected benefit obligation, the accumulated benefit obligation, and the fair value of plan
assets were $4,893 million, $4,015 million, and $2,914 million at December 31, 2004, respectively,
and $4,489 million, $3,661 million, and $2,415 million at December 31, 2003, respectively.

For our unfunded non-qualified supplemental key employee pension plans, the projected benefit
obligation and the accumulated benefit obligation were $219 million and $162 million, respectively,
at December 31, 2004, and were $237 million and $177 million, respectively, at December 31, 2003.

We recognized pension settlement losses of $13 million and special termination benefits of $3
million in 2004. As a result of the ConocoPhillips merger, we recognized settlement losses of $120
million and special termination benefits of $9 million in 2003, and we recorded curtailment losses
of $23 million and special termination benefits of $98 million in 2002.

In determining net pension and other postretirement benefit costs, we elected to amortize net gains
and losses on a straight-line basis over 10 years. Prior service cost is amortized on a
straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive
benefits under the plan.

We have multiple non-pension postretirement benefit plans for health and life insurance. The
health care plans are contributory, with participant and company contributions adjusted annually;
the life insurance plans are non-contributory. For most groups of retirees, any increase in the
annual health care escalation rate above 4.5 percent is borne by the participant. The weighted-
average health care cost trend rate for those participants not subject to the cap is assumed to
decrease gradually from 10 percent in 2005 to 5.5 percent in 2015.



The assumed health care cost trend rate impacts the amounts reported. A one-percentage-point
change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects on the 2004
amounts:

In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Act)
was signed into law. The Act introduced a prescription drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part
D), as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a
benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. In May 2004, the FASB released
Staff Position FAS 106-2, “Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare
Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003,” which required that we reflect the
effect of the Act in our third-quarter 2004 financial statements. We determined, based on
available regulatory guidance, that the prescription drug benefits provided by our retiree medical
plan are not actuarially equivalent to the Medicare Part D benefit. Consequently, the federal
subsidy will have no impact on the calculation of our medical plan liability or expense. We
continue to evaluate the impact of the legislation on our benefit plan design.

Plan Assets

The company follows a policy of broadly diversifying pension plan assets across asset classes,
investment managers, and individual holdings. Asset classes that are considered appropriate
include U.S. equities, non-U.S. equities, U.S. fixed income, non-U.S. fixed income, real estate,
and private equity investments. Plan fiduciaries may consider and add other asset classes to the
investment program from time to time. Any use of leverage is prohibited. At December 31, 2004 and
2003, there were no shares of company stock included in plan assets. Our funding policy for U.S.
plans is to contribute at least the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974. Contributions to foreign plans are dependent upon local laws and tax regulations. In
2005, we expect to contribute approximately $410 million to our domestic qualified and
non-qualified benefit plans and $140 million to our international qualified and non-qualified
benefit plans.

A portion of U.S. pension plan assets is held as a participating interest in an insurance
annuity contract. This participating interest is calculated as the market value of investments held
under this contract, less the accumulated benefit obligation covered by the contract. At December
31, 2004, the participating interest in the annuity contract was valued at $186 million and
consisted of $402 million in debt securities and $70 million in equity securities, less $286
million for the accumulated benefit obligation covered by the contract. At December 31, 2003, the
participating interest was valued at $169 million and consisted of $406 million in debt securities
and $63 million in equity securities, less $300 million for the accumulated benefit obligation.
The participating interest is not available for meeting general pension
benefit obligations in the near term. No future company contributions are required and no new
benefits are being accrued under this insurance annuity contract.



In the United States, plan asset allocation is managed on a gross asset basis, which includes the
market value of all investments held under the insurance annuity contract. On this basis,
weighted-average asset allocation is as follows:

Defined Contribution Plans

Most U.S. employees (excluding retail service station employees) are eligible to participate in the
ConocoPhillips Savings Plan (CPSP). Employees can deposit up to 30 percent of their pay in the
thrift feature of the CPSP to a choice of approximately 30 investment funds. ConocoPhillips
matches $1 for each $1 deposited, up to 1.25 percent of pay. Company contributions charged to
expense for the CPSP and predecessor plans, excluding the stock savings feature (discussed below),
were $17 million in 2004, $19 million in 2003, and $40 million in 2002.

The stock savings feature of the CPSP is a leveraged employee stock ownership plan. Employees may
elect to participate in the stock savings feature by contributing 1 percent of their salaries and
receiving an allocation of shares of common stock proportionate to their contributions.

In 1990, the Long-Term Stock Savings Plan of Phillips Petroleum Company (now the stock savings
feature of the CPSP) borrowed funds that were used to purchase previously unissued shares of
company common stock. Since the company guarantees the CPSP’s borrowings, the unpaid balance is
reported as a liability of the company and unearned compensation is shown as a reduction of common
stockholders’ equity. Dividends on all shares are charged against retained earnings. The debt is
serviced by the CPSP from company contributions and dividends received on certain shares of common
stock held by the plan, including all unallocated shares. The shares held by the stock savings
feature of the CPSP are released for allocation to participant accounts based on debt service
payments on CPSP borrowings. In addition, during the period from 2005 through 2008, when no debt
principal payments are scheduled to occur, the company has committed to make direct contributions
of stock to the stock savings feature of the CPSP, or make prepayments on CPSP borrowings, to
ensure a certain minimum level of stock allocation to participant accounts. The debt was
refinanced during 2004; however, there was no change to the stock allocation schedule.

We recognize interest expense as incurred and compensation expense based on the fair market value
of the stock contributed or on the cost of the unallocated shares released, using the
shares-allocated method. We recognized total CPSP expense related to the stock savings feature of
$88 million, $76 million and $39 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, all of which was
compensation expense. In 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, we made cash contributions to the CPSP
of $0.5 million, $0.2 million and $2 million. In 2004, 2003 and 2002, we contributed 1,209,904
shares, 1,483,780 shares and 771,479 shares, respectively, of company common stock from the
Compensation and Benefits Trust. The shares had a fair market value of $92 million, $80 million
and $41 million, respectively. Dividends used to service debt were $27 million in 2004 and $28
million each in 2003 and 2002. These dividends reduced the amount of compensation expense
recognized each period. Interest incurred on the CPSP debt in 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $5 million,
$5 million and $7 million, respectively.

The total CPSP stock savings feature shares as of December 31 were:

We have several defined contribution plans for our international employees, each with its own terms
and eligibility depending on location. Total compensation expense recognized for these
international plans was approximately $20 million in 2004 and 2003, and was not significant in 2002
because the majority of these plans were acquired in the merger.

Stock-Based Compensation Plans

The 2004 Omnibus Stock and Performance Incentive Plan (the Plan) was approved by shareholders in
May 2004. Over its 10-year life, the Plan allows the issuance of up to 35 million shares of our
common stock for compensation to our employees, directors and consultants. The Plan replaced three
heritage plans previously available to the company. Shares remaining available under the previous
plans will be used to offset the 35 million shares noted above, so that no more than 35 million
shares may be issued under the Plan. After approval of the Plan, the heritage plans were no longer
used for further awards. Of the 35 million shares available for issuance under the Plan, the
number of shares of common stock available for incentive stock options will be 20 million shares,
and no more than 20 million shares may be used for awards in stock.

Shares of company stock awarded to employees under the Plan and the heritage plans were:

Stock options granted under provisions of the Plan and earlier plans permit purchase of our common
stock at exercise prices equivalent to the average market price of the stock on the date the
options were granted. The options have terms of 10 years and normally become exercisable in
increments of up to one-third on each anniversary date following the date of grant. Stock
Appreciation Rights (SARs) may, from time to time, be affixed to the options. Options exercised in
the form of SARs permit the holder to receive stock, or a combination of cash and stock, subject to
a declining cap on the exercise price.

In August 2002, we issued 23.3 million vested stock options to replace unexercised Conoco stock
options at the time of the merger. These options had a weighted-average exercise price of $47.65
per option, and a Black-Scholes option-pricing model value of $16.50 per option.

For information on our 2003 adoption of SFAS No. 123, see Note 1—Accounting Policies.

Compensation and Benefits Trust (CBT)

The CBT is an irrevocable grantor trust, administered by an independent trustee and designed
to acquire, hold and distribute shares of our common stock to fund certain future compensation and
benefit obligations of the company. The CBT does not increase or alter the amount of benefits or
compensation that will be paid under existing plans, but offers us enhanced financial flexibility
in providing the funding requirements of those plans. We also have flexibility in determining the
timing of distributions of shares from the CBT to fund compensation and benefits, subject to a
minimum distribution schedule. The trustee votes shares held by the CBT in accordance with voting
directions from eligible employees, as specified in a trust agreement with the trustee.

We sold 29.2 million shares of previously unissued company common stock to the CBT in 1995 for $37
million of cash, previously contributed to the CBT by us, and a promissory note from the CBT to us
of $952 million. The CBT is consolidated by ConocoPhillips, therefore the cash contribution and
promissory note are eliminated in consolidation. Shares held by the CBT are valued at cost and do
not affect earnings per share or total common stockholders’ equity until after they are transferred
out of the CBT. In 2004 and 2003, shares transferred out of the CBT were 1,209,904 and 1,483,780,
respectively. At December 31, 2004, 24.1 million shares remained in the CBT. All shares are
required to be transferred out of the CBT by January 1, 2021.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax
purposes. Major components of deferred tax liabilities and assets at December 31 were:

*Certain amounts reclassified to conform with 2004 presentation.

Current assets, long-term assets, current liabilities and long-term liabilities included
deferred taxes of $85 million, $52 million, $45 million and $10,385 million, respectively, at
December 31, 2004, and $-0-million, $53 million, $209 million and $8,565 million, respectively, at
December 31, 2003.

We have loss and credit carryovers in multiple taxing jurisdictions. These attributes generally
expire between 2005 and 2016 with some carryovers having indefinite carryforward periods.

Valuation allowances have been established for certain loss and credit carryforwards that
reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized.
Uncertainties that may affect the realization of these assets include tax law changes and the
future level of product prices and costs. During 2004, valuation allowances increased $89
million. This reflects increases of $260 million primarily related to foreign tax loss
carryforwards, partially offset by decreases of $171 million, primarily related to foreign and
state tax loss carryforwards that have expired or that have been utilized. The balance
includes valuation allowances for certain deferred tax assets of $204 million, for which
subsequently recognized tax benefits, if any, will be allocated to goodwill. Based on our historical
taxable income, its expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies,
management expects that remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to
reversing deferred tax liabilities and as offsets to the tax consequences of future taxable
income.



In October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 was signed into law. The legislation
introduced a special one-time provision allowing earnings of controlled foreign companies to be
repatriated at a reduced tax rate. At this point, our investigation into our response to the
legislation is preliminary, as we await additional and final clarifying legislation and
guidance from the government. Because of the uncertainties related to this legislation, and as provided by FASB FSP No. 109-2, we
elected to defer our decision on potentially altering our current plans on
permanently reinvesting in certain foreign subsidiaries and foreign
corporate joint ventures. We expect final guidance to be
issued and our investigation into our response to the legislation to be completed late in 2005.

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, income considered to be permanently reinvested in certain
foreign subsidiaries and foreign corporate joint ventures totaled approximately $2,091 million
and $1,686 million, respectively. Deferred income taxes have not been provided on this income,
as we do not plan to initiate any action that would require the payment of income taxes. It is
not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable on this foreign
income if distributed.

Another provision of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 was a special deduction for
qualifying manufacturing activities. This benefit will be recognized in the year the benefit
is earned and did not impact our assessment of the need for potential valuation allowances.

The amounts of U.S. and foreign income from continuing operations before income taxes, with a
reconciliation of tax at the federal statutory rate with the provision for income taxes, were:

Our 2004 tax expense was reduced by $72 million due to the remeasurement of deferred tax
liabilities from the 2003 Canadian graduated tax rate reduction and a 2004 Alberta provincial tax
rate change. Our 2003 tax expense was reduced by $227 million as a result of tax law changes in
Norway, Canada and Timor Lesté due to adjustments of net deferred tax liabilities.

Note 27—Segment Disclosures and Related Information

We have organized our reporting structure based on the grouping of similar products and
services, resulting in six operating segments:

1)

E&P—This segment primarily explores for, produces and markets crude oil, natural gas,
and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. At December 31, 2004, E&P was producing in
the United States; the Norwegian and U.K. sectors of the North Sea; Canada; Nigeria;
Venezuela; the Timor Sea; offshore Australia and China; Indonesia; the United Arab
Emirates; Vietnam; and Russia. The E&P segment’s U.S. and international operations are
disclosed separately for reporting purposes.

2)

Midstream—Through both consolidated and equity interests, this segment gathers and
processes natural gas produced by ConocoPhillips and others, and fractionates and markets
natural gas liquids, primarily in the United States, Canada and Trinidad. The Midstream
segment includes our 30.3 percent equity investment in DEFS.

3)

R&M—This segment purchases, refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum
products, mainly in the United States, Europe and Asia. At December 31, 2004, we owned 12
refineries in the United States; one in the United Kingdom; one in Ireland; and had equity
interests in one refinery in Germany, two in the Czech Republic,
and one in Malaysia. The R&M segment’s U.S. and international operations are disclosed
separately for reporting purposes.



4)

LUKOIL Investment—This segment represents our investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL,
an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia. In October 2004,
we closed on a transaction to acquire 7.6 percent of LUKOIL’s shares held by the Russian
government. During the remainder of 2004, we increased our ownership to 10 percent.

5)

Chemicals—This segment manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a
worldwide basis. The Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in
CPChem.

6)

Emerging Businesses—This segment encompasses the development of new businesses beyond
our traditional operations. Emerging Businesses includes new technologies related to
natural gas conversion into clean fuels and related products (gas-to-liquids), technology
solutions, power generation, and emerging technologies.

Corporate and Other includes general corporate overhead; interest income and expense; preferred
dividend requirements of capital trusts; discontinued operations; restructuring charges; goodwill
resulting from the merger of Conoco and Phillips that had not yet been allocated to the operating
segments in 2002; certain eliminations; and various other corporate activities. Corporate assets
include all cash and cash equivalents.

We evaluate performance and allocate resources based on net income. Segment accounting policies
are the same as those in Note 1—Accounting Policies. Intersegment sales are at prices that
approximate market.

Note 28—New Accounting Standards and Emerging Issues

New Accounting Standards

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, “Exchange of Nonmonetary Assets an amendment
of APB Opinion No. 29.” This amendment eliminates the APB Opinion No. 29 exception for nonmonetary
exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with an exception for exchanges of
nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. This Statement is effective on a
prospective basis beginning July 1, 2005. We continue to evaluate this standard.



Also in December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment,” (SFAS
123(R)), which supercedes APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and
replaces SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” that we adopted at the beginning
of 2003. SFAS 123(R) prescribes the accounting for a wide range of share-based compensation
arrangements, including share options, restricted share plans, performance-based awards, share
appreciation rights, and employee share purchase plans, and generally requires the fair value of
share-based awards to be expensed in the income statement. We are studying the provisions of this
new pronouncement to determine the impact, if any, on our financial statements. For more
information on our adoption of SFAS No. 123 and its effect on net income, see Note 1—Accounting
Policies.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs an amendment of ARB No. 43,
Chapter 4.” This Statement requires that items, such as idle facility expense, excessive spoilage,
double freight, and re-handling costs, be recognized as a current-period charge. We are required
to implement this Statement in the first quarter of 2006. We are analyzing the provisions of this
standard to determine the effects, if any, on our financial statements.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of Liabilities and Equity,” to address the balance sheet classification of certain
financial instruments that have characteristics of both liabilities and equity. The Statement,
already effective for contracts created or modified after May 31, 2003, was originally intended to
become effective July 1, 2003, for all contracts existing at May 31, 2003. However, on November 7,
2003, the FASB issued an indefinite deferral of certain provisions of SFAS No. 150. We continue to
monitor and assess the FASB’s modifications of SFAS No. 150, but do not anticipate any material
impact to our financial statements.

Emerging Issues

At a November 2004 meeting, the EITF discussed Issue No. 04-13, “Accounting for Purchases and
Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty,” which addresses accounting issues that arise when
one company both sells inventory to and buys inventory from another company in the same line of
business. For additional information, see the Revenue Recognition section of Note 1—Accounting
Policies.

The FASB is currently reviewing the accounting guidance provided in SFAS No. 19, “Financial
Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies,” relating to exploratory costs that
have been capitalized, or “suspended,” on the balance sheet, pending a determination of whether
potential economic oil and gas reserves have been discovered. For additional information, see Note
9—Properties, Plants and Equipment.

In June 2004, the FASB published the Exposure Draft, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143.” This interpretation clarifies that an
entity is required to recognize a liability for a legal obligation to perform asset retirement
activities when the retirement is conditional on a future event if the liability’s fair value can
be reasonably estimated. If the liability’s fair value cannot be reasonably estimated, then the
entity must disclose (a) a description of the obligation, (b) the fact that a liability has not
been recognized because the fair value cannot be reasonably estimated, and (c) the reasons why the
fair value cannot be reasonably estimated. Depending on the FASB’s conclusions on this issue, it
is possible that we would need to reconsider our asset retirement obligations and related
disclosures for certain of our downstream assets (primarily refineries).



Note 29—Subsequent Events

On February 4, 2005, we announced a stock repurchase program that provides for the repurchase of up
to $1 billion of the company’s common stock over a period of up to two years. The program will
serve as a means of offsetting dilution to shareholders from the company’s stock-based compensation
programs. Acquisitions for the share repurchase program will be made at management’s discretion at
prevailing prices, subject to market conditions and other factors. Purchases may be increased,
decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice. Shares of stock repurchased under the
plan will be held as treasury shares.

We participated in negotiations throughout 2004 with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA), U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the states of Louisiana, Illinois, Pennsylvania, New
Jersey, and the Northwest Clean Air Agency (the state of Washington) to settle allegations arising
out of the EPA’s national enforcement initiative, as well as other related Clean Air Act regulation
issues. In January 2005, we entered into a consent decree with the United States and the local
agency and states named above. In the consent decree, we agreed to reduce air emissions from
refineries in Washington, California, Texas, Louisiana, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey over
the next eight years. We plan to spend an estimated $525 million over that time period to install
control technology and equipment to reduce emissions from stacks, vents, valves, heaters, boilers,
and flares.

On February 24, 2005, ConocoPhillips and Duke Energy Corporation (Duke) agreed to terms to
restructure their respective ownership levels in DEFS, which would cause DEFS to become a jointly
controlled venture, owned 50 percent by each company. This restructuring has been approved by the
Boards of Directors of both owners. We will increase our current 30.3 percent ownership in DEFS to
50 percent through a series of direct and indirect transfers of Midstream assets from
ConocoPhillips to Duke, a disproportionate cash distribution to Duke from the sale of DEFS’ general
partner interest in TEPPCO Partners, L.P., and a final cash payment to Duke of approximately $200
million, which we expect to fund from our general liquidity resources. The restructuring is
expected to close in the second quarter of 2005, subject to normal regulatory approvals. Once
completed, our Midstream segment will consist primarily of our 50 percent equity method interest in
DEFS.



Oil and Gas Operations

(Unaudited)

In accordance with SFAS No. 69, “Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities,” and
regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), we are making certain
supplemental disclosures about our oil and gas exploration and production operations. While this
information was developed with reasonable care and disclosed in good faith, it is emphasized that
some of the data is necessarily imprecise and represents only approximate amounts because of the
subjective judgments involved in developing such information. Accordingly, this information may
not necessarily represent our current financial condition or our expected future results.

These disclosures include information about our consolidated oil and gas activities and our
proportionate share of our equity affiliates’ oil and gas activities, covering both those in our
Exploration & Production segment, as well as in our LUKOIL Investment segment. As a result,
amounts reported as Equity Affiliates in Oil and Gas Operations may differ from those shown in the
individual segment disclosures reported elsewhere in this report. The data included for the LUKOIL
Investment segment reflects the company’s estimated share of LUKOIL’s amounts. Because LUKOIL’s
accounting cycle close and preparation of U.S. GAAP financial statements occurs subsequent to our
accounting cycle close, our equity share of financial information and statistics for 2004 from our
LUKOIL investment are an estimate. Our estimated year-end 2004 reserves related to our equity
investment in LUKOIL were based on LUKOIL’s year-end 2003 reserves without any provision for
potential 2004 reserve additions, and included adjustments to conform to ConocoPhillips’ reserve
policy and provide for estimated 2004 production. Other financial information and statistics were
based on market indicators, historical production trends of LUKOIL, and other factors. Any
differences between the estimate and actual financial information and statistics will be recorded
in a subsequent period.

The information about our proportionate share of equity affiliates is necessary for a full
understanding of our operations because equity affiliate operations are an integral part of the
overall success of our oil and gas operations.

Our disclosures by geographic area include the United States (U.S.), European North Sea (Norway and
the United Kingdom), Asia Pacific, Canada and Other Areas. In these supplemental oil and gas disclosures, when we use equity accounting for
operations that have proved reserves, these operations are not included in the consolidated operations information. Instead, they are shown separately and
designated as Equity Affiliates. Prior to 2004, Equity Affiliates consisted of two heavy-oil
projects in Venezuela, an oil development project in northern Russia, and a heavy-oil project in
Canada. In addition, 2004 included certain operations related to our investment in LUKOIL. Equity
Affiliate operations at the end of 2004 would geographically be classified as Other Areas.

Amounts in 2002 were impacted by the merger of Conoco and Phillips (the merger) in late August
2002.

n

Revisions in 2004 in Canada were primarily related to Surmont
as a result of low December 31, 2004, bitumen values.

n

Purchases in 2004 were associated with LUKOIL. Purchases in
2002 were primarily related to the merger.

n

Extensions and discoveries in Other Areas in 2004 were
primarily attributable to Kashagan in Kazakhstan and in 2003
were primarily related to Surmont in Canada. Surmont uses Steam
Assisted Gravity Drainage, an improved recovery method.

n

In addition to conventional crude oil, natural gas and
natural gas liquids (NGL) proved reserves, we have proved oil
sands reserves in Canada, associated with a Syncrude project
totaling 258 million barrels at the end of 2004. For
internal management purposes, we view these reserves and
their development as part of our total exploration and
production operations. However, U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission regulations define these reserves as mining
related. Therefore, they are not included in our tabular
presentation of proved crude oil, natural gas and NGL
reserves. These oil sands reserves also are not included in
the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows
relating to proved oil and gas reserve quantities.

Includes $126 million, $63 million and $27 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, for a Syncrude oil project in Canada that is defined as a mining operation by
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regulations.





n

The provision for income taxes is computed by adjusting each country’s income before income
taxes for permanent differences related to the oil and gas producing activities that are
reflected in our consolidated income tax expense for the period, multiplying the result by the
country’s statutory tax rate and adjusting for applicable tax credits. In 2003, this included

benefit related to the reduction in the Canada and Alberta provincial tax rates, a $46 million

Capitalized costs include the cost of equipment and facilities for oil and
gas producing activities. These costs include the activities of our E&P and LUKOIL
Investment segments, excluding pipeline and marine operations, liquefied natural gas
operations, a Canadian Syncrude operation, crude oil and natural gas marketing activities,
and downstream operations.

n

Proved properties include capitalized costs for oil and gas leaseholds holding proved
reserves; development wells and related equipment and facilities (including uncompleted
development well costs); and support equipment.

n

Unproved properties include capitalized costs for oil and gas leaseholds under
exploration (including where petroleum liquids and natural gas were found but determination
of the economic viability of the required infrastructure is dependent upon further
exploratory work under way or firmly planned) and for uncompleted exploratory well costs,
including exploratory wells under evaluation.



n

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows
Relating to Proved Oil and Gas Reserve Quantities

Amounts are computed using year-end prices and costs (adjusted only for existing contractual
changes), appropriate statutory tax rates and a prescribed 10 percent discount factor.
Continuation of year-end economic conditions also is assumed. The calculation is based on
estimates of proved reserves, which are revised over time as new data become available. Probable
or possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, are not considered. The calculation
also requires assumptions as to the timing of future production of proved reserves, and the timing
and amount of future development, including dismantlement, and production costs.

While due care was taken in its preparation, we do not represent that this data is the fair value
of our oil and gas properties, or a fair estimate of the present value of cash flows to be obtained
from their development and production.

The net change in prices, and production and transportation costs is the
beginning-of-the-year reserve-production forecast multiplied by the net annual change in the
per-unit sales price, and production and transportation cost, discounted at 10 percent.

n

Purchases and sales of reserves in place, along with extensions, discoveries and improved
recovery, are calculated using production forecasts of the applicable reserve quantities for
the year multiplied by the end-of-the-year sales prices, less future estimated costs,
discounted at 10 percent.

n

The accretion of discount is 10 percent of the prior year’s discounted future cash inflows,
less future production, transportation and development costs.

n

The net change in income taxes is the annual change in the discounted future income tax
provisions. The 2003 and 2002 amounts have been revised due to the
correction of disclosure calculations.

securities. In addition, ConocoPhillips Company and ConocoPhillips Holding Company have fully and
unconditionally guaranteed the payment obligations of ConocoPhillips with respect to its publicly

•

ConocoPhillips, ConocoPhillips Holding Company, and ConocoPhillips Company (in each
case, reflecting investments in subsidiaries utilizing the equity method of accounting).

•

All other non-guarantor subsidiaries of ConocoPhillips Holding Company and
ConocoPhillips Company.

•

The consolidating adjustments necessary to present ConocoPhillips’ results on a
consolidated basis.

This condensed consolidating financial information should be read in conjunction with the
accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes. Certain amounts in 2003 have been
reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Effective January 1, 2005, ConocoPhillips Holding Company was merged into ConocoPhillips Company.
This new structure will be reflected in the condensed consolidating financial information included
in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2005.

Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

As of December 31, 2004, with the participation of our management, our Chairman, President and
Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President, Finance, and Chief Financial Officer

business. In a future phase scheduled for 2005, the remaining portion of these commodity streams
will be moved into the system.
