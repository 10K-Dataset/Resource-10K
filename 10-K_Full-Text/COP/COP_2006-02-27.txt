Items 1 and 2.         BUSINESS
AND PROPERTIES

CORPORATE
STRUCTURE

ConocoPhillips is an
international, integrated energy company. 
ConocoPhillips was incorporated in the state of Delaware on November 16,
2001, in connection with, and in anticipation of, the merger between Conoco
Inc. (Conoco) and Phillips Petroleum Company (Phillips).  The merger between Conoco and Phillips (the
merger) was consummated on August 30, 2002, at which time Conoco and Phillips
combined their businesses by merging with separate acquisition subsidiaries of
ConocoPhillips.  For accounting purposes,
Phillips was designated as the acquirer of Conoco and ConocoPhillips was
treated as the successor of Phillips. 
Accordingly, Phillips’ operations and results are presented in this Form
10-K for all periods prior to the close of the merger.  From the merger date forward, the operations
and results of ConocoPhillips reflect the combined operations of the two
companies.  Subsequent to the merger,
Conoco and Phillips were renamed, but for ease of reference, those companies
will be referred to respectively in this document as Conoco and Phillips.

Our business is organized into
six operating segments:

•

Exploration and
Production (E&P) —

This segment primarily
explores for, produces and markets crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas
liquids on a worldwide basis.

•

Midstream—

This segment gathers and processes natural gas produced by
ConocoPhillips and others, and fractionates and markets natural gas liquids,
primarily in the United States, Canada and Trinidad.  The Midstream segment primarily consists of
our 50 percent equity investment in Duke Energy Field Services, LLC (DEFS), a
joint venture with Duke Energy Corporation.

•

Refining and
Marketing (R&M) —

This segment purchases,
refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products, mainly in the
United States, Europe and Asia.

•

LUKOIL
Investment—

This segment consists of
our equity investment in the ordinary shares of OAO LUKOIL (LUKOIL), an
international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in Russia.  Our investment was 16.1 percent at
December 31, 2005.

•

Chemicals—

This segment manufactures and markets petrochemicals and
plastics on a worldwide basis.  The
Chemicals segment consists of our 50 percent equity investment in Chevron
Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem), a joint venture with Chevron
Corporation.


•

Emerging
Businesses—

This segment encompasses
the development of new businesses beyond our traditional operations, including
new technologies related to natural gas conversion into clean fuels and related
products (e.g., gas-to-liquids), technology solutions, power generation, and
emerging technologies.

At December 31, 2005,
ConocoPhillips employed approximately 35,600 people.

SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

For operating segment and
geographic information, see Note 26—Segment Disclosures and Related Information
in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which is incorporated herein
by reference.

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION (E&P)

At December 31, 2005, our
E&P segment represented 57 percent of ConocoPhillips’ total assets,
while contributing 62 percent of net income.

This segment explores for,
produces and markets crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids on a
worldwide basis.  It also mines deposits
of oil sands in Canada to extract the bitumen and upgrade it into a synthetic
crude oil.  Operations to liquefy and
transport natural gas are also included in the E&P segment.  At December 31, 2005, our E&P operations
were producing in the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Venezuela,
Indonesia, offshore Timor Leste in the Timor Sea, Australia, Vietnam, China,
Nigeria, the United Arab Emirates, and Russia.

The E&P segment does not
include the financial results or statistics from our equity investment in the
ordinary shares of LUKOIL, which are reported in a separate segment (LUKOIL
Investment).  As a result, references to
results, production, prices and other statistics throughout the E&P segment
exclude those related to our equity investment in LUKOIL.  However, our share of LUKOIL is included in
the supplemental oil and gas operations disclosures on pages 170 through 185.

The information listed below
appears in the supplemental oil and gas operations disclosures and is
incorporated herein by reference:

•

Proved worldwide
crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves.

•

Net production
of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids.

•

Average sales
prices of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids.

•

Average
production costs per barrel-of-oil-equivalent.

•

Net wells
completed, wells in progress, and productive wells.

•

Developed and
undeveloped acreage.

In 2005, E&P’s worldwide
production, including its share of equity affiliates’ production other than
LUKOIL, averaged 1,543,000 barrels-of-oil-equivalent (BOE) per day, about
the same as the 1,542,000 BOE per day averaged in 2004.  During 2005, 633,000 BOE per day were
produced in the United States, a slight increase from 629,000 BOE per day in
2004.  Production from our international
E&P operations averaged 910,000 BOE per day in 2005, a slight decrease
from 913,000 BOE per day in 2004. 
In addition, our Canadian Syncrude mining operations had net production
of 19,000 barrels per day in 2005, compared with 21,000 barrels per
day in 2004.  Benefiting 2005 production
was the startup of the


Hamaca upgrader in Venezuela in
the fourth quarter of 2004; the Bayu-Undan field in the Timor Sea, which was
still ramping up during 2004; and a full year’s production from the Magnolia
field in the Gulf of Mexico, which continued to ramp-up during 2005. These
benefits were offset by scheduled and unscheduled maintenance and normal field
production declines.  We convert our
natural gas production to BOE based on a 6:1 ratio: six thousand cubic
feet of natural gas equals one barrel-of-oil-equivalent.

E&P’s worldwide annual
average crude oil sales price increased 38 percent in 2005, from
$36.06 per barrel to $49.87 per barrel.  E&P’s annual average worldwide natural
gas sales price also increased, from $4.61 per thousand cubic feet in 2004
to $6.30 per thousand cubic feet in 2005.

E&P—U.S. OPERATIONS

In 2005, U.S. E&P
operations contributed 40 percent of E&P’s worldwide liquids
production and 42 percent of natural gas production, the same as in 2004.

Alaska

Greater Prudhoe Area

The Greater Prudhoe Area is
comprised of the Prudhoe Bay field and satellites, as well as the Greater Point
McIntyre Area fields.  We have a
36.1 percent interest in all fields within the Greater Prudhoe Area, all
of which are operated by BP p.l.c.

The Prudhoe Bay field is the
largest oil field on Alaska’s North Slope. 
It is the site of a large waterflood and enhanced oil recovery
operation, as well as a gas processing plant that processes and reinjects
natural gas back into the reservoir.  Our
net crude oil production from the Prudhoe Bay field averaged
102,100 barrels per day in 2005, compared with 109,600 barrels per
day in 2004, while natural gas liquids production averaged 18,500 barrels
per day in 2005, compared with 22,100 barrels per day in 2004.

Prudhoe Bay satellite fields,
including Aurora, Borealis, Polaris, Midnight Sun, and Orion, produced
14,500 net barrels per day of crude oil in 2005, compared with
14,600 net barrels per day in 2004. 
All Prudhoe Bay satellite fields produce through the Prudhoe Bay
production facilities.

The Greater Point McIntyre Area
(GPMA) primarily is made up of the Point McIntyre, Niakuk, and Lisburne
fields.  The fields within the GPMA
generally produce through the Lisburne Production Center.  Net crude oil production for GPMA averaged
15,200 barrels per day in 2005, compared with 17,800 barrels per day
in 2004, while natural gas liquids production averaged 1,000 barrels per day in
2005, the same as 2004.  The bulk of this
production came from the Point McIntyre field, which is approximately seven
miles north of the Prudhoe Bay field and extends into the Beaufort Sea.

In January 2005, the governor
of Alaska announced that, effective February 1, 2005, most satellite fields
surrounding the Prudhoe Bay field would no longer qualify for a lower
production tax rate that was intended to encourage development of these
marginal deposits.  Accordingly,
beginning in February 2005, the production tax for these satellite fields is
the same rate as Prudhoe Bay.

Greater Kuparuk Area

We operate the Greater Kuparuk
Area, which is comprised of the Kuparuk field and four satellite fields: Tarn,
Tabasco, Meltwater, and West Sak.  Our
ownership interest is 55.3 percent in the Kuparuk field, which is located
about 40 miles west of Prudhoe Bay. 
Field installations include three central production facilities that
separate oil, natural gas and water.  The
natural gas is either used for fuel or compressed for reinjection.  Our net crude oil production from the Kuparuk
field averaged 64,600 barrels per day in 2005, compared with
67,900 barrels per day in 2004.


Other fields within the Greater
Kuparuk Area produced 16,000 net barrels per day of crude oil in 2005,
compared with 19,300 net barrels per day in 2004, primarily from the Tarn,
Tabasco, and Meltwater satellites.  We
have a 55.4 percent interest in Tarn and Tabasco and a 55.5 percent
interest in Meltwater.

The Greater Kuparuk Area also includes
the West Sak heavy-oil field.  Our net
crude oil production from West Sak averaged 5,300 barrels per day in 2005,
compared with 5,500 barrels per day in 2004. 
We have a 52.2 percent interest in this field.

During 2004, we and our
co-venturers announced plans for the expansion of the West Sak
development.  The development program
includes two drill sites: Drill Site 1E, which is an existing Kuparuk drill
site, and Drill Site 1J, which is the first stand-alone West Sak drill
site.  Drill Site 1E started up in July
2004, and its 13-well drilling program was completed in late 2005.  The 1J drilling program, consisting of
31 wells, began in 2005, with first production in October 2005.  Peak production is expected in 2007.

In evaluation of other areas for possible West Sak development, two
successful appraisal wells were completed in 2005.

Western North Slope

The Alpine field, located west
of the Kuparuk field, began production in November 2000.  In 2005, the field produced at a net rate of
76,600 barrels of oil per day, compared with 63,500 barrels per day in
2004. The increased production was the result of the capacity expansion
projects discussed below.  We are the
operator and hold a 78 percent interest in Alpine.

During 2004, the Alpine Capacity Expansion Phase I
project was completed.  As a result,
Alpine’s gross crude oil production capacity increased approximately 5,000
barrels per day, along with an increase in the site’s produced-water handling
capacity.  Originally designed to process
about 10,000 barrels per day of produced water, the site can now process about
100,000 barrels per day of produced water. 
Phase II was completed in 2005, after which Alpine’s crude oil
production capacity was further expanded by approximately 30,000 gross barrels
per day with increased seawater injection rates to boost reservoir pressure.

In November 2004, the U.S.
Department of Interior Bureau of Land Management (BLM) issued a favorable
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) Record of Decision to develop future Alpine
satellites.  Subsequently, in December
2004, we and our co-venturers announced that the companies approved the
development of two Alpine satellite oil fields—Fiord and Nanuq.  The project will include two satellite drill
sites—CD 3 on the Fiord oil field, and CD 4 on the Nanuq oil field—located
within an 8-mile radius of the Alpine oil field.  Plans call for the drilling of approximately
40 wells, with first production scheduled for late 2006 and peak production
in 2008.  The oil will be processed through
the existing Alpine facilities.  The
companies intend to seek state, local and federal permits for additional Alpine
satellite developments in the National Petroleum Reserve—Alaska (NPR-A).  A final decision to move forward on these
additional satellite oil fields is not expected to be made until the outcomes
of remaining permits are known.

Cook Inlet

Our assets in Alaska also
include the North Cook Inlet field, the Beluga River natural gas field, and the
Kenai liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility.

We have a 100 percent
interest in the North Cook Inlet field. 
Net production in 2005 averaged 105 million cubic feet per day of
natural gas, compared with 94 million cubic feet per day in 2004.  Production from the North Cook Inlet field is
used to supply our share of gas to the Kenai LNG plant (discussed below).


Our interest in the Beluga
River field is 33 percent.  Net
production averaged 57 million cubic feet per day of natural gas in 2005,
compared with 63 million cubic feet per day in 2004.  Gas from the Beluga River field is sold to
local utilities and industrial consumers, and is used as back-up supply to the
Kenai LNG plant.

We have a 70 percent
interest in the Kenai LNG plant, which supplies LNG to two utility companies in
Japan, utilizing two LNG tankers for transport. 
We sold 42.8 net billion cubic feet of LNG to Japan in 2005,
compared with 38.6 net billion cubic feet in 2004.

Exploration

During 2005, we drilled five North Slope
exploration and appraisal wells.  This
activity included two wildcat wells in the NPR-A, one infrastructure-led
exploration (ILX) well near the Alpine field, and two appraisal wells in the
West Sak field.  The two NPR-A wells and
the ILX well were classified as dry holes, but the data gathered is being
further evaluated for a future development opportunity.  Additionally, we completed an evaluation of the
economic viability of exploration and appraisal wells drilled in prior years,
and classified five wells as dry holes.

We were also the successful bidder acquiring
66,262 gross and net acres at the Minerals Management Service oil and gas lease
sale in the Beaufort Sea held on March 30, 2005.  Furthermore, we acquired 21,320 gross and net
acres directly from another company in July 2005.  As a result of acquiring this additional
acreage, we had under lease approximately 1.7 million net undeveloped
acres (onshore and offshore) as of December 31, 2005, in Alaska.

Transportation

We
transport the petroleum liquids produced on the North Slope to market through
the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS), an 800-mile pipeline, marine terminal,
spill response and escort vessel system that ties the North Slope of Alaska to
the port of Valdez in south-central Alaska.

A project to upgrade TAPS’ pump stations began in 2004 and is expected to
be completed in 2006.  We have a 28.3 percent ownership interest in
TAPS.  We also have ownership interests
in the Alpine, Kuparuk and Oliktok pipelines on the North Slope.

We
continue to evaluate a gas pipeline project to deliver natural gas from
Alaska’s North Slope to the Lower 48. 
The Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline Act was passed by the U.S. Congress and
signed by the President in October 2004. 
This legislation was designed to help facilitate and streamline the
federal regulatory process and provides up to $18 billion in federal loan
guarantees.  Also approved was federal
tax legislation granting seven-year depreciation for the Alaska portion of the
pipeline and confirming the existing 15 percent enhanced oil recovery tax
credit would apply to the gas treatment plant.

In October 2005, we announced that we reached an agreement
in principle with the state of Alaska on the base fiscal contract terms for an
Alaskan natural gas pipeline project.  In
early 2006, the state of Alaska announced that they had reached an agreement in
principle with all the co-venturers in the project.  Once a final form of agreement is reached
among all the parties, it will be subject to final approval by the Alaska State
Legislature before it can be executed. Additional agreements for the gas to
transit Canada will also be required.

Our wholly owned subsidiary,
Polar Tankers, Inc., manages the marine transportation of our Alaska North
Slope production.  Polar Tankers operates
six ships in the Alaskan trade, chartering additional third-party-operated
vessels, as necessary.  Beginning with
the

Polar Endeavour

in 2001,
Polar Tankers has brought into service a new Endeavour Class tanker each year
through 2004: the

Polar Resolution

in 2002; the

Polar Discovery

in
2003; and the

Polar Adventure

in
2004.  These 140,000-deadweight-ton,
double-hulled crude oil tankers are the first four of five Endeavour Class
tankers that we are adding to our Alaska-trade fleet.  The fifth and final tanker is scheduled to be
in Alaska North Slope service in 2006, although contractual and hurricane-related
issues may further delay delivery of this last vessel.


Lower 48
States

Gulf of Mexico

At year-end 2005, our portfolio
of producing properties in the Gulf of Mexico included four fields operated by
us and five fields operated by our co-venturers.

We operate and hold a 75 percent interest in
the Magnolia field in Garden Banks 783 and 784. 
The Magnolia field is developed from a tension-leg platform in 4,700
feet of water.  Production from Magnolia
began in December 2004.  Well completion
activities continued throughout 2005, and will continue into mid-2006.  Net production from Magnolia averaged
18,700 barrels per day of liquids and 43 million cubic feet per day
of natural gas in 2005.  Hurricanes shut
in Magnolia for approximately 20 days in 2005, but only caused minimal damage.

We hold a 16 percent interest
in the Ursa field located in the Mississippi Canyon area.  Ursa utilizes a tension-leg platform in
approximately 3,900 feet of water.  We
also own a 16 percent interest in the Princess field, a northern, subsalt
extension of the Ursa field.  Our total
net production from the unitized area in 2005 averaged 13,500 barrels per
day of liquids and 16 million cubic feet per day of natural gas, compared
with 21,000 barrels per day of liquids and 30 million cubic feet per day
of natural gas in 2004.

The lower 2005 average daily production rate
was due to Ursa/Princess being shut in, or significantly curtailed, for
approximately 85 days in 2005 for hurricanes and repairs to infrastructure
following hurricane Katrina. 
Ursa/Princess resumed production at a curtailed rate in mid-November
2005, and returned to full production in late-December 2005.

We have a 16.8 percent interest
in the K2 field.  K2 is a subsea
development located in Green Canyon Block 562. 
First production began in May 2005, and our net production averaged
700 BOE per day in 2005.  Hurricanes

shut in K2 for
approximately 22 days in 2005, but caused no damage to the field.  Drilling and completion activities will
continue into early 2006, with peak net production of 6,000 BOE per day
expected in 2006.

Onshore

Our onshore Lower 48 production
primarily consists of natural gas, with the majority of the production located
in the Lobo Trend in South Texas, the San Juan Basin of New Mexico, and the
Guymon-Hugoton Trend in the Panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma.  We also have oil and natural gas production
from the Permian Basin in West Texas and southeast New Mexico.  Other positions and production are maintained
in the onshore Upper Texas Gulf Coast, East Texas and North Louisiana areas.  In addition to our coalbed methane production
from the San Juan Basin, we also hold coalbed methane acreage positions in the
Uinta Basin in Utah and the Black Warrior Basin in Alabama.  Our interest in the coalbed methane acreage
position in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming was traded in early 2005 for
additional interests in Texas properties that integrate well with our existing
assets.

Activities in 2005 primarily
were centered on continued optimization and development of these assets.  Combined production from Lower 48 onshore
fields in 2005 averaged a net 1,147 million cubic feet per day of natural
gas and 54,900 barrels per day of liquids, compared with 1,184 million
cubic feet per day of natural gas and 54,100 barrels per day of liquids in
2004.

E&P—NORTHWEST EUROPE

In 2005, E&P operations in
Northwest Europe contributed 27 percent of E&P’s worldwide liquids
production, compared with 29 percent in 2004. 
Northwest Europe operations contributed 31 percent of natural gas
production in 2005, compared with 34 percent in 2004.  Our Northwest European assets are principally
located in the Norwegian and U.K. sectors of the North Sea.


Norway

The Greater Ekofisk Area is
located approximately 200 miles offshore Norway in the center of the North
Sea.  The Greater Ekofisk Area is
comprised of four producing fields: Ekofisk, Eldfisk, Embla, and Tor.  The Ekofisk complex serves as a hub for
petroleum operations in the area, with surrounding developments utilizing the
Ekofisk infrastructure.  Net production
in 2005 from the Greater Ekofisk Area was 124,800 barrels of liquids per
day and 122 million cubic feet of natural gas per day, compared with
127,400 barrels of liquids per day and 125 million cubic feet of natural
gas per day in 2004.  We are operator and
hold a 35.1 percent interest in Ekofisk.

In 2003, we and our
co-venturers approved a plan for further development of the Greater Ekofisk
Area.  The project consists of two
interrelated components: construction of a new platform, Ekofisk 2/4M, and
modification of the existing Ekofisk and Eldfisk complexes to increase
processing capacity.  Construction began
in 2003, and production from the new 2/4M platform commenced in October 2005.

We also have ownership
interests in other producing fields in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea
and Norwegian Sea, including a 24.3 percent interest in the Heidrun field,
a 10.3 percent interest in the Statfjord field, a 23.3 percent interest in the
Huldra field, a 1.6 percent interest in the Troll field, a
9.1 percent interest in the Visund field, a 6.4 percent interest in the
Grane field, and a 2.4 percent interest in the Oseberg area.  Production from these and other fields in the
Norwegian sector of the North Sea and the Norwegian Sea averaged a net
81,900 barrels of liquids per day and 150 million cubic feet of
natural gas per day in 2005, compared with 87,700 barrels of liquids per
day and 176 million cubic feet of natural gas per day in 2004.

We and our co-venturers
received approval from Norwegian authorities in 2004 for the Alvheim North Sea
development.  The development plans
include a floating production storage and offloading vessel and subsea
installations.  Production from the field
is expected to commence in 2007.  We have
a 20 percent interest in the project.

In 2005, approval was received
from the Norwegian and U.K. authorities to proceed with a further development
of the Statfjord area.  The project,
named the “Statfjord Late-Life Project,” is a gas recovery project, with
production startup targeted for the late-2007 time frame.  We have a combined Norway/U.K. 15.2 percent
interest in this project.

Transportation

We have interests in the
transportation and processing infrastructure in the Norwegian North Sea,
including a 35.1 percent interest in the Norpipe Oil Pipeline System, a
2.3 percent interest in Gassled, which owns most of the Norwegian gas
transportation system, and a 1.6 percent interest in the southern part of the
planned Langeled gas pipeline.

Exploration

Four exploration wells were
completed in 2005.  Three near-field
exploration wells were drilled in the Oseberg and Troll licences, one of which
was successful.  An additional well was
drilled in the Voring Basin and tested hydrocarbons.  Although the well was expensed as a dry hole,
we plan to conduct further appraisal.  A
further near-field well was started in 2005, located within the Troll license,
with operations continuing into 2006.

United
Kingdom

We are a joint operator of the
Britannia natural gas/condensate field, in which we have a 58.7 percent
interest.  Our net production from
Britannia averaged 315 million cubic feet of natural gas per day and
13,100 barrels of liquids per day in 2005, compared with 347 million cubic
feet of natural gas per day and


15,500 barrels of liquids per
day in 2004.  Oil and gas production from
Britannia is delivered by pipeline to Scotland. 
Development drilling in the Britannia field is expected to continue into
the year 2007.

In
December 2003, we approved a plan for the development of two new Britannia
satellite fields: Callanish and Brodgar. 
The U.K. government approved the development plan in early 2004.

The development plan involves
producing the fields via subsea manifolds and two new pipelines to
Britannia.  A new platform, bridge-linked
to Britannia, will also be installed to separate production prior to processing
on the Britannia platform.  Drilling was
completed in the fourth quarter of 2005, with the pipelines, manifolds and installation
of the bridge-linked platform anticipated for 2006.  First production is targeted for 2007.

We have a 75 percent interest in the
Brodgar field and an 83.5 percent interest in the Callanish field.

We operate and hold a
36.5 percent interest in the Judy/Joanne fields, which together comprise J-Block.  Additionally, the Jade field produces from a
wellhead platform and pipeline tied to the J-Block facilities.  We are the operator of, and hold a
32.5 percent interest in, Jade. 
Together, these fields produced a net 14,100 barrels of liquids per
day and 123 million cubic feet of natural gas per day in 2005, compared
with 14,100 barrels of liquids per day and 118 million cubic feet of natural
gas per day in 2004.

We
continue to supply gas from J-Block to Enron Capital and Trade Resources Limited
(Enron Capital), which was placed in Administration in the United Kingdom in
November 2001.  We have been paid all
amounts currently due and payable by Enron Capital in respect of the J-Block
gas sales agreement.  We believe that
Enron Capital will continue to pay the amounts due for gas supplied by us in
accordance with the terms of the gas sales agreement.  We do not currently expect that we will have
to curtail sales of gas under the gas sales agreement or shut in production as
a result of the Administration of Enron Capital.  However, in the event that the arrangements
for the processing of Enron Capital’s gas are terminated or Enron Capital goes
into liquidation, there may be additional risk of production being reduced or
shut in.

We have various ownership
interests in 15 producing gas fields in the southern North Sea, in the
Rotliegendes and Carboniferous areas. 
Net production in 2005 averaged 278 million cubic feet per day of
natural gas and 1,200 barrels of liquids per day, compared with 306 million
cubic feet per day of natural gas and 1,400 barrels per day of liquids in 2004.

In 2004, we received approval
from the U.K. government for development of the Saturn Unit Area in the
southern North Sea.  First gas production
from the Saturn Unit Area began in September 2005, with net production expected
to increase as development drilling continues. 
Initially, the development consists of three wells from a six-slot
wellhead platform.  We are the operator
of the Saturn Unit Area with a 42.9 percent interest.

In 2005, we received U.K.
government approval for the Munro development. 
First production from Munro was achieved in August 2005, from a single
well platform that is tied into the Caister-Murdoch System infrastructure.  We are the operator of Munro with a 46
percent interest.

We also have ownership
interests in several other producing fields in the U.K. North Sea, including a
23.4 percent interest in the Alba field, a 40 percent interest in the
MacCulloch field, a 30 percent interest in the Miller field, an 11.5 percent
interest in the Armada field, and a 4.8 percent interest in the Statfjord
field.  Production from these and the
other remaining fields in the U.K. sector of the North Sea averaged a net 35,400 barrels
of liquids per day and 34 million cubic feet of natural gas per day in
2005, compared with 38,800 barrels of liquids per day and 47 million cubic feet
of natural gas per day in 2004.

We have a 24 percent interest
in the Clair field development in the Atlantic Margin.  First production from Clair began in early
2005, with plateau production expected in 2007. 
The Clair development includes a conventional platform with production
and process topsides facilities supported by a fixed-steel jacket.  Oil


from the field is exported to
the Sullom Voe terminal in Shetland via pipeline, while natural gas is carried
through a spur line into the Magnus enhanced oil recovery trunk line.

Transportation

The Interconnector pipeline,
which connects the United Kingdom and Belgium, facilitates marketing natural
gas produced in the United Kingdom throughout Europe.  Our 10 percent equity share of the
Interconnector pipeline allows us to ship approximately 200 million net
cubic feet of natural gas per day to markets in continental Europe, and our
reverse-flow rights provide an 85 million net cubic feet of natural gas
import capability to the United Kingdom.

We operate two terminals in the
United Kingdom: the Teesside oil terminal (in which we have a 29.3 percent
interest) and the Theddlethorpe gas terminal (in which we have a 50 percent
interest).

Exploration

In the U.K. sector of the North
Sea, we participated in four exploration wells and one appraisal well in
2005.  Drilling operations have been
concluded on one well in the southern North Sea and another in the J-Block
area, both of which were successful. 
Three further wells were started in 2005, one in the Britannia area, one
in the J-Block area, and one adjacent to the Clair field in the Atlantic Margin.  Operation on these wells continued into 2006.

Denmark

Exploration

We hold two exploration
licenses in Denmark: 5/98 (Hejre) and 4/98 (Svane).  Drilling and testing of an appraisal well,
adjacent to a 2001 discovery in the Hejre license, was completed in 2005.  The well was successful.

E&P—CANADA

In 2005, E&P operations in
Canada contributed 3 percent of E&P’s worldwide liquids production
(excluding Syncrude production), compared with 4 percent in 2004.  Canadian operations contributed 13 percent
of natural gas production in 2005, the same as in 2004.

Oil and
Gas Operations

Western Canada

Operations in western Canada
encompass properties in Alberta, northeastern British Columbia and southwestern
Saskatchewan.  We separate our holdings
in western Canada into four geographic regions. 
The north region contains a mix of oil and natural gas, and primarily is
accessible only in the winter.  The
central and west regions mainly produce natural gas, including a coalbed
methane program in the central region.  The
south region has shallow gas and medium-to-heavy oil.  Production from these oil and gas operations
in western Canada averaged a net 32,300 barrels per day of liquids and
425 million cubic feet per day of natural gas in 2005, compared with
35,000 barrels per day of liquids and 433 million cubic feet per day of natural
gas in 2004.

Surmont

The Surmont lease is located
approximately 35 miles south of Fort McMurray, Alberta.  We own a 50 percent interest and are the
operator.  In May 2003, we received regulatory
approval to develop the Surmont project from the Alberta Energy and Utilities
Board and in late 2003 our Board of Directors approved the project.

Consistent with our practice and in accordance with U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission guidelines, we use year-end prices for hydrocarbon reserve
estimation.  Due to low Canadian


bitumen values at December 31, 2005, we did
not record any proved crude oil reserves for the Surmont project in 2005.  The Surmont project remains an economically
viable and important component of our project portfolio.

The Surmont project uses an
enhanced thermal oil recovery method called steam assisted gravity drainage.
This process involves heating the oil by the injection of steam deep into the
oil sands through a horizontal well bore, effectively lowering the viscosity
and enhancing the flow of the oil, which is then recovered via gravity drainage
into a lower horizontal well bore and pumped to the surface.  Over the life of this 30+ year project, we
anticipate that approximately 500 production and steam-injection well pairs
will be drilled.  Construction of the
facilities and development drilling began in 2004.  Commercial production is expected to begin in
late 2006, with peak production expected in 2013.  We anticipate processing our share of the
heavy oil produced as a feedstock in our U.S. refineries.

Parsons Lake/Mackenzie Gas Project

We are working with three other
energy companies, as members of the Mackenzie Delta Producers’ Group, on the
development of the Mackenzie Valley pipeline and gathering system, which is
proposed to transport onshore gas production from the Mackenzie Delta in
northern Canada to established markets in North America.  Our interest in the pipeline and gathering
system varies by component, averaging approximately 18 percent.  We have a 75 percent interest in the
development of the Parsons Lake gas field. 
The Parsons Lake gas field would be one of the primary fields in the
Mackenzie Delta that would anchor the pipeline development.  Considerable progress on several issues,
including socio-economic responsibility, and benefits and access agreements
with four of the five aboriginal groups, have resulted in the decision by the
project proponents to proceed to the regulatory hearings. The National Energy
Board started hearings on January 25, 2006. 
First production from Parsons Lake is expected in 2011.

Exploration

We hold exploration acreage in
four areas of Canada: offshore eastern Canada, the foothills of western
Alberta, the Mackenzie Delta/Beaufort Sea, and the Arctic Islands.  In eastern Canada, we operate eight
contiguous exploration licenses in the deepwater Laurentian basin.  Recent exploratory activity in the Laurentian
basin included a 2D seismic survey in 2004, and two 3D seismic programs
completed in September 2005.  In the
Mackenzie Delta, we participated in an appraisal well to follow-up the Umiak
discovery from 2004.  Oil and gas flowed
during testing of the discovery well and the appraisal well.  Plans to commercialize this discovery will be
integrated into the broader Parsons Lake Development project.

In the foothills, we drilled
three wildcat exploratory wells in 2005. 
One well is being tied-in for production.  The remaining two are being tested.  Throughout the rest of the Western Canadian
Sedimentary basin, we participated in the drilling of approximately
70 low-risk wells near our producing assets.

Elsewhere in the frontiers
regions, we hold varying equity interests in discoveries along the Labrador
Shelf and in the Arctic Islands.  Further
exploration in these basins is contemplated as distribution methods for natural
gas become more certain.

Other
Canadian Operations

Syncrude
Canada Ltd.

We own a 9.0 percent interest in Syncrude
Canada Ltd., a joint venture created by a number of energy companies for the
purpose of mining shallow deposits of oil sands, extracting the bitumen, and
upgrading it into a light sweet crude oil called Syncrude.  The primary plant and facilities are located
at Mildred Lake,


about 25 miles north of Fort McMurray,
Alberta, with an auxiliary mining and extraction facility approximately 20
miles from the Mildred Lake plant. 
Syncrude Canada Ltd. holds eight oil sands leases and the associated
surface rights, of which our share is approximately 23,000 net acres.  Our net share of production averaged
19,100 barrels per day in 2005, compared with 21,000 barrels per day in
2004.

The development of the Stage
III expansion-mining project continued in 2005, which is expected to increase
our Syncrude production.  The Aurora
North Train II mine was completed and started up in the fourth quarter of 2003

and the SW Quadrant Replacement Mine was also
completed and became operational by year-end 2005.  The upgrader expansion project is expected to
be fully operational by mid-2006.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s
regulations define this project as mining-related and not part of conventional
oil and gas operations.  As such,
Syncrude operations are not included in our proved oil and gas reserves or
production as reported in our supplemental oil and gas information.

E&P—SOUTH AMERICA

In 2005, E&P operations in
South America were focused on our operations in Venezuela.  South American operations contributed
11 percent of E&P’s worldwide liquids production in 2005, compared
with 9 percent in 2004.

Venezuela

Petrozuata and Hamaca

Petrozuata is a Venezuelan
Corporation formed under an Association Agreement between a wholly owned
subsidiary of ConocoPhillips that has a 50.1 percent non-controlling equity
interest and a subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), the national
oil company of Venezuela.

The project is an integrated
operation that produces heavy crude oil from reserves in the Orinoco Oil Belt,
transports it to the Jose industrial complex on the north coast of Venezuela,
and upgrades it into heavy, processed crude oil and light, processed crude
oil.  Associated products produced are
liquefied petroleum gas, sulfur, petroleum coke and heavy gas oil.  The processed crude oil produced by
Petrozuata is used as a feedstock for our Lake Charles, Louisiana, refinery, as
well as the Cardon refinery operated by PDVSA in Venezuela.  Our net production was 50,200 barrels of
heavy crude oil per day in 2005, compared with 59,600 barrels per day in
2004, and is included in equity affiliate production.

The Hamaca project also
involves the development of heavy-oil reserves from the Orinoco Oil Belt.  We own a 40 percent interest in the Hamaca
project, which is operated by Petrolera Ameriven on behalf of the owners.  The other participants in Hamaca are PDVSA
and Chevron Corporation, each owning 30 percent. Our interest is held through a
joint limited liability company, Hamaca Holding LLC, for which we use the
equity method of accounting.  Net
production averaged 56,100 barrels per day of heavy crude oil in 2005,
compared with 32,600 barrels per day in 2004, and is included in equity
affiliate production.

Construction of the heavy-oil
upgrader, pipelines and associated production facilities for the Hamaca project
at the Jose industrial complex began in 2000. 
In the fourth quarter of 2004, we began producing on-specification
medium-grade crude oil for export at the planned ramp-up capacity of the plant.


Gulf of Paria

In March 2005, a development
plan addendum for Phase I of the Corocoro field in the Gulf of Paria was
approved by the Venezuelan government. 
This addendum addressed revisions to the original development plan
approved in 2003.  The wellhead platform
was installed in late 2005, and the drilling program is expected to begin in
the second quarter of 2006.  First
production from the central processing facility is targeted for 2008, with the
possibility of production from an interim processing facility in 2007.  We operate the field with a 32.2 percent
interest.

Plataforma Deltana Block 2

We have a 40 percent interest
in Plataforma Deltana Block 2.  The block
is operated by our co-venturer and holds a gas discovery made by PDVSA in
1983.  Two appraisal wells were completed
in 2004, and a third was completed in January 2005.  All appraisal wells indicated that the target
zones were natural gas bearing.  In
addition, a new natural gas/condensate discovery was made in a deeper
zone.  Development of the field may
include a well platform, a 170-mile pipeline to shore, and an LNG plant.  PDVSA has the option to enter the project
with a 35 percent interest, which would proportionately reduce our interest in
the project to 26 percent.

E&P

—ASIA PACIFIC

In 2005, E&P operations in
the Asia Pacific area contributed 12 percent of E&P’s worldwide
liquids production and 11 percent of natural gas production, compared with
10 percent and 9 percent in 2004, respectively.

Indonesia

We operate nine Production
Sharing Contracts (PSCs) in Indonesia and have a non-operator interest in two
others.  Our assets are concentrated in
two core areas: the West Natuna Sea and onshore South Sumatra.  A potentially emerging area is offshore East
Java.  We are a party to five long-term,
U.S.-dollar-denominated natural gas contracts that are based on oil price benchmarks.  In addition, in 2004 we began supplying
natural gas to markets on the Indonesian island of Batam and new contracts were
signed to supply natural gas to domestic markets in West Java and East
Java.  These are U.S.-dollar-denominated,
fixed-price contracts.  Production from
Indonesia in 2005 averaged a net 298 million cubic feet per day of natural
gas and 15,100 barrels per day of oil, compared with 250 million
cubic feet per day of natural gas and 15,400 barrels per day of oil in
2004.

Offshore Assets

We operate three
offshore PSCs: South Natuna Sea Block B, Nila, and Ketapang.  We also hold a non-operator interest in the
Pangkah PSC, offshore East Java.

The South Natuna Sea
Block B PSC, in which we have a 40 percent interest, has two currently
producing oil fields and 16 gas fields in various stages of development
(seven of which have recoverable oil or condensate volumes).  In late 2004, oil production began from the
Belanak oil and gas field through a new floating production, storage and
offloading (FPSO) vessel and related facilities.  In October 2005, natural gas export sales
began from the Belanak field.  Also in
Block B, we began development of the Kerisi and Hiu fields, with construction
contract awards under way, and we began the preliminary engineering phase of
the North Belut field development.

In the Pangkah PSC, in
which we have a 25 percent interest, the development of the Ujung Pangkah field
was approved by the Indonesian government in late 2004 following the signing of
contracts for the supply of natural gas to markets in East Java.  In October 2005, we purchased an additional 3
percent interest in the Pangkah PSC, bringing our ownership to its current 25
percent.


Onshore Assets

We operate six onshore
PSCs.  Four are in South Sumatra:
Corridor PSC, Corridor TAC, South Jambi ‘B’, and Sakakemang JOB.  We also operate Block A PSC in Aceh, and
Warim in Papua.  We hold a non-operator
interest in the Banyumas PSC in Java. 
During 2005, we sold our interests in the Bentu and Korinci-Baru PSCs in
Sumatra.

The Corridor PSC is located
onshore South Sumatra and we have a 54 percent interest.  We operate six oil fields and six natural gas
fields, and supply natural gas from the Grissik and Suban gas processing plants
to the Duri steamflood in central Sumatra and to markets in Singapore and
Batam.

In August 2004, we announced
the signing of a gas sales agreement with PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (Persero)
Tbk. (PGN), the Indonesian state majority-owned gas transportation company, to
supply natural gas for delivery to the industrial markets in West Java and
Jakarta.  The agreement calls for us to
supply approximately 850 billion net cubic feet of gas over a 17-year period
commencing in the first quarter of 2007. 
At the contracted rates, initial gas deliveries are about 65 million net
cubic feet per day, ramping up to approximately 140 million net cubic feet per
day in 2012, and continuing at that level until the contract terminates in
2023.

Following the execution of the
West Java gas sales agreement with PGN in August 2004, we began the development
of the Suban Phase II project, which is an expansion of the existing Suban gas
plant in the Corridor PSC.

The South Jambi ‘B’ PSC is also
located in South Sumatra, and we have a 45 percent interest.  In 2004, we completed the construction of the
South Jambi shallow gas project for the supply of natural gas to Singapore from
the South Jambi B Block, with first production occurring in June 2004.

Transportation

We are a 35 percent owner
of TransAsia Pipeline Company Pvt. Ltd., a consortium company, which has a 40
percent ownership in PT Transportasi Gas Indonesia, an Indonesian limited
liability company, which owns and operates the Grissik to Duri, and Grissik to
Singapore, natural gas pipelines.

Exploration

In Indonesia, a total of three
exploration and appraisal wells were drilled during 2005, of which one was
successful.  In the Ketapang PSC, an
appraisal well of the Bukit Tua field, completed in 2005, provided data for
progressing a development plan, which was submitted to the government of
Indonesia in December 2005.  In August
2005, the government of Indonesia awarded us a 100 percent interest in the
Amborip VI exploration block in Papua Offshore, for which we expect to sign a
PSC in early 2006.

China

Our combined net production of
crude oil from the Xijiang facilities averaged 10,600 barrels per day in
2005, compared with 10,400 barrels per day in 2004.  The Xijiang development consists of two
fields located approximately 80 miles from Hong Kong in the South China
Sea.  The facilities include two manned
platforms and a FPSO facility.

Production from Phase I
development of the Peng Lai 19-3 field in Bohai Bay Block 11-05 began in late
2002.  In 2005, the field produced
12,600 net barrels of oil per day, compared with 15,000 net barrels per
day in 2004.  We have a 49 percent
interest, with the remainder held by the China National Offshore Oil
Corporation.  The Phase I
development utilizes one manned wellhead platform and a leased FPSO facility.


In December 2004, our Board of
Directors approved the second phase of development of the Peng Lai 19-3
field, as well as concurrent development through the same facilities of the
nearby Peng Lai 25-6 field. The “Overall Development Program” for both

fields was approved by the Chinese government
in January 2005.  Detailed design
engineering, procurement and construction activities have begun on the second
phase of development, which are planned to include five wellhead platforms,
central processing facilities and a new FPSO. 
The first wellhead platform of Phase II is expected to be put into
production in 2007, and production through the new FPSO is expected by early
2009.

Vietnam

Our ownership interest in
Vietnam is centered around the Cuu Long Basin in the South China Sea, and
consists of two primarily oil producing blocks, two exploration blocks, and one
gas pipeline transportation system.

We have a 23.3 percent interest
in Block 15-1 in the Cuu Long Basin. 
First production began in the fourth quarter of 2003 with the startup of
the Su Tu Den development.  Net
production in 2005 was 15,100 barrels of oil per day, compared with 20,800
barrels per day in 2004.  The oil is
being processed through a one-million-barrel FPSO vessel.

An oil discovery was made on
the Su Tu Vang prospect in Block 15-1 in the third quarter of 2001, with
successful appraisal drilling conducted in 2004.  Su Tu Vang is located approximately four
miles south of Su Tu Den, and is now being developed.  First oil production is targeted for
2008.  In addition, successful appraisal
of the Su Tu Den Northeast and Su Tu Trang fields within Block 15-1 continued
in 2005.

We have a 36 percent interest
in the Rang Dong field in Block 15-2 in the Cuu Long Basin.  All
wellhead platforms produce into a FPSO vessel.  Net production in 2005 was
14,500 barrels of liquids per day and 18 million cubic feet per day
of natural gas, compared with 11,800 barrels per day and 16 million cubic feet
per day in 2004.  Development of the
central part of the field was completed in 2005, with first production in June.

Transportation

We own a 16.3 percent interest
in the Nam Con Son natural gas pipeline. 
This 244-mile transportation system links gas supplies from the Nam Con
Son Basin to gas markets in southern Vietnam.

Exploration

During 2005, we and our
co-venturers successfully completed an exploration well in the Su Tu Nau field,
located in the north corner of Block 15-1. 
Su Tu Nau is our fifth field discovery in Block 15-1, following Su Tu
Den, Su Tu Vang, Su Tu Den Northeast, and Su Tu Trang.

Two successful appraisal wells
were drilled in the Su Tu Trang field in 2005, a gas condensate field
discovered in 2003 in the southeast area of the Block 15-1.

We also own interests in
offshore Blocks 5-3, 133 and 134.

Timor Sea
and Australia

Bayu-Undan

We are the operator and hold a
56.7 percent interest in the unitized Bayu-Undan field, located in the Timor
Sea, which is being developed in two phases. 
Phase I is a gas-recycle project, where condensate and natural gas
liquids are separated and removed and the dry gas is re-injected into the
reservoir.  This phase began production
in February 2004, and averaged a net rate of 47,800 barrels of liquids per
day in


2005, compared with 28,100
barrels per day in 2004.  Development
drilling concluded at the end of March 2005. 
A major maintenance shutdown was performed during 2005.

Phase II involves the
installation of a natural gas pipeline from the field to Darwin, and
construction of an LNG facility located at Wickham Point, Darwin, to meet gross
contracted sales of up to 3 million tons of LNG per year for a period of 17
years to customers in Japan.  During
2005, construction of the LNG facility proceeded, as did the laying of the
pipeline.  Following commissioning of the
pipeline, limited natural gas production from the Bayu-Undan field began
flowing into the pipeline in August 2005, to support the commissioning of the LNG
plant.  The first LNG cargo was loaded in
February 2006.  We have a 56.7 percent
controlling interest in the pipeline and LNG facility.  Our net share of natural gas production from
the Bayu-Undan field is expected to be approximately 100 million cubic
feet per day initially, increasing to approximately 260 million cubic feet
per day by 2009.

Elang/Kakatua/Kakatua North

During 2005, we continued to
produce ultra-light crude oil from these fields at a combined average net rate
of 1,400 barrels per day, compared with 1,700 barrels per day in 2004.  We are the operator with an interest of
57.4 percent.

Greater Sunrise

We and our co-venturers
continued to evaluate commercial development options and LNG markets in the
Asia Pacific region and the North American West Coast during 2005.  The focus in 2005 was on an onshore LNG
facility located at Darwin, although other alternatives, such as a floating LNG
facility and an onshore plant in Timor-Leste, were also considered.

In December 2005, we were notified that agreement had been reached
between the governments of Australia and Timor-Leste with respect to
Sunrise.  The agreement was signed on
January 12, 2006, but needs to be ratified by the respective parliaments.  Commercial progress on the project will
require further clarification on fiscal and jurisdictional issues with the
respective governments.  We have a
30 percent, non-operator interest in Greater Sunrise.

Athena/Perseus

A cooperative field development
agreement for the Athena/Perseus (WA-17-L) gas field, located offshore Western
Australia, was executed in early 2001. 
In 2005, our net share of production was 34 million cubic feet of
natural gas per day.

Exploration

During 2005, we announced a discovery in the
Caldita No. 1 exploration well in the NT/P 61 license located offshore Northern
Territory Australia.  Technical
evaluation to assess the further appraisal and development of the Caldita
discovery is under way.  Appraisal work
likely will include acquiring and interpreting 3D seismic data, and drilling
one or more appraisal wells to define the size and quality of the natural gas
accumulation.  In October 2005, we were
awarded the NT/P 69 license located adjacent to NT/P 61.  We are operator of the NT/P 61 and the
NT/P 69 licenses, with a 60 percent interest in each.

Malaysia

Exploration

We have interests in deepwater
Blocks G and J located off the east Malaysian state of Sabah.  The Gumusut 1 well, in which we have a
40 percent interest, was drilled in Block J in 2003 and resulted in an oil
discovery.  The field was successfully
appraised during 2004 and 2005, and is moving toward field development.  In 2004, we successfully completed the
drilling of the Malikai discovery in Block G. 
Appraisal of this discovery is scheduled to continue into 2006.  In 2005, we had two additional Block G discoveries—Ubah
and Pisagan.  Appraisal of these
discoveries is scheduled to occur in 2006 and 2007.  We have a 35 percent interest in Block G.


During the
first quarter of 2005, we announced that we and our co-venturers had signed a
production sharing contract with PETRONAS, the Malaysian national oil company,
for the appraisal and development of the Kebabangan oil field in Block J.

The KBB #4 appraisal well was drilled and
deemed unsuccessful in expanding the commercial size of this oil field, and a
leasehold impairment was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2005.  Development opportunities are being reviewed
with co-venturers, and a development proposal is expected to be made to
PETRONAS in 2006.  We have a
40 percent interest in the oil rights of Kebabangan field.

E&P

—AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST

Nigeria

At year-end 2005, we were
producing from four onshore Oil Mining Leases (OMLs), in which we have a 20
percent non-operator interest.  These
leases produced a net 28,900 barrels of liquids per day and
84 million cubic feet of natural gas per day in 2005, compared with
30,500 barrels per day and 71 million cubic feet per day in
2004.  In 2005, we continued development
of projects in the onshore OMLs to supply feedstock natural gas under a gas
sales contract with Nigeria LNG Limited, which owns an LNG facility on Bonny
Island.

We have a 20 percent
interest in a 480-megawatt gas-fired power plant in Kwale, Nigeria.  The plant came online in March 2005, and
supplies electricity to Nigeria’s national electricity supplier.  The plant consumes 68 million gross cubic
feet per day of natural gas, sourced from proved natural gas reserves in the
OMLs.

In October 2003, ConocoPhillips, the Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), and two other co-venturers signed a
Heads of Agreement to conduct front-end engineering and design work for a new
LNG facility that would be constructed in Nigeria’s central Niger Delta.  The co-venturers formed an incorporated joint
venture, Brass LNG Limited, to undertake the project.  The front-end engineering and design work are
expected to be completed in 2006, and will be the basis for commercial
development of the facility, which could be operational as early as 2010.

Exploration

We also have production sharing contracts on
deepwater Nigeria Oil Prospecting Licenses (OPLs), with a contractor interest
on OPL 318 of 35 percent, OPL 248 of 72 percent, OPL 220 of
47.5 percent, and on OPL 214 of 20 percent.  We operate all the OPLs except OPL 214.  OPL 250 was relinquished in November
2005.  OPL 220 has been converted into a
Producing License, OML 131, subject to final government approval.  The first exploration well on OPL 214 was
drilled in 2005 and temporarily abandoned. 
On OPL 318, drilling commenced on the third and final exploration well
in November 2005.

The
well did not encounter any significant accumulation of hydrocarbons, and was
written off to dry hole expense in 2005.

Cameroon

Exploration

In December 2002, we announced
a successful test of an exploratory well offshore Cameroon.  The Coco Marine No. 1 well was located in
exploration permit PH 77, offshore in the Douala Basin.

Contractor interests in the permit are held 50 percent by us and 50
percent by a subsidiary of Petronas Carigali. 
We serve as the operator of the consortium.  Seismic data was analyzed during 2004, and we
drilled an appraisal well and a further exploratory well in 2005.  The Londji Marine No. 1 and Coco Marine
No. 2 wells were drilled consecutively starting in June 2005, with the
Coco Marine No. 2 encountering some hydrocarbon producing zones.  Both wells were plugged and abandoned as dry
holes.  We continue to evaluate the
block, on which our interest expires in March 2007 unless extended.


Libya

In late-December 2005, we announced that, in
conjunction with our co-venturers, we reached agreement with the Libyan
National Oil Corporation on the terms under which we would return to our former
oil and natural gas production operations in the Waha concessions in
Libya.  ConocoPhillips and Marathon Oil
Corporation each hold a 16.33 percent interest, Amerada Hess Corporation holds
an 8.16 percent interest, and the Libyan National Oil Corporation holds
the remaining 59.16 percent interest. 
The concessions currently produce approximately 350,000 barrels of oil
per day, and encompass nearly 13 million acres located in the Sirte Basin.  The fiscal terms of the agreement are similar
to the terms in effect at the time of the suspension of the co-venturers’
activities in 1986, and include a 25-year extension of the concessions to
2031-2034.

As a result of the transaction, we added
238 million barrels of crude oil to our net proved reserves in 2005. Based
on a current gross production estimate of 350,000 barrels of oil per day, we
expect our entitlement to be approximately 45,000 net barrels of oil per day in
2006.  In accordance with our policy of
accounting for E&P production on the sales rather than the entitlements
method, revenue and production from our working interest share of Libyan
operations will be based on actual volumes sold by us during a period.  We currently have, and expect to continue to
build, a crude oil underlift position in the near term, from selling less than
our entitlement.  We expect to begin make-up
of our underlift position in 2006.

Qatar

Qatargas 3

Qatargas 3 is an integrated project, jointly
owned by Qatar Petroleum (68.5 percent), ConocoPhillips (30 percent)
and Mitsui & Co., Ltd. (1.5 percent). 
The project comprises upstream natural gas production facilities to
produce approximately 1.4 billion gross cubic feet per day of natural gas
from Qatar’s North field over the 25-year life of the project.  The project also includes a 7.8-million-gross-ton-per-year
LNG facility.  The LNG will be shipped
from Qatar in a fleet of large LNG vessels, and is destined for sale primarily
in the United States.  The first LNG
cargos are expected to be delivered from Qatargas 3 in 2009.

The onshore Engineering, Procurement and
Construction (EPC) contract for Qatargas 3 was awarded in late-December
2005.  The EPC contract covers the
engineering, procurement, and construction of onshore facilities for the LNG
facility.  The EPC contract marks the
final investment decision for the project, with all definitive agreements
signed and financing completed.

In order to capture cost savings, Qatargas 3
will execute the development of the onshore and offshore assets as a single
integrated project with Qatargas 4, a joint venture between Qatar Petroleum and
Royal Dutch Shell plc.  This includes the
joint development of offshore facilities situated in a common offshore block in
the North field, as well as the construction of two identical LNG process
trains, and associated gas treating facilities for both the Qatargas 3 and
Qatargas 4 joint ventures.

Gas-to-Liquids

In December 2003, we signed a Statement of
Intent with Qatar Petroleum regarding the construction of a gas-to-liquids
(GTL) plant in Ras Laffan, Qatar.  Preliminary
engineering and design studies have been completed

.  In April 2005, the Qatar Minister of
Petroleum stated that there would be a postponement of new GTL projects in
order to further study impacts on infrastructure, shipping and contractors, and
to ensure that the development of its gas resources occurs at a sustainable
rate.

Work continues with the Qatar authorities on the appropriate timing of
the project to meet the objectives of Qatar and ConocoPhillips.


Dubai

In Dubai, United Arab Emirates,
we operate four large, offshore oil fields. 
We use advanced horizontal drilling techniques and reservoir drainage
technology to enhance the recovery rates and efficiencies in these late-life
fields.

Iraq

We have the right to cooperate
with LUKOIL to obtain the Iraqi government's confirmation of LUKOIL’s rights
under its production sharing agreement (PSA) relating to the West Qurna
field.  Subject to obtaining such confirmation
and the consents of governmental authorities and the parties to the contract,
we have the right to enter into further agreements regarding the assignment of
a 17.5 percent interest in the PSA to us by LUKOIL.

E&P—RUSSIA AND CASPIAN SEA
REGION

Russia

Polar Lights

We have a 50 percent ownership
interest in Polar Lights Company, a Russian limited liability company
established in January 1992 to develop fields in the Timan-Pechora basin in northern
Russia.  Our net production from Polar
Lights averaged 12,900 barrels of oil per day in 2005, compared with
13,300 barrels per day in 2004, and is included in equity affiliate
production.

NMNG

On June 30, 2005,
ConocoPhillips and LUKOIL created the OOO Naryanmarneftegaz (NMNG) joint
venture to develop resources in the northern part of Russia’s Timan-Pechora
province.  We have a 30 percent
ownership interest with a 50

percent governance interest in the joint venture.  We use the equity method of accounting for
this joint venture.  We are working with
LUKOIL to finalize the development plan for the Yuzhno Khylchuyu (YK) field,
award major contracts and start construction, with a target of starting up the
field in late 2007.

Production from the NMNG joint-venture fields
is transported via pipeline to LUKOIL’s existing terminal at Varandey Bay on the

Barents Sea and then shipped via tanker to international markets.  LUKOIL intends to complete an expansion of
the terminal’s capacity in late 2007 to accommodate production from the YK
field, with ConocoPhillips participating in the design and financing of the
terminal expansion.

Other

In late 2004, we signed a
Memorandum of Understanding with Gazprom to undertake a joint study on the
development of the Shtokman natural gas field in the Barents Sea.  In September 2005, we were notified that we
were included on the “short list” of candidates to participate in the Shtokman
LNG project.  We are currently engaged in
a joint feasibility study with Gazprom and the other candidates.  Gazprom has indicated they will make their
final partner selection in the March/April 2006 time frame.

Caspian
Sea

In the North Caspian Sea, we have a 9.26
percent interest in the Republic of Kazakhstan’s North Caspian Sea Production
Sharing Agreement (NCSPSA), which includes the Kashagan field.  In March 2005, agreement was reached with the
Republic of Kazakhstan to conclude the sale of BG International’s interest in
the NCSPSA to several of the remaining partners
and for the subsequent sale of one-half of the acquired interests to
KazMunayGas.  This agreement increased
our ownership interest from 8.33 percent to 9.26 percent.


Detailed design, procurement
and construction activities continued on the Kashagan oil field development
following approval by the Republic of Kazakhstan for the development plan and
budget in February 2004.

The first
phase of field development currently being executed includes the construction
of three artificial drilling islands for more than 60 wells, barges with
processing facilities and living quarters, and pipelines to carry products
onshore to oil, gas and sulphur plants. 
The initial production phase of the contract is for 20 years, with
options to extend the agreement an additional 20 years.

Transportation

We have a 2.5 percent interest
in the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline. 
This 1,760 kilometer pipeline will transport crude oil from the Caspian
region through Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey, for tanker loadings at the
Mediterranean port of Ceyhan.  The BTC
pipeline is expected to be operational by mid-2006.

Exploration

In 2002, we and our
co-venturers announced a new hydrocarbon discovery on the Kalamkas More
prospect located approximately 40 miles southwest of the Kashagan field.  The Aktote prospect and the Kashagan
Southwest prospect were announced as discoveries in 2003, and in 2004, the
Kairan prospect was announced as a discovery. 
With the successful test on Kairan, the Exploration Period under the
NCSPSA came to a close.

In 2005, appraisal of these
discoveries continued.  An appraisal well
was drilled on Kalamkas More, and 3D seismic operations were carried out on the
Kairan and Aktote prospects during 2005.

E&P

—OTHER

In
late 2003, we signed an agreement with Freeport LNG Development, L.P. (Freeport
LNG) to participate in its proposed LNG receiving terminal in Quintana,
Texas.  This agreement gives us
1 billion cubic feet per day of regasification capacity in the terminal
and a 50 percent interest in the general partnership managing the venture.  The terminal will be designed with a storage
capacity of 6.9 billion cubic feet and a send-out capacity of
1.5 billion cubic feet per day. 
Freeport LNG

received conditional approval in
June 2004 from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to
construct and operate the facility. 
Final approval from FERC was received in January 2005.  Construction
began in early 2005, and commercial startup is expected in 2008.

In 2005, we executed an option to secure 0.3 billion cubic feet per day
of capacity in a subsequent expansion of the facility, which is subject to
certain regulatory approvals and commercial decisions to proceed.

We are pursuing three other
proposed U.S. LNG regasification terminals. 
The Beacon Port Terminal would be located in federal waters in the Gulf
of Mexico, 56 miles south of the Louisiana mainland.  Also in the Gulf of Mexico is the proposed
Compass Port Terminal, to be located approximately 11 miles offshore
Alabama.  The third proposed facility would
be a joint venture located in the Port of Long Beach,

California. 
Each of these projects is in various stages of the regulatory permitting
process.

During 2005, we signed a Memorandum of
Understanding with Essent Energie B.V. to study the feasibility of developing
an LNG import terminal in the Netherlands. 
The companies identified a potential project site at the Port of
Eemshaven, and completed the feasibility study, which resulted in a
recommendation to proceed to the next phase of more detailed engineering.  A final investment decision could be made as
early as 2007, subject to the economic outlook and the receipt of the necessary
permits.  If the outcome of these
procedures is positive, the operation of the terminal could start in 2010.


During 2005, we, along with the other Norsea
Pipeline Limited shareholders, made an application to obtain planning
permission for an LNG regasification facility and combined heat and power plant
at the Norsea Pipeline Limited existing oil terminal site at Teesside, United
Kingdom.  The planning permission process
is expected to be complete by mid-2007.

The Commercial organization optimizes the
commodity flows of our E&P segment. 
This group markets our crude oil and natural gas production, with
commodity buyers, traders and marketers in offices in

Houston, London,
Singapore and Calgary.

Natural Gas
Pricing

Compared with the more global
nature of crude oil commodity pricing, natural gas prices have historically
varied more in different regions of the world. 
We produce natural gas from regions around the world that have
significantly different supply, demand and regulatory circumstances, typically
resulting in significantly lower average sales prices than in the Lower 48
region of the United States.  Moreover,
excess supply conditions that exist in certain parts of the world cannot easily
serve to mitigate the relatively high-price conditions in the U.S. Lower 48
states and other markets because of a lack of infrastructure and because of the
difficulties in transporting natural gas. 
We, along with other companies in the oil and gas industry, are planning
long-term projects in regions of excess supply to install the infrastructure
required to produce and liquefy natural gas for transportation by tanker and
subsequent regasification in regions where market demand is strong, such as the
U.S. Lower 48 states or certain parts of Asia, but where supplies are not as
plentiful.  Due to the significance of
the overall investment in these long-term projects, the natural gas sales
prices (to a third-party LNG facility) or transfer prices (to a company-owned
LNG facility) in the areas of excess supply are expected to remain well below
sales prices for natural gas that is produced closer to areas of high demand
and which can be transferred to existing natural gas pipeline networks, such as
in the U.S. Lower 48.

Burlington
Resources Acquisition

On the evening of December 12,
2005, ConocoPhillips and Burlington Resources Inc. announced they had signed a
definitive agreement under which ConocoPhillips would acquire Burlington
Resources Inc.  The transaction has a
preliminary value of $33.9 billion.  This
transaction is expected to close on March 31, 2006, subject to approval by
Burlington Resources shareholders at a special meeting set for March 30, 2006.

Under the terms of the
agreement, Burlington Resources shareholders will receive $46.50 in cash and
0.7214 shares of ConocoPhillips common stock for each Burlington Resources
share they own.  This represents a
transaction value of $92 per share, based on the closing of ConocoPhillips
shares on Friday, December 9, 2005, the last unaffected day of trading prior to
the announcement.

Burlington Resources is an
independent exploration and production company, and holds a substantial
position in North American natural gas reserves and production.  At year-end 2004, as reported in its Annual
Report on Form 10-K, Burlington Resources had proved worldwide natural gas
reserves of 8,226 billion cubic feet, including 5,076 billion cubic feet
in the United States and 2,330 billion cubic feet in Canada.  Worldwide, Burlington Resources had 630
million barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids combined, with 483 million
barrels in the United States and 72 million barrels in Canada.  During 2004, Burlington Resources’ worldwide
net natural gas production averaged 1,914 million cubic feet per day, while its
net liquids production averaged 151,000 barrels per day.


E&P—RESERVES

We have not filed any
information with any other federal authority or agency with respect to our
estimated total proved reserves at December 31, 2005.  No difference exists between our estimated
total proved reserves for year-end 2004 and year-end 2003, which are shown in
this filing, and estimates of these reserves shown in a filing with another
federal agency in 2005.

DELIVERY COMMITMENTS

We sell crude oil and natural
gas from our E&P producing operations under a variety of contractual arrangements,
some of which specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity.  Our Commercial organization also enters into
natural gas sales contracts where the source of the natural gas used to fulfill
the contract can be the spot market, or a combination of our reserves and the
spot market.  Worldwide, we are
contractually committed to deliver approximately 5.4 trillion cubic feet
of natural gas and 278 million barrels of crude oil in the future, including
0.9 trillion cubic feet related to the minority interests of
consolidated subsidiaries.  These
contracts have various expiration dates through the year 2025.  Although these delivery commitments could be
fulfilled utilizing proved reserves in the United States, Canada, the Timor
Sea, Nigeria, Indonesia, and the United Kingdom, we anticipate that some of
them will be fulfilled with purchases in the spot market.  A portion of our natural gas delivery
commitment relates to proved undeveloped reserves in Indonesia, a portion of
which are expected to convert to proved developed in 2007, when additional
wells are drilled and the expansion of the Suban gas plant is completed.

MIDSTREAM

At December 31, 2005, our
Midstream segment represented 2 percent of ConocoPhillips’ total assets,
while contributing 5 percent of net income.

Our Midstream business is
primarily conducted through our 50 percent equity investment in Duke Energy
Field Services, LLC (DEFS).  In July
2005, ConocoPhillips and Duke Energy Corporation (Duke) restructured their respective
ownership levels in DEFS, which resulted in DEFS becoming a jointly controlled
venture, owned 50 percent by each company. 
This restructuring increased our ownership in DEFS to 50 percent,
from 30.3 percent, through a series of direct and indirect transfers of certain
Canadian Midstream assets from DEFS to Duke, a disproportionate cash
distribution from DEFS to Duke from the sale of DEFS’ interest in TEPPCO, and a
combined payment by ConocoPhillips to Duke and DEFS of approximately
$840 million.  The Empress plant in
Canada was not included in the initial transaction as originally anticipated
due to weather-related damage.  However,
the Empress plant was sold to Duke on August 1, 2005, for approximately $230
million.

The
Midstream business purchases raw natural gas from producers and gathers natural
gas through extensive pipeline gathering systems.  The gathered natural gas is then processed to
extract natural gas liquids.  The
remaining “residue” gas is marketed to electrical utilities, industrial users,
and gas marketing companies.  Most of the
natural gas liquids are fractionated—separated into individual components like
ethane, butane and propane—and marketed as chemical feedstock, fuel, or
blendstock.  Total natural gas liquids
extracted in 2005, including our share of DEFS’, was 195,000 barrels per
day, compared with 194,000 barrels per day in 2004.

DEFS markets a portion of its
natural gas liquids to ConocoPhillips and Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC
(a joint venture between ConocoPhillips and Chevron Corporation) under a supply
agreement that continues until December 31, 2014.  This purchase commitment is on an
“if-produced, will-


purchase” basis and so it has
no fixed production schedule, but has had, and is expected over the remaining
term of the contract to have, a relatively stable purchase pattern.  Under this agreement, natural gas liquids are
purchased at various published market index prices, less transportation and
fractionation fees.

DEFS is headquartered in
Denver, Colorado.  At December 31,
2005, DEFS owned or operated 54 natural gas liquids extraction plants, 11
natural gas liquids fractionation plants, and its gathering and transmission
systems included approximately 56,000 miles of pipeline.  In 2005, DEFS’ raw natural gas throughput
averaged 5.9 billion cubic feet per day, and natural gas liquids
extraction averaged 353,000 barrels per day, compared with
5.9 billion cubic feet per day and 356,000 barrels per day,
respectively, in 2004 (2004 amounts were restated to reflect discontinued
operations within DEFS).  DEFS’ assets
are primarily located in the Gulf Coast area, West Texas, Oklahoma, the Texas
Panhandle, and the Rocky Mountain area.

Outside of DEFS, our U.S.
natural gas liquids business included the following assets as of December 31,
2005:

•

A 50 percent interest in a natural gas
liquids extraction plant in San Juan County, New Mexico, with a gross plant
inlet capacity of 500 million cubic feet per day.  We also have minor interests in two other natural gas liquids extraction plants in
Texas and Louisiana.

•

A 25,000-barrel-per-day capacity natural gas
liquids fractionation plant in Gallup, New Mexico.

•

A 22.5 percent equity interest in Gulf Coast
Fractionators, which owns a natural gas liquids fractionation plant in Mont
Belvieu, Texas (with our net share of capacity at 25,000 barrels per day).

•

A 40 percent interest in a fractionation
plant in Conway, Kansas (with our net share of capacity at 42,000 barrels per
day).

We also own a 39 percent equity
interest in Phoenix Park Gas Processors Limited (Phoenix Park), a joint venture
primarily with the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited.  Phoenix Park processes gas in Trinidad and
markets natural gas liquids throughout the Caribbean and into the U.S. Gulf
Coast.  Its facilities include a
1.35-billion-cubic-feet-per-day gas processing plant and a natural gas liquids
fractionator that was expanded from 46,000 to 70,000 barrels per day in
the fourth quarter of 2005.  Our share of
natural gas liquids extracted averaged 6,100 barrels per day in 2005, the
same as in 2004.

In Syria, operations were transferred to the Syrian Gas Company at the
end of the service contract on December 31, 2005.  Final administrative requirements associated
with closing out the service contract will be undertaken during the first half
of 2006.

We have no plans to make
additional investments in operations in Syria.

REFINING
AND MARKETING (R&M)

At December 31, 2005, our
R&M segment represented 29 percent of ConocoPhillips’ total assets,
while contributing 31 percent of net income.

R&M operations encompass
refining crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products (such as
gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels); buying, selling and transporting
crude oil; and buying, transporting, distributing and marketing petroleum
products.  R&M has operations in the
United States, Europe and Asia Pacific.


The R&M segment does not
include the results or statistics from our equity investment in LUKOIL, which
are reported in a separate segment (LUKOIL Investment).  Accordingly, references to results, refinery
crude oil throughput capacities and other statistics throughout the R&M
segment exclude those related to our equity investment in LUKOIL.

The
Commercial organization optimizes the commodity flows of our R&M
segment.  This organization procures
feedstocks for R&M’s refineries, facilitates supplying a portion of the gas
and power needs of the R&M facilities, and supplies petroleum products to
our marketing operations.  Commercial has
buyers, traders and marketers in offices in Houston, London, Singapore and
Calgary.

We are planning to spend $4 billion to
$5 billion over the period 2006 through 2011 to increase our U.S. refining
system’s ability to process heavy-sour crude oil and other lower-quality
feedstocks.  These investments are
expected to incrementally increase refining capacity and clean products yield
at our existing facilities, while providing competitive returns.

UNITED STATES

Refining

At December 31, 2005, we owned
and operated 12 crude oil refineries in the United States, having an aggregate
crude oil throughput capacity of 2,182,000 barrels per day.


East Coast Region

Bayway Refinery

The Bayway refinery is located
on the New York Harbor in Linden, New Jersey. 
The refinery has a crude oil processing capacity of 238,000 barrels per
day, and processes mainly light low-sulfur crude oil.  Crude oil is supplied to the refinery by
tanker, primarily from the North Sea, Canada and West Africa.  The refinery produces a high percentage of
transportation fuels, such as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, along with home
heating oil.  Other products include
petrochemical feedstocks (propylene) and residual fuel oil.  The facility distributes its refined products
to East Coast customers through pipelines, barges, railcars and trucks.  The mix of products produced changes to meet
seasonal demand.  Gasoline is in higher
demand during the summer, while in winter the refinery optimizes operations to
increase heating oil production.  The
complex also includes a 775-million-pound-per-year polypropylene plant.

Trainer Refinery

The Trainer refinery is located
on the Delaware River in Trainer, Pennsylvania. 
The refinery has a crude oil processing capacity of 185,000 barrels per
day, and processes mainly light low-sulfur crude oil.  The Bayway and Trainer refineries are
operated in coordination with each other by sharing crude oil cargoes, moving
feedstocks between the facilities, and sharing certain personnel.  Trainer receives crude oil from the North Sea
and West Africa.  The refinery produces a
high percentage of transportation fuels, such as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel,
along with home heating oil.  Other
products include residual fuel oil and liquefied petroleum gas.  Refined products are distributed to customers
in Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey via pipeline, barge, railcar and truck.

Gulf Coast Region

Alliance Refinery

The Alliance refinery is
located on the Mississippi River in Belle Chasse, Louisiana.  The refinery has a crude oil processing
capacity of 247,000 barrels per day, and processes mainly light low-sulfur
crude oil.  Alliance receives domestic
crude oil from the Gulf of Mexico via pipeline, and foreign crude oil from the
North Sea and West Africa via pipeline connected to the Louisiana Offshore Oil
Port.  The refinery produces a high
percentage of transportation fuels, such as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel,
along with home heating oil.  Other
products include

petrochemical
feedstocks (benzene) and anode petroleum coke. 
The majority of the refined products are distributed to customers
through major common-carrier pipeline systems.

The Alliance refinery was shutdown in
anticipation of Hurricane Katrina in late-August 2005, then remained shut down
as a result of flooding and damages sustained during the hurricane.  Removal of water from the site was completed
by October, and repair work began.  The
refinery began partial operation in late-January 2006, and is expected to
return to full operations around the end of the first quarter of 2006.

Lake Charles Refinery

The Lake Charles refinery is
located in Westlake, Louisiana.  The
refinery has a crude oil processing capacity of 239,000 barrels per day, and
processes mainly heavy, high-sulfur, low-sulfur and acidic crude oil.  The refinery receives domestic and foreign
crude oil, with a majority of its foreign crude oil being heavy Venezuelan and
Mexican crude oil delivered via tanker. 
The refinery produces a high percentage of transportation fuels, such as
gasoline, off-road diesel and jet fuel, along with heating oil.  The majority of its refined products are
distributed to customers by truck, railcar or major common-carrier
pipelines.  In addition, refined products
can be sold into export markets through the refinery’s marine terminal.  Construction of an

S Zorb™ Sulfur Removal Technology unit
to produce low-sulfur gasoline was completed and began operation in late 2005.


The Lake Charles facilities
include a specialty coker and calciner that manufacture graphite petroleum
coke, which is supplied to the steel industry. 
The coker and calciner also provide a substantial increase in light oils
production by breaking down the heaviest part of the crude barrel to allow additional
production of diesel fuel and gasoline. 
The Lake Charles refinery supplies feedstocks to Excel

Paralubes and Penreco, joint ventures that
are part of our Specialty Businesses function within R&M.

The Lake Charles refinery was shutdown in
anticipation of Hurricane Rita in September 2005, resumed operations in
mid-October, and returned to full operations in November.

Sweeny Refinery

The Sweeny refinery is located
in Old Ocean, Texas.

Effective January 1, 2005, the crude oil
processing capacity was increased by 13,000 barrels per day, and effective
January 1, 2006, it was further increased by 18,000 barrels per day.  Both increases were a result of incremental
debottlenecking.  As a result, the
refinery’s current crude oil processing capacity is 247,000 barrels per
day.  The refinery processes mainly
heavy, high-sulfur crude oil, but also processes light, low-sulfur crude
oil.  The refinery primarily
receives crude oil through 100-percent-owned and jointly owned terminals on the
Gulf Coast, including a deepwater terminal at Freeport, Texas.  The refinery produces a high percentage of
transportation fuels, such as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, along with home
heating oil.  Other products include
petrochemical feedstocks (benzene) and petroleum (fuel) coke.  Refined products are distributed throughout
the Midwest and southeastern United States by pipeline, barge and railcar.

ConocoPhillips has a
50 percent interest in Merey Sweeny, L.P., a limited partnership that owns
a 65,000-barrel-per-day delayed coker and related facilities at the Sweeny
refinery.  PDVSA, which owns the other
50 percent interest, supplies the refinery with Venezuelan Merey, or
equivalent, Venezuelan crude oil.  We are
the operating partner.

The Sweeny refinery was shutdown in
anticipation of Hurricane Rita in September 2005, and resumed operations by
October.

Central Region

Wood River Refinery

The Wood River refinery is
located on the east side of the Mississippi River in Roxana, Illinois.  It is R&M’s largest refinery, with a
crude oil processing capacity of 306,000 barrels per day.  The refinery processes a mix of both light
low-sulfur and heavy high-sulfur crude oil. 
The refinery receives domestic and foreign crude oil by various
pipelines.  The refinery produces a high
percentage of transportation fuels, such as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel.  Other products include petrochemical
feedstocks (benzene and propylene) and asphalt. 
Through an off-take agreement, a significant portion of its gasoline and
diesel is sold to a third party for delivery via pipelines into the upper
Midwest, including the Chicago, Illinois, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
metropolitan areas.  The remaining
refined products are distributed to customers in the Midwest by pipeline,
truck, barge and railcar.

In November 2005, we announced plans to install
our proprietary S Zorb™ Sulfur Removal Technology (SRT) at the refinery.  The new 32,000-barrel-per-day S Zorb SRT unit
is targeted for completion in early 2007.

Ponca City Refinery

The Ponca City refinery is
located in Ponca City, Oklahoma.  The
refinery has a crude oil processing capacity of 187,000 barrels per day,
and processes light- and medium-weight, low-sulfur crude oil.  Both foreign and domestic crude oil are
delivered by pipeline from the Gulf of Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas and
Canada.  The refinery produces high
ratios of gasoline and diesel fuel from crude oil.  Finished


petroleum products are shipped
by truck, railcar and company-owned and common-carrier pipelines to markets
throughout the Midcontinent region.

Borger Refinery

The Borger refinery is located
in Borger, Texas, and the complex includes a natural gas liquids fractionation
facility.  The crude oil processing
capacity of the refinery is 146,000 barrels per day, and the natural gas
liquids fractionation capacity is 45,000 barrels per day.  The refinery processes mainly light-sour and
medium-sour crude oil.  It receives crude
oil and natural gas liquids feedstocks through our pipelines from West Texas,
the Texas Panhandle and Wyoming.  The
Borger refinery can also receive foreign crude oil via company-owned pipeline
systems.  The refinery produces a high
percentage of transportation fuels, such as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel,
along with a variety of natural gas liquids and solvents.  Pipelines move refined products from the
refinery to West Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, and the Midcontinent region.

During 2005, construction began
on a 25,000-barrel-per-day coker at the Borger refinery, with an estimated
completion date in the second quarter of 2007. 
This project will allow the refinery to comply with clean fuel
regulations for ultra-low-sulfur diesel and low-sulfur gasoline, as well as
comply with required reductions of sulfur dioxide emissions.  Additional project benefits include improved
operating performance by adding additional upgrading capability, improved
utilization, and capability to process heavy Canadian crude oil.

West Coast Region

Billings Refinery

The Billings refinery is
located in Billings, Montana.  The refinery
has a crude oil processing capacity of 58,000 barrels per day, and
processes a mixture of Canadian heavy, high-sulfur crude, plus domestic
high-sulfur and low-sulfur crude oil, all delivered by pipeline.  A delayed coker converts heavy, high-sulfur
residue into higher value light oils. 
The refinery produces a high percentage of transportation fuels, such as
gasoline, jet fuel and diesel, as well as fuel-grade petroleum coke.  Finished petroleum products from the refinery
are delivered via company-owned pipelines, railcars and trucks.  Pipelines transport most of the refined
products to markets in Montana, Wyoming, Utah, and Washington.

Los Angeles Refinery

The Los Angeles refinery is
composed of two linked facilities located about five miles apart in Carson and
Wilmington, California.  Carson serves as
the front-end of the refinery by processing crude oil, and Wilmington serves as
the back-end by upgrading products.  The
refinery has a crude oil processing capacity of 139,000 barrels per day, and
processes mainly heavy, high-sulfur crude oil. 
The refinery receives domestic crude oil via pipeline from California,
and both foreign and domestic crude oil by tanker through a third-party
terminal in the Port of Long Beach.  The
refinery produces a high percentage of transportation fuels, such as gasoline,
diesel and jet fuel.  Other products
include fuel-grade petroleum coke.  The
refinery produces California Air Resources Board (CARB) gasoline, using
ethanol, to meet federally mandated oxygenate requirements.  Refined products are distributed to customers
in Southern California, Nevada and Arizona by pipeline and truck.

In late 2005, we entered into
an agreement to utilize a proposed facility to provide waterborne crude oil
receipt capacity in the Los Angeles harbor. 
This facility, which is expected to be operational in late 2007 or 2008,
will allow the refinery to increase its proportion of waterborne crude oil
versus California crude oil and accept crude oil from very large tankers.


San Francisco Refinery

The San Francisco refinery is
composed of two linked facilities located about 200 miles apart.  The Santa Maria facility is located in Arroyo
Grande, California, about 200 miles south of San Francisco, while the Rodeo
facility is in the San Francisco Bay area.

Effective
April 1, 2005, the refinery’s crude oil processing capacity was increased by
9,000 barrels per day as a result of a project implementation related to clean
fuels, and effective January 1, 2006, it was further increased by
5,000 barrels per day due to incremental debottlenecking.  As a result, the refinery’s current crude oil
processing capacity is 120,000 barrels per day.  The refinery processes mainly heavy,
high-sulfur crude oil.  Both the
Santa Maria and Rodeo facilities have calciners to upgrade the value of the
coke that is produced.  The refinery
receives crude oil from central California, and both foreign and domestic crude
oil by tanker.  Semi-refined liquid
products from the Santa Maria facility are sent by pipeline to the Rodeo
facility for upgrading into finished petroleum products.  The refinery produces transportation fuels,
such as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. 
Other products include calcined and fuel-grade petroleum coke.  The refinery produces CARB gasoline, using
ethanol, to meet federally mandated oxygenate requirements.  Refined products are distributed by pipeline,
railcar, truck and barge.

Ferndale Refinery

The Ferndale refinery is
located on Puget Sound in Ferndale, Washington.

Effective
January 1, 2006, the refinery’s crude oil processing capacity was increased by
3,000 barrels per day as a result of incremental debottlenecking.  As a result, the refinery’s current crude oil
processing capacity is 96,000 barrels per day. The refinery primarily
receives crude oil from the Alaskan North Slope, with secondary sources
supplied from Canada or the Far East. 
Ferndale operates a deepwater dock that is capable of taking in full
tankers bringing North Slope crude oil from Valdez, Alaska.  The refinery is also connected to the Terasen
crude oil pipeline that originates in Canada. 
The refinery produces transportation fuels, such as gasoline, diesel and
jet fuel.  Other products include
residual fuel oil supplying the northwest marine transportation market. Most
refined products are distributed by pipeline and barge to major markets in the
northwest United States.

Transportation

Pipelines and Terminals

At December 31, 2005, we had
approximately 29,000 miles of common-carrier crude oil, raw natural gas
liquids and products pipeline systems in the United States, including those
partially owned and/or operated

by affiliates.  We also owned
and/or operated 66 finished product terminals, 10 liquefied petroleum
gas terminals, seven crude oil terminals and one coke exporting facility.

In November 2005, we entered into a
Memorandum of Understanding which commits us to ship crude oil on the proposed
Keystone oil pipeline, and gives us the right to acquire up to a 50 percent
ownership interest in the pipeline, subject to certain conditions being
met.  The Keystone pipeline is intended
to transport approximately 435,000 barrels per day of crude oil from Hardisty,
Alberta, to Patoka, Illinois, through a 1,840-mile pipeline system.  In addition to approximately 1,100 miles of
new pipeline in the United States, the Canadian portion of the proposed project
includes the construction of approximately 220 miles of new pipeline and
the conversion of approximately 540 miles of existing pipeline facilities from
natural gas to crude oil transmission. 
The Keystone pipeline, upon receipt of the necessary shipper support and
appropriate regulatory approvals in Canada and the United States, is expected
to be in service in 2009.  We expect to
utilize the Keystone pipeline to integrate our upstream assets in Canada with
our Wood River refinery in Illinois.

Tankers

At December 31, 2005, we
had under charter 15 double-hulled crude oil tankers, with capacities
ranging in size from 650,000 to 1,100,000 barrels.  These tankers are utilized to transport
feedstocks to certain of our U.S. refineries. 
We also have a domestic fleet of both owned and chartered boats and
barges providing inland and ocean-going waterway transportation.  The information above excludes the operations
of the company’s subsidiary, Polar Tankers, Inc., which is discussed in the
E&P section, as well as an owned tanker on lease to a third party for use
in the North Sea.

Specialty

venture in which we had a 50 percent interest.

INTERNATIONAL

Refining

At December 31, 2005, R&M
owned or had an interest in six refineries outside the United States with an
aggregate crude oil capacity of 428,000 net barrels per day.

Humber Refinery

Our wholly owned Humber
refinery is located in North Lincolnshire, United Kingdom.  The refinery’s crude oil processing capacity
is 221,000 barrels per day.  Crude
oil processed at the refinery is supplied primarily from the North Sea and
includes lower-cost, acidic crude oil. 
The refinery also processes other intermediate feedstocks, mostly vacuum
gas oils and residual fuel oil.  The
refinery’s location on the east coast of England provides for cost-effective
North Sea crude imports and product exports to European and world markets.

The Humber refinery is a fully
integrated refinery that produces a full slate of light products and fuel
oil.  The refinery also has two coking
units with associated calcining plants, which upgrade the heavy “bottoms” and
imported feedstocks into light-oil products and graphite and anode petroleum
cokes.  Approximately 70 percent of
the light oils produced in the refinery are marketed in the United Kingdom,
while the other products are exported to the rest of Europe and the United
States.

Whitegate Refinery

The Whitegate refinery is
located in Cork, Ireland, and has a crude oil processing capacity of
71,000 barrels per day.  Crude oil
processed by the refinery is light sweet crude sourced mostly from the North
Sea.  The refinery primarily produces
transportation fuels and fuel oil, which are distributed to the inland market
via truck and sea, as well as being exported to Europe and the United
States.  We also operate a crude oil and
products storage complex with a 7.5-million-barrel capacity, facilitated by an
offshore mooring buoy, in Bantry Bay, Cork, Ireland.


MiRO Refinery

The Mineraloel Raffinerie
Oberrhein GmbH (MiRO) refinery in Karlsruhe, Germany, is a joint-venture refinery
with a crude oil processing capacity of 283,000 barrels per day.  We have an 18.75 percent interest in MiRO,
giving us a net capacity share of 53,000 barrels per day.  Effective January 1, 2006, the
refinery’s capacity was increased by 14,000 barrels per day, with our
share being an increase of 3,000 barrels per day, due to incremental
debottlenecking.  Approximately
45 percent of the refinery’s crude oil feedstock is low-cost, high-sulfur
crude.  The MiRO complex is a fully
integrated refinery producing gasoline, middle distillates and specialty
products, along with a small amount of residual fuel oil.  The refinery has a high capacity to convert
lower-cost feedstocks into higher-value products, primarily with a fluid
catalytic cracker and a delayed coker. 
The refinery produces both fuel-grade and specialty calcined cokes.  The refinery processes crude and other
feedstocks supplied by each of the partners in proportion to their respective
ownership interests.

Czech Republic Refineries

Through our participation in C

eská rafinérská, a.s.
(CRC), we have a 16.33 percent ownership in two refineries in the
Czech Republic, giving us a net capacity share of 27,000 barrels per
day.  The refinery at Litvinov has a
crude oil processing capacity of 103,000 barrels per day and processes
Russian-export blend crude oil delivered by pipeline.  Litvinov produces a high yield of transport
fuels and petrochemical feedstocks, and a small amount of fuel oil.  The Kralupy refinery has a crude oil
processing capacity of 63,000 barrels per day and processes low-sulfur
crude, mostly from the Mediterranean. 
The Kralupy refinery has a high yield of transportation fuels.  The two refineries complement each other and
are run on an overall optimized basis, with certain intermediate streams moving
between the two plants.  CRC processes
crude and other feedstocks supplied by ConocoPhillips and the other partners,
with each partner receiving their proportionate share of the resulting
products.  We market our share of these
finished products in both the Czech Republic and in neighboring markets.

Melaka Refinery

The refinery in Melaka,
Malaysia, is a joint venture with PETRONAS, the Malaysian state oil
company.  We own a 47 percent interest in
the joint venture.  The refinery has a
rated crude oil processing capacity of 119,000 barrels per day, of which our
share is 56,000 barrels per day. 
Effective January 1, 2006, the refinery’s capacity was increased by
4,000 barrels per day, with our share being an increase of 2,000 barrels
per day, due to incremental debottlenecking. 
Crude oil processed by the refinery is sourced mostly from the Middle
East.  The refinery produces a full range
of refined petroleum products. The refinery capitalizes on our proprietary
coking technology to upgrade low-cost feedstocks to higher-

margin products.  Our share of refined products is distributed
by truck to “ProJET” retail sites in Malaysia, or transported by sea, primarily
to Asian markets.

Refinery Acquisition

In November 2005,
we executed a definitive agreement for the cash purchase of the Wilhelmshaven
refinery in Wilhelmshaven, Germany.  The
purchase includes the 275,000-barrel-per-day refinery, a marine terminal, rail
and truck loading facilities and a tank farm, as well as another entity that
provides commercial and administrative support to the refinery.  The purchase is expected to be completed
during the first quarter of 2006, subject to satisfaction of closing
conditions, including obtaining the necessary governmental approvals and
regulatory permits.  The acquisition is
expected to provide a foundation for strengthening the company’s ability to
supply products to key export markets.

Our current plans
include a deep conversion project for the refinery, moving it from a
low-complexity facility to a high-complexity facility.  This proposed project would allow the
refinery to run a more advantaged crude slate, including Russian-export blends,
while increasing overall conversion and reducing operating costs.


The addition of the
Wilhelmshaven refinery would increase our overall European refining capacity by
approximately 74 percent, from 372,000 barrels per day at year-end 2005 to
647,000 barrels per day.

Marketing

R&M has marketing
operations in 15 European countries. 
R&M’s European marketing strategy is to sell primarily through
owned, leased or joint-venture retail sites using a low-cost, low-price,
high-volume strategy.  We also market
aviation fuels, liquid petroleum gases, heating oils, transportation fuels and
marine bunkers to commercial customers and into the bulk or spot market.

We use the “JET” brand name to
market retail and wholesale products in our wholly owned operations in Austria,
Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg,
Norway, Poland, Slovakia, Sweden and the United Kingdom.  In addition, a joint venture, in which we
have an equity interest, markets products in Switzerland under the “Coop” brand
name.  During 2005, we sold our equity
interest in a joint venture that marketed products in Turkey.  We also sell a portion of our Ireland
refinery output to inland Irish markets.

As of December 31, 2005,
R&M had approximately 2,110 marketing outlets in its European
operations, of which approximately 1,530 were company-owned, and
580 were dealer-owned.  Through our
joint-venture operations in Switzerland, we also have interests in
168 additional sites.  The company’s
largest branded site networks are in Germany and the United Kingdom, which
account for approximately 60 percent of our total European branded units.

As of December 31, 2005,
R&M had 145 marketing outlets in our wholly owned Thailand operations
in Asia.  In addition, through a joint
venture in Malaysia, we also have an interest in another 43 retail sites.  In Thailand and Malaysia, retail products are
marketed under the “JET” and “ProJET” brands, respectively.  We are currently in the process of
transitioning our Malaysian retail business from mostly company-operated sites
to dealer-operated sites, and the fuel will still be branded “ProJET.”

LUKOIL INVESTMENT

At December 31, 2005, our
LUKOIL Investment segment represented 5 percent of ConocoPhillips’ total
assets, while contributing 5 percent of net income.

In September 2004, we made a
joint announcement with LUKOIL, an international integrated oil and gas company
headquartered in Russia, of an agreement to form a broad-based strategic
alliance, whereby we would become a strategic equity investor in LUKOIL.

We were the successful bidder
in an auction of 7.6 percent of LUKOIL’s authorized and issued ordinary shares
held by the Russian government.  The
transaction closed on October 7, 2004. 
By year-end 2004, we had increased our ownership in LUKOIL to
10 percent, and by year-end 2005, we had increased our ownership to
16.1 percent.  Under the Shareholder
Agreement between the two companies, we had the right to nominate a
representative to the LUKOIL Board of Directors (Board).  In January 2005, our nominee was elected to
the LUKOIL Board, and certain amendments to LUKOIL’s corporate charter that
require unanimous Board consent for certain key decisions were approved.  In addition, the Shareholder Agreement allows
us to increase our ownership interest in LUKOIL to 20 percent and limits
our ability to sell our LUKOIL shares for a period of four years, except in
certain circumstances.  We use the equity
method of accounting for our investment in LUKOIL.  We estimate that our net share of LUKOIL’s
proved reserves at December 31, 2005, was 1,442 million BOE.


As reported in LUKOIL’s 2004
annual report, the majority of its 2004 upstream oil production was sourced
within Russia, with 65 percent from the western Siberia region, 14 percent from
the Timan-Pechora region and 12 percent from the Urals region.  Outside of Russia, LUKOIL has oil production
in Kazakhstan and Egypt, and has exploratory or other projects under way in
Kazakhstan, Colombia, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Iraq.  Downstream, LUKOIL has eight refineries with
a net crude oil throughput capacity of approximately 1.2 million barrels
per day.  In addition, LUKOIL has an
interest in approximately 4,600 retail sites in Russia and Europe, and another
approximately 2,000 in the northeast United States.

CHEMICALS

Construction of a major olefins
and polyolefins complex in Mesaieed, Qatar, called “Q-Chem,” was completed in
2003.  CPChem has signed an agreement for
the development of a second complex to be built in Mesaieed, called “Q-Chem
II.”  The facility will be designed to
produce polyethylene and normal alpha olefins, on a site adjacent to the Q-Chem
complex.  In connection with this
project, CPChem and Qatar Petroleum entered into a separate agreement with
Total Petrochemicals and Qatar Petrochemical Company Ltd., establishing a joint
venture to develop an ethylene cracker in Ras Laffan Industrial City,
Qatar.  The cracker will provide ethylene
feedstock via pipeline to the planned polyethylene and normal alpha olefins
plants.  Construction began in late 2005,
with operational startup of both projects anticipated in late 2008.


In 2003, CPChem formed a 50-percent-owned
joint venture company to develop an integrated styrene facility in Al Jubail,
Saudi Arabia.  The facility, to be built
on a site adjacent to the existing aromatics complex owned by Saudi Chevron
Phillips Company (SCP), another 50-percent-owned CPChem joint venture, will
include feed fractionation, an olefins cracker, and ethylbenzene and styrene
monomer processing units.  Construction
of the facility, which began in the fourth quarter of 2004, is in conjunction
with an expansion of SCP’s benzene plant, together called the “JCP
Project.”  Operational startup is
anticipated in late 2007.

Item
1A. RISK FACTORS

You should carefully
consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information
included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business,
operating results and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the
value of an investment in our common stock.

A substantial or extended decline
in crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, as well as refining
margins, would reduce our operating results and cash flows, and could impact
our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets.

Prices for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas
liquids fluctuate widely.  Our revenues,
operating results and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the prices
we receive for our crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and refined
products.  Historically, the markets for
crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and refined products have been
volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future.  Many of the factors influencing the prices of
crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and refined products are beyond our
control.  These factors include, among
others:

•

Worldwide and domestic
supplies of, and demand for, crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and
refined products.

•

The cost of exploring for,
developing, producing, refining and marketing crude oil, natural gas, natural
gas liquids and refined products.

•

Changes in weather patterns
and climatic changes.

•

The ability of the members of
OPEC and other producing nations to agree to and maintain production levels.

•

The worldwide military and
political environment, uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation
or additional outbreak of armed hostilities or further acts of terrorism in the
United States, or elsewhere.

•

The price and availability
of alternative and competing fuels.

•

Domestic and foreign
governmental regulations and taxes.

•

General economic conditions worldwide.

The long-term effects of these and other conditions
on the prices of crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and refined
products are uncertain.  Generally, our
policy is to remain exposed to market prices of commodities; however,
management may elect to hedge the price risk of our crude oil, natural gas,
natural gas liquids and refined products.

Lower crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids
and refined products prices may reduce the amount of these commodities that we
can produce economically, which may reduce our revenues, operating income and
cash flows.  Significant reductions in
commodity prices could require us to reduce our capital expenditures and impair
the carrying value of our assets.

Estimates of crude oil and
natural gas reserves depend on many factors and assumptions, including various
assumptions that are based on conditions in existence as of the dates of the
estimates.  Any material changes in those
conditions or other factors affecting those assumptions could impair the quantity
and value of our crude oil and natural gas reserves.


The proved crude oil and natural gas reserve
information relating to us included in this annual report has been derived from
engineering estimates prepared by our personnel.  The estimates were calculated using crude oil
and natural gas prices in effect as of December 31, 2005, as well as other
conditions in existence as of that date. 
Any significant future price changes will have a material effect on the
quantity and present value of our proved reserves.  Future reserve revisions could also result
from changes in, among other things, governmental regulation.

Reserve estimation is a subjective process
that involves estimating volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations
of crude oil and natural gas that cannot be directly measured.  Estimates of economically recoverable crude
oil and natural gas reserves and of future net cash flows depend upon a number
of variable factors and assumptions, including:

•

Historical
production from the area, compared with production from other comparable
producing areas.

•

The assumed
effects of regulations by governmental agencies.

•

Assumptions
concerning future crude oil and natural gas prices.

•

Assumptions
concerning future operating costs, severance and excise taxes, development
costs and workover and remedial costs.

As a result, different petroleum engineers,
each using industry-accepted geologic and engineering practices and scientific
methods, may produce different estimates of reserves and future net cash flows
based on the same available data. 
Because of the subjective nature of crude oil and natural gas reserve
estimates, each of the following items may differ materially from the amounts
or other factors estimated:

•

The amount and
timing of crude oil and natural gas production.

•

The revenues and
costs associated with that production.

•

The amount and
timing of future development expenditures.

The discounted future net revenues from our
reserves should not be considered as the market value of the reserves
attributable to our properties.  As
required by rules adopted by the SEC, the estimated discounted future net cash
flows from our proved reserves, as described in the supplemental oil and gas operations
disclosures on pages 183 through 185, are based generally on prices and costs
as of the date of the estimate, while actual future prices and costs may be
materially higher or lower.

In addition, the 10 percent discount factor,
which SEC rules require to be used to calculate discounted future net revenues
for reporting purposes, is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor
based on our cost of capital and the risks associated with our business and the
crude oil and natural gas industry in general.

If we are unsuccessful in
acquiring or finding additional reserves, our future crude oil and natural gas
production would decline, thereby reducing our cash flows and results of
operations, negatively impacting our financial condition.

The rate of production from crude oil and natural
gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted. Except to the
extent that we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves,
conduct successful exploration and development activities, or, through
engineering studies, identify additional or secondary recovery reserves, our
proved reserves will decline materially as we produce crude oil and natural
gas.  Accordingly, to the extent that we
are not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas we produce


with good prospects for future production, our
business will decline.  Creating and
maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors, including:

•

Obtaining rights
to explore, develop and produce crude oil and natural gas in promising areas.

•

Drilling success.

•

The ability to
complete long lead-time, capital-intensive projects timely and on budget.

•

Efficient and
profitable operation of mature properties.

We may not be able to find or acquire additional
reserves at acceptable costs.

Crude oil price increases and
environmental regulations may reduce our refined product margins.

The
profitability of our R&M segment depends largely on the margin between the
cost of crude oil and other feedstocks we refine and the selling prices we
obtain for refined products.  Our overall
profitability could be adversely affected by the availability of supply and
rising crude oil and other feedstock prices that we do not recover in the
marketplace.  Refined product margins
historically have been volatile and vary with the level of economic activity in
the various marketing areas, the regulatory climate, logistical capabilities
and the available supply of refined products.

In addition, environmental regulations,
particularly the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act, have imposed, and are
expected to continue to impose, increasingly stringent and costly requirements
on our refining and marketing operations, which may reduce refined product margins.

We will continue to incur
substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of compliance
with, and changes in, environmental laws and regulations, and, as a result, our
profitability could be materially reduced.

Our
businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the
protection of the environment. These laws and regulations continue to increase
in both number and complexity and affect our operations with respect to, among
other things:

•

The discharge of
pollutants into the environment.

•

The handling, use,
storage, transportation, disposal and clean-up of hazardous materials and
hazardous and non-hazardous wastes.

•

The dismantlement,
abandonment and restoration of our properties and facilities at the end of
their useful lives.

We have incurred and will continue to incur
substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as
a result of these laws and regulations. 
To the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately
reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results
will be adversely affected.  The specific
impact of these laws and regulations on us and our competitors may vary
depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of operating
facilities, marketing areas and production processes.  We may also be required to make material
expenditures to:

•

Modify operations.

•

Install pollution
control equipment.

•

Perform site
cleanups.


•

Curtail
operations.

We may become subject to liabilities that we
currently do not anticipate in connection with new, amended or more stringent
requirements, stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future
discovery of contamination.  In addition,
any failure by us to comply with existing or future laws could result in civil
or criminal fines and other enforcement actions against us.

Our, and our predecessors’, operations also
could expose us to civil claims by third parties for alleged liability
resulting from contamination of the environment or personal injuries caused by
releases of hazardous substances.

Environmental laws are subject to frequent
change and many of them have become more stringent.  In some cases, they can impose liability for
the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible party, without regard to
negligence or fault, and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or
conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all
applicable requirements when we performed them.

Please read “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Contingencies—Environmental” in Item 7 of this annual report.

Worldwide political and
economic developments could damage our operations and materially reduce our
profitability and cash flows.

Local political and economic factors in
international markets could have a material adverse effect on us. Approximately
65 percent of our crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production in
2005 was derived from production outside the United States, and 66 percent
of our proved reserves, as of December 31, 2005, were located outside the
United States.

There are many risks associated with
operations in international markets, including changes in foreign governmental
policies relating to crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids or refined
product pricing and taxation, other political, economic or diplomatic
developments, changing political conditions and international monetary
fluctuations.  These risks include, among
others:

•

Political and
economic instability, war, acts of terrorism and civil disturbances.

•

The possibility
that a foreign government may seize our property, with or without compensation,
may attempt to renegotiate or revoke existing contractual arrangements and
concessions, or may impose additional taxes or royalties.

•

Fluctuating
currency values, hard currency shortages and currency controls.

Continued hostilities and turmoil in the
world and the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could affect the
economies of the United States and other developed countries.  A lower level of economic activity could
result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and
margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects.  More specifically, our energy-related assets
may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible
targets.  A direct attack on our assets,
or assets used by us, could have a material adverse effect on our operations,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects.  These risks could lead to increased
volatility in prices for crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and
refined products and could increase instability in the financial and insurance
markets, making it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain the
insurance coverage that we consider adequate.


Actions of the U.S. government through tax
and other legislation, executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce
our operating profitability both in the United States and abroad.  The U.S. government can prevent or restrict
us from doing business in foreign countries. 
These restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past
limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various
countries.  Actions by both the United
States and host governments have affected operations significantly in the past
and will continue to do so in the future.

We also are exposed to fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates.  We do
not comprehensively hedge our exposure to currency rate changes, although we
may choose to selectively hedge certain working capital balances, firm
commitments, cash returns from affiliates and/or tax payments.  These efforts may not be successful.

Changes in governmental
regulations may impose price controls and limitations on production of crude
oil and natural gas.

Our operations are subject to extensive
governmental regulations.  From time to
time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on
production by restricting the rate of flow of crude oil and natural gas wells
below actual production capacity in order to conserve supplies of crude oil and
natural gas.  Because legal requirements
are frequently changed and subject to interpretation, we cannot predict the
effect of these requirements.

Our operations are subject to
business interruptions and casualty losses, and we do not insure against all
potential losses, so we could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities.

Our exploration and production operations are
subject to unplanned occurrences, including blowouts, explosions, fires, loss
of well control, formations with abnormal pressures, spills and adverse
weather.  In addition, our refining,
marketing and transportation operations are subject to business interruptions
due to scheduled refinery turnarounds and unplanned events such as explosions,
fires, pipeline interruptions, pipeline ruptures, crude oil or refined product
spills, inclement weather or labor disputes. 
Our operations are also subject to the additional hazards of pollution,
releases of toxic gas and other environmental hazards and risks, as well as
hazards of marine operations, such as capsizing, collision and damage or loss
from severe weather conditions.  All such
hazards could result in loss of human life, significant property and equipment
damage, environmental pollution, impairment of operations and substantial
losses to us.  These hazards have
adversely affected us in the past, and litigation arising from a catastrophic
occurrence in the future at one of our locations may result in our being named
as a defendant in lawsuits asserting potentially large claims or being assessed
potentially substantial fines by governmental authorities.  In addition, we are exposed to risks inherent
in any business, such as terrorist attacks, equipment failures, accidents,
theft, strikes, protests and sabotage, that could disrupt or interrupt
operations.

We maintain insurance against many, but not
all, potential losses or liabilities arising from these operating hazards in
amounts that we believe to be prudent. 
Uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating hazards could
reduce the funds available to us for exploration, drilling, production and
other capital expenditures and could materially reduce our profitability.

Our investments in joint ventures decrease
our ability to manage risk.

We
conduct many of our operations through joint ventures in which we may share
control with our joint-venture partners. 
As with any joint-venture arrangement, differences in views among the
joint-venture participants may result in delayed decisions or in failures to
agree on major issues.  There is the risk
that our joint-venture partners may at any time have economic, business or
legal interests or goals that are


inconsistent
with those of the joint venture or us. 
There is also risk that our joint-venture partners may be unable to meet
their economic or other obligations and that we may be required to fulfill
those obligations alone.  Failure by us,
or an entity in which we have a joint-venture interest, to adequately manage
the risks associated with any acquisitions or joint ventures could have a
material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of
our joint ventures and, in turn, our business and operations.

We anticipate entering into additional joint
ventures with other entities.  We cannot
assure that we will undertake such joint ventures or, if undertaken, that such
joint ventures will be successful.

We may not be
successful in continuing to grow through acquisitions, and any further
acquisitions may require us to obtain additional financing or could result in
dilution of earnings per share.

A
substantial portion of our growth over the last several years has been
attributable to acquisitions.  Risks
associated with acquisitions include those relating to:

•

Diversion of management
time and attention from our existing businesses and other priorities.

•

Difficulties in
integrating the financial, technological and management standards, processes,
procedures and controls of an acquired business into those of our existing
operations.

•

Liability for
known or unknown environmental conditions or other contingent liabilities not
covered by indemnification or insurance.

•

Greater than
anticipated expenditures required for compliance with environmental or other
regulatory standards, or for investments to improve operating results.

•

Difficulties in
achieving anticipated operational improvements.

We
may not be successful in continuing to grow through acquisitions.  In addition, the financing of future
acquisitions may require us to incur additional indebtedness, which could limit
our financial flexibility, or to issue additional equity, which could result in
dilution of the ownership interests of existing stockholders. Any acquisitions
that we do consummate may not produce the anticipated benefits or may have
adverse effects on our business and operating results.

Our results of
operations could be adversely affected by goodwill impairments.

As a result of mergers and acquisitions, at
year-end 2005 we had approximately $15 billion of goodwill on our balance
sheet.  Goodwill is not amortized, but
instead must be tested at least annually for impairment by applying a
fair-value-based test.  Goodwill is
deemed impaired to the extent that its carrying amount exceeds the residual
fair value of the reporting unit. 
Although our latest tests indicate that no goodwill impairment is
currently required, future deterioration in market conditions could lead to
goodwill impairments that could have a substantial negative affect on our
profitability.

Item 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

None.


Item 3.        LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The following
is a description of reportable legal proceedings, including those involving
governmental authorities under federal, state and local laws regulating the
discharge of materials into the environment for this reporting period.  The following proceedings include those
matters that arose during the fourth quarter of 2005 and those matters previously
reported in ConocoPhillips’ 2004 Form 10-K and our first-, second- and
third-quarter 2005 Form 10-Qs that have not been resolved.  While it is not possible to accurately
predict the final outcome of these pending proceedings, if any one or more of
such proceeding was decided adversely to ConocoPhillips, there would be no
material effect on our consolidated financial position.  Nevertheless, such proceedings are reported
pursuant to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s regulations.

In December 2005, the
Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) proposed an administrative
penalty of $120,132 for alleged violations of the Texas Clean Air Act at the
Borger refinery.  The allegations relate
to unexcused emission events, reporting and recordkeeping requirements, leak
detection and repair, flare outages, and deviation reporting.  We expect to work with the TCEQ to resolve
this matter.

On October 19,
2005, the Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) notified us of
their intent to seek civil penalties in the amount of $108,000 for 18 alleged
violations of various BAAQMD regulations at our Rodeo facility and carbon plant
located in the San Francisco area that occurred between February 2005 and July
2005.  We are currently assessing these
allegations and expect to work with the BAAQMD toward a resolution of this
matter.

On October 11,
2005, the ConocoPhillips Pipe Line Company received a Notice of Probable
Violation and Proposed Civil Penalty from the Department of Transportation’s
Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (DOT) alleging violation
of DOT’s Integrity Management Program and proposing penalties in the amount of
$200,000.  We responded to these
allegations and expect to work with the DOT toward a resolution of this matter.

In
July and August 2005, the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD)
performed inspections at our Los Angeles refinery in Wilmington and Carson,
California, focusing on our leak detection and repair program for fugitive
emissions as required under SCAQMD rules. 
The SCAQMD has informed us that they believe, as a result of these
inspections, we violated certain rules related to the leak detection and repair
program.  We are currently working with
the SCAQMD to resolve this matter.

In June 2005, the SCAQMD
notified us of their intent to seek civil penalties in the amount of $401,000
for 18 alleged violations of various SCAQMD regulations at our Los Angeles
refinery in Wilmington and Carson, California, and one of our tank facilities
in Torrance, California.  On
October 27 and December 5, 2005, we entered into several settlements
with the SCAQMD to resolve all the alleged violations.  We paid a total civil penalty of $360,850 to
the SCAQMD.

In March 2005,
ConocoPhillips Pipe Line Company received a Notice of Probable Violation and
Proposed Civil Penalty from DOT alleging violation of DOT operation and safety
regulations at certain facilities in Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana,
Wyoming and Nebraska and proposing penalties in the amount of $184,500.  We are currently assessing these allegations
and expect to work with the DOT toward a resolution of this matter.


From December 2004 to
January 2005, the Rodeo facility experienced some exceedances of its wastewater
daily-permitted-limit for copper under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) program, as administered by the San Francisco Bay
Region Regional Water Quality Control Board (Water Board).  The Rodeo facility self-reported the
exceedances.  In November 2005, we agreed
with the Water Board staff to resolve these and other alleged NPDES exceedances
for a civil penalty of $48,000 and supplemental environmental projects valued
at $63,000.  The Water Board finalized
the settlement as proposed.

In December
2004, the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency (PSCAA) notified us of their intent to
seek civil penalties in the amount of $203,000 for alleged violations of
various PSCAA regulations at our Tacoma Terminal in the state of Washington.  We resolved this matter with the payment of
civil penalties to the PSCAA in the amount of $46,000 and recognizing facility
improvement credits in the amount of $115,000.

The U.S. Coast
Guard and Washington State Department of Ecology are investigating the possible
sources of an alleged oil spill in Puget Sound. 
In November 2004, the U.S. Attorney and the U.S. Coast Guard offices in
Seattle, Washington, issued subpoenas to Polar Tankers, Inc., a subsidiary of
ConocoPhillips Company, for records related to the vessel Polar Texas.  On December 23, 2004, the governor of
the state of Washington and the U.S. Coast Guard publicly announced that they
believed the Polar Texas was the source of the alleged spill.  Based on everything presently known by us, we
do not believe that we are the source of the alleged spill.  We are fully cooperating with the
governmental authorities.

In August
2004, Polar Tankers self-reported to the U.S. Coast Guard that a company
employee had disclosed to management potential environmental violations onboard
the vessel Polar Alaska.  The potential
violations related to allegations that certain actions may have resulted in one
or more wastewater streams being discharged potentially having concentrations
of oil exceeding an applicable regulatory limit of 15 parts per million.  On September 1, 2004, the United States
Attorney’s office in Anchorage issued a subpoena to ConocoPhillips Company and
Polar Tankers for records relating to the company’s report of potential
violations.  We are fully cooperating
with the governmental authorities.

In July 2004, Polar
Tankers notified the U.S. Coast Guard of possible environmental violations
onboard the vessel Polar Discovery.  On
June 29, 2005, the U.S. Attorney’s office in Anchorage issued a subpoena to
Polar Tankers for records regarding the possible environmental violations
onboard that vessel. We are fully cooperating with the governmental authorities
in their investigation.

In August of
2003, EPA Region 6 issued a Show Cause Order alleging violations of the Clean
Water Act at the Borger refinery.  The
alleged violations relate primarily to discharges of selenium and reported
exceedances of permit limits for whole effluent toxicity.  We met with the EPA staff on several
occasions to discuss the allegations.  We
believe the EPA staff is evaluating the information presented at the
meetings.  The EPA has not yet proposed a
penalty amount.

On December 17, 2002, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) notified
ConocoPhillips of various alleged violations of the NPDES permit for the Sweeny
refinery.  DOJ asserts that these alleged
violations occurred at various times during the period from January 1997
through July 2002.  A consent decree was
lodged with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston
Division on October 4, 2004, proposing a civil penalty of $610,000 and a
Supplemental Environmental Project (SEP) valued at approximately $90,000.  Under the SEP, ConocoPhillips will donate
approximately 128 acres of land it owns near the Sweeny refinery to the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service for inclusion in the San Bernard National Wildlife
Refuge.  We await the court’s approval
and entry of the consent decree.


On July 15, 2002, the United
States filed a Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
Act (CERCLA) cost recovery action against Conoco Inc. and seven other
defendants alleging that the United States had incurred unreimbursed response
costs at the Lowry Superfund Site located in Arapahoe County, Colorado.  The United States seeks recovery of
approximately $12.3 million in past response costs and a declaratory judgment
for future CERCLA response cost liability. 
The defendants filed counterclaims seeking declaratory relief that
certain response actions taken by the government were inconsistent with the
National Contingency Plan.  The matter
has been resolved and the defendants, including ConocoPhillips, signed a
Consent Decree and Settlement Agreement, which has been approved by the court.

BUSINESS
ENVIRONMENT AND EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

ConocoPhillips is an
international, integrated energy company. 
We are the third largest integrated energy company in the United States,
based on market capitalization.  We have
approximately 35,600 employees worldwide, and at year-end 2005 had assets
of $107 billion.  Our stock is
listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “COP.”  Our business is organized into six operating
segments:

•

Exploration
and Production (E&P)

—This segment primarily explores for, produces and
markets crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis.

•

Midstream

—This
segment gathers and processes natural gas produced by ConocoPhillips and
others, and fractionates and markets natural gas liquids, primarily in the
United States, Canada and Trinidad.  The
Midstream segment primarily includes our 50 percent equity investment in Duke
Energy Field Services, LLC (DEFS), a joint venture with Duke Energy
Corporation.

•

Refining and
Marketing (R&M)

—This segment purchases, refines, markets and
transports crude oil and petroleum products, mainly in the United States,
Europe and Asia.

•

LUKOIL
Investment

—This segment consists of our equity investment in the ordinary
shares of OAO LUKOIL (LUKOIL), an international, integrated oil and gas company
headquartered in Russia.  Our investment
was 16.1 percent at December 31, 2005.

•

Chemicals

—This
segment manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide
basis.  The Chemicals segment consists of
our 50 percent equity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC
(CPChem), a joint venture with Chevron Corporation.

•

Emerging
Businesses

—This segment encompasses the development of new businesses
beyond our traditional operations, including new technologies related to
natural gas conversion into clean fuels and related products (e.g.,
gas-to-liquids), technology solutions, power generation, and emerging
technologies.

Crude oil and natural gas
prices, along with refining margins, play the most significant roles in our
profitability.  Accordingly, our overall
earnings depend primarily upon the profitability of our E&P and R&M
segments.  Crude oil and natural gas
prices, along with refining margins, are driven by market


factors over which we have no
control.  However, from a competitive
perspective, there are other important factors that we must manage well to be
successful, including:

•

Adding to our proved reserve base.

We
primarily add to our proved reserve base in three ways:

•

Successful exploration and development of new
fields.

•

Acquisition of existing fields.

•

Applying new technologies and processes to
boost recovery from existing fields.

Through
a combination of all three methods listed above, we have been successful in the
past in maintaining or adding to our production and proved reserve base, and we
anticipate being able to do so in the future. 
In late 2005, we signed an agreement with the Libyan National Oil
Corporation under which we and our co-venturers acquired an ownership interest
in the Waha concessions in Libya.  As a
result, we added 238 million barrels to our net proved crude oil reserves in
2005.  In the three years ending December
31, 2005, our reserve replacement exceeded 100 percent, including the
impact of our equity investments.  The
replacement rate was primarily attributable to our investment in LUKOIL, other
purchases of reserves in place, and extensions and discoveries.  Although it cannot be assured, going forward,
we expect to more than replace our production over the next three years.  This expectation is based on our current
slate of exploratory and improved recovery projects and the anticipated
additional ownership interest in LUKOIL.

•

Operating our
producing properties and refining and marketing operations safely, consistently
and in an environmentally sound manner.

Safety is our first priority and we are committed to protecting the
health and safety of everyone who has a role in our operations.  Maintaining high utilization rates at our
refineries, minimizing downtime in producing fields, and maximizing the
development of our reserves all enable us to capture the value the market gives
us in terms of prices and margins. 
During 2005, our worldwide refinery capacity utilization rate was
93 percent, compared with 94 percent in 2004.  The reduced utilization rate reflects the impact
of hurricanes on our U.S. refining operations during 2005.  Finally, we strive to conduct our operations
in a manner that emphasizes our environmental stewardship.

•

Controlling
costs and expenses.

Since we cannot
control the prices of the commodity products we sell, keeping our operating and
overhead costs low, within the context of our commitment to safety and
environmental stewardship, is a high priority. 
We monitor these costs using various methodologies that are reported to
senior management monthly, on both an absolute-dollar basis and a per-unit
basis.  Because low operating and
overhead costs are critical to maintaining competitive positions in our
industries, cost control is a component of our variable compensation programs.

•

Selecting the
appropriate projects in which to invest our capital dollars.

We participate in capital-intensive
industries.  As a result, we must often
invest significant capital dollars to explore for new oil and gas fields,
develop newly discovered fields, maintain existing fields, or continue to
maintain and improve our refinery complexes. 
We invest in those projects that are expected to provide an adequate
financial return on invested dollars. 
However, there are often long lead times from the time we make an
investment to the time that investment is operational and begins generating
financial returns.  Our capital
expenditures and investments in 2005 totaled $11.6 billion, and we
anticipate capital expenditures and investments to be approximately
$11.2 billion in 2006, including our expenditures to re-enter Libya.  The 2006 amount excludes any discretionary
expenditures that may be made to further increase our equity investment in
LUKOIL.


•

Managing our
asset portfolio.

We continue to
evaluate opportunities to acquire assets that will contribute to future growth
at competitive prices.  We also
continually assess our assets to determine if any no longer fit our growth
strategy and should be sold or otherwise disposed.  This management of our asset portfolio is
important to ensuring our long-term growth and maintaining adequate financial
returns.  During 2004, we substantially
completed the asset disposition program that we announced at the time of the
merger.  Also during 2004, we acquired a
10 percent interest in LUKOIL, a major Russian integrated energy
company.  During 2005, we increased our
investment in LUKOIL, ending the year with a 16.1 percent ownership
interest.  Also during 2005, we entered
into an agreement to acquire Burlington Resources Inc., an independent
exploration and production company with a substantial position in North
American natural gas reserves and production. 
The transaction has a preliminary value of $33.9 billion.  Under the terms of the agreement, Burlington
Resources shareholders would receive $46.50 in cash and 0.7214 shares of
ConocoPhillips common stock for each Burlington Resources share they own.  This transaction is expected to close on
March 31, 2006, subject to approval by Burlington Resources shareholders at a
special meeting set for March 30, 2006.

•

Hiring,
developing and retaining a talented workforce.

We want to attract, train, develop and retain
individuals with the knowledge and skills to implement our business strategy
and who support our values and ethics.

Our key performance indicators
are shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating
segment sections that follow.  These
include crude oil and natural gas prices and production, natural gas liquids
prices, refining capacity utilization, and refinery output.

Other significant factors that
can affect our profitability include:

•

Property and
leasehold impairments.

As mentioned
above, we participate in capital-intensive industries.  At times, these investments become impaired
when our reserve estimates are revised downward, when crude oil or natural gas
prices, or refinery margins, decline significantly for long periods of time, or
when a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down to its fair market
value.  Property impairments in 2005
totaled $42 million, compared with $164 million in 2004.  We may also invest large amounts of money in
exploration blocks which, if exploratory drilling proves unsuccessful, could
lead to material impairment of leasehold values.

•

Goodwill.

As a result of mergers and acquisitions, at
year-end 2005 we had $15.3 billion of goodwill on our balance sheet.  Although our latest tests indicate that no
goodwill impairment is currently required, future deterioration in market
conditions could lead to goodwill impairments that would have a substantial
negative, though non-cash, effect on our profitability.

•

Tax
jurisdictions.

As a global company, our
operations are located in countries with different tax rates and fiscal
structures.  Accordingly, our overall
effective tax rate can vary significantly between periods based on the “mix” of
earnings within our global operations.

Segment
Analysis

The E&P segment’s results
are most closely linked to crude oil and natural gas prices.  These are commodity products, the prices of
which are subject to factors external to our company and over which we have no
control.  We benefited from favorable
crude oil prices in 2005, which contributed significantly to what we view as
strong results from this segment. 
Industry crude oil prices were approximately $15 per barrel (or 36
percent) higher in 2005, compared with 2004, averaging $56.44 per barrel for
West Texas Intermediate.  The increase
primarily was due to robust global consumption associated with the continuing global
economic recovery, as well as oil supply disruptions in Iraq, and disruptions
in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico due to hurricanes Katrina and Rita.  In addition, there was little excess OPEC
production capacity


available to replace lost
supplies.  Industry U.S. natural gas
prices were $2.51 per million British thermal units (MMBTU) (or 41
percent) higher in 2005, compared with 2004, averaging approximately
$8.64 per MMBTU for Henry Hub. 
Natural gas prices increased  in
2005 due primarily to higher oil prices, continued concerns regarding the
adequacy of U.S. natural gas supplies, and the hurricanes disrupting production
and distribution in the Gulf Coast region. 
Looking forward, prices for both crude and natural gas are expected to
decrease in 2006 from 2005 levels, while remaining strong relative to long-term
historical averages.

The Midstream segment’s results
are most closely linked to natural gas liquids prices.  The most important factor on the
profitability of this segment is the results from our 50 percent equity
investment in DEFS.  During 2005, we
increased our ownership interest in DEFS from 30.3 percent to 50 percent.  During 2005, we recorded a gain of
$306 million, after-tax, for our equity share of DEFS’ sale of its general
partnership interest in TEPPCO Partners, LP (TEPPCO).

Refining margins, refinery
utilization, cost control, and marketing margins primarily drive the R&M
segment’s results.  Refining margins are
subject to movements in the cost of crude oil and other feedstocks, and the
sales prices for refined products, which are subject to market factors over
which we have no control.  Refining
margins in 2005 were stronger in comparison to 2004, resulting in improved
R&M profitability.  The U.S. Gulf
Coast light oil spread increased 68 percent, from an average of
$6.49 per barrel in 2004 to $10.92 per barrel in 2005.  Key factors driving the 2005 growth in
refining margins were healthy growth in demand for refined products in the
United States and other countries worldwide, as well as concerns over adequate
supplies due to hurricanes Katrina and Rita damaging refining and distribution
infrastructure along the Gulf Coast.  Our
marketing margins were lower in 2005, compared with 2004, due to the market’s
inability to pass through higher crude and product costs.

The LUKOIL Investment segment
consists of our investment in the ordinary shares of LUKOIL.  In October 2004, we closed on a transaction
to acquire 7.6 percent of LUKOIL’s shares held by the Russian government
for approximately $2 billion. 
During the remainder of 2004 and all of 2005, we acquired additional
shares in the open market for an additional $2.8 billion, bringing our
equity ownership interest in LUKOIL to 16.1 percent by year-end 2005.  We initiated this strategic investment to
gain further exposure to Russia’s resource potential, where LUKOIL has
significant positions in proved reserves and production.  We also are benefiting from an increase in
proved oil and gas reserves at an attractive cost, and our E&P segment
should benefit from direct participation with LUKOIL in large oil projects in
the northern Timan-Pechora region of Russia, and an opportunity to potentially
participate in the development of the West Qurna field in Iraq.

The Chemicals segment consists
of our 50 percent interest in CPChem. 
The chemicals and plastics industry is mainly a commodity-based industry
where the margins for key products are based on market factors over which
CPChem has little or no control.  CPChem
is investing in feedstock-advantaged areas in the Middle East with access to
large, growing markets, such as Asia. 
Our financial results from Chemicals in 2005 were the strongest since
the formation of CPChem in 2000, as this business line has emerged from a deep
cyclical downturn that began around that time.

The Emerging Businesses segment
represents our investment in new technologies or businesses outside our normal
scope of operations.  We do not expect
the results from this segment to be material to our consolidated results.  However, the businesses in this segment allow
us to support our primary segments by staying current on new technologies that
could become important drivers of profitability in future years.

At December 31, 2005, we
had a debt-to-capital ratio of 19 percent, compared with 26 percent at the
end of 2004.  The decrease was due to a
$2.5 billion reduction in debt during 2005, along with increased equity
reflecting strong earnings.  Upon
completion of the Burlington Resources acquisition, we expect our debt-


to-capital ratio to increase
into the low-30-percent range.  However,
we expect debt reduction to be a priority after the acquisition, allowing us to
move back toward a mid-to-low-20-percent debt-to-capital ratio within three
years.

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

Consolidated Results

A summary of the company’s net income (loss)
by business segment follows:

The improved results in 2005
and 2004 primarily were due to:

•

Higher crude
oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices in our E&P and Midstream
segments.

•

Improved
refining margins in our R&M segment.

•

Equity earnings
from our investment in LUKOIL.

In addition, the improved
results in 2005 also reflected our equity share of DEFS’ sale of its general
partner interest in TEPPCO.

See the “Segment Results”
section for additional information on our segment results.

Income
Statement Analysis

2005 vs. 2004

Sales and other operating
revenues increased 33 percent in 2005, while purchased crude oil, natural
gas and products increased 39 percent. 
These increases primarily were due to higher petroleum product prices
and higher prices for crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids.

At its September
2005 meeting, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on
Issue No. 04-13, “Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the
Same Counterparty,” which encompasses our buy/sell transactions, and will
impact our reported revenues and purchase costs.  The EITF concluded that purchases and sales
of inventory with the same counterparty in the same line of business should be
recorded net and accounted for as nonmonetary exchanges if they are entered
into “in contemplation” of one another. 
The new guidance is effective prospectively beginning April 1,
2006, for


new arrangements
entered into, and for modifications or renewals of existing arrangements.

Had this new guidance been effective for the periods included in this
report, and depending on the determination of what transactions are affected by
the new guidance, we would have been required
to reduce sales and other operating revenues in 2005, 2004 and 2003 by $21,814 million, $15,492 million
and $11,673 million, respectively, with related decreases in purchased
crude oil, natural gas and products.  See
Note 1—Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
for additional information.

Equity in earnings of
affiliates increased 125 percent in 2005. 
The increase reflects a full year’s equity earnings from our investment
in LUKOIL, as well as improved results from:

•

Our heavy-oil
joint ventures in Venezuela (Hamaca and Petrozuata), due to higher crude oil
prices and higher production volumes at Hamaca.

•

Our chemicals
joint venture, CPChem, due to higher margins.

•

Our midstream
joint venture, DEFS, reflecting higher natural gas liquids prices and DEFS’
gain on the sale of its TEPPCO general partner interest.

•

Our
joint-venture refinery in Melaka, Malaysia, due to improved refining margins in
the Asia Pacific region.

•

Our
joint-venture delayed coker facilities at the Sweeny, Texas, refinery, Merey
Sweeny LLP, due to wider heavy-light crude oil differentials.

Other income increased 52 percent in
2005.  The increase was mainly due to
higher net gains on asset dispositions in 2005, as well as higher interest income.  Asset dispositions in 2005 included the sale
of our interest in coalbed methane acreage positions in the Powder River Basin
in Wyoming, as well as our interests in Dixie Pipeline, Turcas Petrol A.S., and
Venture Coke Company.  Asset dispositions
in 2004 included our interest in the Petrovera heavy-oil joint venture in
Canada.

Production and operating expenses increased
16 percent in 2005.  The E&P
segment had higher maintenance and transportation costs; higher costs
associated with new fields, including the Magnolia field in the Gulf of Mexico;
negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates; and upward insurance
premium adjustments.  The R&M segment
had higher utility costs due to higher natural gas prices, as well as higher
maintenance and repair costs due to increased turnaround activity and hurricane
impacts.

Depreciation, depletion and
amortization (DD&A) increased 12 percent in 2005, primarily due to new
projects in the E&P segment, including a full year’s production from the
Magnolia field in the Gulf of Mexico and the Belanak field, offshore Indonesia,
as well as new production from the Clair field in the Atlantic Margin and
continued ramp-up at the Bayu-Undan field in the Timor Sea.

We adopted Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset
Retirement Obligations—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143” (FIN 47),
effective December 31, 2005.  As a
result, we recognized a charge of $88 million for the cumulative effect of
this accounting change.  FIN 47 clarifies
that an entity is required to recognize a liability for a legal obligation to
perform asset retirement activities when the retirement is conditional on a
future event and if the liability’s fair value can be reasonably estimated.  FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would
have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset
retirement obligation.


2004 vs. 2003

Sales and other operating
revenues increased 30 percent in 2004, while purchased crude oil, natural
gas and products increased 34 percent. 
These increases mainly were due to:

•

Higher petroleum
products prices.

•

Higher prices
for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids.

•

Increased volumes
of natural gas bought and sold by our Commercial organization in its role of
optimizing the commodity flows of our E&P segment.

•

Higher excise,
value added and other similar taxes.

Equity in earnings of
affiliates increased 183 percent in 2004. 
The increase reflects initial equity earnings from our investment in
LUKOIL, as well as improved results from:

•

Our heavy-oil
joint ventures in Venezuela, due to higher crude oil prices and higher
production volumes.

•

CPChem, due to
higher volumes and margins.

•

DEFS, reflecting
higher natural gas liquids prices.

•

Our
joint-venture refinery in Melaka, Malaysia, due to improved refining margins in
the Asia Pacific region.

•

Merey Sweeny
LLP, due to wider heavy-light crude oil differentials.

Interest and debt expense
declined 35 percent in 2004.  The
decrease primarily was due to lower average debt levels during 2004 and an
increased amount of interest being capitalized on major capital projects.

During 2003, we recognized a
$28 million gain on subsidiary equity transactions related to our E&P
Bayu-Undan development in the Timor Sea. 
See Note 5—Subsidiary Equity Transactions, in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements, for additional information.

We adopted FASB Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations,” (SFAS No. 143) effective January 1, 2003.  As a result, we recognized a benefit of
$145 million for the cumulative effect of this accounting change.  Also effective January 1, 2003, we adopted
FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities,” (FIN 46(R)) for variable interest entities involving
synthetic leases and certain other financing structures created prior to
February 1, 2003.  This resulted in a
charge of $240 million for the cumulative effect of this accounting
change.  We recognized a net
$95 million charge in 2003 for the cumulative effect of these two
accounting changes.


Segment Results

E&P



The E&P segment explores
for, produces and markets crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids on a
worldwide basis.  It also mines deposits
of oil sands in Canada to extract the bitumen and upgrade it into a synthetic
crude oil.  At December 31, 2005, our
E&P operations were producing in the United States, Norway, the United
Kingdom, Canada, Nigeria, Venezuela, offshore Timor Leste in the Timor Sea,
Australia, China, Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates, Vietnam, and Russia.

2005 vs. 2004

Net income from the E&P
segment increased 48 percent in 2005.

The
increase primarily was due to higher sales prices for crude oil, natural gas,
natural gas liquids and Syncrude.  In
addition, increased sales volumes associated with the Magnolia and Bayu-Undan
fields, as well as the Hamaca project, contributed positively to net income in
2005.  Partially offsetting these items
were increased production and operating costs, DD&A and taxes, as well as
mark-to-market losses on certain U.K. natural gas contracts.

If crude oil and natural gas
prices in 2006 do not remain at the historically strong levels experienced in
2005, E&P’s earnings would be negatively impacted.  See the “Business Environment and Executive
Overview” section for additional discussion of crude oil and natural gas
prices.

Proved reserves at year-end
2005 were 7.92 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), compared with
7.61 billion BOE at year-end 2004. 
This excludes the estimated 1,442 million BOE and 880 million
BOE included in the LUKOIL Investment segment at year-end 2005 and 2004,
respectively.  Also excluded, our
Canadian Syncrude mining operations reported 251 million barrels of proved
oil sands reserves at year-end 2005, compared with 258 million barrels at
year-end 2004.

2004 vs. 2003

Net income from the E&P
segment increased 33 percent in 2004, compared with 2003.  The increase primarily was due to higher
crude oil prices and, to a lesser extent, higher natural gas and natural gas
liquids prices.  Increased sales prices
were partially offset by lower crude oil and natural gas production, as well as
higher exploration expenses and lower net gains on asset dispositions.  The 2003 period included a net benefit of
$142 million for the cumulative effect of accounting changes (SFAS No. 143
and FIN 46(R)), as well as benefits of $233 million from changes in
certain international income tax and site restoration laws, and equity
realignment of certain Australian operations. 
Included in 2004 is a $72 million benefit related to the
remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities from the 2003 Canadian graduated tax
rate reduction and a 2004 Alberta provincial tax rate change.

U.S. E&P

2005 vs. 2004

Net income from our U.S.
E&P operations increased 46 percent in 2005.

The increase primarily was the result of higher crude oil, natural gas
and natural gas liquids prices; higher sales volumes from the Magnolia
deepwater field in the Gulf of Mexico, which began producing in late 2004; and
higher gains from asset sales in 2005. 
These items were partially offset by:

•

Higher production and operating expenses,
reflecting increased transportation costs and well workover and other
maintenance activity, and the impact of newly producing fields and
environmental accruals.


•

Higher DD&A, mainly due to increased
production from the Magnolia field and other new fields.

•

Higher production taxes, resulting from
increased prices for crude oil and natural gas.

U.S. E&P production on a
BOE basis averaged 633,000 barrels per day in 2005, compared with
629,000 barrels per day in 2004. 
The slight increase reflects the positive impact of a full year’s
production from the Magnolia field and the purchase of overriding royalty
interests in the Utah and San Juan basins, mostly offset by normal field
production declines, hurricane-related downtime, and the impact of asset
dispositions.

2004 vs. 2003

Net income from our U.S.
E&P operations increased 24 percent in 2004, compared with 2003.  The increase was mainly the result of higher
crude oil prices and, to a lesser extent, higher natural gas and natural gas
liquids prices, partially offset by lower crude oil and natural gas production
volumes and lower net gains on asset dispositions.  In addition, the 2003 period included a net
benefit of $142 million for the cumulative effect of accounting changes (SFAS
No. 143 and FIN 46(R)).

U.S. E&P production on a
BOE basis averaged 629,000 barrels per day in 2004, down 7 percent
from 674,000 BOE per day in 2003. 
The decreased production primarily was the result of the impact of 2003
asset dispositions, normal field production declines, and planned maintenance
activities during 2004.

International E&P

2005 vs. 2004

Net income from our
international E&P operations increased 50 percent in 2005.

The increase primarily was the result of higher crude oil, natural gas
and natural gas liquids prices.  In
addition, we had higher sales volumes from the Bayu-Undan field in the Timor
Sea and the Hamaca project in Venezuela. 
These items were partially offset by:

•

Higher production and operating expenses,
reflecting increased costs at our Canadian Syncrude operations (including
higher utility costs there) and increased costs associated with newly producing
fields.

•

Mark-to-market losses on certain U.K. natural
gas contracts.

•

Higher DD&A, mainly due to increased
production from the Bayu-Undan field.

•

Higher income taxes incurred by our equity
affiliates at our Venezuelan heavy-oil projects.

International E&P
production averaged 910,000 BOE per day in 2005, a slight decrease from
913,000 BOE per day in 2004. 
Production was favorably impacted in 2005 by the

Bayu-Undan field and the Hamaca heavy-oil
upgrader project.  At the Bayu-Undan
field in the Timor Sea, 2005 production was higher than that in 2004, when
production was still ramping up.  At the
Hamaca project in Venezuela, production increased in late 2004 with the startup
of a heavy-oil upgrader.  These increases
in production were offset by the impact of planned and unplanned maintenance,
and field production declines.  Our
Syncrude mining operations produced 19,000 barrels per day in 2005,
compared with 21,000 barrels per day in 2004.


2004 vs. 2003

Net income from our
international E&P operations increased 43 percent in 2004, compared
with 2003.  The increase primarily was
due to higher crude oil prices and, to a lesser extent, higher natural gas and
natural gas liquids prices and higher natural gas liquids volumes.  Higher prices were partially offset by
increased exploration expenses.

International E&P’s net
income in 2003 also was favorably impacted by the following items:

•

In Norway, the Norway Removal Grant Act
(1986) was repealed, which resulted in a net after-tax benefit of $87 million.

•

In the Timor Sea region, a broad ownership
interest re-alignment among the co-venturers in the Bayu-Undan project and
certain deferred tax adjustments resulted in an after-tax benefit of $51
million.

•

In Canada, the Parliament enacted federal
tax rate reductions for oil and gas producers, which resulted in a $95 million
benefit upon revaluation of our deferred tax liability.

International E&P
production averaged 913,000 BOE per day in 2004, down slightly from 916,000
BOE per day in 2003.  Production was
favorably impacted in 2004 by the startup of production from the Su Tu Den
field in Vietnam in late 2003, the ramp-up of liquids production from the
Bayu-Undan field in the Timor Sea since startup in February 2004, and the
startup of the Hamaca upgrader in Venezuela in the fourth quarter of 2004.  These items were more than offset by the
impact of asset dispositions, normal field production declines, and planned
maintenance.  In addition, our Syncrude
mining operations produced 21,000 barrels per day in 2004, compared with
19,000 barrels per day in 2003.

Midstream

The Midstream segment purchases raw natural
gas from producers and gathers natural gas through an extensive network of
pipeline gathering systems.  The natural
gas is then processed to extract natural gas


liquids from the raw gas stream.  The remaining “residue” gas is marketed to
electrical utilities, industrial users, and gas marketing companies.  Most of the natural gas liquids are
fractionated—separated into individual components like ethane, butane and
propane—and marketed as chemical feedstock, fuel, or blendstock.  The Midstream segment consists of our equity
investment in Duke Energy Field Services, LLC (DEFS), as well as our other
natural gas gathering and processing operations, and natural gas liquids
fractionation and marketing businesses, primarily in the United States and
Trinidad.

In July 2005, ConocoPhillips
and Duke Energy Corporation (Duke) restructured their respective ownership
levels in DEFS, which resulted in DEFS becoming a jointly controlled venture,
owned 50 percent by each company.  Prior
to the restructuring, our ownership interest in DEFS was 30.3 percent.  This restructuring increased our ownership in
DEFS through a series of direct and indirect transfers of certain Canadian
Midstream assets from DEFS to Duke, a disproportionate cash distribution from
DEFS to Duke from the sale of DEFS’ interest in TEPPCO, and a combined payment
by ConocoPhillips to Duke and DEFS of approximately $840 million.  The Empress plant in Canada was not included
in the initial transaction as originally anticipated due to weather-related
damage.  Subsequently, we sold the
Empress plant to Duke in August 2005 for approximately $230 million.

2005 vs. 2004

Net income from the Midstream segment
increased 193 percent in 2005. 
Included in the Midstream segment’s 2005 net income is our share of a
gain from DEFS’ sale of its general partnership interest in TEPPCO.  Our share of this gain, reflected in equity
in earnings of affiliates, was $306 million, after-tax.  In addition to this gain, our Midstream
segment benefited from improved natural gas liquids prices in 2005, which increased
earnings at DEFS, as well as our other Midstream operations.  These positive items were partially offset by
the loss of earnings from asset dispositions completed in 2004 and 2005.

Included in the Midstream
segment’s net income was a benefit of $17 million in 2005, compared with
$36 million in 2004, representing the amortization of the excess amount of
our equity interest in the net assets of DEFS over the book value of our
investment in DEFS.  The reduced amount
in 2005 resulted from a significant reduction in the favorable basis difference
of our investment in DEFS following the restructuring.

2004 vs. 2003

Net income from the Midstream
segment increased 81 percent in 2004, compared with 2003.  The improvement was primarily attributable to
improved results from DEFS, which had:

•

Higher gross
margins, primarily reflecting higher natural gas liquids prices.

•

A $23 million
(gross) charge in 2003 for the cumulative effect of accounting changes, mainly
related to the adoption of SFAS No. 143; partially offset by investment
impairments and write-downs of assets held for sale during 2004.

Our Midstream operations
outside of DEFS had higher earnings in 2004 as well, reflecting the impact of
higher natural gas liquids prices that more than offset the effect of asset
dispositions in 2004.

Included in the Midstream
segment’s net income was a benefit of $36 million in 2004, the same as
2003, representing the amortization of the excess amount of our
30.3 percent equity interest in the net assets of DEFS over the book value
of our investment in DEFS.


R&M


The R&M segment’s
operations encompass refining crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum
products (such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels); buying, selling
and transporting crude oil; and buying, transporting, distributing and
marketing petroleum products.  R&M
has operations in the United States, Europe and Asia Pacific.

vs. 2004

Net
income from the R&M segment increased 52 percent in 2005, primarily
due to higher worldwide refining margins. 
See the “Business Environment and Executive Overview” section for our
view of the factors that supported the improved refining margins during
2005.  Higher refining margins were
partially offset by:

•

Higher
utility costs, mainly due to higher prices for natural gas.

•

Increased
turnaround costs.

•

Lower
production volumes and increased maintenance costs at our Gulf Coast refineries
resulting from hurricanes Katrina and Rita.

•

An
$83 million charge for the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47.

If refining margins
decline in 2006 from the historically strong levels experienced in 2005, we
would expect a corresponding decrease in R&M’s earnings.

vs. 2003

Net income from the R&M segment increased 116 percent in 2004,
compared with 2003, primarily due to higher refining margins.  This was partially offset by lower U.S.
marketing margins, and higher maintenance turnaround and utility costs.  The 2003 period included a $125 million net
charge for the cumulative effect of an accounting change (FIN 46(R)).

U.S. R&M

vs. 2004

Net income from our U.S. R&M operations
increased 57 percent in 2005.  The
increase mainly was the result of higher U.S. refining margins, partially
offset by:

•

Higher utility costs, mainly due to higher
prices for natural gas.

•

Increased turnaround costs.

•

Lower production volumes and increased
maintenance costs at our Gulf Coast refineries resulting from hurricanes
Katrina and Rita.

•

A $78 million charge for the cumulative
effect of adopting FIN 47.

Our U.S. refining capacity utilization rate
was 92 percent in 2005, compared with 95 percent in 2004.  The 2005 rate was impacted by downtime
related to hurricanes.  Specifically, the
Sweeny, Texas, and Lake Charles, Louisiana, refineries were shutdown in advance
of Hurricane Rita.  The Sweeny refinery
returned to full operation by October. 
The Lake Charles refinery resumed operations in mid-October, and
returned to full operation in November. 
The Alliance refinery in Belle Chase, Louisiana, was shutdown in advance


of Hurricane Katrina, and suffered flooding
and damage from that storm.  The refinery
began partial operation in late-January 2006, and is expected to return to full
operation around the end of the first quarter of 2006.

Effective
January 1, 2005, the crude oil capacity at our Sweeny, Texas, refinery was
increased by 13,000 barrels per day, as a result of incremental
debottlenecking.  Effective April 1,
2005, we increased the crude oil processing capacity at our San Francisco,
California, refinery by 9,000 barrels per day as a result of a project
implementation related to clean fuels.

vs. 2003

Net income from our U.S. R&M operations increased 115 percent
in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily due to higher refining margins,
partially offset by lower marketing margins, and higher maintenance turnaround
and utility costs.  The 2003 period
included a $125 million net charge for the cumulative effect of an accounting
change (FIN 46(R)).

Our U.S. refining capacity utilization rate was 95 percent in
2004, compared with 96 percent in 2003. 
The lower capacity utilization was due to increased maintenance
downtime.

International R&M

2005 vs. 2004

Net income from our international R&M operations increased
37 percent in 2005, primarily due to higher refining margins, along with
improved refinery production volumes and increased results from marketing.  These factors were partially offset by
negative foreign currency exchange impacts and higher utility costs.

Our international crude oil capacity utilization rate was 99 percent in
2005, compared with 91 percent in 2004. 
A larger volume of turnaround activity in 2004 contributed to most of
this variance.

In November 2005, we executed a definitive agreement for the cash
purchase of the Wilhelmshaven refinery in Wilhelmshaven, Germany.  The purchase would include the
275,000-barrel-per-day refinery, a marine terminal, rail and truck loading
facilities and a tank farm, as well as another entity that provides commercial
and administrative support to the refinery. 
The purchase is expected to be completed during the first quarter of
2006, subject to satisfaction of closing conditions, including obtaining the
necessary governmental approvals and regulatory permits.  The addition of the Wilhelmshaven refinery
would increase our overall European refining capacity by approximately 74
percent, from 372,000 barrels per day to 647,000 barrels per day.

2004 vs. 2003

Net income from the international R&M operations increased
119 percent in 2004, compared with 2003, with the improvement primarily
attributable to higher refining margins, partially offset by negative foreign
currency impacts on operating costs.


LUKOIL Investment

This segment represents our investment in the
ordinary shares of LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company
headquartered in Russia, which we account for under the equity method.  In October 2004, we purchased 7.6 percent of
LUKOIL’s ordinary shares held by the Russian government, and during the
remainder of 2004, we increased our ownership interest to 10.0 percent.  During 2005, we expended $2,160 million
to further increase our ownership interest to 16.1 percent.  Purchase of LUKOIL shares continued into the
first quarter of 2006.  The 2005 results
for the LUKOIL Investment segment reflect favorable market conditions,
including strong crude oil prices.

In addition to our estimate of our equity
share of LUKOIL’s earnings, this segment reflects the amortization of the basis
difference between our equity interest in the net assets of LUKOIL and the
historical cost of our investment in LUKOIL, and also includes the costs
associated with the employees seconded to LUKOIL.

Because LUKOIL’s accounting cycle close and
preparation of U.S. GAAP financial statements occurs subsequent to our
accounting cycle close, our equity earnings and statistics for our LUKOIL
investment include an estimate for the latest quarter presented in a
period.  This estimate is based on market
indicators, historical production trends of LUKOIL, and other factors.  Differences between the estimate and actual
results are recorded in a subsequent period. 
This process may create volatility in quarterly trend analysis for this
segment, but this volatility will be mitigated when viewing this segment’s
results over an annual or longer time frame.

Chemicals

The Chemicals segment
consists of our 50 percent interest in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC
(CPChem), which we account for under the equity method.  CPChem uses natural gas liquids and other
feedstocks to produce petrochemicals such as ethylene, propylene, styrene,
benzene, and paraxylene.  These products
are then marketed and sold, or used as feedstocks to produce plastics and
commodity chemicals, such as polyethylene, polystyrene and cyclohexane.


2005 vs. 2004

Net income from the Chemicals segment
increased 30 percent in 2005.  The
increase primarily was attributable to higher margins in the ethylene and
polyethylene lines of business.  Ethylene
margins improved for the second consecutive year and, coupled with the increase
in polyethylene margins, indicates that these business lines have improved from
a deep cyclical downturn that began in the 1999/2000 time frame.  Partially offsetting these margin
improvements were higher utility costs, reflecting increased costs of natural
gas, as well as hurricane-related impacts on production and maintenance and
repair costs.

2004 vs. 2003

Net income from
the Chemicals segment increased $242 million in 2004, compared with
2003.  The increase reflects that CPChem
had improved equity earnings from Qatar Chemical Company Ltd. (Q-Chem), an
olefins and polyolefins complex in Qatar, and Saudi Chevron Phillips Company,
an aromatics complex in Saudi Arabia. 
Results from CPChem’s consolidated operations also improved due to
higher ethylene and benzene margins, as well as increased ethylene, polyethylene
and normal alpha olefins sales volumes.

Emerging
Businesses

The Emerging Businesses segment includes the development of new
businesses outside our traditional operations. 
These activities include gas-to-liquids (GTL) operations, power
generation, technology solutions such as sulfur removal technologies, and
emerging technologies, such as renewable fuels and emission management
technologies.

2005 vs. 2004

The Emerging Businesses segment incurred a
net loss of $21 million in 2005, compared with a net loss of $102 million
in 2004.  The improved results in 2005
reflect:

•

The
first full year of operations at the Immingham power plant in the United
Kingdom.  The plant commenced commercial
operations in the fourth quarter of 2004.

•

Lower
costs in the gas-to-liquids business, reflecting the shut down in June 2005 of
a demonstration plant in Ponca City, Oklahoma.

•

Improved
margins in the domestic power generation business.


2004 vs. 2003

Emerging Businesses incurred a net loss of $102 million in 2004,
compared with a net loss of $99 million in 2003.  Contributing to the higher losses in 2004
were lower domestic power margins and higher maintenance costs, as well as increased
costs associated with the Immingham power plant project in the United Kingdom,
which entered the initial commissioning phase during 2004.  Prior to the initial commissioning phase,
most costs associated with this project were construction activities and thus
capitalized. This project completed the initial commissioning phase and began
commercial operations in October 2004. Partially offsetting these items were
lower research and development costs, compared with 2003, which included the
costs of a demonstration GTL plant then under construction.  Construction of the GTL plant was
substantially completed during the second quarter of 2003.

Corporate
and Other

2005 vs. 2004

After-tax net interest consists of interest and financing expense, net
of interest income and capitalized interest, as well as premiums incurred on
the early retirement of debt.  Net
interest decreased 18 percent in 2005, primarily due to lower average debt
levels and increased interest income. 
Interest income increased as a result of our higher average cash
balances during 2005.  These items were
partially offset by increased early debt retirement fees and a lower amount of
interest being capitalized in 2005, reflecting the completion of several major
projects in the second half of 2004.

After-tax corporate general and administrative expenses decreased
14 percent in 2005.  The decrease
reflects increased allocations of management-level stock-based compensation to
the operating segments, which had previously been retained at corporate.  These increased corporate allocations did not
have a material impact on the operating segments’ results.  This was partially offset by increased
charitable contributions, reflecting disaster relief following the southeast
Asia tsunami and Gulf of Mexico hurricanes.

Discontinued operations net income declined in 2005, reflecting asset
dispositions completed during 2004 and 2005.

The category “Other” consists primarily of items not directly
associated with the operating segments on a stand-alone basis, including
certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and environmental costs
associated with sites no longer in operation. 
Results from Other were lower in 2005, mainly due to unfavorable foreign
currency transaction impacts.


2004 vs. 2003

Net interest decreased 19 percent in 2004, primarily due to lower
average debt levels, an increased amount of interest being capitalized in 2004,
lower charges for premiums paid on the early retirement of debt, and lower
costs associated with the receivables monetization program.

After-tax corporate general and administrative expenses increased
23 percent in 2004.  The increase
reflects higher compensation costs, which includes increased stock-based
compensation due to an increase in both the number of units issued and higher
stock prices in the 2004 period.

Discontinued operations net income declined 91 percent in 2004,
reflecting asset dispositions completed during 2003 and 2004.

Results from Other were lower in 2004, mainly due to the inclusion in
the 2003 period of gains related to insurance demutualization benefits,
negative foreign currency transaction impacts, higher environmental costs and
increased minority interest expense.


CAPITAL
RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

Financial
Indicators

To meet our short- and long-term liquidity
requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources, primarily cash generated
from operating activities.  In addition,
during 2005 we raised $768 million in funds from the sale of assets.  During 2005, available cash was used to
support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments program, repay debt,
pay dividends and purchase shares of our common stock.  Total dividends paid on our common stock in
2005 were $1.6 billion.  During
2005, cash and cash equivalents increased $827 million to
$2.2 billion.

In addition to cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from
asset sales, we also rely on our commercial paper and credit facility programs,
as well as our $5 billion universal shelf registration statement, to support
our short- and long-term liquidity requirements.  We anticipate that these sources of liquidity
will be adequate to meet our funding requirements through 2007, including our
capital spending program and required debt payments.  We anticipate that the cash portion of the
pending acquisition of Burlington Resources Inc., approximately $17.5 billion,
will be financed with a combination of short- and long-term debt and available
cash.  For additional information about
the acquisition, see Note 28—Pending Acquisition of Burlington Resources Inc.,
in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our cash flows from operating activities increased in
each of the annual periods from 2003 through 2005.  Favorable market conditions played a
significant role in the upward trend of our cash flows from operating
activities.  Excluding the Burlington
Resources acquisition and absent any unusual event during 2006, we expect that
market conditions will again be the most important factor affecting our 2006
operating cash flows, when compared with 2005.

Significant Sources of Capital

Operating
Activities

During
2005, cash of $17,628 million was provided by operating activities,
compared with cash from operations of $11,959 million in 2004.  This 47 percent increase was primarily
due to higher income from continuing operations and a positive impact from
working capital changes, partly offset by a greater amount of undistributed
equity earnings.


•

Income
from continuing operations increased $5,533 million, compared with 2004,
primarily as a result of higher crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquid
prices, as well as improved worldwide refining margins.

•

Working
capital changes increased cash flow by $847 million when comparing 2005
and 2004.  Contributing to the increase
in cash flow from working capital changes were higher increases in accounts
payable in 2005, resulting from higher commodity prices and increased capital
spending.

•

Undistributed
equity earnings increased $997 million in 2005 over 2004, as a result of
higher equity in earnings of affiliates that have not been distributed to
owners.

During 2004, cash flow from operations
increased $2,603 million to $11,959 million. 
Contributing to the improvement, compared with 2003, was an increase in
income from continuing operations primarily resulting from higher crude oil,
natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, as well as improved worldwide
refining margins.  This benefit was
partly offset by a higher

retained interest in receivables sold to a
Qualifying Special Purpose Entity (QSPE). 
For additional information on receivables sold to a QSPE, see
Receivables Monetization in the Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements section.

Our cash flows from operating activities for
both the short- and long-term are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil,
natural gas and natural gas liquids, as well as refining and marketing
margins.  During 2004 and 2005, we
benefited from historically high crude oil and natural gas prices, as well as
strong refining margins.  The sustainability
of these prices and margins is driven by market conditions over which we have
no control.  In addition, the level of
our production volumes of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids also
impacts our cash flows.  These production
levels are impacted by such factors as acquisitions and dispositions of fields,
field production decline rates, new technologies, operating efficiency, the
addition of proved reserves through exploratory success, and the timely and
cost-effective development of those proved reserves.

We will need to continue to add to our proved
reserve base through exploration and development of new fields, or by
acquisition, and to apply new technologies and processes to boost recovery from
existing fields in order to maintain or increase production and proved
reserves.  We have been successful in the
past in maintaining or adding to our production and proved reserve base and,
although it cannot be assured, anticipate being able to do so in the
future.  Including the impact of our
equity investments and after adjusting our 2003 production for assets sold in
2003 and early 2004, our BOE production has increased in each of the past three
years.  Going forward, based on our 2005
production level of 1.79 million BOE per day, we expect our annual
production growth to average in the range of 2 percent to 4 percent over
the five-year period ending in 2010. 
These projections are tied to projects currently scheduled to begin
production or ramp-up in those years, exclude our Canadian Syncrude mining
operations, and do not include any impact from our pending acquisition of
Burlington Resources Inc.

Including the impact of our
equity investments, our reserve replacement over the three-year period ending
December 31, 2005, exceeded 100 percent.  Contributing to our success during this
three-year period were proved reserves added through our investment in LUKOIL,
other purchases of reserves in place, and extensions and discoveries.  Although it cannot be assured, going forward,
we expect to more than replace our production over the next three-year period,
2006 through 2008.  This expectation is
based on our current slate of exploratory and improved recovery projects.  It does not include any impact from our
pending acquisition of Burlington Resources Inc.

As discussed in
Critical Accounting Policies, engineering estimates of proved reserves are
imprecise, and therefore, each year reserves may be revised upward or downward
due to the impact of changes in oil and gas prices or as more technical data
becomes available on the reservoirs.  In
2005 and 2003, revisions increased our reserves, while in 2004, revisions


decreased reserves.  It is not possible to reliably predict how
revisions will impact reserve quantities in the future.

The net addition of proved
undeveloped reserves accounted for 44 percent, 38 percent and
76 percent of our total net additions in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.  During these years, we
converted, on average, 16 percent per year of our proved undeveloped
reserves to proved developed reserves. 
Of the proved undeveloped reserves we had at December 31, 2005, we
estimated that the average annual conversion rate for these reserves for the
following three years will be approximately 15 percent.  For additional information related to the
development of proved undeveloped reserves, see the discussion under the
E&P section of Capital Spending.  The
anticipated production and reserve replacement results are subject to risks,
including reservoir performance; operational downtime; finding and development
execution; obtaining management, Board and third-party approval of development
projects in a timely manner; regulatory changes; geographical location; market
prices; and environmental issues; and therefore, cannot be assured.

Asset
Sales

Proceeds from asset sales in 2005 were
$768 million.  Following the merger
of Conoco and Phillips in August 2002, we initiated an asset disposition
program.  Our ultimate target was to
raise approximately $4.5 billion by the end of 2004.  During 2004, proceeds from asset sales were
$1.6 billion, bringing total proceeds at the end of 2004 to approximately
$5.0 billion since the program began. 
Proceeds from these asset sales were used primarily to pay off debt.

Commercial Paper and Credit
Facilities

During 2005, we replaced our $2.5 billion four-year revolving credit
facility that would have expired in October 2008 and our $2.5 billion five-year
facility that would have expired in October 2009 with two new revolving credit
facilities totaling $5 billion.  Both new
facilities expire in October 2010.  The
new facilities are available for use as direct bank borrowings or as support
for the ConocoPhillips $5 billion commercial paper program, the ConocoPhillips
Qatar Funding Ltd. commercial paper program, and could be used to support issuances
of letters of credit totaling up to $750 million.  The facilities are broadly syndicated among
financial institutions and do not contain any material adverse change
provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios
or ratings.  The credit agreements do
contain a cross-default provision relating to our, or any of our consolidated
subsidiaries’, failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations
of $200 million or more.  There were no
outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2005.

While the stability of our cash flows from operating activities
benefits from geographic diversity and the effects of upstream and downstream
integration, our operating cash flows remain exposed to the volatility of
commodity crude oil and natural gas prices and refining and marketing margins,
as well as periodic cash needs to finance tax payments and crude oil, natural
gas and petroleum product purchases.  Our
primary funding source for short-term working capital needs is the
ConocoPhillips $5 billion commercial paper program, a portion of which may
be denominated in other currencies (limited to euro 3 billion equivalent).
Commercial paper maturities are generally limited to 90 days.  At December 31, 2005, we had no
commercial paper outstanding under this program, compared with
$544 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2004.  In December 2005, ConocoPhillips Qatar
Funding Ltd. initiated a $1.5 billion commercial paper program to be used
to fund commitments relating to the Qatargas 3 project.  At December 31, 2005, commercial paper
outstanding under this program was $32 million.

Since we had $32 million of commercial
paper outstanding and had issued $62 million of letters of credit, we had
access to $4.9 billion in borrowing capacity under the two revolving
credit facilities as of December 31, 2005. 
In addition, our $2.2 billion cash balance also supported our
liquidity position.


At December 31, 2005, Moody’s Investor
Service had a rating of A1 on our senior long-term debt; and Standard and Poors’
Rating Service and Fitch had ratings of A-. 
We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that
would cause an automatic event of default in the event of a downgrade of our
credit rating and thereby impact our access to liquidity.  In the event that our credit rating
deteriorated to a level that would prohibit us from accessing the commercial paper
market, we would still be able to access funds under our $5 billion
revolving credit facilities.

Shelf Registration

We have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, under which we have available to issue and
sell a total of $5 billion of various types of debt and equity securities.

Minority Interests

At December 31, 2005,
we had outstanding $1,209 million of equity in less than wholly owned
consolidated subsidiaries held by minority interest owners, including a
minority interest of $507 million in Ashford Energy Capital S.A.

The remaining minority interest
amounts are primarily related to controlled-operating joint ventures with
minority interest owners.  The largest of
these, $682 million, was related to the Bayu-Undan liquefied natural gas
project in the Timor Sea and northern Australia.

In December 2001, in order to raise funds for general corporate
purposes, Conoco and Cold Spring Finance S.a.r.l. (Cold Spring) formed Ashford
Energy Capital S.A. through the contribution of a $1 billion Conoco subsidiary
promissory note and $500 million cash by Cold Spring.  Through its initial $500 million
investment, Cold Spring is entitled to a cumulative annual preferred return
based on three-month LIBOR rates, plus 1.32 percent.  The preferred return at December 31, 2005,
was 5.37 percent.  In 2008, and at
each 10-year anniversary thereafter, Cold Spring may elect to remarket their
investment in Ashford, and if unsuccessful, could require ConocoPhillips to
provide a letter of credit in support of Cold Spring’s investment, or in the
event that such letter of credit is not provided, then cause the redemption of
their investment in Ashford.  Should
ConocoPhillips’ credit rating fall below investment grade on a redemption date,
Ashford would require a letter of credit to support $475 million of the
term loans, as of December 31, 2005, made by Ashford to other ConocoPhillips
subsidiaries.  If the letter of credit is
not obtained within 60 days, Cold Spring could cause Ashford to sell the
ConocoPhillips subsidiary notes.  At
December 31, 2005, Ashford held $1.8 billion of ConocoPhillips subsidiary
notes and $28 million in investments unrelated to ConocoPhillips.  We report Cold Spring’s investment as a
minority interest because it is not mandatorily redeemable and the entity does
not have a specified liquidation date. 
Other than the obligation to make payment on the subsidiary notes
described above, Cold Spring does not have recourse to our general credit.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Receivables
Monetization

At December 31, 2004, certain credit card and trade
receivables had been sold to a Qualifying Special Purpose Entity (QSPE) in a
revolving-period securitization arrangement. 
The arrangement provided for ConocoPhillips to sell, and the QSPE to purchase,
certain receivables and for the QSPE to then issue beneficial interests of up
to $1.2 billion to five bank-sponsored entities.  At December 31, 2004, the QSPE had
issued beneficial interests to the bank-sponsored entities of
$480 million.  All five
bank-sponsored entities are multi-seller conduits with access to the commercial
paper market and purchase interests in similar receivables from numerous other
companies unrelated to us.  We have held
no ownership interests, nor any variable interests, in any of the
bank-sponsored entities, which we have not consolidated.  Furthermore, except as discussed below, we
have not consolidated the QSPE because it has met the


requirements of SFAS No. 140, “Accounting for
Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities,”
to be excluded from the consolidated financial statements of
ConocoPhillips.  The receivables
transferred to the QSPE have met the isolation and other requirements of SFAS
No. 140 to be accounted for as sales and have been accounted for
accordingly.

By January 31, 2005, all of the beneficial interests held by the
bank-sponsored entities had matured; therefore, in accordance with SFAS No.
140, the operating results and cash flows of the QSPE subsequent to this
maturity have been consolidated in our financial statements.  The revolving-period securitization
arrangement was terminated on August 31, 2005, and at this time, we have no
plans to renew the arrangement.  See Note
13—Sales of Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for
additional information.

Preferred Securities

In 1997, we formed a statutory business trust, Phillips 66 Capital II
(Trust II), with ConocoPhillips owning all of the common securities of the
trust.  The sole purpose of the trust was
to issue preferred securities to outside investors, investing the proceeds
thereof in an equivalent amount of subordinated debt securities of ConocoPhillips.  The trust was established to raise funds for
general corporate purposes.

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, Trust II had $350 million of mandatorily
redeemable preferred securities outstanding, whose sole asset was $361 million
of ConocoPhillips’ subordinated debt securities, which bear interest at
8 percent.  Distributions on the
trust preferred securities are paid by the trust with funds from interest
payments made by ConocoPhillips on the subordinated debt securities.  We made interest payments of $29 million
in both 2005 and 2004.  In addition, we
guaranteed the payment obligations of the trust on the trust preferred
securities to the extent we made interest payments on the subordinated debt
securities.  When we redeem the
subordinated debt securities, Trust II is required to apply all redemption
proceeds to the immediate redemption of the preferred securities.  See Note 3—Changes in Accounting Principles
and Note 17—Preferred Stock and Other Minority Interests, in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.

Affiliated
Companies

As part of our
normal ongoing business operations and consistent with normal industry
practice, we invest in, and enter into, numerous agreements with other parties
to pursue business opportunities, which share costs and apportion risks among
the parties as governed by the agreements. 
At December 31, 2005, we were liable for certain contingent obligations
under various contractual arrangements as described below.

•

Hamaca

:

The Hamaca project involves
the development of heavy-oil reserves from the Orinoco Oil Belt in
Venezuela.  We own a 40 percent
interest in the Hamaca project, which is operated by Petrolera Ameriven on
behalf of the owners.  The other participants
in Hamaca are Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) and Chevron Corporation.  Our interest is held through a jointly owned
limited liability company, Hamaca Holding LLC, for which we use the equity
method of accounting.  Our equity in
earnings from Hamaca Holding LLC in 2005 was $473 million.  We have a 57.1 percent non-controlling
ownership interest in Hamaca Holding LLC. 
In 2001, we along with our co-venturers in the Hamaca project secured
approximately $1.1 billion in a joint debt financing.  The Export-Import Bank of the United States
provided a guarantee supporting a 17-year term $628 million bank facility.  The joint venture also arranged a
$470 million 14-year term commercial bank facility for the project.  Total debt of $856 million was
outstanding under these credit facilities at December 31, 2005.  Of this amount, $342 million was recourse to
ConocoPhillips.  The proceeds of these
joint financings were used to primarily fund a heavy-oil upgrader.  The remaining necessary funding was provided
by capital contributions from the co-venturers on a pro rata basis to the extent
necessary to successfully complete construction.


Although
the original guaranteed project completion date of October 1, 2005, was
extended because of force majeure events that occurred during the construction
period, completion certification was achieved on January 9, 2006, and the
project financings became non-recourse with respect to the co-venturers.  The lenders under the joint financing
facilities may now look only to the Hamaca project’s cash flows for payment.

•

Qatargas 3

:

Qatargas 3 is an integrated project to
produce and liquefy natural gas from Qatar’s North field.  We own a 30 percent interest in the
project.  The other participants in the
project are affiliates of Qatar Petroleum (68.5 percent) and Mitsui &
Co., Ltd. (Mitsui) (1.5 percent). 
Our interest is held through a jointly owned company, Qatar Liquefied
Gas Company Limited (3), for which we use the equity method of accounting.  Qatargas 3 secured project financing of
$4 billion in December 2005, consisting of $1.3 billion of loans from
export credit agencies (ECA), $1.5 billion from commercial banks, and $1.2
billion from ConocoPhillips.  The
ConocoPhillips loan facilities have substantially the same terms as the ECA and
commercial bank facilities.  Prior to
project completion certification, all loans, including the ConocoPhillips loan
facilities, are guaranteed by the participants, based on their respective
ownership interests.  Accordingly, our
maximum exposure to this financing structure is $1.2 billion.  Upon completion certification, which is
expected to be December 31, 2009, all project loan facilities, including
the ConocoPhillips loan facilities, will become non-recourse to the project
participants.

At December 31, 2005, Qatargas 3 had $120 million
outstanding under all the loan facilities, $36 million of which was loaned
by ConocoPhillips.

•

Other

:

At December 31, 2005, we
had guarantees outstanding for our portion of joint-venture debt obligations,
which have terms of up to 20 years.  The
maximum potential amount of future payments under the guarantees was
approximately $190 million.  Payment
would be required if a joint venture defaults on its debt obligations.  Included in these outstanding guarantees was
$96 million associated with the Polar Lights Company joint venture in
Russia.

For additional information about guarantees, see Note 14—Guarantees, in
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Capital Requirements

For information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the
“Capital Spending” section.

Our balance sheet debt at December 31, 2005, was
$12.5 billion.  This reflects debt
reductions of approximately $2.5 billion during 2005.  The decline in debt primarily resulted from a
reduction of $512 million in our commercial paper balance; the redemption
in November of our $750 million 6.35% Notes due 2009, at a premium of
$42 million plus accrued interest; the redemption in late March of our
$400 million 3.625% Notes due 2007, at par plus accrued interest; and the
purchase, at market prices, and retirement of $752 million of various
ConocoPhillips bond issues.  In
conjunction with the redemption of the 6.35% Notes and the 3.625% Notes, $750
million and $400 million, respectively, of interest rate swaps were
cancelled.  The note redemptions,
interest rate swap cancellations, and bond issue purchases resulted in
after-tax losses of $92 million.


On February 4, August 11, and November 15, 2005, we announced separate
stock repurchase programs, each of which provides for the purchase of up to $1
billion of the company’s common stock over a period of up to two years.  Acquisitions for the share repurchase
programs are made at management’s discretion at prevailing prices, subject to
market conditions and other factors. 
Purchases may be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time
without prior notice.  Shares of stock
purchased under the programs are held as treasury shares.  During 2005, we purchased 32.1 million shares
of our common stock, at a cost of $1.9 billion under the programs.

We
entered into a credit agreement with Qatargas 3, whereby we will provide loan
financing of approximately $1.2 billion for the construction of the
facilities.  This financing will
represent 30 percent of the project’s total debt financing.  Through December 31, 2005, we had
provided $36 million in loan financing. See the “Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements” section for additional information on Qatargas 3.

In July 2004, we announced the finalization of our transaction with
Freeport LNG Development, L.P. (Freeport LNG) to participate in a proposed LNG
receiving terminal in Quintana, Texas. 
Construction began in early 2005. 
We do not have an ownership interest in the facility, but we do have a
50 percent interest in the general partnership managing the venture, along
with contractual rights to regasification capacity of the terminal.  We entered into a credit agreement with
Freeport LNG, whereby we will provide loan financing of approximately
$630 million for the construction of the facility.  Through December 31, 2005, we had provided
$212 million in loan financing, including accrued interest.

In the fall of 2004, ConocoPhillips and LUKOIL agreed to the expansion
of the Varandey terminal as part of our investment in the OOO Naryanmarneftegaz
(NMNG) joint venture.  Production from
the NMNG joint-venture fields is transported via pipeline to LUKOIL’s existing
terminal at Varandey Bay on the Barents Sea and then shipped via tanker to international
markets.  LUKOIL intends to complete an
expansion of the terminal oil-throughput capacity from 30,000 barrels per day
to up to 240,000 barrels per day in late 2007, with ConocoPhillips
participating in the design and financing of the terminal expansion.  We have an obligation to provide loan
financing to Varandey Terminal Company for 30 percent of the costs of the
terminal expansion, but we will have no governance or ownership interest in the
terminal.  Based on preliminary budget
estimates from the operator, we expect our total loan obligation for the
terminal expansion to be approximately $330 million.  This amount will be adjusted as the design is
finalized and the expansion project proceeds. 
Through December 31, 2005, we had provided $61 million in loan
financing.

We account for our loans to Qatargas 3, Freeport LNG and Varandey
Terminal Company as financial assets in the “Investments and long-term
receivables” line on the balance sheet.

In February 2006,
we announced a quarterly dividend of 36 cents per share, representing a
16 percent increase over the previous quarter’s dividend of 31 cents
per share.  The dividend is payable
March 1, 2006, to stockholders of record at the close of business
February 21, 2006.


Contractual
Obligations

The following
table summarizes our aggregate contractual fixed and variable obligations as of
December 31, 2005:


Capital
Spending

Capital
Expenditures and Investments

Our capital spending for continuing operations for the
three-year period ending December 31, 2005, totaled $27.3 billion,
including a combined $4.8 billion in 2004 through 2005 relating to our
purchase of a 16.1 percent interest in LUKOIL.  During the three-year period, spending was
primarily focused on the growth of our E&P segment, with 60 percent of
total spending for continuing operations in this segment.

Excluding discretionary expenditures for potential
additional investment in LUKOIL, our capital budget for 2006 is
$11.2 billion.  Included in this
amount are $447 million in capitalized interest and $44 million that
is expected to be funded by minority interests in the Bayu-Undan gas export
project.  We plan to direct approximately
67 percent of our 2006 capital budget to E&P and 31 percent to
R&M.

E&P

Capital spending for continuing operations for E&P
during the three-year period ending December 31, 2005, totaled
$16.4 billion.  The expenditures
over the three-year period supported several key exploration and development
projects including:

•

The
West Sak and Alpine projects and drilling of National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska
(NPR-A) and satellite field prospects on Alaska’s North Slope.

•

Magnolia
development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.


•

The
acquisition of limited-term, fixed-volume overriding royalty interests in Utah
and the San Juan Basin related to our natural gas production.

Development
projects in Block 15-1 and Block 15-2 in Vietnam.

Capital expenditures for construction of our Endeavour
Class tankers, as well as for an upgrade to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System
pump stations and purchase of an additional interest in the pipeline, were also
included in the E&P segment.

UNITED STATES

Alaska

During the three-year period ending December 31, 2005,
we made capital expenditures for the construction of double-hulled Endeavour
Class tankers for use in transporting Alaskan crude oil to the U.S. West Coast
and Hawaii.  We expect the fifth and
final Endeavour Class tanker to be in Alaska North Slope service in 2006,
although contractual and hurricane-related issues may further delay delivery of
this vessel.

We continued
development drilling in the Greater Kuparuk Area, the Greater Prudhoe Area, the
Alpine field, including Alpine’s first satellite fields—Nanuq and Fiord, and
the West Sak development.  In addition,
we completed both Phase I and Phase II of the Alpine Capacity Expansion
project.  We also participated in exploratory
drilling on the North Slope and acquired additional acreage during this
three-year period.

During 2004, we
and our co-venturers in the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System began a project to
upgrade the pipeline’s pump stations that is expected to be fully complete in
2006.

Lower 48 States

In the Lower 48, we continued to explore or develop our acreage
positions in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, South Texas, the San Juan Basin, the
Permian Basin, and the Texas Panhandle. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, we began production in late 2004 from the
Magnolia field, where development drilling continued in 2005.  We also began production from the K2 field in
Green Canyon Block 562 in May 2005.


Onshore capital was focused on natural gas developments in the San Juan
Basin of New Mexico and the Lobo Trend of South Texas, and the acquisition in
2005 of limited-term, fixed-volume overriding royalty interests in Utah and the
San Juan Basin related to our natural gas production.

CANADA

In Canada, we continued with development of the Syncrude Stage III
expansion-mining project in the Canadian province of Alberta, where an upgrader
expansion project is expected to be fully operational in mid-2006.

We also continued with development of the Surmont heavy-oil
project.  During 2005, funds were also
invested to acquire an additional 6.5 percent interest in Surmont, increasing
our interest to 50 percent.  Over the
life of this 30+ year project, we anticipate that approximately 500 production
and steam-injection well pairs will be drilled. 
In 2005, our capital expenditures associated with the development of the
Surmont project, excluding the acquisition of the additional interest, were
approximately $93 million.

In addition, capital expenditures were also focused on the development
of our conventional crude oil and natural gas reserves in western Canada.

SOUTH AMERICA

At our Hamaca project in Venezuela, construction of an upgrader to
convert heavy crude oil into a medium-grade crude oil became fully operational
in the fourth quarter of 2004.

In the Gulf of Paria, funds were invested to construct a floating
storage offtake facility and to construct and install a wellhead platform in
the Corocoro field.  The Corocoro
drilling program is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2006.

NORTHWEST EUROPE

In the U.K. and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea, funds were invested
during the three-year period ending December 31, 2005, for development of the
Ekofisk Area growth project, where production began in the fourth quarter of
2005; the U.K. Clair field, where production began in early 2005; the Saturn
project, where production began in the third quarter of 2005; the CMS3 area,
comprising five natural gas fields in the southern sector of the U.K. North
Sea, where the final field began production in 2004; the Britannia satellite
fields, Callanish and Brodgar, where production is expected in 2007; and the
Alvheim development project, where production is scheduled to begin in 2007.

AFRICA

In Nigeria, we made capital expenditures for the ongoing development of
onshore oil and natural gas fields, and for ongoing exploration activities both
onshore and on deepwater leases.  Funding
was also provided for our share of the basic phase of the Brass liquefied
natural gas (LNG) project for the front-end engineering and design and related
activities to move the project to a final investment decision.


RUSSIA AND CASPIAN SEA

Russia

In June 2005, we
invested funds of $512 million to acquire a 30 percent economic
interest and a 50 percent voting interest in NMNG, a joint venture with
LUKOIL to explore for and develop oil and gas resources in the northern part of
Russia’s Timan-Pechora province. The June acquisition price was based on
preliminary estimates of capital expenditures and working capital. The purchase
price is expected to be finalized in the first quarter of 2006.

Caspian Sea

Construction activities
began in 2004 to develop the Kashagan field on the Kazakhstan shelf in the
North Caspian Sea. Additional exploratory drilling through 2004 has resulted in
the discovery of a total of five fields in the area. In March 2005,
agreement was reached with the Republic of Kazakhstan government to conclude
the sale of BG International’s interest in the North Caspian Sea Production
Sharing Agreement to several of the remaining partners and for the subsequent
sale of one-half of the acquired interests to KazMunayGas. This agreement
increased our ownership interest from 8.33 percent to 9.26 percent.

ASIA PACIFIC

Timor Sea

In the Timor Sea, we
continued with development activities associated with Phase I of the Bayu-Undan
project, where condensate and natural gas liquids are separated and removed,
and the dry gas re-injected into the reservoir. Production of liquids began
from Phase I in February of 2004, and development drilling concluded at
the end of March 2005.

In June 2003, we
received approval from the Timor Sea Designated Authority for Phase II, the
development of an LNG plant near Darwin, Australia, as well as a gas pipeline
from Bayu-Undan to the LNG facility. Construction activities continued through
2005, and the first LNG cargo from the facility was loaded in February 2006.

Indonesia

In Indonesia, funds were
used for the completion of the Belanak field in the South Natuna Sea Block B,
including the construction of the Belanak floating production, storage and
offloading (FPSO) facility and associated gas plant facilities on the FPSO. Oil
production began from Belanak in late 2004 and first condensate production and
gas exports began in June and October 2005, respectively. Also, in
Block B we began development of the Kerisi and Hiu fields. In South Sumatra,
following the execution of the West Java gas sales agreement in August 2004,
we began the development of the Suban Phase II project, which is an expansion
of the existing Suban gas plant. Also in South Sumatra, we completed the
construction of the South Jambi shallow gas project in the South Jambi B Block,
where first production began in June 2004.

China

Following approval from
the Chinese government in early 2005, we began development of Phase II of the
Peng Lai 19-3 oil field, as well as concurrent development of the nearby 25-6
field. The development of Peng Lai 19-3 and Peng Lai 25-6 will include multiple
wellhead platforms and a larger FPSO facility.


Vietnam

In Vietnam’s Block 15-1,
funds were invested for the Su Tu Den Phase I southwest area development
project, where production began in the fourth quarter of 2003 and where water
injection facilities were put into service in 2004. Also in Block 15-1,
preliminary engineering for the nearby Su Tu Vang development began in early
2005, and approval for the development was obtained in late 2005.

On
Block 15-2, we upgraded facilities at our producing Rang Dong field in 2003 and
continued further development of the field, including the central part of
the field, where two additional platforms and additional production and
injection wells were completed in the third quarter of 2005.

2006 Capital Budget

E&P’s 2006 capital
budget is $7.5 billion, 12 percent higher than actual expenditures in
2005. Twenty-four percent of E&P’s 2006 capital budget is planned for the
United States, with 48 percent of that slated for Alaska.

We plan to spend
$861 million in 2006 for our Alaskan operations. A majority of the capital
spending will fund Prudhoe Bay, Greater Kuparuk and Western North Slope
operations—including two Alpine satellites and West Sak field developments,
construction to complete our fifth and final Endeavour Class tanker, and
exploration activities.

In the Lower 48, offshore
capital expenditures will be focused on continued development of the Ursa field
and the completion of the K2 and Magnolia developments in deepwater Gulf of
Mexico. Onshore capital will focus primarily on developing natural gas reserves
within core areas, including the San Juan Basin of New Mexico and the Lobo
Trend of South Texas.

E&P is directing $5.7 billion of its 2006 capital
budget to international projects, including payments for the acquisition of an
interest in our former oil and gas production operations in Libya. The agreement
for our return was signed and approved by the Libyan government in late-December 2005.
In addition, funds in 2006 also will be directed to developing major long-term
projects, including the Bayu-Undan gas development project in the Timor Sea;
the Kashagan project in the Caspian Sea and the NMNG joint venture in northern
Russia; the Britannia satellites, Ekofisk Area growth and Alvheim projects in
the North Sea; the Bohai Bay project in China; the Syncrude expansion, Surmont
heavy-oil and the Mackenzie Delta gas projects in Canada; the Belanak,
Kerisi-Hiu and Suban Phase II projects in Indonesia; the Corocoro project in
Venezuela; and the Qatargas 3 LNG project in Qatar.

In
late-December 2005, we announced that, in conjunction with our
co-venturers, we reached agreement with the Libyan National Oil Corporation on
the terms under which we would return to our former oil and natural gas
production operations in the Waha concessions in Libya. ConocoPhillips and
Marathon each hold a 16.33 percent interest, Amerada Hess holds an
8.16 percent interest, and the Libyan National Oil Corporation holds the
remaining 59.16 percent interest. The fiscal terms of the agreement are similar
to the terms in effect at the time of the suspension of the co-venturers’ activities
in 1986. The terms include a 25-year extension of the concessions to 2031-2034;
a payment to the Libyan National Oil Corporation of $1.3 billion ($520 million
net to ConocoPhillips) for the acquisition of an ownership interest in, and
extension of, the concessions; and a contribution to unamortized investments
made since 1986 of $530 million ($212 million net to ConocoPhillips) that
were agreed to be paid as part of the 1986 standstill agreement to hold
the assets in escrow for the U.S.-based co-venturers. Of the total amount to be
paid by ConocoPhillips, $520 million was paid in January 2006, and
the remaining $212 million is expected to be paid in December 2006.


PROVED UNDEVELOPED
RESERVES

Costs incurred for the years ended December 31, 2005,
2004, and 2003, relating to the development of proved undeveloped oil and gas
reserves were $3.4 billion, $2.4 billion, and $2.0 billion,
respectively. During these years, we converted, on average, 16 percent per
year of our proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves. Although
it cannot be assured, estimated future development costs relating to the
development of proved undeveloped reserves for the years 2006 through 2008 are
projected to be $2.9 billion, $2.2 billion, and $1.3 billion,
respectively. Of our 2,515 million BOE proved undeveloped reserves at
year-end 2005, we estimated that the average annual conversion rate for these
reserves for the three-year period ending 2008 will be approximately
15 percent.

Approximately 80 percent of our proved undeveloped
reserves at year-end 2005 were associated with nine major developments and our
investment in LUKOIL. Seven of the major developments are currently producing
and are expected to have proved reserves convert from undeveloped to developed
over time as development activities continue and/or production facilities are
expanded or upgraded, and include:

•

The Hamaca and Petrozuata heavy-oil
projects in Venezuela.

•

The Ekofisk, Eldfisk and Heidrun fields in
the North Sea and Norwegian Sea.

•

Natural gas and crude oil fields in
Indonesia.

The remaining two major
projects, Qatargas 3 in Qatar and the Kashagan field in Kazakhstan, will have
undeveloped proved reserves convert to developed as these projects begin
production.

Midstream

Capital spending for
continuing operations for Midstream during the three-year period ending December 31,
2005, was primarily related to increasing our ownership interest in DEFS in
2005 from 30.3 percent to 50 percent.

R&M

Capital spending for
continuing operations for R&M during the three-year period ending December 31,
2005, was primarily for clean fuels projects to meet new environmental
standards, refinery-upgrade projects to improve product yields, and the
operating integrity of key processing units, as well as for safety projects. During
this three-year period, R&M capital spending for continuing operations was
$4.3 billion, representing 16 percent of our total capital spending
for continuing operations.

Key projects during the
three-year period included:

•

Completion of a fluid catalytic cracking
(FCC) unit and an S Zorb

Ô

Sulfur Removal Technology (S-Zorb) unit at
the Ferndale refinery.

•

A low sulfur gasoline project at the Ponca
City refinery.

•

Phase I of a low sulfur gasoline project at
the Wood River refinery.

•

A new S-Zorb unit at the Lake Charles
refinery.

•

A new FCC gasoline hydrotreater at the
Alliance refinery.

•

An expansion of capacity in the Seaway
crude-oil pipeline.

•

Integration of a crude unit and coker adjacent to our Wood River
refinery.

•

A new hydrotreater at the Rodeo
facility of our San Francisco refinery.


The integration of the
crude unit and coker purchased adjacent to our Wood River refinery enables the
refinery to process additional heavier, lower-cost crude oil.

The
new diesel hydrotreater at the Rodeo facility of our San Francisco refinery
became operational at the end of March 2005. The new diesel hydrotreater
provides the capability to produce reformulated California highway diesel over
one year ahead of the June 2006 deadline.

Internationally, we
continued to invest in our ongoing refining and marketing operations to upgrade
and increase the profitability of our existing assets, including a replacement
reformer at our Humber refinery in the United Kingdom. In November 2005,
we announced the planned acquisition of the 275,000-barrel-per-day
Wilhelmshaven refinery in Germany. The purchase is expected to be finalized in
the first quarter of 2006.

2006 Capital Budget

R&M’s 2006 capital
budget is $3.5 billion, a 101 percent increase over actual spending in
2005. Domestic spending is expected to consume 52 percent of the R&M
budget.

We plan to direct about
$1.5 billion of the R&M capital budget to domestic refining, of which
approximately $400 million is earmarked for clean fuels projects already
in progress and about $700 million is for sustaining projects related to
reliability, safety and the environment. In addition, about $400 million
is intended for strategic and other investments to increase crude oil capacity,
expand conversion capability, improve energy efficiency and increase clean
product yield. Our U.S. marketing and transportation businesses are expected to
spend about $275 million.

Internationally, we plan
to spend approximately $1.7 billion on our R&M operations. Of this
amount, about $1.4 billion is intended for the acquisition of the
Wilhelmshaven refinery in Germany, including the initial expenditures for a
deep conversion project and other improvements at the refinery. The remaining
international R&M capital budget is for projects to strengthen our existing
assets within Europe and Asia.

Emerging
Businesses

Capital spending for
Emerging Businesses during the three-year period ending December 31, 2005,
was primarily for construction of the Immingham combined heat and power
cogeneration plant near the company’s Humber refinery in the United Kingdom.
The plant began commercial operations in October 2004.

Contingencies

Legal
and Tax Matters

We accrue for
contingencies when a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably
estimated. Based on currently available information, we believe that it is
remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will
exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact
on the company’s financial statements.


Environmental

We are subject to the
same numerous international, federal, state, and local environmental laws and
regulations, as are other companies in the petroleum exploration and production
industry; and refining, marketing and transportation of crude oil and refined
products businesses. The most significant of these environmental laws and
regulations include, among others, the:

•

Federal Clean Air Act, which governs
air emissions.

•

Federal Clean Water Act, which
governs discharges to water bodies.

•

Federal Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on
generators, transporters, and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where
hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatened to occur.

•

Federal Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage, and disposal of
solid waste.

•

Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990
(OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines,
lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and
owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that
result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the United States.

•

Federal Emergency Planning and
Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which requires facilities to report toxic chemical
inventories with local emergency planning committees and responses departments.

•

Federal Safe Drinking Water Act,
which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection wells.

•

U.S. Department of the Interior
regulations, which relate to offshore oil and gas operations in U.S. waters and
impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations,
as well as potential liability for pollution damages.

These laws and
their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of
discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also, in most cases,
require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits
can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with
the application process, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In
addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and
the agency’s processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with
the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant.

Many states and
foreign countries where we operate also have, or are developing, similar
environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While
similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more
stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or
transporting products across state and international borders.

The ultimate financial
impact arising from environmental laws and regulations is neither clearly known
nor easily determinable as new standards, such as air emission standards, water
quality standards and stricter fuel regulations, continue to evolve. However,
environmental laws and regulations, including those that may arise to
address concerns about global climate change, are expected to continue to have
an increasing impact on our operations in the United States and in other
countries in which we operate. Notable areas of potential impacts include air
emission compliance and remediation obligations in the United States.


For example, the EPA has
promulgated rules regarding the sulfur content in highway diesel fuel,
which become applicable in June 2006. In April 2003, the EPA proposed
a rule regarding emissions from non-road diesel engines and limiting
non-road diesel fuel sulfur content. The non-road rule, as promulgated in June 2004,
significantly reduces non-road diesel fuel sulfur content limits as early as
2007. We are evaluating and developing capital strategies for future integrated
compliance of our diesel fuel for the highway and non-road markets.

Additional areas of
potential air-related impact are the proposed revisions to the National Ambient
Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and the Kyoto Protocol. In July 1997, the
EPA promulgated more stringent revisions to the NAAQS for ozone and particulate
matter. Since that time, final adoption of these revisions has been the subject
of litigation (

American Trucking Association, Inc.
et al. v. United States Environmental Protection Agency

)

that eventually reached the
U.S. Supreme Court during the fall of 2000. In February 2001, the
U.S. Supreme Court remanded this matter, in part, to the EPA to address
the implementation provisions relating to the revised ozone NAAQS. The EPA
responded by promulgating a revised implementation rule for its new
eight-hour NAAQS on April 30, 2004. Several environmental groups have
since filed challenges to this new rule. Depending upon the outcomes of the
various challenges, area designations, and the resulting State Implementation
Plans, the revised NAAQS could result in substantial future environmental
expenditures for us. In recent action, the EPA has proposed an even more
stringent particulate-matter standard and continues to consider increased
stringency for ozone requirements as well. Outcomes of the deliberations remain
indeterminate.

In 1997, an international
conference on global warming concluded an agreement, known as the Kyoto
Protocol, which called for reductions of certain emissions that contribute to
increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. The United States has
not ratified the treaty codifying the Kyoto Protocol but may in the future
ratify, support or sponsor either it or other climate change related emissions
reduction programs. Other countries where we have interests, or may have
interests in the future, have made commitments to the Kyoto Protocol and are in
various stages of formulating applicable regulations. Because considerable uncertainty
exists with respect to the regulations that would ultimately govern
implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, it currently is not possible to
accurately estimate our future compliance costs under the Kyoto Protocol, but
they could be substantial. The Kyoto Protocol became effective as to its
ratifying countries in February 2005.

We also are subject to certain laws and regulations
relating to environmental remediation obligations associated with current and
past operations. Such laws and regulations include CERCLA and RCRA and their
state equivalents. Remediation obligations include cleanup responsibility
arising from petroleum releases from underground storage tanks located at
numerous past and present ConocoPhillips-owned and/or operated petroleum-marketing
outlets throughout the United States.

Federal and state laws require that
contamination caused by such underground storage tank releases be assessed and
remediated to meet applicable standards. In addition to other cleanup
standards, many states adopted cleanup criteria for methyl tertiary-butyl ether
(MTBE) for both soil and groundwater. MTBE standards continue to evolve, and
future environmental expenditures associated with the remediation of
MTBE-contaminated underground storage tank sites could be substantial

.

At RCRA permitted
facilities, we are required to assess environmental conditions. If conditions
warrant, we may be required to remediate contamination caused by prior
operations. In contrast to CERCLA, which is often referred to as “Superfund,”
the cost of corrective action activities under RCRA corrective action programs
typically is borne solely by us. Over the next decade, we anticipate that
significant ongoing expenditures for RCRA remediation activities may be
required, but such annual expenditures for the near term are not expected to
vary significantly from the range of such expenditures we have experienced over
the past few years. Longer-term expenditures are subject to considerable
uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly.


We, from time to time,
receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the EPA
and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible
party under CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have
been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private
parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for
remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but
allegedly contain wastes attributable to our past operations. As of December 31,
2004, we reported we had been notified of potential liability under CERCLA and
comparable state laws at 64 sites around the United States. At December 31,
2005, we had resolved five of these sites, reclassified one site, and had
received six new notices of potential liability, leaving 66 unresolved
sites where we have been notified of potential liability.

For most Superfund sites,
our potential liability will be significantly less than the total site
remediation costs because the percentage of waste attributable to us, versus
that attributable to all other potentially responsible parties, is relatively
low. Although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and
several for federal sites and frequently so for state sites, other potentially
responsible parties at sites where we are a party typically have had the
financial strength to meet their obligations, and where they have not, or where
potentially responsible parties could not be located, our share of liability
has not increased materially. Many of the sites at which we are potentially
responsible are still under investigation by the EPA or the state agencies
concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally
assess site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate
remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or attain a
settlement of liability. Actual cleanup costs generally occur after the parties
obtain EPA or equivalent state agency approval. There are relatively few sites
where we are a major participant, and given the timing and amounts of
anticipated expenditures, neither the cost of remediation at those sites nor
such costs at all CERCLA sites, in the aggregate, is expected to have a
material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition.

Expensed
environmental costs were $847 million in 2005 and are expected to be about
$790 million in 2006 and $850 million in 2007. Capitalized
environmental costs were $1,235 million in 2005 and are expected to be
about $1,000 million and $630 million in 2006 and 2007, respectively.

Remediation
Accruals

We accrue for remediation
activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and
reasonable estimates of the liability can be made. These accrued liabilities
are not reduced for potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties
and are not discounted (except those assumed in a purchase business combination,
which we do record on a discounted basis).

Many of these liabilities
result from CERCLA, RCRA and similar state laws that require us to undertake
certain investigative and remedial activities at sites where we conduct, or
once conducted, operations or at sites where ConocoPhillips-generated waste was
disposed. The accrual also includes a number of sites we identified that may require
environmental remediation, but which are not currently the subject of CERCLA,
RCRA or state enforcement activities. If applicable, we accrue receivables for
probable insurance or other third-party recoveries. In the future, we may incur
significant costs under both CERCLA and RCRA. Considerable uncertainty exists
with respect to these costs, and under adverse changes in circumstances,
potential liability may exceed amounts accrued as of December 31,
2005.

Remediation activities
vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site, depending on the mix
of unique site characteristics, evolving remediation technologies, diverse
regulatory agencies and enforcement policies, and the presence or absence of
potentially liable third parties. Therefore, it is difficult to develop
reasonable estimates of future site remediation costs.


At December 31,
2005, our balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs related to
continuing operations of $989 million, compared with $1,061 million
at December 31, 2004. We expect to incur a substantial majority of these
expenditures within the next 30 years.

Notwithstanding any of
the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses,
environmental costs and liabilities are inherent in our operations and
products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities
will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse
effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of
compliance with environmental laws and regulations.

Other

We have deferred
tax assets related to certain accrued liabilities, loss carryforwards, and
credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances have been established for certain
foreign operating and domestic capital loss carryforwards that reduce deferred
tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Uncertainties
that may affect the realization of these assets include tax law changes
and the future level of product prices and costs. Based on our historical
taxable income, our expectations for the future, and available tax-planning
strategies, management expects that the net deferred tax assets will be
realized as offsets to reversing deferred tax liabilities and as reductions in
future taxable income.

NEW
ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In

May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154,
“Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20
and FASB Statement No. 3.”  Among
other changes, this Statement requires retrospective application for voluntary
changes in accounting principle, unless it is impractical to do so. Guidance is
provided on how to account for changes when retrospective application is
impractical. This Statement is effective on a prospective basis beginning January 1,
2006.

In December 2004,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment,”
(SFAS 123(R)), which supercedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and replaces SFAS No. 123, “Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation,” that we adopted at the beginning of 2003. SFAS
123(R) prescribes the accounting for a wide range of share-based compensation
arrangements, including options, restricted share plans, performance-based
awards, share appreciation rights, and employee share purchase plans, and
generally requires the fair value of share-based awards to be expensed. For
ConocoPhillips, this Statement provided for an effective date of third-quarter
2005; however, in April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission
approved a new rule that delayed the effective date until January 1,
2006. We adopted the provisions of this Statement on January 1, 2006,
using the modified-prospective transition method, and do not expect the
provisions of this new pronouncement to have a material impact on our financial
statements. For more information on our adoption of SFAS No. 123 and its
effect on net income, see Note 1—Accounting Policies, in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

In
November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs, an
amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4.” 
This Statement clarifies that items, such as abnormal idle facility
expense, excessive spoilage, double freight, and handling costs, be recognized
as current-period charges. In addition, the Statement requires that allocation
of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal
capacity of the production facilities. We are required to implement this
Statement in the first quarter of 2006. We do not expect this Statement to have
a significant impact on our financial statements.


At the September 2005
meeting, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 04-13, “Accounting for
Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty,” which addresses
accounting issues that arise when one company both sells inventory to and buys
inventory from another company in the same line of business. For additional
information, see the Revenue Recognition section of Note 1—Accounting
Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting
policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. See Note 1—Accounting Policies,
in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for descriptions of our
major accounting policies. Certain of these accounting policies involve
judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable
likelihood that materially different amounts would have been reported under
different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. These critical
accounting policies are discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee at least
annually. We believe the following discussions of critical accounting policies,
along with the discussions of contingencies and of deferred tax asset valuation
allowances in this report, address all important accounting areas where the
nature of accounting estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of
subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or
the susceptibility of such matters to change.

Oil and Gas Accounting

Accounting

for oil and gas exploratory activity is
subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas
industry. The acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information,
prior to the discovery of proved reserves, is expensed as incurred, similar to
accounting for research and development costs. However, leasehold acquisition
costs and exploratory well costs are capitalized on the balance sheet pending
determination of whether proved oil and gas reserves have been discovered on
the prospect.

Property Acquisition Costs

For
individually significant leaseholds, management periodically assesses for
impairment based on exploration and drilling efforts to date. For leasehold
acquisition costs that individually are relatively small, management exercises
judgment and determines a percentage probability that the prospect ultimately
will fail to find proved oil and gas reserves and pools that leasehold
information with others in the geographic area. For prospects in areas that
have had limited, or no, previous exploratory drilling, the percentage
probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high. This
judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost, and that
product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine a
periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense.

This
judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the
contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable
exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leaseholds, and leasehold
impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively. By the end of the
contractual period of the leasehold, the impairment probability percentage will
have been adjusted to 100 percent if the leasehold is expected to be
abandoned, or will have been adjusted to zero percent if there is an oil or gas
discovery that is under development. See the supplemental Oil and Gas
Operations disclosures about Costs Incurred and Capitalized Costs for more
information about the amounts and geographic locations of costs incurred in
acquisition activity and the amounts on the balance sheet related to unproved
properties. At year-end 2005, the book value of the pools of property
acquisition costs, that individually are relatively small and thus subject to
the above-described periodic leasehold impairment calculation, was
approximately $512 million and the accumulated impairment reserve was
approximately


$167 million.
The weighted average judgmental percentage probability of ultimate failure was
approximately 72 percent and the weighted average amortization period was
approximately 2.9 years. If that judgmental percentage were to be raised
by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax leasehold impairment expense in
2006 would increase by $6 million. The remaining $2,688 million of
capitalized unproved property costs at year-end 2005 consisted of individually
significant leaseholds, mineral rights held into perpetuity by title ownership,
exploratory wells currently drilling, and suspended exploratory wells. Management
periodically assesses individually significant leaseholds for impairment based
on exploration and drilling efforts to date on the individual prospects. Of
this amount, approximately $1.7 billion is concentrated in nine major
projects. Except for Surmont, which is scheduled to begin production in late
2006, management expects less than $100 million to move to proved
properties in 2006. Most of the remaining value is associated with Mackenzie
Delta, Alaska North Slope and Australia natural gas projects, on which we
continue to work with partners and regulatory agencies in order to develop. See
the following discussion of Exploratory Costs for more information on suspended
exploratory wells.

Exploratory Costs

For exploratory wells, drilling costs are
temporarily capitalized, or “suspended,” on the balance sheet, pending a
determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserves have been
discovered by the drilling effort to justify completion of the find as a
producing well.

If a judgment is made that the well did not
encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities, the well costs are
expensed as a dry hole and reported in exploration expense. If exploratory
wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs
remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress
assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project
is being made. The accounting notion of “sufficient progress” is a judgmental
area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of
suspended well costs on the mere chance that future market conditions will
improve or new technologies will be found that would make the project’s
development economically profitable. In these situations, recoverable reserves
are considered economic if the quantity found justifies completion of the find
as a producing well, without considering the major infrastructure capital
expenditures that will need to be made. Once all additional exploratory
drilling and testing work has been completed, the economic viability of the
overall project, including any major infrastructure capital expenditures that
will need to be made, is evaluated. If economically viable, internal company
approvals are obtained to move the project into the development phase. Often,
the ability to move the project into the development phase and record proved
reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer
approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control. Exploratory
well costs remain suspended as long as the company is actively pursuing such
approvals and permits and believes they will be obtained. Once all required
approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the
development phase and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved
reserves. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual to have
exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several years while
we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential
oil and gas field, or we seek government or co-venturer approval of development
plans or seek environmental permitting.

Unlike leasehold acquisition costs, there is no
periodic impairment assessment of suspended exploratory well costs. In addition
to reviewing suspended well balances quarterly, management continuously
monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work and
expenses the suspended well costs as a dry hole when it judges that the
potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term. Criteria
utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir
characteristics and hydrocarbon properties, expected development costs, ability
to apply existing technology to produce the reserves, fiscal terms, regulations
or contract negotiations, and our required return on investment.


At year-end 2005, total suspended well costs were
$339 million, compared with $347 million at year-end 2004. For
additional information on suspended wells, see Note 8—Properties, Plants and
Equipment, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Proved Oil and Gas Reserves and Canadian Syncrude Reserves

Engineering
estimates of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves in oil and gas
fields and in-place crude bitumen volumes in oil sand mining operations are
inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the
subjective judgments involved in developing such information. Reserve estimates
are based on subjective judgments involving geological and engineering
assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production or mining plan,
historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant
operating capacity and operating approval limits. The reliability of these
estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the
technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the
hydrocarbons. Despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates,
accounting rules require disclosure of “proved” reserve estimates due to
the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and
future cash flows of a company’s exploration and production (E&P)
operations. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the
engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated
as “proved.”  Our reservoir engineering
department has policies and procedures in place that are consistent with these
authoritative guidelines. We have qualified and experienced internal
engineering personnel who make these estimates for our E&P segment. Proved
reserve estimates are updated annually and take into account recent production
and seismic information about each field or oil sand mining operation. Also, as
required by authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when a field or
oil sand mining operation will be permanently shut down for economic reasons is
based on an extrapolation of sales prices and operating costs prevalent at the
balance sheet date. This estimated date when production will end affects the
amount of estimated recoverable reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels
change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Year-end
2005 estimated reserves related to our LUKOIL Investment segment were based on
LUKOIL’s year-end 2004 oil and gas reserves. Because LUKOIL’s accounting cycle
close and preparation of U.S. GAAP financial statements occurs subsequent to
our accounting cycle close, our 16.1 percent equity share of LUKOIL’s oil
and gas proved reserves at year-end 2005 were estimated based on LUKOIL’s prior
year’s report (adjusted for known additions, license extensions, dispositions, and
public information) and included adjustments to conform to our reserve
policy and provided for estimated 2005 production. Any differences between the
estimate and actual reserve computations will be recorded in a subsequent
period. This estimate-to-actual adjustment will then be a recurring component
of future period reserves.

The
judgmental estimation of proved reserves also is important to the income
statement because the proved oil and gas reserve estimate for a field or the
estimated in-place crude bitumen volume for an oil sand mining operation serves
as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of depreciation,
depletion and amortization of the capitalized costs for that asset. At year-end
2005, the net book value of productive E&P properties, plants and equipment
subject to a unit-of-production calculation, including our Canadian Syncrude
bitumen oil sand assets, was approximately $31.9 billion and the
depreciation, depletion and amortization recorded on these assets in 2005 was
approximately $2.5 billion. The estimated proved developed oil and gas
reserves on these fields were 4.8 billion BOE at the beginning of 2005 and were
5.2 billion BOE at the end of 2005. The estimated proved reserves on the
Canadian Syncrude assets were 258 million barrels at the beginning of 2005 and
were 251 million barrels at the end of 2005. If the judgmental estimates
of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower
by 5 percent across all calculations, pretax depreciation, depletion and
amortization in 2005 would have been increased by an estimated
$131 million. Impairments of producing oil and gas properties in 2005,
2004 and 2003 totaled $4 million, $67million and $225 million,
respectively. Of these write-downs, only $1 million in 2005, $52 million
in 2004 and $19 million in 2003 were due to downward revisions of


proved
reserves. The remainder of the impairments in 2003 resulted either from
properties being designated as held for sale or from the repeal in 2003 of the
Norway Removal Grant Act (1986) that increased asset removal obligations.

Impairment
of Assets

Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for
impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible
significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated by
an asset group. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pretax cash flows
is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is
written down to estimated fair value. Individual assets are grouped for
impairment purposes based on a judgmental assessment of the lowest level for
which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the
cash flows of other groups of assets—generally on a field-by-field basis for
exploration and production assets, at an entire complex level for downstream
assets, or at a site level for retail stores. Because there usually is a lack
of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value usually is based
on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates
commensurate with the risks involved in the asset group. The expected future
cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair-value calculations are
based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, prices and costs,
considering all available information at the date of review. See Note
10—Property Impairments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for
additional information.

Asset
Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs

Under various contracts, permits and regulations, we
have material legal obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the
land or seabed at the end of operations at operational sites. Our largest asset
removal obligations involve removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas
platforms around the world, oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in
Alaska, and asbestos abatement at refineries. The estimated discounted costs of
dismantling and removing these facilities are accrued at the installation of
the asset. Estimating the future asset removal costs necessary for this
accounting calculation is difficult. Most of these removal obligations are many
years, or decades, in the future and the contracts and regulations often have
vague descriptions of what removal practices and criteria must be met when the
removal event actually occurs. Asset removal technologies and costs are
changing constantly, as well as political, environmental, safety and public
relations considerations.

In addition, under the above or similar contracts,
permits and regulations, we have certain obligations to complete
environmental-related projects. These projects are primarily related to cleanup
at domestic refineries and underground storage tanks at U.S. service stations,
and remediation activities required by the state of Alaska at exploration and
production sites. Future environmental remediation costs are difficult to
estimate because they are subject to change due to such factors as the
uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such
remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our
liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties.

See Note 1—Accounting Policies, Note 3—Changes in
Accounting Principles, Note 11—Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued
Environmental Costs, and Note 15—Contingencies and Commitments, in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.

Business
Acquisitions

Purchase Price Allocation

Accounting for the
acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the
various assets and liabilities of the acquired business. For most assets and
liabilities, purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording the asset
or liability at its estimated fair value. The most difficult estimations of


individual fair values are
those involving properties, plants and equipment and identifiable intangible
assets. We use all available information to make these fair value
determinations and, for major business acquisitions, typically engage an
outside appraisal firm to assist in the fair value determination of the
acquired long-lived assets. We have, if necessary, up to one year after the
acquisition closing date to finish these fair value determinations and finalize
the purchase price allocation.

Intangible Assets and Goodwill

In connection with the
acquisition of Tosco Corporation on September 14, 2001, and the merger of
Conoco and Phillips on August 30, 2002, we recorded material intangible
assets for trademarks and trade names, air emission permit credits, and permits
to operate refineries. These intangible assets were determined to have
indefinite useful lives and so are not amortized. This judgmental assessment of
an indefinite useful life has to be continuously evaluated in the future. If,
due to changes in facts and circumstances, management determines that these
intangible assets then have definite useful lives, amortization will have to
commence at that time on a prospective basis. As long as these intangible
assets are judged to have indefinite lives, they will be subject to periodic
lower-of-cost-or-market tests that require management’s judgment of the
estimated fair value of these intangible assets. See Note 9—Goodwill and
Intangibles, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional
information.

Also,
in connection with the acquisition of Tosco, the merger of Conoco and Phillips,
and the acquisition of an ownership interest in a producing oil business in
Libya, we recorded a material amount of goodwill. Under the accounting rules for
goodwill, this intangible asset is not amortized. Instead, goodwill is subject
to annual reviews for impairment based on a two-step accounting test. The first
step is to compare the estimated fair value of any reporting units within the
company that have recorded goodwill with the recorded net book value (including
the goodwill) of the reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of the
reporting unit is higher than the recorded net book value, no impairment is
deemed to exist and no further testing is required that year. If, however, the
estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the recorded net book
value, then a second step must be performed to determine the amount of the
goodwill impairment to record, if any. In this second step, the estimated fair
value from the first step is used as the purchase price in a hypothetical new
acquisition of the reporting unit. The various purchase business combination rules are
followed to determine a hypothetical purchase price allocation for the
reporting unit’s assets and liabilities. The residual amount of goodwill that
results from this hypothetical purchase price allocation is compared with the
recorded amount of goodwill for the reporting unit, and the recorded amount is
written down to the hypothetical amount if lower.

The reporting unit or
units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined
primarily from the manner in which the business is managed. A reporting unit is
an operating segment or a component that is one level below an operating
segment. A component is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a
business for which discrete financial information is available and segment
management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. However,
two or more components of an operating segment shall be aggregated and deemed a
single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. Within
our E&P segment and our R&M segment, we determined that we have one and
two reporting units, respectively, for purposes of assigning goodwill and
testing for impairment. These are Worldwide Exploration and Production,
Worldwide Refining and Worldwide Marketing. Our Midstream, Chemicals and
Emerging Businesses operating segments were not assigned any goodwill from the
merger because the two predecessor companies’ operations did not overlap in
these operating segments so we were unable to capture significant synergies and
strategic advantages from the merger in these areas.

In our E&P segment, management reporting is
primarily organized based on geographic areas. All of these geographic areas
have similar business processes, distribution networks and customers, and are
supported by a worldwide exploration team and shared services organizations. Therefore,
all components have been aggregated into one reporting unit, Worldwide
Exploration and Production, which is the same as the


operating segment. In contrast, in our R&M
segment, management reporting is primarily organized based on functional areas.
Because the two broad functional areas of R&M have dissimilar business
processes and customers, we concluded that it would not be appropriate to
aggregate these components into only one reporting unit at the R&M segment
level. Instead, we identified two reporting units within the operating
segment:  Worldwide Refining and
Worldwide Marketing. Components in those two reporting units have similar
business processes, distribution networks and customers. If we later reorganize
our businesses or management structure so that the components within these
three reporting units are no longer economically similar, the reporting units
would be revised and goodwill would be re-assigned using a relative fair value
approach in accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets.”  Goodwill impairment testing at
a lower reporting unit level could result in the recognition of impairment that
would not otherwise be recognized at the current higher level of aggregation. In
addition, the sale or disposition of a portion of these three reporting units
will be allocated a portion of the reporting unit’s goodwill, based on relative
fair values, which will adjust the amount of gain or loss on the sale or
disposition.

Because quoted market
prices for our reporting units are not available, management must apply
judgment in determining the estimated fair value of these reporting units for
purposes of performing the first step of the periodic goodwill impairment test.
Management uses all available information to make these fair value
determinations, including the present values of expected future cash flows
using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the assets and
observed market multiples of operating cash flows and net income, and may engage
an outside appraisal firm for assistance. In addition, if the first test step
is not met, further judgment must be applied in determining the fair values of
individual assets and liabilities for purposes of the hypothetical purchase
price allocation. Again, management must use all available information to make
these fair value determinations and may engage an outside appraisal firm
for assistance. At year-end 2005, the estimated fair values of our Worldwide
Exploration and Production, Worldwide Refining, and Worldwide Marketing
reporting units ranged from between 17 percent to 67 percent higher
than recorded net book values (including goodwill) of the reporting units. However,
a lower fair value estimate in the future for any of these reporting units
could result in impairment of the $15.3 billion of goodwill.

During 2006, we expect to
acquire Burlington Resources Inc., subject to approval of the transaction by
Burlington’s shareholders and appropriate regulatory agencies. We expect this
acquisition to result in the accounting recognition of a material amount of
additional goodwill, all of which will be associated with our Worldwide
Exploration and Production reporting unit. Based on our goodwill impairment
testing at year-end 2005, we anticipate that this reporting unit will have
adequate capacity to absorb this additional goodwill from the Burlington
transaction and will not result in an impairment.

Use of
Equity Method Accounting for Investment in LUKOIL

In October 2004, we
purchased 7.6 percent of the outstanding ordinary shares of LUKOIL from
the Russian government. During the remainder of 2004 and throughout 2005, we
purchased additional shares of LUKOIL on the open market and reached an
ownership level of 16.1 percent in LUKOIL by the end of 2005. On January 24,
2005, LUKOIL held an extraordinary general meeting of stockholders at which our
nominee to the LUKOIL Board of Directors was elected under the cumulative
voting rules in Russia, and certain amendments to LUKOIL’s charter were
approved which provide protections to preserve the significant influence of
major stockholders in LUKOIL, such as ConocoPhillips. In addition, during the
first quarter of 2005, the two companies began the secondment of managerial
personnel between the two companies.


Based on the overall
facts and circumstances surrounding our investment in LUKOIL, we concluded that
we have significant influence over the operating and financial policies of
LUKOIL and thus applied the equity method of accounting beginning in the fourth
quarter of 2004. Determination of whether one company has significant influence
over another, the criterion required by APB Opinion No. 18, “The Equity
Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock,” in order to use equity
method accounting, is a judgmental accounting decision based on the overall
facts and circumstances of each situation. Under the equity method of
accounting, we estimate and record our weighted-average ownership share of
LUKOIL’s net income (determined in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP)) each period as equity
earnings on our income statement, with a corresponding increase in our recorded
investment in LUKOIL. Cash dividends received from LUKOIL will reduce our
recorded investment in LUKOIL. The use of equity-method accounting also
requires us to supplementally report our ownership share of LUKOIL’s oil and
gas disclosures in our report.

If future facts and circumstances were to change to
where we no longer believe we have significant influence over LUKOIL’s
operating and financial policies, we would have to change our accounting
classification for the investment to an available-for-sale equity security
under SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities.”  If that unlikely event were
to occur, our investment in LUKOIL would be marked to market each period, based
on LUKOIL’s publicly traded share price, with the offset recorded as a
component of other comprehensive income. Additionally, we would no longer
record our ownership share of LUKOIL’s net income each period and any cash
dividends would be reported as dividend income when declared by LUKOIL. We also
would no longer be able to supplementally report our ownership share of LUKOIL’s
oil and gas disclosures.

During 2005, we recorded $756 million of
equity-method earnings from our 13.1 percent weighted-average ownership
level in LUKOIL. Our reported earnings for the LUKOIL Investment segment of
$714 million included the above equity-method earnings, less certain
expenses and taxes. At December 31, 2005, we supplementally reported an
estimated 1,242 million barrels of crude oil and 1,197 billion cubic
feet of natural gas proved reserves from our ownership level of
16.1 percent at year-end 2005. Because LUKOIL’s accounting cycle close and
preparation of U.S. GAAP financial statements occurs subsequent to our
accounting cycle close, we have used all available information to estimate
LUKOIL’s U.S. GAAP net income for the year 2005 for purposes of our
equity-method accounting. Any differences between our estimate of
fourth-quarter 2005 net income and the actual LUKOIL U.S. GAAP net income will
be recorded in our 2006 equity earnings. In addition, we used all available
information to estimate our share of LUKOIL’s oil and gas disclosures. If,
instead of equity-method accounting, we had been required to follow the
requirements of SFAS No. 115 for our investment in LUKOIL, the
mark-to-market adjustment to reflect LUKOIL’s publicly-traded share price at
year-end 2005 would have been a pretax benefit to other comprehensive income of
approximately $3,298 million. Also, $19 million of
acquisition-related costs would have been expensed and $756 million of
current year equity-method earnings would not have been recorded.

At the end of 2005, the cost of our investment in
LUKOIL exceeded our 16.1 percent share of LUKOIL’s historical U.S. GAAP
balance sheet equity by an estimated $1,375 million. Under the accounting
guidelines of APB Opinion No. 18, we account for the basis difference
between the cost of our investment and the amount of underlying equity in the
historical net assets of LUKOIL as if LUKOIL were a consolidated subsidiary. In
other words, a hypothetical purchase price allocation is performed to determine
how LUKOIL assets and liabilities would have been adjusted in a hypothetical
push-down accounting exercise to reflect the actual cost of our investment in
LUKOIL’s shares. Once these hypothetical push-down adjustments have been
identified, the nature of the hypothetically adjusted assets or liabilities
determines the future amortization pattern for the basis difference. The
majority of the basis difference is associated with LUKOIL’s developed
property, plant and equipment base. The earnings we recorded for


our LUKOIL investment thus included a reduction for
the amortization of this basis difference. In 2005, we completed the purchase
price allocation related to our 2004 share purchases of LUKOIL.

Projected
Benefit Obligations

Determination of the
projected benefit obligations for our defined benefit pension and
postretirement plans are important to the recorded amounts for such obligations
on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income
statement. This also impacts the required company contributions into the plans.
The actuarial determination of projected benefit obligations and company
contribution requirements involves judgment about uncertain future events,
including estimated retirement dates, salary levels at retirement, mortality
rates, lump-sum election rates, rates of return on plan assets, future health
care cost-trend rates, and rates of utilization of health care services by retirees.
Due to the specialized nature of these calculations, we engage outside
actuarial firms to assist in the determination of these projected benefit
obligations. For Employee Retirement Income Security Act-qualified pension
plans, the actuary exercises fiduciary care on behalf of plan participants in
the determination of the judgmental assumptions used in determining required
company contributions into plan assets. Due to differing objectives and
requirements between financial accounting rules and the pension plan
funding regulations promulgated by governmental agencies, the actuarial methods
and assumptions for the two purposes differ in certain important respects. Ultimately,
we will be required to fund all promised benefits under pension and postretirement
benefit plans not funded by plan assets or investment returns, but the
judgmental assumptions used in the actuarial calculations significantly affect
periodic financial statements and funding patterns over time. Benefit expense
is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan assets
assumptions. A 1 percent decrease in the discount rate would increase
annual benefit expense by $105 million, while a 1 percent decrease in
the return on plan assets assumption would increase annual benefit expense by
$40 million. In determining the discount rate, we use yields on
high-quality fixed income investments (including among other things, Moody’s Aa
corporate bond yields) with adjustments as needed to match the estimated
benefit cash flows of our plans.

OUTLOOK

On the evening of December 12,
2005, ConocoPhillips and Burlington Resources Inc. announced that they had
signed a definitive agreement under which ConocoPhillips would acquire
Burlington Resources Inc. The transaction has a preliminary value of $33.9
billion. This transaction is expected to close on March 31, 2006, subject to
approval by Burlington Resources shareholders at a special meeting set for
March 30, 2006.

Under the terms of the
agreement, Burlington Resources shareholders will receive $46.50 in cash and
0.7214 shares of ConocoPhillips common stock for each Burlington Resources
share they own. This represents a transaction value of $92 per share, based on
the closing of ConocoPhillips shares on Friday, December 9, 2005, the last
unaffected day of trading prior to the announcement. We anticipate that the
cash portion of the purchase price, approximately $17.5 billion, will be
financed with a combination of short- and long-term debt and available cash.

Burlington Resources is
an independent exploration and production company that holds a substantial
position in North American natural gas reserves and production.

Upon completion of the
transaction, Bobby S. Shakouls, Burlington Resources’ President and Chief
Executive Officer, and William E. Wade Jr., currently an independent director
of Burlington Resources, will join our Board of Directors. For additional
information about the acquisition, see Note 28—Pending Acquisition of
Burlington Resources Inc., in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.


In October 2005, we announced that we had reached an agreement in
principle with the state of Alaska on the base fiscal contract terms for an
Alaskan natural gas pipeline project.  In
early 2006, the state of Alaska announced that they had reached an agreement in
principle with all the co-venturers in the project.  Once the final form of agreement is reached
among all the parties, it will be subject to approval by the Alaska State Legislature
before it can be executed.  Additional
agreements for the gas to transit Canada will also be required.

In February 2006, the governor of Alaska announced proposed legislation
to change the state's oil and gas production tax structure.  The proposed structure would be based on a
percentage of revenues less certain expenditures, and include certain
incentives to encourage new investment. 
If approved by the legislature, the new tax structure would go into
effect July 1, 2006.  If enacted, we
would anticipate an increase in our production taxes in Alaska, based on an
initial assessment of the proposed legislation.

In addition to our
participation in the LNG regasification terminal at Freeport, Texas, we are
pursuing three other proposed LNG regasification terminals in the United States.
The Beacon Port Terminal would be located in federal waters in the Gulf of
Mexico, 56 miles south of the Louisiana mainland. Also in the Gulf of Mexico is
the proposed Compass Port Terminal, to be located approximately 11 miles
offshore Alabama. The third proposed facility would be a joint venture located
in the Port of Long Beach, California. Each of these proposed projects is in various
stages of the regulatory permitting process.

In the United Kingdom, with effect from January 1,
2006, legislation is pending to increase the rate of supplementary corporation
tax applicable to U.K. upstream activity from 10 percent to
20 percent. This would result in the overall U.K. upstream corporation tax
rate increasing from 40 percent to 50 percent. The earnings impact of
these changes will be reflected in our financial statements when the
legislation is substantially enacted, which could occur in the third quarter of
2006. Upon enactment, we expect to record a charge for the revaluing of the December 31,
2005, deferred tax liability, as well as an adjustment to our tax expense to
reflect the new rate from January 1, 2006, through the date of enactment. We
are currently evaluating the full financial impact of this proposed legislation
on our financial statements.

In February 2003, the
Venezuelan government implemented a currency exchange control regime. The
government has published legal instruments supporting the controls, one of
which establishes official exchange rates for the U.S. dollar. The devaluation
of the Venezuelan currency by approximately 11 percent in March 2005 did not
have a significant impact on our operations there; however, future changes in
the exchange rate could have a significant impact.  Based on public comments by Venezuelan
government officials, Venezuelan legislation could be enacted that would
increase the income tax rate on foreign companies operating in the Orinoco Oil
Belt from 34 percent to 50 percent. We continue to work closely with the
Venezuelan government on any potential impacts to our heavy-oil projects in
Venezuela.

In November 2005, the
Mackenzie Gas Project (MGP) proponents elected to proceed to the regulatory
hearings, which began in January 2006. This followed an earlier halting of
selected data collection, engineering and preliminary contracting work due to
insufficient progress on key areas critical to the project. Since that time,
considerable progress has been made with respect to Canadian government
socio-economic funding, regulatory process and schedule, the negotiation of
benefits and access agreements with four of the five aboriginal groups in the
field areas and on the pipeline route. First production from the Parsons Lake
field is now expected in 2011.


In December 2003, we
signed a Statement of Intent with Qatar Petroleum regarding the construction of
a gas-to-liquids (GTL) plant in Ras Laffan, Qatar. Preliminary engineering and
design studies have been completed. In April 2005, the Qatar Minister of
Petroleum stated that there would be a postponement of new GTL projects in
order to further study impacts on infrastructure, shipping and contractors, and
to ensure that the development of its gas resources occurs at a sustainable
rate. Work continues with Qatar authorities on the appropriate timing of the
project to meet the objectives of Qatar and ConocoPhillips.

In R&M, the
optimization of spending related to clean fuels project initiatives will be an
important focus area during 2006. We expect our average refinery crude oil
utilization rate for 2006 to average in the mid-nineties. This projection
excludes the impact of our equity investment in LUKOIL and the pending
acquisition of the Wilhelmshaven refinery in Germany.

Also in R&M, we are
planning to spend $4 billion to $5 billion over the period 2006
through 2011 to increase our U.S. refining system’s ability to process
heavy-sour crude oil and other lower-quality feedstocks. These investments are
expected to incrementally increase refining capacity and clean products yield
at our existing facilities, while providing competitive returns.

Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND
QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Financial Instrument Market Risk

We and certain of
our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial instruments
that expose cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices, foreign
exchange rates or interest rates. We may use financial and commodity-based
derivative contracts to manage the risks produced by changes in the prices of
electric power, natural gas, crude oil and related products, fluctuations in
interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, or to exploit market
opportunities.

Our use of
derivative instruments is governed by an “Authority Limitations” document
approved by our Board that prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or
derivative instruments without sufficient liquidity for comparable valuations
without approval from the Chief Executive Officer. The Authority Limitations
document also authorizes the Chief Executive Officer to establish the maximum
Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company and compliance with these limits is
monitored daily. The Chief Financial Officer monitors risks resulting from
foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, while the Executive Vice
President of Commercial monitors commodity price risk. Both report to the Chief
Executive Officer. The Commercial organization manages our commercial
marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, monitors related risks
of our upstream and downstream businesses, and selectively takes price risk to
add value.

Commodity
Price Risk

We operate in the
worldwide crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, and
electric power markets and are exposed to fluctuations in the prices for these
commodities. These fluctuations can affect our revenues, as well as the cost of
operating, investing, and financing activities. Generally, our policy is to
remain exposed to the market prices of commodities; however, executive
management may elect to use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk
of our crude oil and natural gas production, as well as refinery margins.

Our Commercial
organization uses futures, forwards, swaps, and options in various markets to
optimize the value of our supply chain, which may move our risk profile
away from market average prices to accomplish the following objectives:

•

Balance physical systems. In addition to cash settlement prior to contract expiration, exchange traded futures contracts also may be settled by physical delivery of the commodity, providing another source of supply to meet our refinery requirements or marketing demand.

•

Meet customer needs. Consist
ent with our policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to convert fixed-price sales contracts, which are often requested by natural gas and refined product consumers, to a floating market price.

•

Manage the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil, natural gas, refined product and electric power transactions.

•


0;

Enable us to use the market knowledge gained from these activities to do a limited amount of trading not directly related to our physical business. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the gains or losses from this activity were not material to our cash flows or income from continuing operations.


We use a VaR model
to estimate the loss in fair value that could potentially result on a single
day from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative
financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments held or issued,
including commodity purchase and sales contracts recorded on the balance sheet
at December 31, 2005, as derivative instruments in accordance with SFAS No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended. Using
Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent confidence level and a one-day holding
period, the VaR for those instruments issued or held for trading purposes at December 31,
2005 and 2004, was immaterial to our net income and cash flows. The VaR for
instruments held for purposes other than trading at December 31, 2005 and
2004, was also immaterial to our net income and cash flows.

Interest
Rate Risk

The following
tables provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive
to changes in interest rates. The debt tables present principal cash flows and
related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates; the
derivative table shows the notional quantities on which the cash flows will be
calculated by swap termination date. Weighted-average variable rates are based
on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date. The carrying
amount of our floating-rate debt approximates its fair value. The fair value of
the fixed-rate financial instruments is estimated based on quoted market
prices.


During the fourth quarter
of 2003, we executed certain interest rate swaps that had the effect of
converting $1.5 billion of debt from fixed to floating rate, but during
2005 we terminated the majority of these interest rate swaps as we redeemed the
associated debt. This reduced the amount of debt being converted from fixed to
floating by the end of 2005 to $350 million. Under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” these swaps were designated
as hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of $400 million of
3.625% Notes due 2007, $750 million of 6.35% Notes due 2009, and
$350 million of 4.75% Notes due 2012. These swaps qualify for the shortcut
method of hedge accounting, so over the term of the swaps we will not recognize
gain or loss due to ineffectiveness in the hedge.

Foreign Currency Risk

We have foreign
currency exchange rate risk resulting from international operations. We do not
comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency rate changes, although we may choose
to selectively hedge exposures to foreign currency rate risk. Examples include
firm commitments for capital projects, certain local currency tax payments and
dividends, and cash returns from net investments in foreign affiliates to be
remitted within the coming year.

At December 31, 2005
and 2004, we held foreign currency swaps hedging short-term intercompany loans
between European subsidiaries and a U.S. subsidiary. Although these swaps hedge
exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates, we elected not to utilize hedge
accounting as allowed by SFAS No. 133. As a result, the change in the fair
value of these foreign currency swaps is recorded directly in earnings. Since
the gain or loss on the swaps is offset by the gain or loss from remeasuring
the intercompany loans into the functional currency of the lender or borrower,
there would be no material impact to income from an adverse hypothetical
10 percent change in the December 31, 2005 or 2004, exchange rates. The
notional and fair market values of these positions at December 31, 2005
and 2004, were as follows:

Statements.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

All other
schedules are omitted because they are either not required, not significant,
not applicable or the information is shown in another schedule, the financial
statements or in the notes to consolidated financial statements.


Report of Management

Management prepared, and is responsible for, the consolidated financial
statements and the other information appearing in this annual report. The
consolidated financial statements present fairly the company’s financial
position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. In preparing its
consolidated financial statements, the company includes amounts that are based
on estimates and judgments that management believes are reasonable under the
circumstances. The company’s financial statements have been audited by Ernst
& Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm appointed by
the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors and ratified by
stockholders. Management has made available to Ernst & Young LLP all of the
company’s financial records and related data, as well as the minutes of
stockholders’ and directors’ meetings.

Assessment
of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management
is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting. ConocoPhillips’ internal control system was designed
to provide reasonable assurance to the company’s management and directors
regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial
statements.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have
inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective
can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation and presentation.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. In making this assessment, it
used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

. Based on our assessment, we believe
that, as of December 31, 2005, the company’s internal control over financial
reporting is effective based on those criteria.

Ernst & Young LLP has issued an audit report on our assessment of
the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,

Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on

Consolidated Financial Statements

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

ConocoPhillips

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
ConocoPhillips as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated
statements of income, changes in common stockholders’ equity, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005. Our audits
also included the condensed consolidating financial information and financial
statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 8. These financial statements,
condensed consolidating financial information and schedule are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements, condensed consolidating financial
information and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
ConocoPhillips at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the consolidated results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, the related condensed consolidating financial
information and financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to
the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material
respects the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, in
2005 ConocoPhillips adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations
— an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143,” and in 2003 ConocoPhillips
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, “Accounting
for Asset Retirement Obligations,” SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,” and FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities.”

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of
ConocoPhillips’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
and our report dated February 26, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.


Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

ConocoPhillips

We have audited management’s assessment, included under the heading “Assessment
of Internal Control over Financial Reporting” in the accompanying “Report of
Management,” that ConocoPhillips maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on

criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). ConocoPhillips’
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that ConocoPhillips maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is
fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in
our opinion, ConocoPhillips maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on

the COSO criteria.


We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the 2005

consolidated financial statements of
ConocoPhillips and our report dated February 26, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

1—Accounting Policies

•

Consolidation Principles and Investments—

Our consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of majority-owned, controlled subsidiaries and variable
interest entities where we are the primary beneficiary. The equity method is
used to account for investments in affiliates in which we have the ability to
exert significant influence over the affiliates’ operating and financial
policies. The cost method is used when we do not have the ability to exert
significant influence. Undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures,
pipelines, natural gas plants, certain transportation assets and Canadian
Syncrude mining operations are consolidated on a proportionate basis. Other
securities and investments, excluding marketable securities, are generally
carried at cost.

•

Foreign Currency Translation—

Adjustments
resulting from the process of translating foreign functional currency financial
statements into U.S. dollars are included in accumulated other comprehensive
income/loss in common stockholders’ equity. Foreign currency transaction gains
and losses are included in current earnings. Most of our foreign operations use
their local currency as the functional currency.

•

Use of Estimates—

The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual
results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used.

•

Revenue Recognition—

Revenues associated
with sales of crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, petroleum and
chemical products, and other items are recognized when title passes to the
customer, which is when the risk of ownership passes to the purchaser and
physical delivery of goods occurs, either immediately or within a fixed
delivery schedule that is reasonable and customary in the industry. Revenues
include

the sales portion of
transactions commonly called buy/sell contracts, in which physical commodity
purchases and sales are simultaneously contracted with the same counterparty to
either obtain a different quality or grade of refinery feedstock supply,
reposition a commodity (for example, where we enter into a contract with a
counterparty to sell refined products or natural gas volumes at one location
and purchase similar volumes at another location closer to our wholesale
customer), or both.

Buy/sell
transactions have the same general terms and conditions as typical commercial
contracts including: separate title transfer, transfer of risk of loss,
separate billing and cash settlement for both the buy and sell sides of the
transaction, and non-performance by one party does not relieve the other party
of its obligation to perform, except in events of force majeure.

Because
buy/sell contracts have similar terms and conditions, we and many other companies
in our industry

account for these
purchase and sale transactions in the consolidated income statement as monetary
transactions outside the scope of Accounting Principles Board (APB)
Opinion  No. 29, “Accounting for
Nonmonetary Transactions.”

Our
buy/sell transactions are similar to the “barrel back” example used in Emerging
Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03-11, “Reporting Realized Gains and
Losses on Derivative Instruments That Are Subject to FASB Statement No. 133 and
Not ‘Held for Trading Purposes’ as Defined in Issue No. 02-3.”  Using the “barrel back” example, the EITF
concluded that a company’s decision to


display
buy/sell-type transactions either gross or net on the income statement is a
matter of judgment that depends on relevant facts and circumstances. We apply
this judgment based on guidance in EITF Issue No. 99-19, “Reporting Revenue
Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent” (Issue No. 99-19), which
provides indicators for when to report revenues and the associated cost of
goods sold gross (i.e., on separate revenue and cost of sales lines in the
income statement) or net (i.e., on the same line). The indicators for gross
reporting in Issue No. 99-19 are consistent with many of the characteristics of
buy/sell transactions, which support our accounting for buy/sell transactions.

We

also believe that the
conclusion reached by the Derivatives Implementation Group Statement 133
Implementation Issue No. K1, “Miscellaneous: Determining Whether Separate
Transactions Should be Viewed as a Unit,” further supports our judgment that
the purchase and sale contracts should be viewed as two separate transactions
and not as a single transaction.

In
November 2004, the EITF began deliberating the accounting for buy/sell and
related transactions as Issue No. 04-13, “Accounting for Purchases and
Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty,” and reached a consensus at its
September 2005 meeting. The EITF concluded that purchases and sales of inventory,
including raw materials, work-in-progress or finished goods, with the same
counterparty that are entered into “in contemplation” of one another should be
combined and reported net for purposes of applying APB Opinion No. 29. Additionally,
the EITF concluded that exchanges of finished goods for raw materials or
work-in-progress within the same line of business is not an exchange subject to
APB Opinion No. 29 and should be recorded at fair value.

The
new guidance is effective prospectively beginning April 1, 2006, for new
arrangements entered into, and for modifications or renewals of existing
arrangements. We are reviewing this guidance and believe that any impact to
income from continuing operations and net income would result from changes in
last-in, first-out (LIFO) inventory valuations and would not be material to our
financial statements.

Had this new
guidance been effective for the periods included in this report, and pending
our final determination of what transactions are affected by the new guidance,
we estimate that we would have been

required to reduce sales and other operating revenues in 2005, 2004 and 2003 by
$21,814 million, $15,492 million and $11,673 million,
respectively, with related decreases in purchased crude oil, natural gas and
products.

Our
Commercial organization uses commodity derivative contracts (such as futures
and options) in various markets to optimize the value of our supply chain and
to balance physical systems. In addition to cash settlement prior to contract
expiration, exchange-traded futures contracts may also be settled by physical
delivery of the commodity, providing another source of supply to meet our
refinery requirements or marketing demand.

Revenues from the
production of natural gas properties, in which we have an interest with other
producers, are recognized based on the actual volumes we sold during the period.
Any differences between volumes sold and entitlement volumes, based on our net
working interest, which are deemed to be non-recoverable through remaining
production, are recognized as accounts receivable or accounts payable, as
appropriate. Cumulative differences between volumes sold and entitlement
volumes are generally not significant. Revenues associated with royalty fees
from licensed technology are recorded based either upon volumes produced by the
licensee or upon the successful completion of all substantive performance
requirements related to the installation of licensed technology.


•

Shipping and
Handling Costs—

Our Exploration
and Production (E&P) segment includes shipping and handling costs in
production and operating expenses, while the Refining and Marketing (R&M)
segment records shipping and handling costs in purchased crude oil, natural gas
and products. Freight costs billed to customers are recorded as a component of
revenue.

•

Cash Equivalents—

Cash equivalents are
highly liquid, short-term investments that are readily convertible to known
amounts of cash and have original maturities within three months from their
date of purchase. They are carried at cost plus accrued interest, which
approximates fair value.

•

Inventories—

We have several valuation methods for our various types of inventories
and consistently use the following methods for each type of inventory. Crude
oil, petroleum products, and Canadian Syncrude inventories are valued at the
lower of cost or market in the aggregate, primarily on the LIFO basis. Any
necessary lower-of-cost-or-market write-downs are recorded as permanent adjustments
to the LIFO cost basis. LIFO is used to better match current inventory costs
with current revenues and to meet tax-conformity requirements. Costs include
both direct and indirect expenditures incurred in bringing an item or product
to its existing condition and location, but not unusual/non-recurring costs or
research and development costs. Materials, supplies and other miscellaneous
inventories are valued under various methods, including the
weighted-average-cost method, and the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method,
consistent with general industry practice.

•

Derivative Instruments—

All derivative instruments are recorded on
the balance sheet at fair value in either prepaid expenses and other current
assets, other assets, other accruals, or other liabilities and deferred credits.
Recognition and classification of the gain or loss that results from recording
and adjusting a derivative to fair value depends on the purpose for issuing or
holding the derivative. Gains and losses from derivatives that are not
accounted for as hedges under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,”
are recognized immediately in earnings. For derivative instruments that are
designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gains or losses from
adjusting the derivative to its fair value will be immediately recognized in
earnings and, to the extent the hedge is effective, offset the concurrent
recognition of changes in the fair value of the hedged item. Gains or losses
from derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow
hedge will be recorded on the balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive
income until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings; however, to the
extent the change in the value of the derivative exceeds the change in the
anticipated cash flows of the hedged transaction, the excess gains or losses
will be recognized immediately in earnings.

In
the consolidated income statement, gains and losses from derivatives that are
held for trading and not directly related to our physical business are recorded
in other income. Gains and losses from derivatives used for other purposes are
recorded in either sales and other operating revenues; other income; purchased
crude oil, natural gas and products; interest and debt expense; or foreign
currency transaction (gains) losses, depending on the purpose for issuing or
holding the derivatives.

•

Oil and Gas Exploration and Development—

Oil
and gas exploration and development costs are accounted for using the
successful efforts method of accounting.

Property
Acquisition Costs—

Oil and gas leasehold acquisition costs are
capitalized and included in the balance sheet caption properties, plants and
equipment. Leasehold impairment is recognized based on exploratory experience
and management’s judgment. Upon discovery of commercial reserves, leasehold
costs are transferred to proved properties.


Exploratory Costs—

Geological
and geophysical costs and the costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped
properties are expensed as incurred. Exploratory well costs are capitalized, or
“suspended,” on the balance sheet pending further evaluation of whether
economically recoverable reserves have been found. If economically recoverable
reserves are not found, exploratory well costs are expensed as dry holes. If
exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the
well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient
progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the
project is being made. For complex exploratory discoveries, it is not unusual
to have exploratory wells remain suspended on the balance sheet for several
years while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the
potential oil and gas field, or we seek government or co-venturer approval of
development plans or seek environmental permitting. Once all required approvals
and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development
phase and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves.

Unlike leasehold acquisition costs, there is no
periodic impairment assessment of suspended exploratory well costs. In addition
to reviewing suspended well balances quarterly, management continuously
monitors the results of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work and
expenses the suspended well costs as a dry hole when it judges that the
potential field does not warrant further investment in the near term.

See Note 8—Properties, Plants and Equipment, for
additional information on suspended wells.

Development
Costs—

Costs incurred to drill and equip development wells,
including unsuccessful development wells, are capitalized.

Depletion
and Amortization—

Leasehold costs of producing properties are
depleted using the unit-of-production method based on estimated proved oil and
gas reserves. Amortization of intangible development costs is based on the
unit-of-production method using estimated proved developed oil and gas
reserves.

•

Syncrude Mining Operations—

Capitalized costs, including support
facilities, include the cost of the acquisition and other capital costs
incurred. Capital costs are depreciated using the unit-of-production method
based on the applicable portion of proven reserves associated with each mine
location and its facilities.

•

Capitalized Interest—

Interest from external
borrowings is capitalized on major projects with an expected construction
period of one year or longer. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of the
underlying asset and is amortized over the useful lives of the assets in the
same manner as the underlying assets.

•

Intangible Assets Other Than Goodwill—

Intangible assets that have finite useful
lives are amortized by the straight-line method over their useful lives. Intangible
assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are tested at
least annually for impairment. Each reporting period, we evaluate the remaining
useful lives of intangible assets not being amortized to determine whether
events and circumstances continue to support indefinite useful lives. Intangible
assets are considered impaired if the fair value of the intangible asset is
lower than cost. The fair value of intangible assets is determined based on
quoted market prices in active markets, if available. If quoted market prices
are not available, fair value of intangible assets is determined based upon the
present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate
with the risks involved in the asset, or upon estimated replacement cost, if
expected future cash flows from the intangible asset are not determinable.


•

Goodwill—

Goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for
impairment. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the recorded
book value of the reporting unit’s assets (including goodwill), less
liabilities, then a hypothetical purchase price allocation is performed on the
reporting unit’s assets and liabilities using the fair value of the reporting
unit as the purchase price in the calculation. If the amount of goodwill
resulting from this hypothetical purchase price allocation is less than the
recorded amount of goodwill, the recorded goodwill is written down to the new
amount. For purposes of goodwill impairment calculations, three reporting units
have been determined: Worldwide Exploration and Production, Worldwide Refining,
and Worldwide Marketing. Because quoted market prices are not available for the
company’s reporting units, the fair value of the reporting units is determined
based upon consideration of several factors, including the present values of
expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks
involved in the operations and observed market multiples of operating cash
flows and net income.

•

Depreciation and Amortization—

Depreciation and amortization of
properties, plants and equipment on producing oil and gas properties, certain
pipeline assets (those which are expected to have a declining utilization
pattern), and on Syncrude mining operations are determined by the
unit-of-production method. Depreciation and amortization of all other
properties, plants and equipment are determined by either the
individual-unit-straight-line method or the group-straight-line method (for
those individual units that are highly integrated with other units).

•

Impairment of Properties, Plants and Equipment—

Properties, plants and equipment used in
operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and
circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash
flows expected to be generated by an asset group. If, upon review, the sum of
the undiscounted pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset
group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value through
additional amortization or depreciation provisions and reported as Property
Impairments in the periods in which the determination of impairment is made. Individual
assets are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there
are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of
other groups of assets—generally on a field-by-field basis for exploration and
production assets, at an entire complex level for refining assets or at a site
level for retail stores. The fair value of impaired assets is determined based
on quoted market prices in active markets, if available, or upon the present
values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the
risks involved in the asset group. Long-lived assets committed by management
for disposal within one year are accounted for at the lower of amortized cost
or fair value, less cost to sell.

The expected future cash
flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based
on estimated future production volumes, prices and costs, considering all
available evidence at the date of review. If the future production price risk
has been hedged, the hedged price is used in the calculations for the period
and quantities hedged. The impairment review includes cash flows from proved
developed and undeveloped reserves, including any development expenditures
necessary to achieve that production. Additionally, when probable reserves
exist, an appropriate risk-adjusted amount of these reserves may be included in
the impairment calculation. The price and cost outlook assumptions used in
impairment reviews differ from the assumptions used in the Standardized Measure
of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Gas Reserve
Quantities. In that disclosure, SFAS No. 69, “Disclosures about Oil and Gas
Producing Activities,” requires inclusion of only proved reserves and the use
of prices and costs at the balance sheet date, with no projection for future
changes in assumptions.


•

Impairment
of Investments in Non-Consolidated Companies

—

Investments
in non-consolidated companies are assessed for impairment whenever changes in
the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value has occurred, which is
other than a temporary decline in value. The fair value of the impaired
investment is based on quoted market prices, if available, or upon the present
value of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the
risks of the investment.

•

Maintenance and Repairs—

The costs of maintenance
and repairs, which are not significant improvements, are expensed when incurred.

•

Advertising Costs—

Production costs of media advertising are deferred until the first
public showing of the advertisement. Advances to secure advertising slots at
specific sporting or other events are deferred until the event occurs. All
other advertising costs are expensed as incurred, unless the cost has benefits
that clearly extend beyond the interim period in which the expenditure is made,
in which case the advertising cost is deferred and amortized ratably over the
interim periods which clearly benefit from the expenditure.

•

Property Dispositions—

When complete units of depreciable
property are retired or sold, the asset cost and related accumulated
depreciation are eliminated, with any gain or loss reflected in income. When
less than complete units of depreciable property are disposed of or retired,
the difference between asset cost and salvage value is charged or credited to
accumulated depreciation.

•

Asset Retirement Obligations and Environmental Costs—

We record the fair value of legal obligations
to retire and remove long-lived assets in the period in which the obligation is
incurred (typically when the asset is installed at the production location). When
the liability is initially recorded, we capitalize this cost by increasing the
carrying amount of the related properties, plants and equipment. Over time the
liability is increased for the change in its present value, and the capitalized
cost in properties, plants and equipment is depreciated over the useful life of
the related asset. See Note 3—Changes in Accounting Principles, for
additional information.

Environmental
expenditures are expensed or capitalized, depending upon their future economic
benefit. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past
operations, and do not have a future economic benefit, are expensed. Liabilities
for environmental expenditures are recorded on an undiscounted basis (unless
acquired in a purchase business combination) when environmental assessments or
cleanups are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Recoveries of
environmental remediation costs from other parties, such as state reimbursement
funds, are recorded as assets when their receipt is probable and estimable.

•

Guarantees—

The fair value of a guarantee is determined and
recorded as a liability at the time the guarantee is given. The initial
liability is subsequently reduced as we are released from exposure under the
guarantee. We amortize the guarantee liability over the relevant time period,
if one exists, based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each type of
guarantee. In cases where the guarantee term is indefinite, we reverse the
liability when we have information that the liability is essentially relieved
or amortize it over an appropriate time period as the fair value of our
guarantee exposure declines over time. We amortize the guarantee liability to
the related income statement line item based on the nature of the guarantee. When
it becomes probable that we will have to perform on a guarantee, we accrue a
separate liability, if it is reasonably estimable, based on the facts and
circumstances at that time.


•

Stock-Based Compensation—

Effective January 1, 2003, we
voluntarily adopted the fair-value accounting method prescribed by SFAS No.
123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” 
We used the prospective transition method, applying the fair-value
accounting method and recognizing compensation expense equal to the fair-market
value on the grant date for all stock options granted or modified after
December 31, 2002.

Employee stock options
granted prior to 2003 continue to be accounted for under APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related Interpretations. Because the exercise
price of our employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying
stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is generally recognized
under APB Opinion No. 25. The following table displays pro forma information as
if the provisions of SFAS No. 123 had been applied to all employee stock
options granted:

Generally, our
stock-based compensation programs provide accelerated vesting (i.e., a waiver
of the remaining period of service required to earn an award) for awards held
by employees at the time of their retirement. We recognize expense for these
awards over the period of time during which the employee earns the award,
accelerating the recognition of expense only when an employee actually retires
(both the actual expense and the pro forma expense shown in the preceding table
were calculated in this manner).

Beginning in 2006, our
adoption of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (FAS 123R),
will require us to recognize stock-based compensation expense for new awards
over the shorter of: 1) the service period (i.e., the stated period of time
required to earn the award); or 2) the period beginning at the start of the
service period and ending when an employee first becomes eligible for
retirement. This will shorten the period over which we recognize expense for
most of our stock-based awards granted to our employees who are already age 55
or older, but we do not expect this change to have a material effect on our
financial statements. If we had used this method of recognizing expense for
stock-based awards for the periods presented, the effect on net income, as
reported, would not have been material.


•

Income Taxes—

Deferred income taxes are
computed using the liability method and are provided on all temporary
differences between the financial-reporting basis and the tax basis of our
assets and liabilities, except for deferred taxes on income considered to be
permanently reinvested in certain foreign subsidiaries and foreign corporate
joint ventures. Allowable tax credits are applied currently as reductions of
the provision for income taxes.

•

Net Income Per Share of Common Stock—

Basic
income per share of common stock is calculated based upon the daily weighted-average
number of common shares outstanding during the year, including unallocated
shares held by the stock savings feature of the ConocoPhillips Savings Plan. Diluted
income per share of common stock includes the above, plus unvested stock, unit
or option awards granted under our compensation plans and vested but
unexercised stock options, but only to the extent these instruments dilute net
income per share. Treasury stock and shares held by the Compensation and
Benefits Trust are excluded from the daily weighted-average number of common
shares outstanding in both calculations.

•

Accounting for Sales of Stock by Subsidiary or Equity
Investees

—

We recognize a
gain or loss upon the direct sale of non-preference equity by our subsidiaries
or equity investees if the sales price differs from our carrying amount, and
provided that the sale of such equity is not part of a broader corporate
reorganization.

Note
2—Common Stock Split

On April 7, 2005, our Board of Directors declared a two-for-one common
stock split effected in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend, payable June
1, 2005, to stockholders of record as of May 16, 2005. The total number of
authorized common shares and associated par value per share were unchanged by
this action. Shares and per-share information in the Consolidated Income
Statement, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Statement of
Changes in Common Stockholders’ Equity, and the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements are on an after-split basis for all periods presented.

Note 3—Changes in Accounting
Principles

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted SFAS No. 143, “Accounting
for Asset Retirement Obligations,” which applies to legal obligations
associated with the retirement and removal of long-lived assets. SFAS No. 143
requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement obligation when it is incurred (typically when the asset is
installed at the production location).

When the liability is initially recorded, the entity
capitalizes the cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related
properties, plants and equipment. Over time, the liability increases for the
change in its present value, while the capitalized cost depreciates over the
useful life of the related asset.

Application
of this new accounting principle resulted in an initial increase in net
properties, plants and equipment of $1.2 billion and an asset retirement
obligation liability increase of $1.1 billion. The cu

mulative effect of
this accounting change

increased
2003 net income by $145 million (after reduction of income taxes of
$21 million). Excluding the cumulative-effect benefit, application of the
new accounting principle increased income from continuing operations and net
income for 2003 by $32 million, or $.02 per basic and diluted share,
compared with the previous accounting method.


In March 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
FASB Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143”  (FIN 47). This Interpretation clarifies that
an entity is required to recognize a liability for a legal obligation to
perform asset retirement activities when the retirement is conditional on a
future event and if the liability’s fair value can be reasonably estimated. We
implemented FIN 47 effective December 31, 2005. Accordingly, there was no
impact on income from continuing operations in 2005. Application of FIN 47
increased net properties, plants and equipment by $269 million, and increased
asset retirement obligation liabilities by $417 million. The cumulative effect
of this accounting change decreased 2005 net income by $88 million (after reduction
of income taxes of $60 million).

We have numerous asset removal obligations that we are
required to perform under law or contract once an asset is permanently taken
out of service. Most of these obligations are not expected to be paid until
several years, or decades, in the future and will be funded from general
company resources at the time of removal. Our largest individual obligations
involve removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the
world, oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska, and asbestos
abatement at refineries.

SFAS No. 143 calls for measurements of asset
retirement obligations to include, as a component of expected costs, an
estimate of the price that a third party would demand, and could expect to receive,
for bearing the uncertainties and unforeseeable circumstances inherent in the
obligations, sometimes referred to as a market-risk premium. To date, the oil
and gas industry has no examples of credit-worthy third parties who are willing
to assume this type of risk, for a determinable price, on major oil and gas
production facilities and pipelines. Therefore, because determining such a
market-risk premium would be an arbitrary process, we excluded it from our SFAS
No. 143 and FIN 47 estimates.

During 2005 and 2004, our overall asset retirement
obligation changed as follows:


The following table presents the estimated pro forma
effects of the retroactive application of the adoption of FIN 47 as if the
interpretation had been adopted on the dates the obligations arose:

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

During 2003, the FASB issued and then revised Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities” (FIN 46(R)), to expand existing accounting
guidance about when a company should include in its consolidated financial
statements the assets, liabilities and activities of another entity. Effective
January 1, 2003, we adopted FIN 46(R) and we consolidate all variable
interest entities (VIEs) where we conclude we are the primary beneficiary. In
addition, we deconsolidated one entity in 2003, where we determined that we
were not the primary beneficiary.

In 2004, we finalized a transaction with Freeport LNG Development, L.P.
(Freeport LNG) to participate in a liquefied natural gas (LNG) receiving
terminal in Quintana, Texas. We have no ownership in Freeport LNG; however, we
obtained a 50 percent interest in Freeport LNG GP, Inc., which serves as the
general partner managing the venture. We entered into a credit agreement with
Freeport LNG, whereby we will provide loan financing of approximately $630
million for the construction of the terminal. Through December 31, 2005, we had
provided $212 million in financing, including accrued interest. We determined
that Freeport LNG was a VIE, and that we were not the primary beneficiary. We
account for our loan to Freeport LNG as a financial asset.

In June 2005, ConocoPhillips and OAO LUKOIL (LUKOIL) created the OOO
Naryanmarneftegaz (NMNG) joint venture to develop resources in the
Timan-Pechora region of Russia. We determined that NMNG was a VIE because we
and our related party, LUKOIL, have disproportionate interests. We have a 30
percent ownership interest with a 50 percent governance interest in the joint
venture. We determined we were not the primary beneficiary and we use the equity
method of accounting for this investment. Our funding for a 30 percent
ownership interest amounted to $512 million. This acquisition price was based
on preliminary estimates of capital expenditures and working capital. Purchase
price adjustments are expected to be finalized in the first quarter of 2006. At
December 31, 2005, the book value of our investment in the venture was $630
million.

Production from the NMNG joint-venture fields is transported via
pipeline to LUKOIL’s existing terminal at Varandey Bay on the Barents Sea and
then shipped via tanker to international markets. LUKOIL intends to complete an
expansion of the terminal’s capacity in late 2007, with ConocoPhillips
participating in the design and financing of the expansion. We determined that
the terminal entity, Varandey Terminal Company, is a VIE because we and our
related party, LUKOIL, have disproportionate interests. We have an obligation
to fund, through loans, 30 percent of the terminal’s costs, but we will have no
governance or ownership interest in the terminal. We determined that we were
not the primary beneficiary and account


for our loan to Varandey Terminal Company as a financial asset. Through
December 31, 2005, we had provided $61 million in loan financing.

In
2003, we entered into two 20-year agreements establishing separate guarantee
facilities of $50 million each for two LNG ships that were then under
construction. Subject to the terms of the facilities, we will be required to
make payments should the charter revenue generated by the respective ships fall
below a certain specified minimum threshold, and we will receive payments to
the extent that such revenues exceed those thresholds. Actual gross payments
over the 20 years could exceed $100 million to the extent cash is received
by us. In September 2003, the first ship was delivered to its owner and in July
2005, the second ship was delivered to its owner. We determined that both of
our agreements represented a VIE, but we were not the primary beneficiary and,
therefore, did not consolidate these entities. The amount drawn under the
guarantee facilities at December 31, 2005, was less than $5 million for
both ships. We currently account for these agreements as guarantees and
contingent liabilities. See Note 14—Guarantees for additional information.

The adoption of FIN 46(R) resulted in the following:

Consolidated VIEs

•

We consolidated
certain VIEs from which we lease certain ocean vessels, airplanes, refining
assets, marketing sites and office buildings. The consolidation increased net
properties, plants and equipment by $940 million and increased assets of
discontinued operations held for sale by $726 million (both are collateral
for the debt obligations); increased cash by $225 million; increased debt
by $2.4 billion; increased minority interest by $90 million; reduced
other accruals by $263 million, and resulted in a cumulative after-tax
effect-of-adoption loss that decreased net income and common stockholders’
equity by $240 million. However, during 2003, we exercised our option to
purchase most of these assets and as a result, the leasing arrangements and our
involvement with all but one of the associated VIEs were terminated. At
December 31, 2005, we continue to lease refining assets totaling
$116 million, which are collateral for the debt obligations of
$111 million from a VIE. Other than the obligation to make lease payments
and residual value guarantees, the creditors of the VIE have no recourse to our
general credit. In addition, we discontinued hedge accounting for an interest
rate swap because it had been designated as a cash flow hedge of the variable
interest rate component of a lease with a VIE that is now consolidated. At
December 31, 2005, the fair market value of the swap was a liability of
$2 million.

•

Ashford Energy
Capital S.A. continues to be consolidated in our financial statements under the
provisions of FIN 46(R) because we are the primary beneficiary. In December
2001, in order to raise funds for general corporate purposes, Conoco and Cold
Spring Finance S.a.r.l. (Cold Spring) formed Ashford Energy Capital S.A.
through the contribution of a $1 billion Conoco subsidiary promissory note
and $500 million cash. Through its initial $500 million investment, Cold
Spring is entitled to a cumulative annual preferred return, based on
three-month LIBOR rates, plus 1.32 percent. The preferred return at
December 31, 2005, was 5.37 percent. In 2008, and each 10-year
anniversary thereafter, Cold Spring may elect to remarket their investment in
Ashford, and if unsuccessful, could require ConocoPhillips to provide a letter
of credit in support of Cold Spring’s investment, or in the event that such
letter of credit is not provided, then cause the redemption of their investment
in Ashford. Should ConocoPhillips’ credit rating fall below investment grade,
Ashford would require a letter of credit to support $475 million of the
term loans, as of December 31, 2005, made by Ashford to other
ConocoPhillips subsidiaries. If the letter of credit is not obtained within 60
days, Cold Spring could cause Ashford to sell the ConocoPhillips subsidiary
notes. At December 31, 2005, Ashford held $1.8 billion of ConocoPhillips
subsidiary notes and $28 million in investments unrelated to ConocoPhillips.
We report Cold Spring’s investment as a minority interest because it is not
mandatorily redeemable


and the entity does not have a specified liquidation
date. Other than the obligation to make payment on the subsidiary notes
described above, Cold Spring does not have recourse to our general credit.

Unconsolidated
VIEs

•

Phillips 66
Capital II (Trust) was deconsolidated under the provisions of FIN 46(R) because
ConocoPhillips is not the primary beneficiary. During 1997, in order to raise
funds for general corporate purposes, we formed the Trust (a statutory business
trust), in which we own all common beneficial interests. The Trust was created
for the sole purpose of issuing mandatorily redeemable preferred securities to
third-party investors and investing the proceeds thereof in an approximate
equivalent amount of subordinated debt securities of ConocoPhillips. Application
of FIN 46(R) required deconsolidation of the Trust, which increased debt in
2003 by $361 million because the 8% Junior Subordinated Deferrable
Interest Debentures due 2037 were no longer eliminated in consolidation, and
the $350 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities were
deconsolidated.

In
2003, we recorded a charge of $240 million (after an income tax benefit of
$145 million) for the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 46(R). The
effect of adopting FIN 46(R) increased 2003 income from continuing operations
by $34 million, or $.02 per basic and diluted share. Excluding the
cumulative effect, the adoption of FIN 46(R) increased net income by
$139 million, or $.10 per basic and diluted share in 2003.

Stock-Based Compensation

Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted the
fair-value accounting method provided for under SFAS No. 123, “Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation.”  We used
the prospective transition method provided under SFAS 123, applying the
fair-value accounting method and recognizing compensation expense for all stock
options granted or modified after December 31, 2002. See
Note 1—Accounting Policies and Note 20—Employee Benefit Plans for
additional information.

Other

In June 2005, the FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 04-5, “Determining
Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a
Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain
Rights” (Issue No. 04-5). Issue No. 04-5 adopts a framework for evaluating
whether the general partner (or general partners as a group) controls the
partnership. The framework makes it more likely that a single general partner
(or a general partner within a general partner group) would have to consolidate
the limited partnership regardless of its ownership in the limited partnership.
The new guidance was effective upon ratification for all newly formed limited
partnerships and for existing limited partnership agreements that are modified.
The adoption of this portion of the EITF guidance had no impact on our
financial statements. The guidance is effective January 1, 2006, for existing
limited partnership agreements that have not been modified. This guidance will
not require any new consolidations by us for existing limited partnerships or
similar activities.

In April 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
(FSP) FAS 19-1, “Accounting for Suspended Well Costs” (FSP FAS 19-1), with
application required in the first reporting period beginning after April 4,
2005. Under early application provisions, we adopted FSP FAS 19-1 effective
January 1, 2005. The adoption of this Standard did not impact 2005 net income. See
Note 8—Properties, Plants and Equipment for additional information.


In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, “Exchange
of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29.”  This amendment eliminates the APB Opinion
No. 29 exception for fair value recognition of nonmonetary exchanges of
similar productive assets and replaces it with an exception for exchanges of
nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. We adopted this
guidance on a prospective basis effective July 1, 2005. There was no impact to
our financial statements upon adoption.

In December 2004, the FASB issued FSP FAS 109-1, “Application
of FASB Statement No. 109, ‘Accounting for Income Taxes,’ to the Tax Deduction
on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of
2004,” and FSP No. 109-2, “Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign
Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.”  See Note 21—Income Taxes, for additional
information.

In April 2004, the FASB issued FSPs FAS 141-1 and FAS 142-1, which
amended SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations,” and SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets,” respectively, to remove mineral rights as an example
of an intangible asset. In September 2004, the FASB issued FSP FAS 142-2, which
confirmed that the scope exception in paragraph 8(b) of SFAS No. 142 extends to
the disclosure provision for oil- and gas-producing entities.

In March 2004,
the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 03-6, “Participating Securities and
the Two-Class Method under FASB Statement No. 128, Earnings per Share,” that
explained how to determine whether a security should be considered a “participating
security” and how earnings should be allocated to a participating security when
using the two-class method for computing basic earnings per share. The adoption
of this Standard in the second quarter of 2004 did not have a material effect
on our earnings per share calculations for the periods presented in this
report.

In January 2004
and May 2004, the FASB issued FSPs FAS 106-1 and FAS 106-2, respectively,
regarding accounting and disclosure requirements related to the Medicare
Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. See Note
20—Employee Benefit Plans, for additional information.

In December 2003, the FASB revised and reissued SFAS
No. 132 (revised 2003), “Employer’s Disclosures about Pensions and Other
Postretirement Benefits—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88 and
106.”  While requiring certain new
disclosures, the new Statement does not change the measurement or recognition
of employee benefit plans. We adopted the provisions of this Standard effective
December 2003, except for certain provisions regarding disclosure of
information about estimated future benefit payments that were adopted effective
December 2004.

Effective January 1, 2003, we adopted SFAS No. 145, “Rescission of
FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and
Technical Corrections.”  The adoption of
SFAS No. 145 requires that gains and losses on extinguishments of debt no
longer be presented as extraordinary items in the income statement.

Note 4—Discontinued Operations

During 2003, 2004 and 2005, we disposed of certain U.S. retail and
wholesale marketing assets, certain U.S. refining and related assets, and
certain U.S. midstream natural gas gathering and processing assets. For
reporting purposes, these operations were classified as discontinued
operations, and in Note 26—Segment Disclosures and Related Information,
these operations were included in Corporate and Other.


During 2003 we sold:

•

Our Woods Cross
business unit, which included the Woods Cross, Utah, refinery; the Utah, Idaho,
Montana, and Wyoming Phillips-branded motor fuel marketing operations (both
retail and wholesale) and associated assets; and a refined products terminal in
Spokane, Washington.

•

Certain midstream
natural gas gathering and processing assets in southeast New Mexico, and
certain midstream natural gas gathering assets in West Texas.

•

Our Commerce
City, Colorado, refinery, and related crude oil pipelines, and our Colorado
Phillips-branded motor fuel marketing operations (both retail and wholesale).

•

Our
Exxon-branded marketing assets in New York and New England, including contracts
with independent dealers and marketers. Approximately 230 sites were included
in this package.

•

The
Circle K Corporation and its subsidiaries. The transaction included about
1,660 retail marketing outlets in 16 states and the Circle K brand, as
well as the assignment of the franchise relationship with more than 350
franchised and licensed stores.

Based on disposals completed and signed agreements as of
December 31, 2003, we recognized a net charge in 2003 of approximately
$96 million before-tax.

During 2004, we sold our Mobil-branded marketing assets on the East
Coast in two separate transactions. Assets in these packages included
approximately 100 company-owned and operated sites, and contracts with
independent dealers and marketers covering an additional 350 sites. As a result
of these and other transactions during 2004, we recorded a net before-tax gain
on asset sales of $178 million in 2004. We also recorded additional
impairments in 2004 totaling $96 million before-tax.

During 2005, we sold the majority of the remaining assets that had been
classified as discontinued and reclassified the remaining immaterial assets
back into continuing operations.

Sales and other operating revenues and income (loss) from discontinued
operations were as follows:

Assets of discontinued operations at December 31, 2004, were primarily
properties, plants and equipment, while liabilities were primarily deferred
taxes.


Note 5—Subsidiary Equity Transactions

ConocoPhillips, through various affiliates, and its unaffiliated
co-venturers received final approvals from authorities in June 2003 to proceed
with the natural gas development phase of the Bayu-Undan project in the Timor
Sea. The natural gas development phase of the project includes a pipeline from
the offshore Bayu-Undan field to Darwin, Australia, and a liquefied natural gas
facility, also located in Darwin. The pipeline portion of the project is owned
and operated by an unincorporated joint venture, while the liquefied natural
gas facility is owned and operated by Darwin LNG Pty Ltd (DLNG). Both of these
entities are consolidated subsidiaries of ConocoPhillips.

In June 2003, as part of a broad Bayu-Undan ownership interest
re-alignment with co-venturers, these entities issued equity and sold interests
to the co-venturers (as described below), which resulted in a gain of
$28 million before-tax, $25 million after-tax, in 2003. This non-operating
gain is shown in the consolidated statement of income in the line item entitled
gain on subsidiary equity transactions.

DLNG—

DLNG issued
118.9 million shares of stock, valued at 1 Australian dollar per share, to
co-venturers for 118.9 million Australian dollars ($76.2 million U.S.
dollars), reducing our ownership interest in DLNG from 100 percent to 56.72
percent. The transaction resulted in a before-tax gain of $21 million in the
consolidated financial statements. Deferred income taxes were not recognized
because this was an issuance of common stock and therefore not taxable.

Unincorporated Pipeline Joint Venture—

The
co-venturers purchased pro-rata interests in the pipeline assets held by
ConocoPhillips Pipeline Australia Pty Ltd for $26.6 million U.S. dollars and
contributed the purchased assets to the unincorporated joint venture, reducing
our ownership interest from 100 percent to 56.72 percent. The transaction
resulted in a before-tax gain of $7 million. A deferred tax liability of
$1.3 million was recorded in connection with the transaction.

Note 6—Inventories

Inventories at December 31 were:

Inventories valued on a LIFO basis totaled $3,019 million and
$2,988 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The
remainder of our inventories is valued under various methods, including FIFO
and weighted average. The excess of current replacement cost over LIFO cost of
inventories amounted to $4,271 million and $2,220 million at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

During 2005, certain inventory quantity reductions caused a liquidation
of LIFO inventory values. This liquidation increased net income by
$16 million, of which $15 million was attributable to our R&M
segment. In 2004, a liquidation of LIFO inventory values increased income from
continuing operations by $62 million, of which $54 million was
attributable to our R&M segment.


Note
7—Investments and Long-Term Receivables

Components of
investments and long-term receivables at December 31 were:

Equity
Investments

Significant
affiliated companies for which we use the equity method of accounting include:

•

LUKOIL—16.1 percent
ownership interest at December 31, 2005 (10.0 percent at year-end
2004).  We use the equity method of
accounting because we concluded that the facts and circumstances surrounding
our ownership interest indicate that we have an ability to exercise significant
influence over its operating and financial policies.  LUKOIL explores for and produces crude oil,
natural gas, and natural gas liquids; refines, markets and transports crude oil
and petroleum products; and is headquartered in Russia.

•

Duke
Energy Field Services, LLC (DEFS)—50 percent ownership interest at
December 31, 2005 (30.3 percent at year-end 2004)—owns and operates
gas plants, gathering systems, storage facilities and fractionation plants.

•

Chevron
Phillips Chemical Co. LLC (CPChem)—50 percent ownership
interest—manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics.

•

Hamaca
Holding LLC—57.1 percent non-controlling ownership interest accounted for
under the equity method because the minority shareholders have substantive
participating rights, under which all substantive operating decisions (e.g.,
annual budgets, major financings, selection of senior operating management,
etc.) require joint approvals.  Hamaca
produces heavy oil and in fourth quarter 2004 began producing on-specification
medium-grade crude oil for export.

•

Petrozuata
C.A.—50.1 percent non-controlling ownership interest accounted for under
the equity method because the minority shareholders have substantive
participating rights, under which all substantive operating decisions (e.g.,
annual budgets, major financings, selection of senior operating management, etc.)
require joint approvals.  Petrozuata
produces extra heavy crude oil and upgrades it into medium grade crude oil at
Jose on the northern coast of Venezuela.

•

OOO
Naryanmarneftegaz (NMNG)—30 percent economic interest and a
50 percent voting interest—a joint venture with LUKOIL to explore for and
develop oil and gas resources in the northern part of Russia’s Timan-Pechora
province.

•

Malaysian
Refining Company (MRC)—47 percent ownership interest—refines crude oil and
sells petroleum products.

•

Merey
Sweeny L.P. (MSLP)—50 percent ownership interest—processes long resid from
heavy crude oil into intermediate products for the Sweeny, Texas, refinery.


Summarized
100 percent financial information for equity-basis investments in
affiliated companies, combined, was as follows (information included for LUKOIL
is based on estimates):

Our share of income taxes incurred directly by the equity companies is
reported in equity in earnings of affiliates, and as such is not included in
income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.

At December 31,
2005, retained earnings included $3,376 million related to the
undistributed earnings of affiliated companies, and distributions received from
affiliates were $1,807 million, $1,035 million and $496 million
in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

LUKOIL

LUKOIL is an international, integrated energy company headquartered in
Russia, with worldwide petroleum exploration and production, and petroleum
refining, marketing, supply and transportation. 
In 2004, we made a joint announcement with LUKOIL of an agreement to
form a broad-based strategic alliance, whereby we would become a strategic
equity investor in LUKOIL.

We were the successful bidder in an auction of 7.6 percent of
LUKOIL’s authorized and issued ordinary shares held by the Russian government
for a price of $1,988 million, or $30.76 per share, excluding
transaction costs.  The transaction
closed on October 7, 2004.  We
increased our ownership in LUKOIL to 16.1 percent by the end of 2005.  During the January 24, 2005,
extraordinary general meeting of LUKOIL shareholders, all charter amendments
reflected in the Shareholder Agreement were passed and ConocoPhillips’ nominee
was elected to LUKOIL’s Board.  The
Shareholder Agreement allows us to increase our ownership interest in LUKOIL to
20 percent and limits our ability to sell our LUKOIL shares for a period
of four years, except in certain circumstances.

Our equity share of the results of LUKOIL for the current year period
has been estimated because LUKOIL’s accounting cycle close and preparation of
U.S. GAAP financial statements occurs subsequent to our accounting cycle
close.  This estimate is based on market
indicators and historical production trends of LUKOIL, and other factors.  Any difference between our estimate of
fourth-quarter 2005 and the actual LUKOIL U.S. GAAP net income will be reported
in our 2006 equity earnings.  At
December 31, 2005, the book value of our ordinary share investment in
LUKOIL was $5,549 million.  Our
16.1 percent share of the net assets of LUKOIL was estimated to be
$4,174 million.  This basis
difference of $1,375 million is primarily being amortized on a
unit-of-production basis.  Included in
net income for 2005 and 2004 was after-tax expense of $43 million and
$14 million, respectively, representing the amortization of this basis
difference.


On December 31, 2005, the closing price of LUKOIL shares on the
London Stock Exchange was $59 per share, making the aggregate total market
value of our LUKOIL investment $8,069 million.

Duke Energy Field Services, LLC

DEFS owns and operates gas plants,
gathering systems, storage facilities and fractionation plants.

In July 2005, ConocoPhillips and Duke
Energy Corporation (Duke) restructured their respective ownership levels in
DEFS, which resulted in DEFS becoming a jointly controlled venture, owned
50 percent by each company.  This
restructuring increased our ownership in DEFS to 50 percent from
30.3 percent through a series of direct and indirect transfers of certain
Canadian Midstream assets from DEFS to Duke, a disproportionate cash
distribution from DEFS to Duke from the sale of DEFS’ interest in TEPPCO
Partners, L.P., and a combined payment by ConocoPhillips to Duke and DEFS of
approximately $840 million.  Our
interest in the Empress plant in Canada was not included in the initial
transaction as originally anticipated due to weather-related damage to the
facility.  Subsequently, the Empress
plant was sold to Duke on August 1, 2005, for approximately $230 million.

In the first quarter of 2005, as a part of equity earnings, we recorded
our $306 million (after-tax) equity share of the financial gain from DEFS’
sale of its interest in TEPPCO.

At December 31, 2005, the
book value of our common investment in DEFS was $1,274 million.  Our 50 percent share of the net assets
of DEFS was $1,253 million.  This
basis difference of $21 million is being amortized on a straight-line
basis through 2014 consistent with the remaining estimated useful lives of DEFS’
properties, plants and equipment. 
Included in net income for 2005, 2004 and 2003 was after-tax income of
$17 million, $36 million and $36 million, respectively, representing the
amortization of the basis difference.

DEFS markets a
portion of its natural gas liquids to us and CPChem under a supply agreement
that continues until December 31, 2014. 
This purchase commitment is on an “if-produced, will-purchase” basis so
it has no fixed production schedule, but has been, and is expected to be, a
relatively stable purchase pattern over the term of the contract.  Natural gas liquids are purchased under this
agreement at various published market index prices, less transportation and
fractionation fees.

Chevron
Phillips Chemical Company LLC

CPChem
manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics.  At December 31, 2005, the book value of our
investment in CPChem was $2,158 million. 
Our 50 percent share of the total net assets of CPChem was
$2,015 million.  This basis
difference of $143 million is being amortized through 2020, consistent
with the remaining estimated useful lives of CPChem properties, plants and
equipment.

During 2005, we
received one distribution from CPChem totaling $37.5 million that redeemed
the remainder of our member preferred interests.

We have multiple supply and purchase agreements in place with CPChem,
ranging in initial terms from one to 99 years, with extension
options.  These agreements cover sales
and purchases of refined products, solvents, and petrochemical and natural gas
liquids feedstocks, as well as fuel oils and gases.  Delivery quantities vary by product, and are
generally on an “if-produced, will-purchase” basis.  All products are purchased and sold under
specified pricing formulas based on various published pricing indices,
consistent with terms extended to third-party customers.

Loans to Affiliated Companies

As part of our normal ongoing business operations and consistent with
normal industry practice, we invest and enter into numerous agreements with
other parties to pursue business opportunities, which share costs and apportion
risks among the parties as governed by the agreements.  Included in such activity are loans made to
certain affiliated companies. 
Significant loans to affiliated companies include the following:


•

We
entered into a credit agreement with Freeport LNG, whereby we will provide loan
financing of approximately $630 million for the construction of an LNG
facility.  Through December 31, 2005, we
had provided $212 million in loan financing, including accrued interest.  See Note 3—Changes in Accounting
Principles, for additional information.

•

We
have an obligation to provide loan financing to Varandey Terminal Company for
30 percent of the costs of a terminal expansion.  Based on preliminary budget estimates from
the operator, we expect our total loan obligation for the terminal expansion to
be approximately $330 million.  This
amount will be adjusted as the design is finalized and the expansion project
proceeds.  Through December 31, 2005, we
had provided $61 million in loan financing.  See Note 3—Changes in Accounting Principles,
for additional information.

•

Qatargas
3 is an integrated project to produce and liquefy natural gas from Qatar’s
North field.  We own a 30 percent
interest in the project.  The other participants
in the project are affiliates of Qatar Petroleum (68.5 percent) and Mitsui
& Co., Ltd. (Mitsui) (1.5 percent). 
Our interest is held through a jointly owned company, Qatar Liquefied
Gas Company Limited (3), for which we use the equity method of accounting.  Qatargas 3 secured project financing of
$4 billion in December 2005, consisting of $1.3 billion of loans from
export credit agencies (ECA), $1.5 billion from commercial banks, and $1.2
billion from ConocoPhillips.  The
ConocoPhillips loan facilities have substantially the same terms as the ECA and
commercial bank facilities.  Prior to
project completion certification, all loans, including the ConocoPhillips loan
facilities, are guaranteed by the participants based on their respective
ownership interests.  Accordingly, our
maximum exposure to this financing structure is $1.2 billion.  Upon completion certification, which is
expected to be December 31, 2009, all project loan facilities, including
the ConocoPhillips loan facilities, will become non-recourse to the project
participants.   At December 31,
2005, Qatargas 3 had $120 million outstanding under all the loan
facilities, $36 million of which was loaned by ConocoPhillips.

Note
8—Properties, Plants and Equipment

Properties, plants
and equipment (PP&E) are recorded at cost. 
Within the E&P segment, depreciation is on a unit-of-production
basis, so depreciable life will vary by field. 
In the R&M segment, investments in refining assets and lubes
basestock manufacturing facilities are generally depreciated on a straight-line
basis over a 25-year life, pipeline assets over a 45-year life, and service
station buildings and fixed improvements over a 30-year life.  The company’s investment in PP&E, with
accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization (Accum. DD&A), at
December 31 was:


Suspended Wells

In April 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 19-1, “Accounting
for Suspended Well Costs” (FSP FAS 19-1). This FSP was issued to address
whether there were circumstances that would permit the continued capitalization
of exploratory well costs beyond one year, other than when further exploratory
drilling is planned and major capital expenditures would be required to develop
the project.

FSP FAS 19-1 requires the continued capitalization
of suspended well costs if the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves
to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making
sufficient progress assessing these reserves and the economic and operating
viability of the project.  All relevant
facts and circumstances should be evaluated in determining whether a company is
making sufficient progress assessing the reserves, and FSP FAS 19-1 provides
several indicators to assist in this evaluation.  FSP FAS 19-1 prohibits continued
capitalization of suspended well costs on the chance that market conditions
will change or technology will be developed to make the project economic.  We adopted FSP FAS 19-1 effective January 1,
2005.  There was no impact on our
consolidated financial statements from the adoption.

The following table reflects the net changes in
suspended exploratory well costs during 2005, 2004 and 2003:

The following table provides an aging of suspended
well balances at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003:


The following table provides a further aging of those exploratory well
costs that have been capitalized for more than one year since the completion of
drilling as of December 31, 2005:

(1)

Development decisions pending infrastructure
west of Alpine and construction authorization.

(2)

Additional appraisal wells planned.

(3)

Appraisal drilling complete; costs being
incurred to assess development.

Note
9—Goodwill and Intangibles

Changes in the
carrying amount of goodwill are as follows:

On December 28,
2005, we signed an agreement with the Libyan National Oil Corporation under
which we and our co-venturers acquired an ownership interest in the Waha
concessions in Libya.  On
December 29, 2005, the Libyan government approved the signed agreement
which, in the opinion of our legal counsel, made the rights and obligations
under the contract legally binding and unconditional at that date among all
four parties involved.  The terms
included a payment to the Libyan National Oil Corporation of $520 million
(net to ConocoPhillips) for the acquisition of an ownership in, and extension
of, the concessions; and a contribution to unamortized investments made since
1986 of $212 million (net to ConocoPhillips) that were agreed to be paid
as part of the 1986 standstill agreement to hold the assets in escrow for the
U.S.-based co-venturers.  The
$732 million of total unconditional payment obligations were recognized as
current liabilities in the “Other Accruals” line of the consolidated balance
sheet.  The recognition of assets acquired
in the business combination was a preliminary allocation of the
$732 million to properties, plants and equipment.  This transaction also resulted in the
recording of $477 million of goodwill, which relates to net deferred tax
liabilities arising from differences between the allocated financial


bases and
deductible tax bases of the acquired assets. 
This goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

Information on the
carrying value of intangible assets follows:

*

During 2005, U.S. regulatory
  actions resulted in the determination that certain U.S. refinery air emission
  credits totaling $32 million, which were previously classified as indefinite-lived,
  now have a finite useful life. At the time of that determination, and in
  accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,”
  amortization began on these intangible assets prospectively over their
  estimated remaining useful life.

**

Primarily related to seismic
  technology, land rights, supply and processing contracts and licenses.

***

Primarily pension related.

Amortization
expense related to the intangible assets above for the years ended December 31,
2005 and 2004, was $21 million and $18 million, respectively.  The estimated amortization expense for the
next five years is approximately $20 million per year.

In 2004, we
reduced the carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets related to
refinery air emission credits.  This
impairment totaled $41 million before-tax, $26 million after-tax, and
was recorded in the property impairments line of the consolidated income
statement.  The impairment was related to
the reduced market value of certain air credits.  We also impaired an intangible asset related
to a marketing brand name.  These
intangible assets are included in the R&M segment.


Note 10—Property
Impairments

During 2005, 2004
and 2003, we recognized the following before-tax impairment charges:

The E&P
segment’s impairments were the result of the write-down to market value of
properties planned for disposition, properties failing to meet recoverability
tests, and, in 2003, international tax law changes affecting asset removal
costs.  The Midstream segment recognized
property impairments related to planned asset dispositions.  In R&M, we reduced the carrying value of
certain indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2004.  See Note 9—Goodwill and Intangibles, for
additional information.  Other
impairments in R&M primarily were related to assets planned for
disposition.

See Note 4—Discontinued Operations, for information regarding property
impairments included in discontinued operations.


Note
11—Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs

Asset retirement
obligations and accrued environmental costs at December 31 were:

Asset
Retirement Obligations

For information on
our adoption of SFAS No. 143 and FIN 47, and related disclosures, see
Note 3—Changes in Accounting Principles.

Accrued Environmental Costs

Total environmental accruals at December 31, 2005 and 2004, were
$989 million and $1,061 million, respectively.  The 2005 decrease in total accrued
environmental costs is due primarily to payments on accrued environmental
costs, partially offset by new accruals and accretion.

We had accrued environmental costs of $570 million and
$606 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, primarily
related to cleanup at domestic refineries and underground storage tanks at U.S.
service stations, and remediation activities required by the state of Alaska at
exploration and production sites.  We had
also accrued in Corporate and Other $302 million and $337 million of
environmental costs associated with non-operating sites at December 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively.  In
addition, $117 million and $118 million were included at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, where the company has been named
a potentially responsible party under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or similar state laws.  Accrued environmental liabilities will be
paid over periods extending up to 30 years.

Because a large
portion of our accrued environmental costs were acquired in various business
combinations, they are discounted obligations. 
Expected expenditures for acquired environmental obligations are
discounted using a weighted-average 5 percent discount factor, resulting
in an accrued balance for acquired environmental liabilities of
$805 million at December 31, 2005. 
The expected future undiscounted payments related to the portion of the
accrued environmental costs that have been discounted are: $149 million in
2006, $102 million in 2007, $65 million in 2008, $60 million in
2009, $61 million in 2010, and $476 million for all future years
after 2010.


Note
12—Debt

Long-term debt at
December 31 was:

Maturities
inclusive of net unamortized premiums and discounts in 2006 through 2010 are:
$1,758 million (included in current liabilities), $199 million,
$77 million, $331 million and $1,346 million, respectively.

Effective October 5, 2005, we entered into two new revolving credit
facilities totaling $5 billion to replace our previously existing $2.5 billion
four-year facility expiring in October 2008 and a $2.5 billion five-year
facility expiring in October 2009.  The
two new

revolving credit facilities expire in October 2010.  The


facilities

are
available for use as direct bank borrowings or as support for the
ConocoPhillips $5 billion commercial paper program, the ConocoPhillips Qatar
Funding Ltd. $1.5 billion commercial paper program, and could be used to
support issuances of letters of credit totaling up to $750 million.  The facilities are broadly syndicated among
financial institutions and do not contain any material adverse change
provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios
or ratings.  The credit agreements do
contain a cross-default provision relating to our, or any of our consolidated
subsidiaries’, failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations
of $200 million or more.  There were no
outstanding borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2005, but
$62 million in letters of credit had been issued.

Credit facility
borrowings may bear interest at a margin above rates offered by certain
designated banks in the London interbank market or at a margin above the
overnight federal funds rate or prime rates offered by certain designated banks
in the United States.  The agreements
call for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts.  The agreements also contain early termination
rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a
majority of the Board of Directors.

During 2005, we reduced the commercial paper balance outstanding under
the ConocoPhillips program from $544 million at December 31, 2004, to a
zero balance at December 31, 2005.  In
December 2005, ConocoPhillips Qatar Funding Ltd. initiated a $1.5 billion
commercial paper program to be used to fund our commitments relating to the
Qatargas 3 project.  At December 31,
2005, commercial paper outstanding under this program totaled
$32 million.  Also in 2005, we
redeemed our $750 million 6.35% Notes due 2009, at a premium of
$42 million plus accrued interest; our $400 million 3.625% Notes due 2007,
at par plus accrued interest; and we purchased, at market prices, and retired
$752 million of various ConocoPhillips bond issues.  In conjunction with the redemption of the
6.35% Notes and the 3.625% Notes, $750 million and $400 million, respectively,
of interest rate swaps were cancelled. 
The note redemptions, interest rate swap cancellations, and bond issue
purchases resulted in after-tax losses of $92 million.

At December 31, 2005, $229 million was outstanding under the
ConocoPhillips Savings Plan term loan, which requires repayment in semi-annual
installments beginning in 2010 and continuing through 2015.  Under this loan, any participating bank in
the syndicate of lenders may cease to participate on December 4, 2009, by
giving not less than 180 days’ prior notice to the ConocoPhillips Savings Plan
and the company.  Each bank participating
in the ConocoPhillips Savings Plan loan has the optional right, if our current
directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board, and
upon not less than 90 days’ notice, to cease to participate in the loan.  Under the above conditions, we are required
to purchase such bank’s rights and obligations under the loan agreement if they
are not transferred to another bank of our choice.  See Note 20—Employee Benefit Plans, for
additional discussion of the ConocoPhillips Savings Plan.

Note
13—Sales of Receivables

At December 31, 2004, certain credit card and trade
receivables had been sold to a Qualifying Special Purpose Entity (QSPE) in a
revolving-period securitization arrangement. 
The arrangement provided for ConocoPhillips to sell, and the QSPE to
purchase, certain receivables and for the QSPE to then issue beneficial
interests of up to $1.2 billion to five bank-sponsored entities.  At December 31, 2004, the QSPE had
issued beneficial interests to the bank-sponsored entities of
$480 million.  All five bank-sponsored
entities are multi-seller conduits with access to the commercial paper market
and purchase interests in similar receivables from numerous other companies
unrelated to us.  We have held no
ownership interests, nor any variable interests, in any of the bank-sponsored
entities, which we have not consolidated.


Furthermore, except as discussed below, we have not
consolidated the QSPE because it has met the requirements of SFAS No. 140,
“Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments
of Liabilities,” to be excluded from the consolidated financial statements of
ConocoPhillips.  The receivables
transferred to the QSPE have met the isolation and other requirements of SFAS No. 140
to be accounted for as sales and have been accounted for accordingly.

By January 31, 2005, all of the beneficial interests held by the
bank-sponsored entities had matured; therefore, in accordance with SFAS No.
140, the operating results and cash flows of the QSPE subsequent to this
maturity have been consolidated in our financial statements.  The revolving-period securitization
arrangement was terminated on August 31, 2005, and, at this time, we have no
plans to renew the arrangement.

Total QSPE cash flows received from and paid under the securitization
arrangements were as follows:

Note
14—Guarantees

At December 31,
2005, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual
arrangements as described below.  We
recognize a liability, at inception, for the fair value of our obligation as a
guarantor for newly issued or modified guarantees.  Unless the carrying amount of the liability
is noted, we have not recognized a liability either because the guarantees were
issued prior to December 31, 2002, or because the fair value of the
obligation is immaterial.

Construction Completion Guarantees

•

At
December 31, 2005, we had a construction completion guarantee related to
our share of the debt held by Hamaca Holding LLC, which was used to construct
the joint-venture project in Venezuela. 
The maximum potential amount of future payments under the guarantee is
estimated to be $350 million.  The
original Guaranteed Project Completion Date of October 1, 2005, was further
extended because of force majeure events that occurred during the construction
period.  Subsequent to the balance sheet
date, certified construction completion was achieved on January 9, 2006, so the
guarantee was released and the debt became non-recourse to ConocoPhillips.

•

In
December 2005, we issued a construction completion guarantee for
30 percent of the $4.0 billion in loan facilities of Qatargas 3,
which will be used to construct an LNG train in Qatar. Of the $4.0 billion
in loan facilities, ConocoPhillips provided facilities of
$1.2 billion.  The maximum potential
amount of future payments to third-party lenders under the guarantee is
estimated to be $850 million, which could become payable if the full debt financing
is utilized and completion of the Qatargas 3 project is not achieved.  Completion certification is expected on
December 31, 2009.  The project
financing will be non-recourse upon certified completion.  At year-end 2005, the carrying value of the guarantee
to the third party lenders was $11 million.  For additional information, see Note
7—Investments and Long-Term Receivables.


Guarantees of Joint-Venture Debt

•

At
December 31, 2005, we had guarantees outstanding for our portion of
joint-venture debt obligations, which have terms of up to 20 years.  The maximum potential amount of future
payments under the guarantees was approximately $190 million.  Payment would be required if a joint venture
defaults on its debt obligations. 
Included in these outstanding guarantees was $96 million associated
with the Polar Lights Company joint venture in Russia.

Other Guarantees

•

The MSLP joint-venture
project agreement requires the partners in the venture to pay cash calls to
cover operating expenses in the event that the venture does not have enough
cash to cover operating expenses after setting aside the amount required for
debt service over the next 19 years. 
Although there is no maximum limit stated in the agreement, the intent
is to cover short-term cash deficiencies should they occur.  Our maximum potential future payments under
the agreement are currently estimated to be $100 million, assuming such a
shortfall exists at some point in the future due to an extended operational
disruption.

•

In
February 2003, we entered into two agreements establishing separate guarantee
facilities of $50 million each for two LNG ships.  Subject to the terms of each such facility,
we will be required to make payments should the charter revenue generated by
the respective ship fall below certain specified minimum thresholds, and we
will receive payments to the extent that such revenues exceed those
thresholds.  The net maximum future
payments that we may have to make over the 20-year terms of the two agreements
could be up to an aggregate of $100 million.  Actual gross payments over the 20 years could
exceed that amount to the extent cash is received by us.  In the event either ship is sold or a total
loss occurs, we also may have recourse to the sales or insurance proceeds to
recoup payments made under the guarantee facilities.  See Note 3—Changes in Accounting Principles,
for additional information.

•

We
have other guarantees with maximum future potential payment amounts totaling
$260 million, which consist primarily of dealer and jobber loan guarantees
to support our marketing business, a guarantee to fund the short-term cash
liquidity deficits of a lubricants joint venture, two small construction
completion guarantees, a guarantee supporting a lease assignment on a corporate
aircraft, a guarantee associated with a pending lawsuit and guarantees of the
lease payment obligations of a joint venture. 
The carrying amount recorded for these other guarantees, as of
December 31, 2005, was $22 million. 
These guarantees generally extend up to 15 years and payment would
be required only if the dealer, jobber or lessee goes into default, if the
lubricants joint venture has cash liquidity issues, if construction projects
are not completed, if guaranteed parties default on lease payments, or if an
adverse decision occurs in the lawsuit.

Indemnifications

Over the years, we have entered into various
agreements to sell ownership interests in certain corporations and joint
ventures and sold assets, including sales of downstream and midstream assets,
certain exploration and production assets, and downstream retail and wholesale
sites, giving rise to qualifying indemnifications.  Agreements associated with these sales
include indemnifications for taxes, environmental liabilities, permits and
licenses, employee claims, real estate indemnity against tenant defaults, and
litigation.  The terms of these
indemnifications vary greatly.  The
majority of these indemnifications are related to environmental issues, the
term is


generally indefinite and the maximum amount of future
payments is generally unlimited.  The
carrying amount recorded for these indemnifications as of December 31, 2005,
was $446 million. We amortize the indemnification liability over the
relevant time period, if one exists, based on the facts and circumstances
surrounding each type of indemnity.  In
cases where the indemnification term is indefinite, we will reverse the liability
when we have information that the liability is essentially relieved or amortize
the liability over an appropriate time period as the fair value of our
indemnification exposure declines. 
Although it is reasonably possible that future payments may exceed
amounts recorded, due to the nature of the indemnifications, it is not possible
to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future
payments.  Included in the carrying
amount recorded were $320 million of environmental accruals for known
contamination that is included in asset retirement obligations and accrued
environmental costs at December 31, 2005. 
For additional information about environmental liabilities, see Note
11—Asset Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs, and Note
15—Contingencies and Commitments.

Note
15—Contingencies and Commitments

In the case of all known contingencies, we accrue a
liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably
estimable.  We do not reduce these
liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries.  If applicable, we accrue receivables for
probable insurance or other third-party recoveries.

Based on currently available information, we believe
that it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability
exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material
adverse impact on our financial statements. 
As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position
both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures.  Estimates that are particularly sensitive to
future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental
remediation, tax and legal matters.  Estimated
future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such
factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and
extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of
our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties.  Estimated future costs related to tax and
legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional
information becomes available during the administrative and litigation
processes.

Environmental—

We are subject to
federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations.  These may result in obligations to remove or
mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or
release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various sites.  When we prepare our financial statements, we
record accruals for environmental liabilities based on management’s best
estimates, using all information that is available at the time.  We measure estimates and base liabilities on
currently available facts, existing technology, and presently enacted laws and
regulations, taking into consideration the likely effects of societal and
economic factors.  When measuring
environmental liabilities, we also consider our prior experience in remediation
of contaminated sites, other companies’ cleanup experience, and data released
by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or other organizations.  We consider unasserted claims in our
determination of environmental liabilities and we accrue them in the period
that they are both probable and reasonably estimable.

Although liability of those potentially responsible for environmental
remediation costs is generally joint and several for federal sites and
frequently so for state sites, we are usually only one of many companies cited
at a particular site.  Due to the joint
and several liabilities, we could be responsible for all of the cleanup costs
related to any site at which we have been designated as a potentially
responsible party.  If we were solely
responsible, the costs, in some cases, could be material to our, or one of our
segments’,  results of operations,
capital resources or liquidity.  However,
settlements and costs incurred in matters that


previously have been resolved have not been material to our results of
operations or financial condition.  We
have been successful to date in sharing cleanup costs with other financially
sound companies.  Many of the sites at
which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the EPA
or the state agencies concerned.  Prior
to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess the site
conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate
remediation.  In some instances, we may
have no liability or may attain a settlement of liability.  Where it appears that other potentially
responsible parties may be financially unable to bear their proportional share,
we consider this inability in estimating our potential liability and we adjust
our accruals accordingly.

As a result of various acquisitions in the past, we assumed certain
environmental obligations.  Some of these
environmental obligations are mitigated by indemnifications made by others for
our benefit and some of the indemnifications are subject to dollar limits and
time limits.  We have not recorded
accruals for any potential contingent liabilities that we expect to be funded
by the prior owners under these indemnifications.

We are currently participating in environmental
assessments and cleanups at numerous federal Superfund and comparable state
sites.  After an assessment of
environmental exposures for cleanup and other costs, we make accruals on an
undiscounted basis (except those acquired in a purchase business combination,
which we record on a discounted basis) for planned investigation and
remediation activities for sites where it is probable that future costs will be
incurred and these costs can be reasonably estimated.  We have not reduced these accruals for
possible insurance recoveries.  In the
future, we may be involved in additional environmental assessments, cleanups
and proceedings.  See Note 11—Asset
Retirement Obligations and Accrued Environmental Costs, for a summary of our
accrued environmental liabilities.

Legal Proceedings—

We apply our
knowledge, experience, and professional judgment to the specific
characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to
manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us.  Our process facilitates the early evaluation
and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases.  This process also enables us to track trial
settings, as well as the status and pace of settlement discussions in
individual matters.  Based on our
professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools
and available information about current developments in all our cases, we
believe that there is only a remote likelihood that future costs related to
known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount
that would have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.

Other Contingencies—

We have
contingent liabilities resulting from throughput agreements with pipeline and
processing companies not associated with financing arrangements.  Under these agreements, we may be required to
provide any such company with additional funds through advances and penalties
for fees related to throughput capacity not utilized.  In addition, we have performance obligations
that are secured by letters of credit of $749 million (of which $62
million was issued under the provisions of our revolving credit facilities, and
the remainder was issued as direct bank letters of credit) and various purchase
commitments for materials, supplies, services and items of permanent investment
incident to the ordinary conduct of business.

Long-Term Throughput Agreements and Take-or-Pay
Agreements—

We have certain throughput agreements and  take-or-pay agreements that are in support of
financing arrangements.  The agreements
typically provide for natural gas or crude oil transportation to be used in the
ordinary course of the company’s business. 
The aggregate amounts of estimated payments under these various
agreements are 2006—$109 million; 2007—$100 million;
2008—$93 million; 2009—$87 million; 2010—$80 million; and 2011
and after—$427 million.  Total 
payments under the agreements were $88 million in 2005, $96 million
in 2004 and $90 million in 2003.


Note
16—Financial Instruments and Derivative Contracts

Derivative
Instruments

We, and certain of
our subsidiaries, may use financial and commodity-based derivative contracts to
manage exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity
prices, and interest rates, or to exploit market opportunities.  Our use of derivative instruments is governed
by an “Authority Limitations” document approved by our Board of Directors that
prohibits the use of highly leveraged derivatives or derivative instruments
without sufficient liquidity for comparable valuations without approval from
the Chief Executive Officer.  The
Authority Limitations document also authorizes the Chief Executive Officer to
establish the maximum Value at Risk (VaR) limits for the company and compliance
with these limits is monitored daily. 
The Chief Financial Officer monitors risks resulting from foreign
currency exchange rates and interest rates, while the Executive Vice President
of Commercial monitors commodity price risk. 
Both report to the Chief Executive Officer.  The Commercial organization manages our
commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity flows and positions, monitors
related risks of our upstream and downstream businesses and selectively takes
price risk to add value.

SFAS No. 133, “Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended (SFAS
No. 133), requires companies to recognize all derivative instruments as
either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value.  Assets and liabilities resulting from
derivative contracts open at December 31 were:

These derivative
assets and liabilities appear as prepaid expenses and other current assets,
other assets, other accruals, or other liabilities and deferred credits on the
balance sheet.

In June 2005, we
acquired two limited-term, fixed-volume overriding royalty interests in Utah
and the San Juan Basin related to our natural gas production.  As part of the acquisition, we assumed
related commodity swaps with a negative fair value of $261 million at
June 30, 2005.  In late June and
early July, we entered into additional commodity swaps to offset essentially
all of the exposure from the assumed swaps. 
At December 31, 2005, the commodity swaps assumed in the acquisition had
a negative fair value of $316 million, and the commodity swaps entered to
offset the resulting exposure had a positive fair value of
$109 million.  These commodity swaps
contributed to the increase in derivative assets and liabilities from
December 31, 2004, to December 31, 2005, as did price movements,
particularly price increases in natural gas.

The accounting for
changes in fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument
depends on whether it meets the qualifications for, and has been designated as,
a SFAS No. 133 hedge, and the type of hedge. 
At this time, we are not using SFAS No. 133 hedge accounting for
commodity derivative contracts and foreign currency derivatives, but we are
using hedge accounting for the interest-rate derivatives noted


below.  All gains and losses, realized or unrealized,
from derivative contracts not designated as SFAS No. 133 hedges have been
recognized in the income statement. 
Gains and losses from derivative contracts held for trading not directly
related to our physical business, whether realized or unrealized, have been
reported net in other income.

SFAS No. 133 also
requires purchase and sales contracts for commodities that are readily
convertible to cash (e.g., crude oil, natural gas, and gasoline) to be recorded
on the balance sheet as derivatives unless the contracts are for quantities we
expect to use or sell over a reasonable period in the normal course of business
(the normal purchases and normal sales exception), among other requirements,
and we have documented our intent to apply this exception.  Except for contracts to buy or sell natural
gas, we generally apply this exception to eligible purchase and sales
contracts; however, we may elect not to apply this exception (e.g., when
another derivative instrument will be used to mitigate the risk of the purchase
or sale contract but hedge accounting will not be applied).  When this occurs, both the purchase or sales
contract and the derivative contract mitigating the resulting risk will be
recorded on the balance sheet at fair value in accordance with the preceding
paragraphs.  Most of our contracts to buy
or sell natural gas are recorded on the balance sheet as derivatives, except
for certain long-term contracts to sell our natural gas production, which
either have been designated normal purchase/normal sales or do not meet the
SFAS No. 133 definition of a derivative.

Interest
Rate Derivative Contracts—

During the fourth quarter of 2003, we executed interest rate swaps that
had the effect of converting $1.5 billion of debt from fixed to floating
rates, but during 2005 we terminated the majority of these interest rate swaps
as we redeemed the associated debt.  This
reduced the amount of debt being converted from fixed to floating by the end of
2005 to $350 million.  These swaps,
which we continue to hold, have qualified for and been designated as fair-value
hedges using the short-cut method of hedge accounting provided by SFAS No. 133,
which permits the assumption that changes in the value of the derivative
perfectly offset changes in the value of the debt; therefore, no gain or loss
has been recognized due to hedge ineffectiveness.

Currency
Exchange Rate Derivative Contracts—

We have foreign currency
exchange rate risk resulting from international operations.  We do not comprehensively hedge the exposure
to currency rate changes, although we may choose to selectively hedge exposures
to foreign currency rate risk.  Examples
include firm commitments for capital projects, certain local currency tax
payments and dividends, short-term intercompany loans between subsidiaries
operating in different countries, and cash returns from net investments in
foreign affiliates to be remitted within the coming year.  Hedge accounting is not currently being used
for any of our foreign currency derivatives.

Commodity
Derivative Contracts—

We
operate in the worldwide crude oil, refined product, natural gas, natural gas
liquids, and electric power markets and are exposed to fluctuations in the
prices for these commodities.  These
fluctuations can affect our revenues as well as the cost of operating,
investing, and financing activities. 
Generally, our policy is to remain exposed to the market prices of
commodities; however, executive management may elect to use derivative
instruments to hedge the price risk of our crude oil and natural gas
production, as well as refinery margins.

Our Commercial
organization uses futures, forwards, swaps, and options in various markets to
optimize the value of our supply chain, which may move our risk profile away
from market average prices to accomplish the following objectives:

•

Balance
physical systems.  In addition to cash
settlement prior to contract expiration, exchange traded futures contracts may
also be settled by physical delivery of the commodity, providing another source
of supply to meet our refinery requirements or marketing demand.


•

Meet
customer needs.  Consistent with our
policy to generally remain exposed to market prices, we use swap contracts to
convert fixed-price sales contracts, which are often requested by natural gas
and refined product consumers, to a floating market price.

•

Manage
the risk to our cash flows from price exposures on specific crude oil, natural
gas, refined product and electric power transactions.

•

Enable
us to use the market knowledge gained from these activities to do a limited
amount of trading not directly related to our physical business.  For the 12 months ended December 31, 2005,
2004 and 2003, the gains or losses from this activity were not material to our
cash flows or income from continuing operations.

At
December 31, 2005, we were not using hedge accounting for any commodity
derivative contracts.

Credit Risk

Our financial
instruments that are potentially exposed to concentrations of credit risk
consist primarily of cash equivalents, over-the-counter derivative contracts,
and trade receivables.  Our cash
equivalents are placed in high-quality commercial paper, money market funds and
time deposits with major international banks and financial institutions.  The credit risk from our over-the-counter
derivative contracts, such as forwards and swaps, derives from the counterparty
to the transaction, typically a major bank or financial institution.  We closely monitor these credit exposures
against predetermined credit limits, including the continual exposure
adjustments that result from market movements. 
Individual counterparty exposure is managed within these limits, and
includes the use of cash-call margins when appropriate, thereby reducing the risk
of significant non-performance.  We also
use futures contracts, but futures have a negligible credit risk because they
are traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange or the IntercontinentalExchange.

Our trade
receivables result primarily from our petroleum operations and reflect a broad
national and international customer base, which limits our exposure to
concentrations of credit risk.  The
majority of these receivables have payment terms of 30 days or less, and
we continually monitor this exposure and the creditworthiness of the
counterparties.  We do not generally
require collateral to limit the exposure to loss; however, we will sometimes
use letters of credit, prepayments, and master netting arrangements to mitigate
credit risk with counterparties that both buy from and sell to us, as these
agreements permit the amounts owed by us or owed to others to be offset against
amounts due us.

Fair
Values of Financial Instruments

We used the
following methods and assumptions to estimate the fair value of financial
instruments:

•

Cash
and cash equivalents: The carrying amount reported on the balance sheet
approximates fair value.

•

Accounts
and notes receivable: The carrying amount reported on the balance sheet
approximates fair value.

•

Investments
in LUKOIL shares: See Note 7—Investments and Long-Term Receivables, for a
discussion of the carrying value and fair value of our investment in LUKOIL
shares.

•

Debt:
The carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates fair value.  The fair value of the fixed-rate debt is
estimated based on quoted market prices.

•

Swaps:
Fair value is estimated based on forward market prices and approximates the net
gains and losses that would have been realized if the contracts had been closed
out at year-end.  When forward market
prices are not available, they are estimated using the forward prices of a
similar commodity with adjustments for differences in quality or location.


•

Futures:
Fair values are based on quoted market prices obtained from the New York
Mercantile Exchange, the IntercontinentalExchange, or other traded exchanges.

•

Forward-exchange
contracts: Fair value is estimated by comparing the contract rate to the
forward rate in effect on December 31 and approximates the net gains and losses
that would have been realized if the contracts had been closed out at year-end.

Certain of our
commodity derivative and financial instruments at December 31 were:

In 1997, we formed
a statutory business trust, Phillips 66 Capital II (Trust II), with
ConocoPhillips owning all of the common securities of the trust.  The sole purpose of the trust was to issue
preferred securities to outside investors, investing the proceeds thereof in an
equivalent amount of subordinated debt securities of ConocoPhillips.  The trust was established to raise funds for
general corporate purposes.

Trust II has
outstanding $350 million of 8% Capital Securities (Capital
Securities).  The sole asset of
Trust II is $361 million of the company’s 8% Junior Subordinated
Deferrable Interest Debentures due 2037 (Subordinated Debt Securities II).  The Subordinated Debt Securities II are due
January 15, 2037, and are redeemable in whole, or in part, at our option
on or after January 15, 2007, at 103.94 percent declining annually
until January 15, 2017, when they can be called at par, $1,000 per
share, plus accrued and unpaid interest. 
When we redeem the Subordinated Debt Securities II, Trust II is
required to apply all redemption proceeds to the immediate redemption of the
Capital Securities.  We fully and
unconditionally guarantee Trust II’s obligations under the Capital
Securities.  Subordinated Debt Securities
II are unsecured obligations that are subordinate and junior in right of
payment to all our present and future senior indebtedness.

Effective January
1, 2003, with the adoption of FIN 46(R), Trust II was deconsolidated because we
were not the primary beneficiary.  This
had the effect of increasing consolidated debt by $361 million, since the
Subordinated Debt Securities II were no longer eliminated in consolidation.  It also removed the $350 million of
mandatorily redeemable preferred securities from our consolidated balance
sheet.  Prior to the adoption of FIN
46(R), the subordinated debt securities and related income statement effects
were eliminated in the company’s consolidated financial statements.  See Note 3—Changes in Accounting Principles,
for additional information.


Other Minority Interests

The minority interest
owner in Ashford Energy Capital S.A. is entitled to a cumulative annual preferred
return on its investment, based on three-month LIBOR rates plus
1.32 percent.  The preferred return
at December 31, 2005 and 2004, was 5.37 percent and 3.34 percent,
respectively.  At December 31, 2005
and 2004, the minority interest was $507 million and $504 million,
respectively.  Ashford Energy Capital
S.A. continues to be consolidated in our financial statements under the
provisions of FIN 46(R) because we are the primary beneficiary.  See Note 3—Changes in Accounting Principles,
for additional information.

The remaining minority interest amounts relate to consolidated
operating joint ventures that have minority interest owners.  The largest amount, $682 million at
December 31, 2005, relates to the Bayu-Undan LNG project in the Timor Sea and
northern Australia.  See Note
5—Subsidiary Equity Transactions, for additional information.

Preferred
Stock

We have
500 million shares of preferred stock authorized, par value $.01 per
share, none of which was issued or outstanding at December 31, 2005.

Note
18—Preferred Share Purchase Rights

In 2002, our Board
of Directors authorized and declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase
right for each common share outstanding, and authorized and directed the
issuance of one right per common share for any newly issued shares.  The rights have certain anti-takeover
effects.  The rights will cause
substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire
ConocoPhillips on terms not approved by the Board of Directors.  However, since the rights may either be
redeemed or otherwise made inapplicable by ConocoPhillips prior to an acquiror
obtaining beneficial ownership of 15 percent or more of ConocoPhillips’ common
stock, the rights should not interfere with any merger or business combination
approved by the Board of Directors prior to that occurrence.  The rights, which expire June 30, 2012, will
be exercisable only if a person or group acquires 15 percent or more of the
company’s common stock or commences a tender offer that would result in
ownership of 15 percent or more of the common stock.  Each right would entitle stockholders to buy
one one-hundredth of a share of preferred stock at an exercise price of
$300.  If an acquiror obtains 15 percent
or more of ConocoPhillips’ common stock, then each right will be adjusted so
that it will entitle the holder (other than the acquiror, whose rights will
become void) to purchase, for the then exercise price, a number of shares of
ConocoPhillips’ common stock equal in value to two times the exercise price of
the right.  In addition, the rights
enable holders to purchase the stock of an acquiring company at a discount,
depending on specific circumstances.  We
may redeem the rights in whole, but not in part, for one cent per right.

Note
19—Non-Mineral Leases

The company leases
ocean transport vessels, railcars, corporate aircraft, service stations,
computers, office buildings and other facilities and equipment.  Certain leases include escalation clauses for
adjusting rentals to reflect changes in price indices, as well as renewal
options and/or options to purchase the leased property for the fair market
value at the end of the lease term. 
There are no significant restrictions imposed on us by the leasing
agreements in regards to dividends, asset dispositions or borrowing
ability.  Leased assets under capital
leases were not significant in any period presented.


At December 31,
2005, future minimum rental payments due under non-cancelable leases were:

*Includes
$150 million related to railroad cars subleased to CPChem, a related
party.

Operating lease rental
expense from continuing operations for the years ended December 31 was:

*Includes $28 million, $27
million and $31 million of contingent rentals in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Contingent rentals primarily are related to retail sites and refining
equipment, and are based on volume of product sold or throughput.


Note
20—Employee Benefit Plans

Pension
and Postretirement Plans

An analysis of the
projected benefit obligations for our pension plans and accumulated benefit
obligations for our postretirement health and life insurance plans follows:


For both U.S. and
international pensions, the overall expected long-term rate of return is
developed from the expected future return of each asset class, weighted by the
expected allocation of pension assets to that asset class. We rely on a variety
of independent market forecasts in developing the expected rate of return for
each class of assets.

All of our plans use a December 31
measurement date, except for a plan in the United Kingdom, which has a September 30
measurement date.

During 2005, we recorded
charges to other comprehensive income related to minimum pension liability
adjustments totaling $96 million ($55 million net of tax), resulting
in accumulated other comprehensive loss due to minimum pension liability
adjustments at December 31, 2005, of $177 million ($115 million
net of tax). During 2004, we recorded a benefit to other comprehensive income
totaling $8 million ($1 million net of tax), resulting in accumulated
other comprehensive loss due to minimum pension liability adjustments at December 31,
2004, of $81 million ($60 million net of tax).


For our tax-qualified
pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets, the
projected benefit obligation, the accumulated benefit obligation, and the fair
value of plan assets were $5,896 million, $4,899 million, and
$3,906 million at December 31, 2005, respectively, and
$4,893 million, $4,015 million, and $2,914 million at December 31,
2004, respectively.

For our unfunded
non-qualified supplemental key employee pension plans, the projected benefit
obligation and the accumulated benefit obligation were $292 million and
$227 million, respectively, at December 31, 2005, and were
$219 million and $162 million, respectively, at December 31,
2004.

We recognized pension
settlement losses of $4 million and $13 million in 2005 and 2004,
respectively, and special termination benefits of $3 million in 2005 and
2004. As a result of the ConocoPhillips merger, we recognized settlement losses
of $120 million and special termination benefits of $9 million in
2003.

In determining net
pension and other postretirement benefit costs, we elected to amortize net
gains and losses on a straight-line basis over 10 years. Prior service cost is
amortized on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of
employees expected to receive benefits under the plan.

We have multiple
non-pension postretirement benefit plans for health and life insurance. The
health care plans are contributory, with participant and company contributions
adjusted annually; the life insurance plans are non-contributory. For most
groups of retirees, any increase in the annual health care escalation rate
above 4.5 percent is borne by the participant. The weighted-average health
care cost trend rate for those participants not subject to the cap is assumed
to decrease gradually from 10 percent in 2006 to 5.5 percent in 2015.

The assumed health care
cost trend rate impacts the amounts reported. A one-percentage-point change in
the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects on the
2005 amounts:


During the third quarter of 2005, we announced that retail prescription
drug coverage will be extended to heritage Phillips retirees, similar to the
benefit provided to heritage Conoco and Tosco retirees. Because of this change,
we measured our postretirement medical plan liability as of September 1, 2005.
Also included in the September 1, 2005, measurement was a loss from lowering
the discount rate by 75 basis points to 5.00 percent, a gain from favorable
claims experience, and a gain from recognizing the non-taxable federal subsidy
we expect to receive under Medicare Part D. In 2004, we stated that, based on
the regulatory evidence available at that time, we did not believe the benefit
provided under our plan would be actuarially equivalent to that offered under
Medicare Part D and that we would not be entitled to receive a federal subsidy.
However, because of the extension of additional prescription drug benefits to
heritage Phillips retirees, recent favorable claims experience, and the
additional flexibility provided in the final regulations issued by the
Department of Health and Human Services earlier in 2005 regarding the
submission of Medicare subsidy claims, we concluded that our plan will qualify
for the subsidy. Consequently, we reduced the Accumulated Postretirement
Benefit Obligation (APBO) in the September 1, 2005, measurement by $166 million
for the federal subsidy and reduced expense for the period from September
through December 2005 for service cost, interest cost, and the amortization of
gains by $2 million, $3 million, and $5 million, respectively. Combining all of
the changes included in the September 1, 2005, measurement, the medical plan’s
APBO decreased by $53 million, and expense for the remainder of 2005 was $7
million lower than it would have been, based on the previous measurement.

Plan Assets

The company follows a
policy of broadly diversifying pension plan assets across asset classes,
investment managers, and individual holdings. Asset classes that are considered
appropriate include U.S. equities, non-U.S. equities, U.S. fixed income,
non-U.S. fixed income, real estate, and private equity investments. Plan
fiduciaries may consider and add other asset classes to the investment
program from time to time. Our funding policy for U.S. plans is to contribute
at least the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974. Contributions to foreign plans are dependent upon local laws and tax
regulations. In 2006, we expect to contribute approximately $415 million
to our domestic qualified and non-qualified benefit plans and $115 million
to our international qualified and non-qualified benefit plans.

A portion of U.S.
pension plan assets is held as a participating interest in an insurance annuity
contract. This participating interest is calculated as the market value of
investments held under this contract, less the accumulated benefit obligation
covered by the contract. At December 31, 2005, the participating interest
in the annuity contract was valued at $175 million and consisted of
$407 million in debt securities and $71 million in equity securities,
less $303 million for the accumulated benefit obligation covered by the
contract. At December 31, 2004, the participating interest was valued at
$186 million and consisted of $402 million in debt securities and
$70 million in equity securities, less $286 million for the
accumulated benefit obligation. The participating interest is not available for
meeting general pension benefit obligations in the near term. No future company
contributions are required and no new benefits are being accrued under this
insurance annuity contract.


In the United
States, plan asset allocation is managed on a gross asset basis, which includes
the market value of all investments held under the insurance annuity contract. On
this basis, weighted-average asset allocation is as follows:

The above asset
allocations are all within guidelines established by plan fiduciaries.

Treating the
participating interest in the annuity contract as a separate asset category
results in the following weighted-average asset allocations:

The
following benefit payments, which are exclusive of amounts to be paid from the
participating annuity contract and which reflect expected future service, as
appropriate, are expected to be paid:


Defined
Contribution Plans

Most U.S. employees
(excluding retail service station employees) are eligible to participate in the
ConocoPhillips Savings Plan (CPSP). Employees can deposit up to 30 percent of
their pay in the thrift feature of the CPSP to a choice of approximately 32
investment funds. ConocoPhillips matches $1 for each $1 deposited, up to
1.25 percent of pay. Company contributions charged to expense for the CPSP
and predecessor plans, excluding the stock savings feature (discussed below),
were $18 million in 2005, $17 million in 2004, and $19 million in
2003.

The stock savings feature
of the CPSP is a leveraged employee stock ownership plan. Employees may elect
to participate in the stock savings feature by contributing 1 percent of their
salaries and receiving an allocation of shares of common stock proportionate to
their contributions.

In 1990, the Long-Term
Stock Savings Plan of Phillips Petroleum Company (now the stock savings feature
of the CPSP) borrowed funds that were used to purchase previously unissued
shares of company common stock. Since the company guarantees the CPSP’s
borrowings, the unpaid balance is reported as a liability of the company and
unearned compensation is shown as a reduction of common stockholders’ equity. Dividends
on all shares are charged against retained earnings. The debt is serviced by
the CPSP from company contributions and dividends received on certain shares of
common stock held by the plan, including all unallocated shares. The shares
held by the stock savings feature of the CPSP are released for allocation to
participant accounts based on debt service payments on CPSP borrowings. In
addition, during the period from 2006 through 2009, when no debt principal
payments are scheduled to occur, the company has committed to make direct
contributions of stock to the stock savings feature of the CPSP, or make
prepayments on CPSP borrowings, to ensure a certain minimum level of stock
allocation to participant accounts. The debt was refinanced during 2004;
however, there was no change to the stock allocation schedule.

We recognize interest
expense as incurred and compensation expense based on the fair market value of
the stock contributed or on the cost of the unallocated shares released, using
the shares-allocated method. We recognized total CPSP expense related to the
stock savings feature of $127 million, $88 million and
$76 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, all of which was
compensation expense. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, we made cash contributions to the
CPSP of less than $1 million. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, we contributed
2,250,727 shares, 2,419,808 shares and 2,967,560 shares,
respectively, of company common stock from the Compensation and Benefits Trust.
The shares had a fair market value of $130 million, $99 million and
$89 million, respectively. Dividends used to service debt were
$32 million, $27 million, and $28 million in 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively. These dividends reduced the amount of compensation expense
recognized each period. Interest incurred on the CPSP debt in 2005, 2004 and
2003 was $9 million, $5 million and $5 million, respectively.

The total CPSP stock
savings feature shares as of December 31 were:


The
fair value of unallocated shares at December 31, 2005, and 2004, was
$689 million and $566 million, respectively.

We
have several defined contribution plans for our international employees, each
with its own terms and eligibility depending on location. Total compensation
expense recognized for these international plans was approximately
$20 million in 2005 and 2004.

Stock-Based
Compensation Plans

The 2004 Omnibus Stock
and Performance Incentive Plan (the Plan) was approved by shareholders in May 2004.
Over its 10-year life, the Plan allows the issuance of up to 70 million
shares of our common stock for compensation to our employees, directors and
consultants. After approval of the Plan, the heritage plans were no longer used
for further awards. Of the 70 million shares available for issuance under
the Plan, the number of shares of common stock available for incentive stock
options will be 40 million shares, and no more than 40 million shares
may be used for awards in stock.

Shares of company stock
awarded to employees under the Plan and the heritage plans were:

Stock options granted
under provisions of the Plan and earlier plans permit purchase of our common
stock at exercise prices equivalent to the average market price of the stock on
the date the options were granted. The options have terms of 10 years and
normally become exercisable in increments of up to one-third on each
anniversary date following the date of grant. Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs)
may, from time to time, be affixed to the options. Options exercised in the form of
SARs permit the holder to receive stock, or a combination of cash and stock,
subject to a declining cap on the exercise price.

A summary of our stock
option activity follows:


The
weighted-average fair market values of the options granted over the past three
years, as calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, and the
significant assumptions used to calculate these values were as follows:

Options
Outstanding at December 31, 2005

Options
Exercisable at December 31

For
information on our 2003 adoption of SFAS No. 123, see Note 1—Accounting
Policies.

Compensation
and Benefits Trust (CBT)

The CBT is an irrevocable
grantor trust, administered by an independent trustee and designed to acquire,
hold and distribute shares of our common stock to fund certain future
compensation and benefit obligations of the company. The CBT does not increase
or alter the amount of benefits or compensation that will be paid under
existing plans, but offers us enhanced financial flexibility in providing the
funding requirements of those plans. We also have flexibility in determining
the timing of distributions of shares


from the CBT to fund
compensation and benefits, subject to a minimum distribution schedule. The
trustee votes shares held by the CBT in accordance with voting directions from
eligible employees, as specified in a trust agreement with the trustee.

We sold 58.4 million
shares of previously unissued company common stock to the CBT in 1995 for $37 million
of cash, previously contributed to the CBT by us, and a promissory note from
the CBT to us of $952 million. The CBT is consolidated by ConocoPhillips,
therefore the cash contribution and promissory note are eliminated in
consolidation. Shares held by the CBT are valued at cost and do not affect
earnings per share or total common stockholders’ equity until after they are
transferred out of the CBT. In 2005 and 2004, shares transferred out of the CBT
were 2,250,727 and 2,419,808, respectively. At December 31, 2005,
45.9 million shares remained in the CBT. All shares are required to be
transferred out of the CBT by January 1, 2021.

Note
21—Income Taxes

Income taxes charged to
income from continuing operations were:


Deferred income taxes
reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the
amounts used for tax purposes. Major components of deferred tax liabilities and
assets at December 31 were:

Current assets, long-term
assets, current liabilities and long-term liabilities included deferred taxes
of $363 million, $65 million, $12 million and
$11,439 million, respectively, at December 31, 2005, and
$85 million, $52 million, $45 million and $10,385 million,
respectively, at December 31, 2004.

We have loss and credit
carryovers in multiple taxing jurisdictions. These attributes generally expire
between 2006 and 2018 with some carryovers having indefinite carryforward
periods.

Valuation allowances have
been established for certain loss and credit carryforwards that reduce deferred
tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. Uncertainties
that may affect the realization of these assets include tax law changes
and the future level of product prices and costs. During 2005, valuation allowances
decreased $118 million. This reflects increases of $90 million
primarily related to foreign tax loss carryforwards, more than offset by
decreases of $134 million primarily related to U.S. capital loss
carryforward utilization and decreases of $74 million related to foreign
loss carryforwards (i.e. expiration, relinquishment, currency translation). The
balance includes valuation allowances for certain deferred tax assets of
$271 million, for which subsequently recognized tax benefits, if any, will
be allocated to goodwill. Based on our historical taxable income, its
expectations for the future, and available tax-planning strategies, management
expects that remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized as offsets to
reversing deferred tax liabilities and as offsets to the tax consequences of
future taxable income.

In October 2004, the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (Act) was signed into law. One of the
provisions of the Act was a special deduction for qualifying manufacturing
activities. While the legislation is still undergoing clarifications, under
guidance in FSP FAS 109-1, we included the estimated impact as a current
benefit, which did not have a material impact on the company’s effective tax
rate, and it did not have any impact on our assessment of the need for possible
valuation allowances.


The Act also
included a special one-time provision allowing earnings of foreign subsidiaries
to be repatriated at a reduced U.S. income tax rate. Final guidance clarifying
the uncertain provisions of the law was published during the third quarter of
2005. We have completed our analysis of this provision, including the final
guidance, and do not intend to change our repatriation plans.

At December 31, 2005
and 2004, income considered to be permanently reinvested in certain foreign
subsidiaries and foreign corporate joint ventures totaled approximately
$2,773 million and $2,091 million, respectively. Deferred income
taxes have not been provided on this income, as we do not plan to initiate any
action that would require the payment of income taxes. It is not practicable to
estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable on this foreign
income if distributed.

The amounts of U.S. and
foreign income from continuing operations before income taxes, with a
reconciliation of tax at the federal statutory rate with the provision for
income taxes, were:

Our
2005 tax expense was reduced by $38 million due to the remeasurement of
deferred tax liabilities from the 2003 Canadian graduated tax rate reduction. Our
2004 tax expense was reduced by $72 million due to the remeasurement of
deferred tax liabilities from the 2003 Canadian graduated tax rate reduction
and a 2004 Alberta provincial tax rate change.


Note
22—Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

The components and
allocated tax effects of other comprehensive income (loss) follow:

Unrealized gain (loss) on
securities relate to available-for-sale securities held by irrevocable grantor
trusts that fund certain of our domestic, non-qualified supplemental key
employee pension plans.

Deferred taxes have not
been provided on temporary differences related to foreign currency translation
adjustments for investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and foreign
corporate joint ventures that are considered permanent in duration.

Accumulated other
comprehensive income in the equity section of the balance sheet included:

Note
26—Segment Disclosures and Related Information

We have organized
our reporting structure based on the grouping of similar products and services,
resulting in six operating segments:

1)

E&P—This segment
primarily explores for, produces and markets crude oil, natural gas, and
natural gas liquids on a worldwide basis. 
At December 31, 2005, our E&P operations were producing in the
United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, Nigeria, Venezuela, offshore
Timor Leste in the Timor Sea, Australia, China, Indonesia, the United Arab
Emirates, Vietnam, and Russia.  The
E&P segment’s U.S. and international operations are disclosed separately
for reporting purposes.

2)

Midstream—Through
both consolidated and equity interests, this segment gathers and processes
natural gas produced by ConocoPhillips and others, and fractionates and markets
natural gas liquids, primarily in the United States, Canada and Trinidad.  The Midstream segment primarily consists of
our equity investment in DEFS.  Through
June 30, 2005, our equity ownership in DEFS was 30.3 percent.  In July 2005, we increased our ownership
interest to 50 percent.

3)

R&M—This segment
purchases, refines, markets and transports crude oil and petroleum products,
mainly in the United States, Europe and Asia. 
At December 31, 2005, we owned 12 refineries in the United
States; one in the United Kingdom; one in Ireland; and had equity interests in
one refinery in Germany, two in the Czech Republic, and one in Malaysia.  The R&M segment’s U.S. and international
operations are disclosed separately for reporting purposes.

4)

LUKOIL
Investment—This segment represents our investment in the ordinary shares of
LUKOIL, an international, integrated oil and gas company headquartered in
Russia.  In October 2004, we closed on a
transaction to acquire 7.6 percent of LUKOIL’s shares held by the Russian
government.  During the remainder of 2004
and throughout 2005, we further increased our ownership to 16.1 percent.

5)

Chemicals—This
segment manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide
basis.  The Chemicals segment consists of
our 50 percent equity investment in CPChem.

6)

Emerging
Businesses—This segment encompasses the development of new businesses beyond
our traditional operations.  Emerging
Businesses includes new technologies related to natural gas conversion into
clean fuels and related products (gas-to-liquids), technology solutions, power
generation, and emerging technologies.

Corporate and
Other includes general corporate overhead; interest income and expense;
discontinued operations; restructuring charges; certain eliminations; and
various other corporate activities. 
Corporate assets include all cash and cash equivalents.

27—New Accounting Standards

In

May 2005,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a
replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3.”  Among other changes, this Statement requires
retrospective application for voluntary changes in accounting principle, unless
it is impractical to do so.  Guidance is
provided on how to account for changes when retrospective application is
impractical.  This Statement is effective
on a prospective basis beginning January 1, 2006.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based
Payment,” (SFAS 123(R)), which supercedes Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and replaces SFAS
No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” that we adopted at the
beginning of 2003.  SFAS 123(R)
prescribes the accounting for a wide range of share-based compensation
arrangements, including options, restricted share plans, performance-based
awards,


share appreciation rights, and employee share purchase plans, and
generally requires the fair value of share-based awards to be expensed.  For ConocoPhillips, this Statement provided
for an effective date of third-quarter 2005; however, in April 2005, the
Securities and Exchange Commission approved a new rule that delayed the effective
date until January 1, 2006.  We adopted
the provisions of this Statement on January 1, 2006, using the
modified-prospective transition method, and do not expect the provisions of
this new pronouncement to have a material impact on our financial statements.  For more information on our adoption of SFAS
No. 123 and its effect on net income, see Note 1—Accounting Policies.

In

November 2004, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 151, “Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4.”  This Statement clarifies that items, such as
abnormal idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double freight, and
handling costs, be recognized as current-period charges.  In addition, the Statement requires that
allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on
the normal capacity of the production facilities.  We are required to implement this Statement
in the first quarter of 2006.  We do not
expect this Statement to have a significant impact on our financial statements.

At the September 2005 meeting, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue
No. 04-13, “Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same
Counterparty,” which addresses accounting issues that arise when one company
both sells inventory to and buys inventory from another company in the same
line of business.  For additional
information, see the Revenue Recognition section of Note 1—Accounting Policies.

Note
28—Pending Acquisition of Burlington Resources Inc.

On the evening of December 12, 2005,
ConocoPhillips and Burlington Resources Inc. announced they had signed a
definitive agreement under which ConocoPhillips would acquire Burlington
Resources Inc.  The transaction has a
preliminary value of $33.9 billion.  This
transaction is expected to close on March 31, 2006, subject to approval by
Burlington Resources shareholders at a special meeting set for March 30, 2006.

Under the terms of the agreement, Burlington
Resources shareholders will receive $46.50 in cash and 0.7214 shares of
ConocoPhillips common stock for each Burlington Resources share they own.  This represents a transaction value of $92
per share, based on the closing price of our common stock on Friday, December
9, 2005, the last unaffected day of trading prior to the announcement.  We anticipate that the cash portion of the
purchase price, currently estimated to be approximately $17.5 billion, will be
financed with a combination of short- and long-term debt and available cash.

Burlington Resources is an independent
exploration and production company, and holds a substantial position in North
American natural gas reserves and production. 
At year-end 2004, as reported in its Annual Report on Form 10-K,
Burlington Resources had proved worldwide natural gas reserves of 8,226 billion
cubic feet, including 5,076 billion cubic feet in the United States and 2,330
billion cubic feet in Canada.  Worldwide,
Burlington Resources had 630 million barrels of crude oil and natural gas
liquids combined, with 483 million barrels in the United States and 72 million
barrels in Canada.  During 2004,
Burlington Resources’ worldwide net natural gas production averaged 1,914
million cubic feet per day, while its net liquids production averaged 151
thousand barrels per day.

Upon completion of the transaction, Bobby S.
Shakouls, Burlington Resources’ President and Chief Executive Officer, and
William E. Wade Jr., currently an independent director of Burlington Resources,
will join our Board of Directors.


Oil
and Gas Operations

(Unaudited)

In accordance with SFAS No. 69, “Disclosures about Oil and Gas
Producing Activities,” and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC), we are making certain supplemental disclosures about our oil
and gas exploration and production operations. 
While this information was developed with reasonable care and disclosed
in good faith, it is emphasized that some of the data is necessarily imprecise
and represents only approximate amounts because of the subjective judgments
involved in developing such information. 
Accordingly, this information may not necessarily represent our current
financial condition or our expected future results.

These disclosures include information about our consolidated oil and
gas activities and our proportionate share of our equity affiliates’ oil and
gas activities, covering both those in our Exploration and Production segment,
as well as in our LUKOIL Investment segment. 
As a result, amounts reported as Equity Affiliates in Oil and Gas
Operations may differ from those shown in the individual segment disclosures
reported elsewhere in this report.  The
data included for the LUKOIL Investment segment reflects the company’s
estimated share of LUKOIL’s amounts. 
Because LUKOIL’s accounting cycle close and preparation of U.S. GAAP
financial statements occurs subsequent to our accounting cycle close, our
equity share of financial information and statistics from our LUKOIL investment
are estimates for 2005 and 2004.  Our
estimated year-end 2005 reserves related to our equity investment in LUKOIL
were based on LUKOIL’s year-end 2004 reserves (adjusted for known additions,
license extensions, dispositions, and public information) and included
adjustments to conform them to ConocoPhillips’ reserve policy and provided for
estimated 2005 production.  Other
financial information and statistics were based on market indicators,
historical production trends of LUKOIL, and other factors.  Any differences between the estimate and
actual financial information and statistics will be recorded in a subsequent
period.

The information about our proportionate share of equity affiliates is
necessary for a full understanding of our operations because equity affiliate
operations are an integral part of the overall success of our oil and gas operations.

Our disclosures by geographic area for our consolidated operations
include the United States (U.S.), European North Sea (Norway and the United
Kingdom), Asia Pacific, Canada, Middle East and Africa, and Other Areas.  In these supplemental oil and gas
disclosures, where we use equity accounting for operations that have proved
reserves, these operations are shown separately and designated as Equity
Affiliates, and include Venezuela, and Russia and Other Areas.


•

Proved
Reserves Worldwide

*Includes proved reserves of 14
million barrels attributable to a consolidated subsidiary in which there was a
10 percent minority interest.

•

Revisions
in 2004 in Canada were primarily related to Surmont as a result of low
December 31, 2004, bitumen values.

•

Purchases
in Middle East and Africa in 2005 of 238 million barrels were attributable to
Libya.  Purchases in Russia and Other
Areas in 2005 and 2004 were primarily associated with LUKOIL.

•

Extensions
and discoveries in Asia Pacific were primarily attributable to China in
2005.  Extensions and discoveries in
Other Areas were attributable to Kashagan in Kazakhstan in 2004, and in 2003
were primarily related to Surmont in Canada.

•

In
addition to conventional crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL)
proved reserves, we have proved oil sands reserves in Canada, associated with a
Syncrude project totaling 251 million barrels at the end of 2005.  For internal management purposes, we view
these reserves and their development as part of our total exploration and
production operations.  However, SEC regulations
define these reserves as mining related. 
Therefore, they are not included in our tabular presentation of proved
crude oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. 
These oil sands reserves also are not included in the standardized
measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserve
quantities.


*Includes proved reserves of 10
billion cubic feet attributable to a consolidated subsidiary in which there was
a 10 percent minority interest.

•

Natural
gas production may differ from gas production (delivered for sale) in our
statistics disclosure, primarily because the quantities above include gas
consumed at the lease, but omit the gas equivalent of liquids extracted at any
of our owned, equity-affiliate, or third-party processing plant or facility.

•

Revisions
in 2005 and 2004 for Alaska were primarily related to higher prices and
improved performance.  Revisions in 2004
in Asia Pacific were primarily related to Indonesia.

•

Purchases
in Lower 48 in 2005 were attributable to the acquisition of two limited-term,
fixed-volume overriding royalty interests in Utah and the San Juan Basin, as
well as property trades in Wyoming and Texas. 
Purchases in Russia and Other Areas in 2005 and 2004 were primarily
attributable to LUKOIL.

•

Equity
extensions and discoveries in 2005 in Russia and Other Areas were primarily
attributable to Qatar. Extensions and discoveries in 2004 in Other Areas were
primarily attributable to Kashagan in Kazakhstan, and in the European North Sea
attributable to the United Kingdom. 
Extensions and discoveries in Asia Pacific in 2003 were primarily
attributable to the Bayu-Undan project in the Timor Sea.

•

Natural
gas reserves are computed at 14.65 pounds per square inch absolute and 60
degrees Fahrenheit.


*

Includes proved reserves
of 9 million barrels attributable to a consolidated subsidiary in which there was
a 10 percent minority interest.

•

Natural
gas liquids reserves include estimates of natural gas liquids to be extracted
from our leasehold gas at gas processing plants or facilities.


•

Results
of Operations


*Includes $141 million, $126 million and
$63 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, for a Syncrude oil
project in Canada that is defined as a mining operation by SEC regulations.


•

Results
of operations for producing activities consist of all the activities within the
E&P organization, as well as producing activities within the LUKOIL
Investment segment, except for pipeline and marine operations, liquefied
natural gas operations, a Canadian Syncrude operation, and crude oil and gas
marketing activities, which are included in other earnings.  Also excluded are our Midstream segment,
downstream petroleum and chemical activities, as well as general corporate
administrative expenses and interest.

•

Transfers
are valued at prices that approximate market.

•

Other
revenues include gains and losses from asset sales, including a net gain of
approximately $152 million in 2005, certain amounts resulting from the
purchase and sale of hydrocarbons, and other miscellaneous income.  Also included in 2005 were losses of
approximately $282 million for the mark-to-market valuation of certain
U.K. gas contracts.  Other revenues in
2004 included net gains of $72 million from asset sales.

•

Production
costs are those incurred to operate and maintain wells and related equipment
and facilities used to produce petroleum liquids and natural gas.  These costs also include depreciation of
support equipment and administrative expenses related to the production
activity.

•

Taxes
other than income taxes include production, property and other non-income
taxes.

•

Exploration
expenses include dry hole, leasehold impairment, geological and geophysical
expenses, the cost of retaining undeveloped leaseholds, and depreciation of
support equipment and administrative expenses related to the exploration
activity.

•

Depreciation,
depletion and amortization (DD&A) in Results of Operations differs from
that shown for total E&P in Note 26—Segment Disclosures and Related
Information, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, mainly due to
depreciation of support equipment being reclassified to production or
exploration expenses, as applicable, in Results of Operations.  In addition, other earnings include certain
E&P activities, including their related DD&A charges.

•

Transportation
costs include costs to transport our produced oil, natural gas or natural gas
liquids to their points of sale, as well as processing fees paid to process
natural gas to natural gas liquids.  The
profit element of transportation operations in which we have an ownership
interest are deemed to be outside the oil and gas producing activity.  The net income of the transportation
operations is included in other earnings.

•

Other
related expenses include foreign currency gains and losses, and other
miscellaneous expenses.

•

The
provision for income taxes is computed by adjusting each country’s income
before income taxes for permanent differences related to the oil and gas
producing activities that are reflected in our consolidated income tax expense
for the period, multiplying the result by the country’s statutory tax rate and
adjusting for applicable tax credits.  In
2003, this included a $105 million benefit related to the repeal of the
Norway Removal Grant Act, a $95 million benefit related to the reduction
in the Canada and Alberta provincial tax rates, a $46 million benefit
related to the impairment of Angola Block 34, and a $27 million benefit
related to the re-alignment agreement of the Bayu-Undan project in the Timor
Sea.  Included in 2004 is a
$72 million benefit related to the remeasurement of deferred tax
liabilities from the 2003 Canadian graduated tax rate reduction and a 2004
Alberta provincial tax rate change.


•

Statistics

*Represents amounts extracted attributable to
E&P operations (see natural gas liquids reserves for further discussion).
Includes for 2005, 2004 and 2003, 9,000, 13,000, and 15,000 barrels daily in
Alaska, respectively, that were sold from the Prudhoe Bay lease to the Kuparuk
lease for reinjection to enhance crude oil production.

*Represents quantities available
for sale. Excludes gas equivalent of natural gas liquids shown above.


*2004 and 2003 restated to
exclude production, property and similar taxes.


(1) Excludes farmout arrangements.

(2) Includes step-out wells, as well as other types
of exploratory wells.  Step-out
exploratory wells are wells drilled in areas near or offsetting current
production, for which we cannot demonstrate with certainty that there is
continuity of production from an existing productive formation.  These are classified as exploratory wells
because we cannot attribute proved reserves to these locations.

(3) Excludes LUKOIL.

*Our total proportionate interest was less than one.


(1)
Includes wells that have been temporarily suspended.

(2)
Includes 2,537 gross and 1,253 net multiple completion wells.

(3)
Excludes LUKOIL.


•

Costs
Incurred

•

Costs
incurred include capitalized and expensed items.

•

Acquisition
costs include the costs of acquiring proved and unproved oil and gas
properties.  Costs in Lower 48 relate to
the acquisition of two limited-term, fixed-volume overriding royalty interests
in Utah and the San Juan Basin, as well as property trades in Wyoming and
Texas.  Such costs in Middle East and
Africa were related to our return to Libya. 
Equity affiliate acquisition costs in 2005 and 2004 were primarily
related to LUKOIL.  Some of the 2005 costs
have been temporarily assigned as unproved property acquisitions while the
purchase price allocation is being finalized. 
Once the final purchase price allocation is completed, certain amounts
will be reclassified between proved and unproved property acquisition
costs.  Proved property

acquisition costs in 2003 included net negative merger-related
adjustments totaling $178 million.

•

Exploration
costs include geological and geophysical expenses, the cost of retaining
undeveloped leaseholds, and exploratory drilling costs.

•

Development

costs

include

the

cost

of drilling and equipping development wells and building related
production

facilities

for extracting, treating, gathering and
storing petroleum liquids and natural gas.

•

Approximately

$1,211

million

of

properties

, plants and equipment adjustments related to the cumulative

effect

of accounting cha

n

ges in connection with the
implementation of SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,”
has been excluded from the 2003 costs incurred.

•

Costs

incurred

for the

European

North Sea in 2003 included approximately $430 million of
increased

properties

, plants and equipment related to the repeal
of the Norway Removal Grant Act.


•

Capitalized
Costs

•

Capitalized
costs include the cost of equipment and facilities for oil and gas producing
activities.  These costs include the
activities of our E&P and LUKOIL Investment segments, excluding pipeline
and marine operations, liquefied natural gas operations, a Canadian Syncrude
operation, crude oil and natural gas marketing activities, and downstream
operations.

•

Proved
properties include capitalized costs for oil and gas leaseholds holding proved
reserves; development wells and related equipment and facilities (including
uncompleted development well costs); and support equipment.

•

Unproved
properties include capitalized costs for oil and gas leaseholds under
exploration (including where petroleum liquids and natural gas were found but
determination of the economic viability of the required infrastructure is
dependent upon further exploratory work under way or firmly planned) and for
uncompleted exploratory well costs, including exploratory wells under
evaluation.


•

Standardized
Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows

Relating to Proved Oil and Gas Reserve Quantities

Amounts are
computed using year-end prices and costs (adjusted only for existing
contractual changes), appropriate statutory tax rates and a prescribed 10
percent discount factor.  Continuation of
year-end economic conditions also is assumed. 
The calculation is based on estimates of proved reserves, which are
revised over time as new data become available. 
Probable or possible reserves, which may become proved in the future,
are not considered.  The calculation also
requires assumptions as to the timing of future production of proved reserves,
and the timing and amount of future development, including dismantlement, and
production costs.

While due care was
taken in its preparation, we do not represent that this data is the fair value
of our oil and gas properties, or a fair estimate of the present value of cash
flows to be obtained from their development and production.


Discounted Future Net Cash Flows

*Includes
taxes other than income taxes.

Excludes
discounted future net cash flows from Canadian Syncrude of $2,159 million in
2005, $1,302 million in 2004 and $1,048 million in 2003.


Sources of Change in Discounted
Future Net Cash Flows*

*Certain amounts in 2004 and 2003 were reclassified to conform with the
current year presentation.

**Includes
taxes other than income taxes.

***Includes
amounts resulting from changes in the timing of production.

•

The
net change in prices, and production and transportation costs is the
beginning-of-the-year reserve-production forecast multiplied by the net annual
change in the per-unit sales price, and production and transportation cost,
discounted at 10 percent.

•

Purchases
and sales of reserves in place, along with extensions, discoveries and improved
recovery, are calculated using production forecasts of the applicable reserve
quantities for the year multiplied by the end-of-the-year sales prices, less
future estimated costs, discounted at 10 percent.

•

The
accretion of discount is 10 percent of the prior year’s discounted future cash
inflows, less future production, transportation and development costs.

•

The
net change in income taxes is the annual change in the discounted future income
tax provisions.


Selected
Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)

*Includes excise taxes on
petroleum products sales.

**Per-share amounts in all periods reflect a two-for-one stock split effected
as a 100 percent stock dividend on June 1, 2005.
