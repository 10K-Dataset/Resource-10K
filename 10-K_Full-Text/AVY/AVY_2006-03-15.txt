ANNUAL
REPORT



PART I

Item 1.

BUSINESS

Avery Dennison Corporation (“Avery Dennison,” the
“Company,” “Registrant,” “Issuer,”
which may be referred to as “we” or “us”)
was incorporated in 1977 in the state of Delaware as Avery
International Corporation, the successor corporation to a
California corporation of the same name, which was incorporated
in 1946. In 1990, the Company merged one of its subsidiaries
into Dennison Manufacturing Company (“Dennison”), as a
result of which Dennison became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company, and in connection with which Company’s name was
changed to Avery Dennison Corporation.

Our homepage on the
internet is www.averydennison.com and you can learn more about
us by visiting our Web site. Our Web site address provided in
this annual report on
Form

10-K

is not
intended to function as a hyperlink and the information on our
Web site is not and should not be considered part of this report
and is not incorporated by reference in this document.

Our businesses include the production of pressure-sensitive
materials, office products and a variety of tickets, tags,
labels and other converted products. Some pressure-sensitive
materials are “converted” into labels and other
products through embossing, printing, stamping and die-cutting,
and some are sold in unconverted form as base materials, tapes
and reflective sheeting. We also manufacture and sell a variety
of office products and other converted products and other items
not involving pressure-sensitive components, such as binders,
organizing systems, markers, fasteners, business forms, as well
as tickets, tags, and imprinting equipment for retail and
apparel manufacturers.

A pressure-sensitive, or self-adhesive, material is one that
adheres to a surface by press-on contact. It generally consists
of four elements: a face material, which may be paper, metal
foil, plastic film or fabric; an adhesive, which may be
permanent or removable; a release coating; and a backing
material to protect the adhesive against premature contact with
other surfaces, and which can also serve as the carrier for
supporting and dispensing individual labels. When the products
are to be used, the release coating and protective backing are
removed, exposing the adhesive, and the label or other face
material is pressed or rolled into place.

Self-adhesive materials may initially cost more than materials
using heat or moisture activated adhesives, but the use of
self-adhesive materials often provides cost savings because of
their easy and instant application, without the need for
adhesive activation. They also provide consistent and versatile
adhesion, with minimal adhesive deterioration and are available
in a large selection of materials in nearly any size, shape and
color.

Our reporting segments are:

•

Pressure-sensitive Materials

•

Office and Consumer Products

•

Retail Information Services

In addition to our reporting segments, we have other specialty
converting businesses comprised of several businesses that
produce specialty tapes and highly engineered labels including
radio frequency identification (“RFID”) inlays and
labels and other converted products.

The Pressure-sensitive Materials segment contributes
approximately 57 percent of our total sales, while the
Office and Consumer Products segment and the Retail Information
Services segment contribute approximately 21 percent and
12 percent, respectively, of our total sales. Approximately
80 percent of our sales are generated in the United States
and Europe.

International operations constitute a significant portion of our
business and represent approximately 55 percent of our
sales. We continue to expand our operations, focusing
particularly on Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe. As of
December 31, 2005, we operated approximately 140
manufacturing and distribution facilities located in over 40
countries, and employed approximately 22,600 persons worldwide.

We are subject to certain risks referred to in Item 1A,
“Risk Factors” and Item 3, “Legal
Proceedings” below, including those normally attending
international and domestic operations, such as changes in
economic



or political conditions, currency fluctuations, exchange control
regulations and the effect of international relations and
domestic affairs of foreign countries on the conduct of
business, legal proceedings, and the availability and pricing of
raw materials.

Except as set forth below, no single customer represented 10% or
more of our net sales or trade receivables at year end 2005 and
2004. However, our ten largest customers at year end 2005
represented approximately 20% of trade accounts receivable and
consisted of six customers of our Office and Consumer Products
segment, three customers of our Pressure-sensitive Materials
segment and one customer of both these segments. The financial
position and operations of these customers are monitored on an
ongoing basis. (see “Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates” of Item 7, “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial
Condition”). United States export sales are not a
significant part of our business. Backlogs are not considered
material in the industries in which we compete.

The Board designated Richard M. Ferry as presiding director
during 2005. He presided at executive sessions of the Board
until December 1, 2005, when Kent Kresa was elected
non-executive Chairman. Mr. Kresa now presides at executive
sessions of the Board. During 2005, the Board held six executive
sessions with non-management directors only during regularly
scheduled Board meetings, as well as one additional executive
session with independent directors only. Stockholders and other
interested parties may write to Mr. Kresa concerning
matters other than accounting and auditing c/o Secretary,

and auditing matters c/o Secretary at the same address.

Pressure-sensitive Materials Segment

The Pressure-sensitive Materials segment manufactures and sells
Fasson-, JAC-, and Avery Dennison-brand pressure-sensitive
materials, Avery-brand graphics and graphic films, Avery
Dennison-brand reflective products, and performance polymers.
The business of this segment is generally not seasonal, except
for certain outdoor graphics and highway safety products and
operations in Western Europe. Pressure-sensitive materials
consist primarily of papers, plastic films, metal foils and
fabrics, which are coated with Company-developed and purchased
adhesives, and then laminated with specially coated backing
papers and films. They are sold in roll or sheet form with
either solid or patterned adhesive coatings, and are available
in a wide range of face materials, sizes, thicknesses and
adhesive properties. These materials are sold to label printers
and converters for labeling, decorating, fastening, electronic
data processing and special applications on a worldwide basis.

Graphic products consist of a variety of films and other
products sold to the architectural, commercial sign, digital
printing, and other related markets. We also sell durable cast
and reflective films to the construction, automotive, fleet
transportation, scrim-reinforced vinyl material for banner sign
applications, and reflective films and highway safety products
for traffic and safety applications. Our graphic and reflective
businesses are organized on a worldwide basis to serve the
expanding commercial graphic arts market,



including wide-format digital printing applications. We also
manufacture and sell proprietary films that are used for
outdoor, weather-resistant applications.

Performance polymer products include a range of solvent- and
emulsion-based acrylic polymer adhesives, protective coatings
and other polymer additives for internal use, as well as for
sale to other companies.

In this segment, our larger competitors are Raflatac, a
subsidiary of UPM-Kymmene; Morgan Adhesives
(“MACtac”), a division of the Bemis Company; and 3M
Company (for graphic and reflective products). Entry of
competitors into the field of pressure-sensitive adhesives and
materials may be limited by capital requirements and a need for
technical knowledge. We believe that our relative size and scale
of operations, our ability to serve our customers with a broad
line of quality products and service programs, our distribution
and brand strength, and the development and commercialization of
new products are among the more significant factors in
developing and maintaining our competitive position.

Office and Consumer Products Segment

The Office and Consumer Products segment manufactures and sells
a wide range of Avery-brand office and printable media products.
The business of this segment is seasonal, with higher volume
related to the

back-to

-school season.

This segment’s products are generally sold through office
products superstores, mass market distributors, wholesalers and
dealers. We manufacture and sell a wide range of Avery-brand
products for office, school and home uses: printable media, such
as copier, ink-jet and laser printer labels, related computer
software, ink-jet and laser printer card and index products; and
organization, filing and presentation products, such as binders,
dividers and sheet protectors. We also offer a wide range of
other stationery products, including writing instruments,
markers, adhesives and specialty products under brand names such
as Avery, Marks-A-Lot and HI-LITER. The extent of product
offerings varies by geographic market.

In this segment, our larger competitors are Acco Brands
Corporation, Esselte Corporation and manufacturers of private
brands. We believe that our brand strength, a large installed
base of software that facilitates the use of many of our
products, our ability to serve our customers with a broad line
of quality products, and the development and commercialization
of new products are among the more significant factors in
developing and maintaining our competitive position.

Retail Information Services Segment

The Retail Information Services segment designs, manufactures
and sells a wide variety of price marking and brand
identification products for retailers, apparel manufacturers,
distributors and industrial customers on a worldwide basis. This
business is seasonal, with higher volume in advance of the

back-to

-school and
holiday shipping periods.

Our brand identification products include woven and printed
labels, graphic tags and barcode tags. Our information
management products include price tickets, carton labels, RFID
tags and printing applications for supply chain and security
management. Our solution enabling products include barcode
printers, molded plastic fastening and application devices and
security management products.

In this segment, our largest competitor is Paxar Corporation. We
believe that our ability to serve our customers with product
innovation, a comprehensive brand identification and information
management product line, our global distribution network,
service, quality, and geographic reach are the key advantages in
developing and maintaining our competitive position.

Other specialty converting businesses

Other specialty converting businesses include our specialty
tapes, industrial and automotive products, RFID and security
printing businesses. These businesses manufacture and sell
specialty tapes, highly engineered films, RFID inlays,
pressure-sensitive postage stamps and other converted products.
These



businesses are generally not seasonal, except for certain
automotive products due to typical summer plant shutdowns by
automotive manufacturers.

The specialty tapes business manufactures and sells single- and
double-coated tapes and adhesive transfer tapes for use in
non-mechanical fastening, bonding and sealing systems in various
industries, which are sold to industrial and medical original
equipment manufacturers, converters, and disposable diaper
producers worldwide. These products are sold in roll form and
are available in a wide range of face materials, sizes,
thicknesses and adhesive properties.

Our industrial and automotive products businesses primarily
consist of custom pressure-sensitive and heat-seal labels for
the automotive and durable goods industries. These products are
sold primarily to original equipment manufacturers.

Our RFID business, manufactures RFID inlays and labels and makes
use of our existing distribution by marketing to our label
converter customers.

Our security printing business manufactures and sells
self-adhesive battery labels to a battery manufacturer, and
self-adhesive stamps to the U.S. Postal Service.

In addition, we sell specialty print-receptive films to the
industrial label market, metallic dispersion products to the
packaging industry and proprietary woodgrain and other patterns
of film laminates for housing exteriors and interior and
exterior automotive applications.

We compete with a number of diverse businesses. Our largest
competitor for this group of businesses is 3M Company in the
specialty tapes business. Entry of competitors into these
specialty converting businesses may be limited by capital and
technical requirements. We believe that our ability to serve our
customers with quality, cost effective products and the
development and commercialization of new products are among the
more significant factors in developing and maintaining our
competitive position.

Research and Development

Many of our current products are the result of our research and
development efforts. Our expenses for research, design and
testing of new products and applications by our operating units
and the Avery Research Center (the “Research Center”)
located in Pasadena, California were $85.4 million in 2005,
$81.8 million in 2004 and $74.3 million in 2003. A
significant number of our research and development activities
are conducted at the Research Center, which supports each of our
operating segments.

Our operating units’ research efforts are directed
primarily toward developing new products and operating
techniques and improving product performance, often in close
association with customers. The Research Center supports our
operating units’ patent and product development work, and
focuses on improving adhesives, materials and coating processes,
as well as related product applications and ventures. These
efforts often focus on projects relating to printing and coating
technologies and adhesive, release and ink chemistries.

The loss of individual patents or licenses would not be material
to us taken as a whole, nor to our operating segments
individually. Our principal trademarks are Avery, Fasson, Avery
Dennison and the Company’s symbol. These trademarks are
significant in the markets in which our products compete.

Three-Year Summary of Segment Information

Certain financial information on our reporting segments and
other specialty converting businesses for the three years ended
December 31, 2005, which appear in Note 12
“Segment Information,” in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements beginning on page 61 of our 2005
Annual Report to Shareholders, are incorporated herein by
reference.



Other Matters

We use various raw materials, primarily paper, plastic films and
resins, and specialty chemicals, which we purchase from a
variety of commercial and industrial sources and which are
subject to price fluctuations. Although from time to time
shortages could occur, these raw materials currently are
generally available.

We produce a majority of our self-adhesive materials using
water-based emulsion and hot-melt adhesive technologies.
Emissions from these operations contain small amounts of
volatile organic compounds, which can be regulated by agencies
of federal, state, local and foreign governments. We continue to
evaluate the use of alternative materials and technologies to
minimize these emissions.

A portion of our manufacturing process for self-adhesive
materials utilizes certain organic solvents which, unless
controlled, would be emitted into the atmosphere. Emissions of
these substances are regulated by agencies of federal, state,
local and foreign governments. In connection with the
acquisition of certain manufacturing equipment, we invest in
solvent capture and control units to assist in regulating these
emissions.

We have developed adhesives and adhesive processing systems.
Emulsion adhesives, hot-melt adhesives or solventless silicone
systems have been installed in our facilities in Peachtree City,
Georgia; Fort Wayne and Greenfield, Indiana; and
Quakertown, Pennsylvania; as well as in other plants in the
United States, Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada,
China, Colombia, France, Germany, India, Korea, Luxembourg,
Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, South Africa, Thailand and
United Kingdom.

Based on current information, we do not believe that the costs
of complying with applicable laws regulating the discharge of
materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the
protection of the environment, will have a material effect upon
our capital expenditures, consolidated financial position or
results of operations.

For information regarding our potential responsibility for
cleanup costs at certain hazardous waste sites, see “Legal
Proceedings” (see Part I, Item 3) and
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of
Operations and Financial Condition” (see Part II,
Item 7).

Item 1A.

RISK FACTORS

Our ability to attain our goals and objectives is materially
dependent on numerous factors and risks, including but not
limited to, the following:

Potential adverse developments in legal proceedings and
investigations regarding competitive activities and other legal,
compliance and regulatory matters, including those involving
product liability, product and trade compliance, Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act issues and other matters, could impact us
materially.

Our financial results could be materially adversely impacted by
an unfavorable outcome to pending or future litigation and
investigations, including, without limitation, any relating to
the U.S. Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division
(“DOJ”) criminal investigation, as well as the
European Commission (“EC”), Canadian Department of
Justice, and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission
investigations, into industry competitive practices and any
related proceedings or lawsuits pertaining to these
investigations or to the subject matter thereof (including
purported class actions in the United States seeking treble
damages for alleged unlawful competitive practices, and
purported class actions related to alleged disclosure and
fiduciary duty violations pertaining to alleged unlawful
competitive practices, which were filed after the announcement
of the DOJ investigation, as well as a likely fine by the EC in
respect of certain employee misconduct in Europe). See
Item 3, “Legal Proceedings.” There can be no
assurance that any investigation or litigation outcome will be
favorable.

The demand for our products is impacted by economic
conditions of the principal countries in which we operate. A
decline in the economies in these countries could have an
adverse effect on our sales and profitability.

We have operations in over 40 countries and our domestic and
international operations are strongly influenced by matters
beyond our control, including changes in the political, social,
economic, tax and



regulatory environments (including tariffs) in the countries in
which we operate, as well as the impact of economic conditions
on underlying demand for our products. In addition,
approximately 55 percent of our sales are in foreign
currencies, which fluctuate in relation to one another and to
the United States dollar. Fluctuations in currencies can cause
transaction, translation and other losses to us, which can
negatively impact our sales and profitability.

We operate in some highly competitive markets. If we do not
compete effectively, we could lose market share and experience
falling prices, adversely affecting our financial results.

We are at risk that our competitors will expand in our key
markets and implement new technologies making them more
competitive. There is also the possibility that competitors will
be able to offer additional products, services, lower prices, or
other incentives that we cannot or will not offer or that will
make our products less profitable. There can be no assurance
that we will be able to compete successfully against current and
future competitors.

As a manufacturer, our sales and profitability are also
dependent upon the cost and availability of raw materials and
energy, which are subject to price fluctuations, and the ability
to control or pass on costs of raw materials and labor.

Inflationary and other increases in the costs of raw materials,
labor and energy have occurred in the past and are expected to
recur, and our performance depends in part on our ability to
pass on to customers changes in costs in our selling prices for
products and through improvements in productivity. Also, it is
important that we are able to obtain timely delivery of
materials, equipment, and packaging from suppliers. A disruption
to our supply chain could adversely affect our sales and
profitability.

Our future results may be affected if we generate less
productivity improvement than projected.

We are undergoing efforts to reduce costs in many of our
operations, including closure of facilities, headcount
reductions, organizational simplification, process
standardization, and using a variety of tools such as Lean Sigma
and Kaizen events, to accomplish this productivity, which is not
assured. Lower levels of productivity could result in lower
production, sales, and profitability. Cost reduction actions, in
turn, could expose us to additional production risk.

Slower growth in key markets could adversely affect our
profitability.

Our business could be negatively impacted by a decline in key
end use markets or applications for our products. Our overall
performance will be influenced by these markets.

Our customers are widely diversified, but in certain portions
of our business, industry concentration has increased the
importance and decreased the number of significant customers.

In particular, sales of our office and consumer products in the
United States are concentrated in a few major customers,
principally office product superstores, mass market distributors
and wholesalers. The business risk associated with this
concentration, including increased credit risks for these and
other customers, and the possibility of related bad debt
write-offs, could negatively affect our margins and profits.

Our ability to develop and successfully market new products
and applications is important in maintaining growth.

The timely introduction of new products and improvements in
current products helps determine our success. Research and
development for each of our operating segments is complex and
uncertain and requires innovation and anticipation of market
trends. We could focus on products that ultimately are not
accepted by customers.



Infringing intellectual property rights of third parties or
inadequately acquiring or protecting our intellectual property
and patents could harm our ability to grow.

Because our products involve complex technology and chemistry,
we are sometimes involved in litigation involving patents and
other intellectual property. Parties have filed, and in the
future may file, claims against us alleging that we have
infringed their intellectual property rights. We could be held
to be liable to pay damages or obtain licenses. There can be no
assurance that licenses will be available, and the cost to
defend these infringement claims and to develop new technology
could be significant.

We also could have our intellectual property infringed. We
attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual
property and proprietary information, but it may be possible for
a third party to obtain our information and develop similar
technologies. In addition, many of the countries in which we
operate have limited or no protection for intellectual property
rights. The costs involved to protect our intellectual property
rights could adversely impact our profitability.

The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing
audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities.

Our estimate of the potential outcome of uncertain tax issues is
subject to our assessment of relevant risks, facts, and
circumstances existing at that time. Our future results may
include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated
tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or
resolved, which may impact our effective tax rate and our
financial results.

The level of returns on pension and postretirement plan
assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes
could affect our earnings in future periods.

Assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations
and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plan and other
postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by us in consultation
with outside actuaries who we rely on as experts. In the event
that we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions
used, such as the discount rate, expected long term rate of
return, or health care costs, our future pension and projected
postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease. Due
to changing market conditions or changes in the participant
population, the actuarial assumptions that we use may differ
from actual results, which could have a significant impact on
our pension and postretirement liability and related cost.

We have acquired and may continue to acquire other companies.
These acquisitions come with significant risks and
uncertainties, including integration, technology and
personnel.

In order to grow our product lines and to expand into new
markets, we have made acquisitions and may do so in the future.
Many risks, uncertainties, and costs are associated with the
acquisitions. The integration of systems, objectives, personnel,
product lines, markets, customers, suppliers, and cost savings
can be difficult to achieve and the results are uncertain. There
can be no assurance that acquisitions will be successful and
contribute to our profitability.

In order for us to remain competitive it is important to
recruit and retain highly-skilled employees.

There is significant competition to recruit and retain skilled
employees. Due to rapid expansion in certain markets and the
ongoing productivity efforts and recent employee reductions, it
may be difficult for us to retain and recruit sufficient numbers
of highly-skilled employees.

We need to comply with many environmental, health, and safety
laws.

Due to the nature of our business, we are subject to
environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations,
including those related to the disposal of hazardous waste from
our manufacturing processes. We have accrued liabilities for
environmental

clean-up

sites, including sites for which governmental agencies have
designated us as a potentially responsible party, where it is
probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of
loss can be reasonably estimated. However, because of the
uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and
remediation activities, future expense to remediate currently
identified sites and other sites, which could be identified in
the future for cleanup, could be higher than the liability
currently accrued.



In order to mitigate risk, it is important that we obtain
various types of insurance.

We have various types of insurance including health, life, and
property. Since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, insurance premiums
have risen considerably and recent natural disasters will likely
result in an additional increase in insurance premiums. As the
cost of insurance continues to increase, our financial results
could be adversely affected.

Significant disruption to our information technology
infrastructure could adversely impact our operations, sales,
customer relations, and financial results.

We rely on a large and complex information technology
infrastructure to link our worldwide divisions. Like other
information technology systems, ours is susceptible to damage or
interruptions caused by natural disasters, power failures,
viruses and security breaches. We upgrade and install new
systems, which if installed or programmed incorrectly, could
cause significant disruptions. If a disruption occurs, we could
incur losses and costs for remediation and interruption of
operations.

Our share price has been volatile.

Our stock price is influenced by changes in the overall stock
market and demand for equity securities in general. Other
factors, including market expectations for our performance, the
level of perceived growth of our industries, and announcements
concerning industry investigations, have also impacted our share
price. There can be no assurance that our stock will be less
volatile in the future.

If our credit ratings are downgraded, we may have difficulty
obtaining acceptable short- and long-term financing from capital
markets.

Credit ratings are a significant factor in our ability to raise
short-term and long-term financing. The credit ratings assigned
to us also impact the interest rates on our commercial paper and
other borrowings. Standard and Poor’s (“S&P”)
has assigned us a credit rating of A-2 for short-term and A- for
long-term financing. S&P has given us a negative outlook.
Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) has
assigned us a credit rating of P2 for short-term and A3 for
long-term financing. Moody’s has given us a stable outlook.
If our credit ratings were to be downgraded, our financial
flexibility would decrease and the cost to borrow would
increase. We have no assurance that the current credit ratings
will be maintained.

Our reputation, sales, and earnings could be affected
adversely if the quality of our products and services does not
meet customer expectations.

There are occasions when we ship products with quality issues
resulting from defective materials, manufacturing, packaging or
design. Many of these issues are discovered before shipping but
this causes delays in shipping, delays in the manufacturing
process, and occasionally cancelled orders. When the issues are
discovered after shipment, this causes additional shipping
costs, possible discounts, possible refunds, and potential loss
of future sales. Both pre-shipping and post-shipping quality
issues can result in financial consequences along with a
negative impact on our reputation.

Some of our products are sold by third parties.

Our products are not only sold by us, but by third party
distributors and retailers as well. Some of our distributors
also market products that compete with our products. Changes in
the financial or business condition or purchasing decisions of
these third parties could affect our sales and profitability.

We outsource some of our manufacturing. If there are
significant changes in the quality control or financial or
business condition of these outsourced manufacturers, our
business could be negatively impacted.

We manufacture most of our products, but occasionally
third-party manufacturers are needed for specialty jobs or
capacity overflow. Outsourced manufacturers reduce our ability
to control product failure, late deliveries, customer
dissatisfaction and compliance with customer requirements for
labor standards. Because of possible quality problems and
customer dissatisfaction, outsourced manufacturers could have an
adverse effect on our business and financial results.



The risks described above are not exclusive. Additional risks
not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be
less significant may also have an adverse effect on us. If any
of the above risks actually occur, our business, results of
operations, cash flows or financial condition could suffer,
which might cause the value of our securities to decline.

title to, or significant encumbrances on, our properties except
for certain mortgage liens.



Item 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company has been designated by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (“EPA”) and/or other responsible
state agencies as a potentially responsible party
(“PRP”) at fourteen waste disposal or waste recycling
sites, which are the subject of separate investigations or
proceedings concerning alleged soil and/or groundwater
contamination and for which no settlement of the Company’s
liability has been agreed. The Company is participating with
other PRPs at all such sites, and anticipates that its share of
cleanup costs will be determined pursuant to remedial agreements
entered into in the normal course of negotiations with the EPA
or other governmental authorities.

The Company has accrued liabilities for all sites, including
sites in which governmental agencies have designated the Company
as a PRP, where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and
the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. However,
because of the uncertainties associated with environmental
assessment and remediation activities, future expense to
remediate the currently identified sites and any sites which
could be identified in the future for cleanup could be higher
than the liability currently accrued. Amounts currently accrued
are not significant to the consolidated financial position of
the Company and, based upon current information, management
believes it is unlikely that the final resolution of these
matters will significantly impact the Company’s
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

On April 14, 2003, the Company announced that it had been
advised that the U.S. Department of Justice was challenging
the proposed merger of UPM-Kymmene (“UPM”) and the
Morgan Adhesives (“MACtac”) division of Bemis Co.,
Inc. (“Bemis”) on the basis of its belief that in
certain aspects of the label stock industry “the
competitors have sought to coordinate rather than compete.”
The Company also announced that it had been notified that the
U.S. Department of Justice had initiated a criminal
investigation into competitive practices in the label stock
industry.

On April 15, 2003, the U.S. Department of Justice
filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Illinois seeking to enjoin the proposed
merger (“DOJ Merger Complaint”). The DOJ Merger
Complaint, which set forth the U.S. Department of
Justice’s theory of its case, included references not only
to the parties to the merger, but also to an unnamed
“Leading Producer” of North American label stock,
which is the Company. The DOJ Merger Complaint asserted that
“UPM and the Leading Producer have already attempted to
limit competition between themselves, as reflected in written
and oral communications to each other through high level
executives regarding explicit anticompetitive understandings,
although the extent to which these efforts have succeeded is not
entirely clear to the United States at the present time.”

In connection with the U.S. Department of Justice’s
investigation into the proposed merger, the Company produced
documents and provided testimony by Messrs. Neal,
Scarborough and Simcic (then CEO, President and Group Vice
President — Roll Materials Worldwide, respectively).
On July 25, 2003, the United States District Court for the
Northern District of Illinois entered an order enjoining the
proposed merger. UPM and Bemis thereafter agreed to terminate
the merger agreement. The court’s decision incorporated a
stipulation by the U.S. Department of Justice that the
paper label industry is competitive.

On April 24, 2003, Sentry Business Products, Inc. filed a
purported class action in the United States District Court for
the Northern District of Illinois against the Company, UPM,
Bemis and certain of their subsidiaries seeking treble damages
and other relief for alleged unlawful competitive practices,
essentially repeating the underlying allegations of the DOJ
Merger Complaint. Ten similar complaints were filed in various
federal district courts. In November 2003, the cases were
transferred to the United States District Court for the Middle
District of Pennsylvania and consolidated for pretrial purposes.
Plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint on February 16,
2004, which the Company answered on March 31, 2004. On
April 14, 2004, the court separated the proceedings as to
class certification and merits discovery, and limited the
initial phase of discovery to the issue of the appropriateness
of class certification. On January 4, 2006, plaintiffs
filed an amended complaint. The Company intends to defend these
matters vigorously.

On May 6, 2003, Sekuk Global Enterprises filed a purported
stockholder class action in the United States District Court for
the Central District of California against the Company and
Messrs. Neal, O’Bryant and Skovran (then CEO, CFO and
Controller, respectively) seeking damages and other relief for
alleged



disclosure violations pertaining to alleged unlawful competitive
practices. Subsequently, another similar action was filed in the
same court. On September 24, 2003, the court appointed a
lead plaintiff, approved lead and liaison counsel and ordered
the two actions consolidated as the “In Re Avery Dennison
Corporation Securities Litigation.” Pursuant to court order
and the parties’ stipulation, plaintiff filed a
consolidated complaint in mid-February 2004. The court approved
a briefing schedule for defendants’ motion to dismiss the
consolidated complaint, with a contemplated hearing date in June
2004. In January 2004, the parties stipulated to stay the
consolidated action, including the proposed briefing schedule,
pending the outcome of the government investigation of alleged
anticompetitive conduct by the Company. The court has approved
the parties’ stipulation to stay the consolidated actions.
There has been no discovery and no trial date has been set. The
Company intends to defend these matters vigorously.

On May 21, 2003, The Harman Press filed in the Superior
Court for the County of Los Angeles, California, a purported
class action on behalf of indirect purchasers of label stock
against the Company, UPM and UPM’s subsidiary Raflatac
(“Raflatac”), seeking treble damages and other relief
for alleged unlawful competitive practices, essentially
repeating the underlying allegations of the DOJ Merger
Complaint. Three similar complaints were filed in various
California courts. In November 2003, on petition from the
parties, the California Judicial Council ordered the cases be
coordinated for pretrial purposes. The cases were assigned to a
coordination trial judge in the Superior Court for
San Francisco County on March 30, 2004. A further
similar complaint was filed in the Superior Court for Maricopa
County, Arizona on November 6, 2003. Plaintiffs voluntarily
dismissed the Arizona complaint without prejudice on
October 4, 2004. On January 21, 2005, American
International Distribution Corporation filed a purported class
action on behalf of indirect purchasers in the Superior Court
for Chittenden County, Vermont. Similar actions were filed by
Webtego on February 16, 2005, in the Court of Common Pleas
for Cuyahoga County, Ohio; by D.R. Ward Construction Co. on
February 17, 2005, in the Superior Court for Maricopa
County, Arizona; by Richard Wrobel, on February 16, 2005,
in the District Court of Johnson County, Kansas; and by Chad and
Terry Muzzey, on February 16, 2005 in the District Court of
Scotts Bluff County, Nebraska. On February 17, 2005, Judy
Benson filed a purported multi-state class action on behalf of
indirect purchasers in the Circuit Court for Cocke County,
Tennessee. On October 7, 2005, Webtego voluntarily
dismissed its complaint. The Company intends to defend the
remaining matters vigorously.

On August 15, 2003, the U.S. Department of Justice
issued a subpoena to the Company in connection with its criminal
investigation into competitive practices in the label stock
industry. The Company is cooperating with the investigation.

On June 8, 2004, Pamco Tape & Label filed in the
Superior Court for the County of San Francisco, California,
a purported class action on behalf of direct purchasers in
California of self-adhesive label stock, against the Company,
Bemis, UPM and Raflatac, seeking actual damages and other relief
for alleged unlawful competitive practices, essentially
repeating the underlying allegations of the DOJ Merger
Complaint. Pamco voluntarily dismissed its complaint without
prejudice on May 18, 2005.

On May 25, 2004, officials from the European Commission
(“EC”), assisted by officials from national
competition authorities, launched unannounced inspections of and
obtained documents from the Company’s pressure-sensitive
materials facilities in the Netherlands and Germany. The
investigation apparently seeks evidence of unlawful
anticompetitive activities affecting the European paper and
forestry products sector, including the label stock market. The
Company is cooperating with the investigation.

Based on published press reports, certain other European
producers of paper and forestry products received similar visits
from European authorities. One such producer, UPM, stated that
it had decided to disclose to competition authorities “any
conduct that has not comported with applicable competition
laws,” and that it had received conditional immunity in the
European Union (“EU”) and Canada with respect to
certain conduct it has previously disclosed to them, contingent
on full cooperation. In February 2006, UPM announced that the
U.S. Department of Justice had agreed not to prosecute UPM
in connection with the label stock investigation, and, further,
that UPM had received conditional immunity in jurisdictions in
addition to the EU and Canada.



In the course of its internal examination of matters pertinent
to the EC’s investigation of anticompetitive activities
affecting the European paper and forestry products sector, the
Company discovered instances of improper conduct by certain
employees in its European operations. This conduct violated the
Company’s policies and in some cases constituted an
infringement of EC competition law. As a result, the Company
expects that the EC will fine the Company when its investigation
is completed. The EC has wide discretion in fixing the amount of
a fine, up to a maximum fine of 10% of a company’s annual
revenue. Because the Company is unable to estimate either the
timing or the amount or range of any fine, the Company has made
no provision for a fine in its financial statements. However,
the Company believes that the fine could well be material in
amount. There can be no assurance that additional adverse
consequences to the Company will not result from the conduct
discovered by the Company or other matters under EC or other
laws. The Company is cooperating with authorities, continuing
its internal examination, and taking remedial actions.

On July 9, 2004, the Competition Law Division of the
Department of Justice of Canada notified the Company that it was
seeking information from the Company in connection with a label
stock investigation. The Company is cooperating with the
investigation.

On May 18, 2005, Ronald E. Dancer filed a purported class
action in the United States District Court for the Central
District of California against the Company, Mr. Neal, Karyn
Rodriguez (VP and Treasurer) and James Bochinski (then VP,
Compensation and Benefits), for alleged breaches of fiduciary
duty under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act to the
Company’s Employee Savings Plan and Plan participants. The
plaintiff alleges, among other things, that permitting
investment in and retention of Company Common Stock under the
Plan was imprudent because of alleged anticompetitive activities
by the Company, and that failure to disclose such activities to
the Plan and participants was unlawful. Plaintiff seeks an order
compelling defendants to compensate the Plan for any losses and
other relief. The parties stipulated to transfer the case to the
judge in the consolidated case, “In Re Avery Dennison
Corporation Securities Litigation” referenced above, and
the court has approved the parties’ stipulation to stay the
matter pending the outcome of the government investigation of
alleged anticompetitive conduct by the Company. The Company
intends to defend this matter vigorously.

On August 18, 2005, the Australian Competition and Consumer
Commission notified two of the Company’s subsidiaries,
Avery Dennison Material Pty Limited and Avery Dennison Australia
Pty Ltd, that it was seeking information in connection with a
label stock investigation. The Company is cooperating with the
investigation.

The Board of Directors has created an ad hoc committee comprised
of independent directors to oversee the foregoing matters.

The Company is unable to predict the effect of these matters at
this time, although the effect could well be adverse and
material.

The Company has contacted relevant authorities in the U.S. and
reported on the results of an internal investigation of
potential violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act. The transactions at issue were carried out by a small
number of employees of the Company’s reflectives business
in China, and involved, among other things, impermissible
payments or attempted impermissible payments. The payments or
attempted payments and the contracts associated with them appear
to have been relatively minor in amount and of limited duration.
Corrective and disciplinary actions have been taken. Sales of
the Company’s reflectives business in China in 2005 were
approximately $7 million. Based on findings to date, no
changes to the Company’s previously filed financial
statements are warranted as a result of these matters. However,
the Company expects that fines or other penalties could be
incurred. While the Company is unable to predict the financial
or operating impact of any such fines or penalties, it believes
that its behavior in detecting, investigating, responding to and
voluntarily disclosing these matters to authorities should be
viewed favorably.

The Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various other
lawsuits, claims and inquiries, most of which are routine to the
nature of the business. Based upon current information,
management believes that the resolution of these other matters
will not materially affect the Company’s financial position.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK

Overview

Sales

Our sales from continuing operations increased 3% in 2005
compared to 12% growth in 2004, reflecting the factors
summarized in the following table.




Estimated change in sales due to:

*

Core unit volume is a measure of sales performance that excludes
    the estimated impact of acquisitions, divestitures, changes in
    product mix and pricing, and currency translation. We use this
    measure to evaluate underlying demand for our products and
    services, and to assess sales trends over time.

The decrease in core unit volume in 2005 reflects the following
factors:

•

Loss of market share in our North American roll materials
    business following our implementation of selling price increases
    to offset higher raw material costs

•

The impact of an extra week in the 2004 fiscal year

•

Accelerated purchases by Office and Consumer Products customers
    in advance of our 2005 selling price increases, which
    contributed to higher growth in 2004

In addition to the factors noted above for 2004, core unit
volume also benefited in that year from additional sales in the
Retail Information Services segment as a result of customer
preparation for increased exports from China following the
elimination of apparel manufacturing quotas in January 2005.

The improvement in pricing and product mix in 2005 was primarily
due to the impact of selling price increases implemented to
offset higher raw material costs.

Cost Reduction Actions

In 2005, we initiated company-wide cost reduction efforts which
are expected to improve our global operating efficiencies. These
actions include reductions in headcount, which impact most
businesses and geographic regions and expected divestitures of
low-margin businesses and product lines. In connection with
these actions, we recorded cash and non-cash charges related to
severance and other employee-related costs, as well as asset
impairments. The charges are detailed in “Cost Reduction
Actions” below.

As a result of our expected sale of a business in 2006 that
manufactures raised reflective pavement markers and the
divestiture of our package label converting business in Europe
in October 2003 (discussed below in “Acquisitions and
Divestitures”), the discussions which follow generally
reflect summary results from our continuing operations unless
otherwise noted. However, the net income and net income per
share discussions include the impact of discontinued
operations.



Net Income

Net income decreased $53.3 million or 19% in 2005 compared
to 2004.

Negative factors affecting the change in net income included:

Positive factors affecting the change in net income included:

•

Higher sales

•

Cost savings from productivity improvement initiatives,
    including actions taken in 2005 and the closure of two European
    plants during the first six months of 2004

•

Benefit of a lower effective tax rate

Pressure-sensitive Materials (57% of net sales)

Our Pressure-sensitive Materials segment reported a 4% increase
in sales in 2005 compared to 2004. Approximately 60% of the
incremental sales was due to the positive impact of changes in
pricing and product mix, reflecting increased selling prices
implemented to offset higher raw material costs. This benefit
was partially offset by a decrease in core unit volume due in
part to the impact of the extra week in 2004. A decline in core
unit volume in North America, which reflected market share loss
(related to price increases), was partially offset by growth
from international sales. Foreign currency translation also
contributed to sales growth for this segment.

Operating income for this segment increased $38 million or
17% in 2005, reflecting cost savings from productivity
improvement initiatives, including the closure of two European
plants during the first six months of 2004. Operating income for
this segment included charges related to restructuring costs and
asset impairment in both 2005 and 2004. The impact of higher raw
material costs was offset by selling price increases.



Office and Consumer Products (21% of net
sales)

Our Office and Consumer Products segment reported a 3% decrease
in sales in 2005 compared to 2004. The decrease in sales was
primarily due to the impact of accelerated purchases in 2004 by
customers in advance of our 2005 selling price increases, and
the impact of an extra week in 2004. The decrease in core unit
volume was partially offset by a positive impact of changes in
pricing and product mix and the favorable impact of foreign
currency translation.

Operating income for this segment decreased $18 million or
10%, reflecting lower sales volume and the write-off of
inventories and equipment, primarily due to a product launch.
Operating income for this segment included a charge related to
restructuring costs and asset impairment charges in 2005. These
decreases were partially offset by cost savings from
productivity improvement initiatives. The 2005 selling price
increases offset the cumulative effect of raw material inflation
since the beginning of 2004.

Retail Information Services (12% of net sales)

The Retail Information Services segment reported a 6% increase
in sales in 2005 compared to 2004. Approximately 40% of the
increase was due to core unit volume growth, reflecting
continued growth of the business in Asia and Latin America. The
benefit to core unit volume was partially offset by additional
sales in 2004 as a result of customer preparation for increased
exports from China following the elimination of apparel
manufacturing quotas in January 2005. The balance of the growth
reflected incremental sales from acquisitions and the favorable
impact of foreign currency translation.

Operating income for this segment decreased $5 million or
11% due to charges for restructuring and asset impairments in
2005 and higher spending associated with growth initiatives.
Partially offsetting these factors was the benefit of
productivity improvement actions, including the ongoing
migration of production from Hong Kong to lower cost facilities
in mainland China.

Other specialty converting businesses (10% of net
sales)

Other specialty converting businesses reported a 5% increase in
sales in 2005 compared to 2004 due to core unit volume growth,
as well as the favorable impact of foreign currency translation.
Operating income for these businesses decreased $26 million
or 73% reflecting costs related to the development of the RFID
business and charges related to restructuring costs and asset
impairments in 2005. In 2005, due to the commercialization of
our RFID business, we have included RFID in this group of
businesses. Financial results of this group have been restated
for years presented herein to reflect this change.

Sales Growth by Region

Excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign
currency translation, we estimate sales growth (decline) in
major regions of operation as follows:




U.S.

(3

)%

5%

1%

Europe


%

5%

4%

Asia


%

26%

15%

Latin America


%

19%

15%

In the U.S., the decrease in 2005 was partially due to market
share loss and a slow market in Pressure-sensitive Materials, as
well as accelerated purchases in 2004 by Office and Consumer
Products customers in advance of our 2005 selling price
increases. These negative factors were partially offset by
selling price increases. Weaker demand in the U.S. also
reflected a practice among end users of our products to move
manufacturing outside the U.S. This shift is offset by
growth in emerging markets, where manufacturing has moved.



In Asia, the pace of growth in 2005 moderated throughout the
region, including China. The comparison to 2004 was also
affected by additional sales in the Retail Information Services
segment in 2004 as a result of customer preparation for
increased exports from China following the elimination of
apparel manufacturing quotas in January 2005.

In Latin America, the roll materials business was affected by
market share loss as a result of selling price increases,
although there was a benefit from higher selling prices.

In addition to the factors above, the impact of the extra week
in 2004 also affected comparisons of growth between 2005 and
2004 for all regions.

During the fourth quarter of 2005, we announced cost reduction
actions related to restructuring and anticipated product line
divestitures (discussed in “Acquisitions and
Divestitures” below). We recorded charges related to
severance and related costs and non-cash charges for asset
impairments, included in the table above. These actions impact
most businesses and geographic regions and are expected to be
completed by the end of 2006. The restructuring actions,
including anticipated charges in early 2006, are expected to
result in annualized pretax savings of $80 million to
$90 million when completed. We expect to reinvest some of
the savings into future growth opportunities. In addition to the
fourth quarter charges, other charges were recorded earlier in
2005 including the closure of our Gainesville, Georgia label
converting plant, which was completed during the third quarter
of 2005.

Also included in “Other Expense” in 2005 was an
accrual for legal expenses related to a patent lawsuit, offset
by gains on the sale of assets.

The restructuring charges associated with severance and asset
impairments recorded during 2004 were related to the completion
of the integration of the 2002 acquisition of Jackstädt
into our other existing businesses. We closed a manufacturing
facility in France during the first quarter of 2004 and a
manufacturing facility in Italy during the second quarter of
2004.

In 2003, the restructuring charges related to the integration of
Jackstädt and other productivity improvement initiatives.

See also Note 10 “Components of Other Income and
Expense,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
further detail.

Effective Rate of Taxes on Income

The effective tax rate was 20.4% for the full year 2005 compared
to 25.1% for the full year 2004. Our 2005 tax rate included
benefits from:

•

Changes in the geographic mix of income

•

Continued improvements in our global tax structure

•

Several favorable tax audit settlements

These benefits were partially offset by incremental expense
associated with the repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings
under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.



The effective tax rate for 2004 included the benefits from
changes in the geographic mix of income, continued improvements
in our global tax structure and several favorable global tax
audit settlements.

Free cash flow for 2005 decreased $63 million, due
primarily to lower net income. The changes in assets and
liabilities were partially offset by lower cash spending on
capital in 2005. See “Analysis of Results of
Operations” and “Liquidity” below for more
information. Free cash flow refers to cash flow from operating
activities less spending on property, plant and equipment, and
software. We use free cash flow as a measurement tool to assess
the cash flow available for other corporate purposes, such as
dividends, debt service and repurchase of common stock.

Acquisitions and Divestitures

In December 2005, we announced our plan to sell a business
consisting of raised reflective pavement markers, with sales of
approximately $23 million in 2005. Based on the estimated
value of this business, we concluded that associated goodwill
and intangible assets from our acquisition of this business were
impaired, resulting in a pretax charge of approximately
$74 million. The results of this business have been
accounted for as discontinued operations for the years presented
herein. This business was previously included in the
Pressure-sensitive Materials segment.

In December 2005, we also announced the expected divestiture of
two low-margin product lines. One of these divestitures, which
impacts the Office and Consumer Products segment, was completed
in February 2006. This product line had estimated sales of
$60 million in 2005, and minimal impact on income. The
expected divestiture of the second product line would reduce
annual sales by approximately $10 million, with minimal
impact to income from operations. As part of these expected
divestitures, we recorded charges of approximately
$6 million for severance and other employee-related costs,
and asset impairments of approximately $9 million, which
are included in the “Other Expense” line of our
Consolidated Statement of Income.

During the third quarter of 2004, we acquired Rinke Etiketten
(“Rinke”), a privately held company in Germany. The
incremental impact of this acquisition on our net sales was
approximately $9 million during 2004, with an additional
impact of approximately $18 million in 2005. This business
is reported in our Retail Information Services segment.

In October 2003, we completed the sale of our package label
converting business in Europe, which consisted of two package
label converting facilities in Denmark and a package label
converting facility in France, which combined, represented
approximately $30 million in sales in the first nine months
of 2003. The results from this business have been accounted for
as discontinued operations for 2003.

Investigations

In April 2003, we were notified by the U.S. Department of
Justice’s Antitrust Division (“DOJ”) that it had
initiated a criminal investigation into competitive practices in
the label stock industry, and on August 15, 2003, the DOJ
issued a subpoena to us in connection with the investigation. In
May 2004, the European Commission (“EC”) initiated
inspections and obtained documents from our pressure-sensitive
materials facilities in the Netherlands and Germany, seeking
evidence of unlawful anticompetitive activities. In July 2004,
we were notified by the Competition Law Division of the
Department of Justice of Canada that it was seeking information
in connection with a label stock investigation. In August 2005,
we were notified by the Australian Competition and Consumer
Commission that it was seeking information in connection with a
label



stock investigation. We are cooperating with these
investigations. We are a named defendant in purported class
actions in the U.S. seeking treble damages and other relief
for alleged unlawful competitive practices, which were filed
after the announcement of the DOJ investigation. We are also a
named defendant in purported class actions in the
U.S. seeking damages and other relief for alleged
disclosure and fiduciary duty violations pertaining to alleged
unlawful competitive practices. We have discovered instances of
improper conduct by certain employees in our European operations
that constituted an infringement of EC competition law.
Accordingly, we expect that the EC will impose a fine on us when
its investigation is completed. We have discovered instances of
conduct by certain employees in China that potentially violate
the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and we have
reported that conduct to authorities in the
U.S. Accordingly, we expect that fines or other penalties
may be incurred. We are unable to predict the effect of these
matters at this time, although the effect could well be adverse
and material. These matters are reported in Note 8
“Contingencies,” to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Outlook

In 2006, we anticipate unit volume growth in the range of 2% to
3%. This outlook is based on expected underlying growth of
approximately 4% to 5%, partially offset by the impact of
product line divestitures and withdrawal from some low-margin
private label business. We expect the positive impact from price
and mix to be offset by a negative effect of foreign currency
translation. These expectations are subject to changes in
economic and market conditions. Price increases in early 2006
are expected to offset raw material inflation incurred at the
end of 2005 and early 2006.

We expect our restructuring and business realignment efforts
will reduce costs by $80 million to $90 million when
completed. We estimate that 60% to 70% of these savings will be
achieved in 2006. However, we expect to reinvest some of the
savings into growth opportunities across the company. In
addition, we anticipate transitional costs related to our
productivity improvement actions to be approximately
$15 million to $20 million, which will be incurred in
2006. Transitional costs include accelerated depreciation on
assets expected to be retired by the end of 2006, costs of
moving equipment and other related costs.

To comply with the provisions of the reissued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” we will begin
recognizing expense for stock options in 2006. We expect this
pretax expense to be approximately $17 million in 2006
based on unvested stock options outstanding at year end 2005,
which will have an estimated $.12 per share impact on
earnings after tax.

We expect an increase in pretax expenses related to our pension
plans of approximately $7 million, due to changes in
actuarial assumptions for our U.S. and international plans.

We expect continued improvement in marketing, general and
administrative expenses as a percent of sales. Additionally, in
2006, we will be classifying shipping and handling costs as an
element of cost of goods sold for all businesses, to align our
businesses around a standard methodology. In 2005, several of
our businesses included these costs in marketing, general and
administrative expenses, totaling approximately
$145 million. Refer to the Shipping and Handling Costs
section in Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
further information.

The pretax loss from our RFID business in 2006 is expected to be
approximately $2 million to $7 million lower than in
2005 due to an increase in revenue and reduced spending.

We estimate that pretax interest expense will be between
$55 million to $60 million for 2006, assuming expected
interest rate increases will be offset by expected reductions in
debt.

We anticipate an annual effective tax rate in the range of 20%
to 23% for 2006, subject to changes in the geographic mix of
income, with potentially wide variances from quarter to quarter.

We expect free cash flow after capital spending and purchases of
software to be approximately $300 million to
$350 million for 2006.

We expect capital expenditures for 2006 to be approximately
$175 million to $200 million, funded through operating
cash flow. Major projects in 2006 include new investments for
expansion in China and



India, serving both our materials and retail information
services businesses, as well as spending for a new films coater
in the U.S.

Sales

Sales increased 3% in 2005 compared to an increase of 12% in
2004. A decrease in core unit volume in 2005 partially reflected
the loss of market share in our North American roll materials
business following our implementation of selling price increases
to offset higher raw material costs. The 2005 volume decline
also reflected the impact of an extra week in the 2004 fiscal
year and accelerated purchases by Office and Consumer Products
customers in advance of our 2005 selling price increases, both
of which contributed to higher growth in 2004. Combined, the
accelerated purchases and extra week in 2004 represented an
estimated $60 million to $70 million of the change in
sales between the two years.

We realized selling price increases in 2005 of an estimated
$100 million related to higher raw material costs. However,
we experienced some related share loss in our North American
roll materials business, as previously described.

In 2004, core unit volume also benefited from higher sales in
the Retail Information Services segment as a result of customer
preparation for increased exports from China following the
January 2005 elimination of apparel manufacturing quotas. These
benefits were partially offset by the impact of share loss with
one major customer in the Office and Consumer Products segment
in late 2003 (estimated to be $30 million).

Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on the
change in sales of approximately $77 million in 2005 and
approximately $207 million in 2004.

Incremental sales from acquisitions, net of product line
divestitures, contributed approximately $19 million in
2005. In 2004, product line divestitures more than offset
incremental sales from acquisitions; the net impact reduced
sales by approximately $33 million.

Gross Profit

Gross profit margin in both 2005 and 2004 benefited from our
ongoing productivity improvement initiatives, including the
completion of the integration of the Jackstädt business in
mid-2004, and cost reduction actions in 2005. Unfavorable
segment mix (faster growth in segments with lower gross profit
margin as a percent of sales) and raw material inflation
partially offset these benefits in both years.



In 2005, gross profit margin was also negatively impacted by:

•

Write-off of inventories (approximately $12 million),
    approximately half related to a product launch

•

Costs related to our RFID business (approximately
    $9 million)

In 2004, gross profit margin was also negatively impacted by
declining selling prices during the first half of the year
(estimated to be $38 million).

Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses

Marketing, general and administrative expense as a percent of
sales in 2005 and 2004 reflected the benefit of productivity
improvement initiatives and cost reduction actions.

Offsetting the benefit of these productivity improvements,
marketing, general and administrative expenses increased in 2005
due to:

In 2004, marketing, general and administrative expenses
increased due to the same factors which impacted 2005, as well
as higher insurance costs.

Interest Expense

Interest expense decreased slightly in 2005 and was unchanged in
2004. The decrease in 2005 was due to a reduction in total debt
outstanding, partially offset by an increase in interest rates.

Other Expense (Restructuring and Cost Reduction
Actions)

In 2005, other expense consisted of charges for cost reduction
actions and restructuring associated with several expected
product line divestitures, as well as other items:

•

Severance and other employee-related costs (approximately
    $38 million)

•

Asset impairment and lease cancellation costs (approximately
    $28 million)

•

Gain on the sales of assets, partially offset by costs for a
    legal accrual (net gain of approximately $2 million)

In 2004, other expense consisted of charges for productivity
improvement actions, primarily related to the completion of the
Jackstädt integration actions:

•

Severance and employee-related costs (approximately
    $24 million)

•

Impairment of assets (approximately $12 million)

In 2003, other expense consisted of charges for restructuring
related to the integration of Jackstädt, productivity
improvement initiatives and net losses associated with several
product line divestitures, as well as other items:

•

Severance and employee-related costs (approximately
    $22 million)

•

Impairment and planned disposition of property, plant and
    equipment, and lease cancellation costs (approximately
    $8 million)

•

Net losses associated with several product line divestitures and
    other associated costs (approximately $4 million)



•

Gain from settlement of a lawsuit, partially offset by net
    losses from disposition of fixed assets and costs associated
    with a plant closure (net gain of approximately $4 million)

Our 2005 tax rate included the benefit of changes in the
geographic mix of income and continued improvements in our
global tax structure, and a $9 million benefit from several
favorable global tax audit settlements. These benefits were
partially offset by the incremental expense of
$13.5 million associated with the repatriation of
accumulated foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation
Act of 2004.

Our 2004 effective tax rate included the benefit from changes in
the geographic mix of income, continued improvements in our
global tax structure and several favorable global tax audit
settlements, which reduced tax expense by approximately
$8 million.

Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations

Income (loss) from discontinued operations includes our raised
reflective pavement markers business in 2005, 2004 and 2003, as
well as our package label converting business in Europe in 2003.

Based on the estimated value of the raised reflective pavement
markers business that we are expecting to sell in 2006, we
concluded that associated goodwill and intangible assets from
our acquisition of this business were impaired. The resulting
pretax impairment charge was approximately $74 million in
2005.

Income from discontinued operations included net sales of
approximately $23 million in 2005 and approximately
$24 million in 2004. Net income from discontinued
operations in 2003 included a gain on sale of business of
$19.7 million, net of tax of $5.8 million. Income from
all discontinued operations included net sales of approximately
$70 million in 2003.

Net Sales

Sales in our Pressure-sensitive Materials segment increased 4%
in 2005 compared to 17% in 2004. A decline in core unit volume
in 2005 reflected the loss of market share in North America
following our implementation of selling price increases,
partially offset by growth internationally. The benefit to core
unit volume growth in 2004 resulting from an extra week in the
fiscal year partially contributed to slower growth in 2005.
Sales growth in 2005 was also affected by slow market conditions
in North America.

Sales growth in 2005 reflected the positive impact of pricing
and product mix, resulting from increased selling prices
implemented to offset higher raw material costs.

Increased sales in our roll materials business (approximately
$112 million) reflected increased selling prices, partially
offset by a decline in core unit volume. Our North American roll
materials business experienced a decline in sales of
approximately 3%, due to share loss related to higher selling
prices. Our roll materials business in Europe experienced sales
growth of approximately 7% in local currency resulting from
volume growth in the region, with stronger growth in the
emerging markets of Eastern Europe. Market expansion contributed
to sales growth for the roll materials business in Asia,
although the pace of growth moderated in this region compared to
the prior year. In Latin America, loss of market share from
selling price increases and loss of sales with a large customer
affected growth, partially offset by selling price increases.
Sales for the graphics and reflective business were comparable
to 2004.

In 2004, increased sales in our roll materials business
(approximately $365 million) reflected core unit volume
growth, including the extra week in the fiscal year. In North
America, strong growth in new film products and selling price
increases contributed to sales growth of approximately 9%. In
Europe, strong growth in the emerging markets of Eastern Europe
and the benefit of selling price increases contributed to sales
growth of approximately 9% in local currency. Strong market
growth and share gain contributed to sales growth in local
currency in Asia and Latin America.

Sales growth in 2004 in our graphics and reflective business
(approximately $63 million) reflected market growth, new
applications and customers, and geographic expansion.

Included in these increases was the favorable impact of foreign
currency translation of approximately $58 million in 2005
and approximately $146 million in 2004.



Operating Income

Increased operating income in both years reflected higher sales
and cost savings from productivity improvement initiatives,
including two plant closures related to the Jackstädt
integration in the first half of 2004. Also reflected in
operating income were charges related to restructuring, asset
impairments and lease cancellations in 2005 and 2004.

In 2004, this segment experienced rising raw material costs
throughout the year. While selling price increases partially
offset these increased costs, the net impact reduced operating
income for the year. In contrast, in 2005 the impact of higher
raw material costs was offset through selling price increases.

Net Sales

Sales in our Office and Consumer Products segment decreased 3%
in 2005, while sales increased by less than 1% in 2004. In 2004,
higher than usual volume in the fourth quarter was due in part
to customers’ accelerated purchases in advance of selling
price increases effective January 1, 2005, as well as the
benefit from an extra week in the 2004 fiscal year. The shift in
volume in late 2004 contributed to a decline in core unit volume
in 2005, as customers depleted related inventories.

In 2005, the positive impact of selling price increases
partially offset the decrease in core unit volume. Selling
prices were increased to offset higher raw material costs.

In 2004, increased volume resulting from accelerated purchases
and the extra week was offset by share loss with one major
customer in late 2003 (estimated $30 million impact in
2004), loss of sales from a discontinued product line
(approximately $14 million), reduced prices, and the
continued erosion in market share of our Avery-brand products,
in favor of private label brands.

Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on the
change in sales of approximately $8 million in 2005 and
approximately $35 million in 2004.

Operating Income

Operating income reflected charges related to restructuring,
asset impairment and net losses associated with product line
divestitures in 2005 and 2003. While 2004 operating income was
negatively affected by lower selling prices and rising raw
material costs, the 2005 selling price increases offset the
cumulative effect of raw material inflation over the two-year
period. The changes in operating income reflected the benefit
from continued cost reduction efforts, as well as the write-off
of inventories (approximately $9 million) and equipment,
primarily related to a product launch.

Net Sales

Sales in our Retail Information Services segment increased 6% in
2005 compared to 15% in 2004. The increase in both years was a
result of core unit volume growth and incremental sales from
acquisitions. Volume growth reflected continued growth of the
business in Asia and Latin America and new product
introductions. Sales in 2004 also reflected relatively weak
results in 2003 (related to slow industry conditions), the
impact of the extra week in the 2004 fiscal year and higher
sales as a result of customer preparation for increased exports
from China following the January 2005 elimination of apparel
manufacturing quotas.

The impact of acquisitions, net of product line divestitures,
was approximately $21 million in 2005. In 2004, incremental
sales from acquisitions were offset by the loss of sales from
product line divestitures.

Foreign currency translation contributed to the increase in
sales by approximately $7 million in 2005 and approximately
$12 million in 2004.

Operating Income

Operating income reflected charges related to restructuring,
asset impairment and lease cancellation in 2005 and 2003. In
2005, operating income benefited from productivity improvement
actions, including the ongoing migration of production from Hong
Kong to lower cost facilities in mainland China, partially
offset by higher costs associated with growth initiatives. The
increase in 2004 also reflected sales growth and the successful
integration of the 2002 acquisitions.

Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on the
change in sales of approximately $4 million in 2005 and
approximately $14 million in 2004.



Operating Income

The decreases in operating income in both 2005 and 2004
primarily reflect incremental costs related to the development
of the RFID business. Operating income also reflects charges
related to restructuring and asset impairment in 2005 and 2003.

Borrowings and Repayment of Debt

At year end 2005, our borrowings outstanding under foreign
short-term lines of credit were $108.3 million with a
weighted-average interest rate of 6.6% compared to
$70.8 million at year end 2004.



The $60 million one-year callable commercial notes issued
in January 2004 were paid at maturity in 2005. In June 2005, we
issued $75 million of one-year callable commercial notes at
a variable rate of 3.5%, and then called and paid the notes in
November 2005.

We had medium-term notes of $160 million and
$233 million outstanding at year end 2005 and 2004,
respectively. Decreases are a result of payments on maturity.
Medium-term notes have maturities from 2007 through 2025 and
accrue interest at fixed rates ranging from 5.9% to 7.5%.

In August 2004, we issued $150 million in floating rate
senior notes due in 2007 under our 2001 shelf registration
statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”). These notes are callable at par.

In February 2004, we paid the obligation related to the 1999
transaction with Steinbeis Holding GmbH (“Steinbeis”)
for approximately $106 million. This obligation was a
result of the combination of our office products business in
Europe with Zweckform Büro-Produkte GmbH.

Shareholders’ Equity

Our shareholders’ equity was $1.51 billion at year end
2005, compared to $1.55 billion at year end 2004. Our
annual dividend per share increased to $1.53 in 2005 from $1.49
in 2004.

In the fourth quarter of 2005, we repurchased
698,505 shares for $41 million under an agreement
related to the L&E Packaging (“L&E”)
acquisition and recorded such amount to treasury stock. (See the
Other section of “Contractual Obligations, Commitments and
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” below for further details.)
As of year end 2005, a cumulative 37.9 million shares of
our common stock had been repurchased since 1991, and
2.5 million shares remain available for repurchase under
the Board of Directors’ authorization.

Analysis of Selected Balance Sheet Accounts

Long-lived Assets

Goodwill decreased $38 million during 2005 due to foreign
currency translation (approximately $36 million), purchase
price allocation adjustments associated with the acquisition of
Rinke and the settlement of claims associated with the
acquisition of RVL Packaging, Inc., partially offset by goodwill
related to an acquisition in 2005 (approximately
$1 million).

Net other intangibles resulting from business acquisitions
decreased $17 million during 2005 due to amortization
expense recorded during 2005 (approximately $12 million)
and the impact of foreign currency translation (approximately
$8 million), partially offset by purchase price allocation
adjustments associated with the acquisition of Rinke
(approximately $3 million).

Other assets decreased approximately $78 million during
2005 due primarily to the impairment of goodwill and other
intangibles in a business held for sale. Refer to the
“Discontinued Operations” section of Note 1 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other Shareholders’ Equity Accounts

Our employee stock benefit trusts decreased $67 million,
due to a decrease in the market value of shares held in the
trust of $48 million during 2005, as well as issuance of
shares under our stock and incentive plans for 2005 of
approximately $19 million.

Effect of Foreign Currency

International operations generate approximately 55% of our net
sales. Our future results are subject to changes in political
and economic conditions and the impact of fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange and interest rates. To reduce our
income statement exposure to transactions in foreign currencies,
we enter into foreign exchange forward, option and swap
contracts, where available and appropriate.



Impact of Foreign Currency Translation:




(In millions)

Change in net sales

$


$


$


Change in net income




While there was a benefit from foreign currency translation in
2005, this decreased significantly in 2005 compared to prior
years, due to strengthening of the U.S. dollar. The benefit
in 2005 reflected the strength of the Euro, Brazilian real,
Canadian dollar and Korean won, against the U.S. dollar.
The impact of foreign currency fluctuations on net income is
smaller than the impact on net sales, because our products are
generally sourced in the currencies in which they are sold. As a
result, the impact of foreign exchange rates on sales is matched
with a partially offsetting impact on reported expenses, thereby
reducing the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on net
income.

Translation gains and losses for operations in hyperinflationary
economies were included in our net income. Operations are
treated as being in a hyperinflationary economy for accounting
purposes, based on the cumulative inflation rate over the past
three years. Operations in hyperinflationary economies consist
of our operations in Turkey and the Dominican Republic. These
operations were not significant to our consolidated financial
position or results of operations.

Analysis of Selected Financial Ratios

We utilize certain financial ratios to assess our financial
condition and operating performance, as discussed in detail
below.

Working Capital Ratio

Working capital (current assets minus current liabilities), as a
percent of net sales, decreased in 2005 primarily due to an
increase in short-term debt. Working capital from continuing
operations, as a percent of net sales, is shown below. We use
this non-GAAP measure as a tool to assess our working capital
requirements, because it excludes the impact of fluctuations due
to our financing activities. The timing of financing activities
is not necessarily related to our current operations and would
tend to distort the working capital ratio from period to period.
Our objective is to minimize our investment in working capital
from operations by reducing this ratio, to maximize cash flow
and return on investment.

In 2005, the increase in working capital from continuing
operations, as a percent of sales, was primarily due to changes
in accounts payable, income taxes payable, cash and cash
equivalents and refundable income taxes, partially offset by the
change in other accrued liabilities and trade accounts
receivable. These changes included the impact of currency.



Accounts Receivable Ratio

The average number of days sales outstanding was 58 days in
2005 compared to 60 days in 2004, calculated using a
four-quarter average accounts receivable balance. This decrease
reflects improved collections efforts across the businesses.

Inventory Ratio

Average inventory turnover was 8.5 in both 2005 and 2004,
calculated using a four-quarter average inventory balance. For
purposes of comparability, the ratio was calculated using a

52-week

year for 2004.

Our various loan agreements in effect at year end require that
we maintain specified ratios of consolidated debt and
consolidated interest expense in relation to certain measures of
income. We were in compliance with these covenants as shown in
the table above.

The fair value of our debt is estimated based on the discounted
amount of the related cash flows using the current rates offered
to us for debt of the same remaining maturities. At year end
2005 and 2004, the fair value of our total debt, including
short-term borrowings, was $1.1 billion and
$1.32 billion, respectively.

Decreases in these returns in 2005 compared to 2004 were
primarily due to lower net income. These ratios are computed
using actual net income and a five-quarter average denominator
for equity and total debt accounts.

Capital Resources

Capital resources include cash flows from operations and debt
financing. We maintain adequate financing arrangements at
competitive rates. These financing arrangements consist of our
commercial paper programs in the U.S. and Europe, committed and
uncommitted bank lines of credit in the countries where we
operate, callable commercial notes and long-term debt, including
medium-term notes.

Capital from Debt

Our total debt decreased approximately $124 million in 2005
to $1.09 billion compared to $1.21 billion at year end
2004, reflecting payments of debt and the effect of foreign
currency translation.



In July 2004, we entered into a revolving credit agreement with
ten domestic and foreign banks for a total commitment of
$525 million, expiring July 16, 2009. We use the
financing available under this agreement as a commercial paper

back-up

facility and to
finance other corporate requirements. There was no debt
outstanding under this agreement as of year end 2005.

In addition, we have a

364-day

revolving
credit facility with a foreign bank to provide up to Euro
30 million ($35.6 million) in borrowings through
July 19, 2006. We may extend the revolving period and due
date with the approval of the bank, on an annual basis. Our
intention is to renegotiate an extension of this facility in
2006. Financing under this agreement is used to finance cash
requirements of our European operations. As of year end 2005,
$15.4 million was outstanding under this agreement.

We had standby letters of credit outstanding of
$81.2 million and $81 million at the end of 2005 and
2004, respectively.

Our uncommitted lines of credit were approximately
$409 million at year end 2005. Our uncommitted lines of
credit do not have a commitment expiration date, and may be
cancelled by the banks or us at any time.

In the fourth quarter of 2004, we filed a shelf registration
statement with the SEC to permit the issuance of up to
$500 million in debt and equity securities. Proceeds from
the shelf offering may be used for general corporate purposes,
including repaying, redeeming or repurchasing existing debt, and
for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. As
of December 31, 2005, no securities had been issued under
the 2004 registration statement.

Credit ratings are a significant factor in our ability to raise
short-term and long-term financing. When determining a credit
rating, the rating agencies place significant weight on our
competitive position, business outlook, consistency of cash
flows, debt level and liquidity, geographic dispersion and
management team.

The credit ratings assigned to us also impact the interest rates
on our commercial paper and other borrowings.

Interest on floating rate debt was estimated using the index

We enter into operating leases primarily for office and
warehouse space and equipment for electronic data processing and
transportation. The terms of our leases do not impose
significant restrictions or unusual obligations, except for the
facility in Mentor, Ohio as noted below. The table above
includes minimum annual rental commitments on operating leases
having initial or remaining noncancellable lease terms of one
year or more.



We did not include purchase obligations or open purchase orders
at year end 2005 in the table of contractual obligations above,
because it is impracticable for us to either obtain such
information or provide a reasonable estimate due to the
decentralized nature of our purchasing systems.

In January 2006, we contributed $25 million to our domestic
pension plan, which is more than the amount required by
U.S. governmental agencies for 2006.

Industry Investigations

In April 2003, we were notified by the DOJ that it had initiated
a criminal investigation into competitive practices in the label
stock industry, and on August 15, 2003, the DOJ issued a
subpoena to us in connection with the investigation. In May
2004, the EC initiated inspections and obtained documents from
our pressure-sensitive materials facilities in the Netherlands
and Germany, seeking evidence of unlawful anticompetitive
activities. In July 2004, we were notified by the Competition
Law Division of the Department of Justice of Canada that it was
seeking information in connection with a label stock
investigation. In August 2005, we were notified by the
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission that it was
seeking information in connection with a label stock
investigation. We are cooperating with these investigations. We
are a named defendant in purported class actions in the
U.S. seeking treble damages and other relief for alleged
unlawful competitive practices, which were filed after the
announcement of the DOJ investigation. We are also a named
defendant in purported class actions in the U.S. seeking
damages and other relief for alleged disclosure and fiduciary
duty violations pertaining to alleged unlawful competitive
practices. We have discovered instances of improper conduct by
certain employees in our European operations that constituted an
infringement of EC competition law. We accordingly expect that
the EC will impose a fine on us when its investigation is
completed. We are unable to predict the effect of these matters
at this time, although the effect could well be adverse and
material. These matters are reported in Note 8
“Contingencies,” to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Environmental

We have been designated by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (“EPA”) and/or other responsible
state agencies as a potentially responsible party
(“PRP”) at fourteen waste disposal or waste recycling
sites, which are the subject of separate investigations or
proceedings concerning alleged soil and/or groundwater
contamination and for which no settlement of our liability has
been agreed upon. We are participating with other PRPs at such
sites, and anticipate that our share of cleanup costs will be
determined pursuant to remedial agreements to be entered into in
the normal course of negotiations with the EPA or other
governmental authorities.

We have accrued liabilities for such sites, including sites in
which governmental agencies have designated us as a PRP, where
it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or
amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. However, because of
the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and
remediation activities, future expense to remediate the
currently identified sites and any sites which could be
identified in the future for cleanup could be higher than the
liability currently accrued. Amounts currently accrued are not
significant to our consolidated financial position, and based
upon current information, we believe that it is unlikely that
the final resolution of these matters will significantly impact
our consolidated financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.

Other

We have contacted relevant authorities in the U.S. and reported
the results of an internal investigation of potential violations
of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The transactions
at issue were carried out by a small number of employees of our
reflectives business in China, and involved, among other things,
impermissible payments or attempted impermissible payments. The
payments or attempted payments and the contracts associated with
them appear to have been relatively minor in amount and of
limited duration. Corrective and disciplinary actions have been
taken. Sales of our reflectives business in China in 2005 were
approximately $7 million. Based on findings to date, no
changes to our previously filed financial statements are



warranted as a result of these matters. However, we expect that
fines or other penalties may be incurred. While we are unable to
predict the financial or operating impact of any such fines or
penalties, we believe that our behavior in detecting,
investigating, responding to and voluntarily disclosing these
matters to authorities should be viewed favorably.

We and our subsidiaries are involved in various other lawsuits,
claims and inquiries, most of which are routine to the nature of
the business. Based upon current information, we believe that
the resolution of these other matters will not materially affect
us.

We provide for an estimate of costs that may be incurred under
our basic limited warranty at the time product revenue is
recognized. These costs primarily include materials and labor
associated with the service or sale of products. Factors that
affect our warranty liability include the number of units
installed or sold, historical and anticipated rate of warranty
claims on those units, cost per claim to satisfy our warranty
obligation and availability of insurance coverage. As these
factors are impacted by actual experience and future
expectations, we assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty
liability and adjust the amounts as necessary.

On September 9, 2005, we completed the lease financing for
a commercial facility to be located in Mentor, Ohio. This
facility will be the new headquarters for our roll materials
worldwide division, and will consist generally of land,
buildings, equipment and office furnishings and equipment (the
“Facility”). We will lease the Facility under an
operating lease arrangement, which contains a residual value
guarantee of $33.4 million. We do not expect the residual
value of the Facility to be less than the amount guaranteed.

We participate in receivable financing programs, both
domestically and internationally, with several financial
institutions whereby we may request advances from these
financial institutions. At December 31, 2005, we guaranteed
approximately $19 million of these advances.

We guaranteed up to approximately $21 million of certain of
our foreign subsidiaries’ obligations to their suppliers as
of December 31, 2005.

In connection with the L&E acquisition in 2002, we issued
743,108 shares at $63.08 per share. We also entered
into an agreement with L&E whereby in the event the value of
our common shares fell below the price of the shares that were
issued to L&E (adjusted for dividends received), during the
period from January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2007,
L&E had the option to exercise a

true-up

right. Upon
exercise of this

true-up

right, we had
the option to (1) pay the difference in value to L&E,
in the form of (a) cash or (b) common shares, or
(2) repurchase the shares at the issued share price,
adjusted for dividends paid. The

true-up

obligation was
reduced by any shares sold by L&E to third parties. During
2005, L&E sold 44,603 shares to third parties. On
October 20, 2005, L&E notified us that it was
exercising its

true-up

right under the agreement for the remaining 698,505 shares.
We repurchased the remaining shares under the agreement for
$41 million in the fourth quarter of 2005.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

From time to time, we enter into transactions in the normal
course of business with related parties. We believe that such
transactions are at arm’s-length and for terms that would
have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties. One of our
directors, Peter W. Mullin is the chairman, chief executive
officer and a director of MC Insurance Services, Inc.
(“MC”), Mullin Insurance Services, Inc.
(“MINC”), and PWM Insurance Services, Inc.
(“PWM”), executive compensation and benefit
consultants and insurance agents. Mr. Mullin is also the
majority stockholder of MC, MINC and PWM (collectively referred
to as the “Mullin Companies”). We paid premiums to
insurance carriers for life insurance placed by the Mullin
Companies in connection with several of our employee benefit
plans. The Mullin Companies have advised us that they earned
commissions from such insurance carriers for the placement and
renewal of this insurance. The majority of these commissions
were allocated to and used by MC Insurance Agency Services, LLC
(an affiliate of MC) to administer benefit plans and provide
benefit statements to participants under several of our employee
benefit plans. The Mullin Companies own a minority interest in M
Financial Holdings, Inc. (“MFH”). Substantially all of
the life insurance policies, which we placed through the Mullin
Companies in



2005 and prior years, are issued by insurance carriers that
participate in reinsurance agreements entered into between these
insurance carriers and M Life Insurance Company (“M
Life”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of MFH. Reinsurance
returns earned by M Life are determined annually by the
insurance carriers and can be negative or positive, depending
upon the results of M Life’s aggregate reinsurance pool,
which consists of the insured lives reinsured by M Life. The
Mullin Companies have advised us that they participated in net
reinsurance gains of M Life. None of these transactions were
significant to our financial position or results of operations.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
for the reporting period and as of the financial statement date.
These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities
and the reported amounts of revenue and expense. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

Critical accounting policies are those that are important to the
portrayal of our financial condition and results, and which
require us to make difficult, subjective and/or complex
judgments. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters
that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of
such matters is unknown. We believe that critical accounting
policies include accounting for revenue recognition, sales
returns and allowances, accounts receivable allowances,
inventory reserves, long-lived asset impairments, pensions and
postretirement benefits, income taxes, restructuring and
severance costs and litigation.

Revenue Recognition

Sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, product delivery has occurred, pricing is fixed or
determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Sales,
provisions for estimated sales returns, and the cost of products
sold are recorded at the time title transfers to customers.
Actual product returns are charged against estimated sales
return allowances.

Sales rebates and discounts are common practice in the
industries in which we operate. Volume, promotional, price, cash
and other discounts and customer incentives are accounted for as
a reduction to gross sales. Rebates and discounts are recorded
based upon estimates at the time products are sold. These
estimates are based upon historical experience for similar
programs and products. We review such rebates and discounts on
an ongoing basis and accruals for rebates and discounts are
adjusted, if necessary, as additional information becomes
available.

Sales Returns and Allowances

Sales returns and allowances represent credits we grant to our
customers (both affiliated and non-affiliated) for the return of
unsatisfactory product or a negotiated allowance in lieu of
return. We accrue for



returns and allowances based upon the gross price of the
products sold and historical experience for such products. We
record these allowances based on the following factors:
(i) customer specific allowances; and (ii) an
estimated amount, based on our historical experience, for issues
not yet identified.

Accounts Receivable Allowances

We are required to make judgments as to the collectibility of
accounts receivable based on established aging policy,
historical experience and future expectations. The allowances
for doubtful accounts represent allowances for customer trade
accounts receivable that are estimated to be partially or
entirely uncollectible. These allowances are used to reduce
gross trade receivables to their net realizable value. We record
these allowances based on estimates related to the following
factors: (i) customer specific allowances;
(ii) amounts based upon an aging schedule; and
(iii) an estimated amount, based on our historical
experience, for issues not yet identified. No single customer
represented 10% or more of our net sales or trade receivables at
year end 2005 and 2004. However, our ten largest customers at
year end 2005 represented approximately 20% of trade accounts
receivable and consisted of six customers of our Office and
Consumer Products segment, three customers of our
Pressure-sensitive Materials segment and one customer of both
these segments. The financial position and operations of these
customers are monitored on an ongoing basis.

Inventory Reserves

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value and
are categorized as raw materials,

work-in

-progress or
finished goods. Inventory reserves are recorded for damaged,
obsolete, excess and slow-moving inventory. We use estimates to
record these reserves. Slow-moving inventory is reviewed by
category and may be partially or fully reserved for depending on
the type of product and the length of time the product has been
included in inventory.

Long-lived Asset Impairments

We record impairment charges when the carrying amounts of
long-lived assets are determined not to be recoverable.
Impairment is measured by assessing the usefulness of an asset
or by comparing the carrying value of an asset to its fair
value. Fair value is typically determined using quoted market
prices, if available, or an estimate of undiscounted future cash
flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its
eventual disposition. The amount of impairment loss is
calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the fair
value. Changes in market conditions and management strategy have
historically caused us to reassess the carrying amount of our
long-lived assets.

Pensions and Postretirement Benefits

Assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations
and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plan and other
postretirement benefits plans are evaluated by management in
consultation with outside actuaries who are relied upon as
experts. In the event we determine that changes are warranted in
the assumptions used, such as the discount rate, expected long
term rate of return, or health care costs, future pension and
postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease. Due
to changing market conditions or changes in the participant
population, the actuarial assumptions we use may differ from
actual results, which could have a significant impact on our
pension and postretirement liability and related cost.

Discount Rate

We, in consultation with our actuaries, annually review and
determine the discount rates to be used in connection with our
postretirement obligations. The assumed discount rate for each
pension plan reflects market rates for high quality corporate
bonds currently available. In the U.S., our discount rate was
determined by evaluating several yield curves consisting of
large populations of high quality corporate bonds. The projected
pension benefit payment streams were then matched with the bond
portfolios to determine a rate that reflected the liability
duration unique to our plans.



Long-term Return on Assets

We determine the long-term rate of return assumption for plan
assets by reviewing the historical and expected returns of both
the equity and fixed income markets, taking into consideration
that assets with higher volatility typically generate a greater
return over the long run. Additionally, current market
conditions, such as interest rates, are evaluated and peer data
is reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness.

Healthcare Cost Trend Rate

Our practice is to fund the cost of the postretirement benefits
on a cash basis. For measurement purposes, an 8% annual rate of
increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits
was assumed for 2006. This rate is expected to decrease to
approximately 5% by 2009.

Income Taxes

Deferred tax liabilities or assets reflect temporary differences
between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and
tax reporting purposes. Such amounts are adjusted, as
appropriate, to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in
effect when the temporary differences reverse. A valuation
allowance is recorded to reduce our deferred tax assets to the
amount that is more likely than not to be realized.

When establishing a valuation allowance, we consider future
sources of income such as forecasted earnings, the mix of
earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and prudent
and feasible tax planning. In the event we determine that we
would not be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the
future, the valuation adjustment to the deferred tax assets is
charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a
determination. Likewise, if later it is determined that it is
more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be
realized, we would reverse the previously provided valuation
allowance.

We calculate current and deferred tax provisions based on
estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual
results reflected in income tax returns filed during the
following year. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded
when identified in the subsequent year.

The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits
by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. Our estimate of
the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to
management’s assessment of relevant risks, facts, and
circumstances existing at that time. We believe that we have
adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable outcomes related
to these matters. However, our future results may include
favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax
liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved,
which may impact our effective tax rate on a quarterly basis.

Restructuring and Severance Costs

We account for restructuring costs including severance and other
costs associated with exit or disposal activities following the
guidance provided in SFAS No. 112, “Accounting
for Postemployment Benefits,” and SFAS No. 146,
“Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities.” In the U.S., we have a severance pay plan
(“Pay Plan”), which provides eligible employees with
severance payments in the event of an involuntary termination
due to qualifying cost reduction actions. We calculate severance
pay using the severance benefits formula under the Pay Plan.
Accordingly, we record provisions for such amounts and other
related exit costs when they are probable and estimable as set
forth under SFAS No. 112. In the absence of a Pay
Plan, liability for severance and other employee-related costs
are recognized when the liability is incurred and follow the
guidance of SFAS No. 146.

Litigation

We are currently involved in various lawsuits, claims and
inquiries, most of which are routine to the nature of the
business, and in accordance with SFAS No. 5,
“Accounting for Contingencies,” we accrue estimates of
the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these
claims. The ultimate resolution of these claims could affect our
future results of operations for any particular quarterly or
annual period should



our exposure be materially different from our earlier estimates
or should liabilities be incurred that were not previously
accrued.

RECENT ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS

During 2005, we adopted several accounting and financial
disclosure requirements by the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”), Emerging Issues Task Force
(“EITF”) and Financial Interpretations by the FASB,
none of which has had a significant impact on our financial
results of operations and financial position. (Refer to
Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
more information).

In January 2006, we adopted the recognition provisions of
SFAS 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” following the
guidance under modified prospective application and expect that
the associated expense will be approximately $17 million in
2006 based on unvested stock options outstanding at year end
2005. Such expense will have an estimated $.12 per share
impact on earnings after tax.

RISK FACTORS (SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT)

The matters discussed in this Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and
other sections of this Annual Report contain
“forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These
statements, which are not statements of historical fact, may
contain estimates, assumptions, projections and/or expectations
regarding future events, which may or may not occur. Words such
as “aim,” “anticipate,” “assume,”
“believe,” “continue,” “could,”
“estimate,” “expect,” “guidance,”
“intend,” “may,” “objective,”
“plan,” “potential,” “project,”
“seek,” “shall,” “should,”
“target,” “will,” “would,” or
variations thereof and other expressions, which refer to future
events and trends, identify forward-looking statements. Such
forward-looking statements, and financial or other business
targets, are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which
could cause actual results to differ materially from expected
results, performance or achievements of the Company expressed or
implied by such forward-looking statements.

Certain of such risks and uncertainties are discussed in more
detail in Part 1, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”
above, and include, but are not limited to, risks and
uncertainties relating to investment in development activities
and new production facilities, timely development and successful
market acceptance of new products, fluctuations in cost and
availability of raw materials, ability of the Company to achieve
and sustain targeted cost reductions, impact of competitive
products and pricing, business mix shift, credit risks, ability
to obtain adequate financing arrangements, fluctuations in
pension, insurance and employee benefit costs, successful
integration of acquisitions, successful implementation of new
manufacturing technologies and installation of manufacturing
equipment, customer and supplier concentrations, financial
condition and inventory strategies of customers, changes in
customer order patterns, loss of significant contract(s) or
customer(s), legal proceedings, including the DOJ criminal
investigation, as well as the European Commission
(“EC”), Canadian Department of Justice, and Australian
Competition and Consumer Commission investigations, into
industry competitive practices and any related proceedings or
lawsuits pertaining to these investigations or to the subject
matter thereof (including purported class actions seeking treble
damages for alleged unlawful competitive practices, and
purported class actions related to alleged disclosure and
fiduciary duty violations pertaining to alleged unlawful
competitive practices, which were filed after the announcement
of the DOJ investigation, as well as a likely fine by the EC in
respect of certain employee misconduct in Europe), impact of
potential violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act based on issues in China, changes in governmental
regulations, fluctuations in interest rates, fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates and other risks associated with
foreign operations, changes in economic or political conditions,
acts of war, terrorism, natural disasters, impact of
epidemiological events on the economy, the Company’s
customers and suppliers, and other factors.



The Company believes that the most significant risk factors that
could affect its ability to achieve its stated financial
expectations in the near-term include:

Any forward-looking statements should also be considered in
light of the factors detailed in Part 1, Item 1A,
“Risk Factors,” above.

The Company’s forward-looking statements represent judgment
only on the dates such statements were made. By making any
forward-looking statements, the Company assumes no duty to
update them to reflect new, changed or unanticipated events or
circumstances, other than as may be required by law.

Item 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Risk Management

We are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates and
foreign currency exchange rates.

Our policy is not to purchase or hold foreign currency, interest
rate or commodity contracts for trading purposes.

Our objective in managing the exposure to foreign currency
changes is to reduce the risk to our earnings and cash flow
associated with foreign exchange rate changes. As a result, we
enter into foreign exchange forward, option and swap contracts
to reduce risks associated with the value of our existing
foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and
anticipated foreign revenues and costs, when available and
appropriate. The gains and losses on these contracts are
intended to offset changes in the related exposures. We do not
hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that would
entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange
rates on our consolidated net income.

Our objective in managing our exposure to interest rate changes
is to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and
cash flows. To achieve our objectives, we may periodically use
interest rate contracts to manage net exposure to interest rate
changes related to our borrowings. In connection with the
issuance of the $250 million

10-year

senior notes in
2003, we settled a forward starting interest rate swap at a loss
of approximately $32.5 million. The loss is currently being
amortized to interest expense over 10 years, which
corresponds to the term of the related debt.

Additionally, we enter into certain natural gas futures
contracts to reduce the risks associated with anticipated
domestic natural gas used in manufacturing and operations. These
amounts are not material to our financial statements.

In the normal course of operations, we also face other risks
that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable. Such risks
principally include changes in economic or political conditions,
other risks associated with foreign operations, commodity price
risk and litigation risk, which are not represented in the
analyses that follow.



Foreign Exchange Value-At-Risk

We use a Value-At-Risk (“VAR”) model to determine the
estimated maximum potential one-day loss in earnings associated
with both our foreign exchange positions and contracts. This
approach assumes that market rates or prices for foreign
exchange positions and contracts are normally distributed. The
VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions.
Firm commitments, accounts receivable and accounts payable
denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these
instruments are intended to hedge, were included in the model.
Forecasted transactions, which certain of these instruments are
intended to hedge, were excluded from the model. The VAR was
estimated using a variance-covariance methodology based on
historical volatility for each currency. The volatility and
correlation used in the calculation were based on two-year
historical data obtained from one of our domestic banks. A 95%
confidence level was used for a one-day time horizon.

The VAR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to
represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred by
us, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable
changes in market factors.

The estimated maximum potential one-day loss in earnings for our
foreign exchange positions and contracts was approximately
$4.5 million at year end 2005.

Interest Rate Sensitivity

An assumed 28 basis point move in interest rates (10% of
our weighted-average interest rate on floating rate debt)
affecting our variable-rate borrowings would have had an
immaterial effect on our 2005 earnings.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

As of the end of the
period covered by this report, the Company carried out an
evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of
its management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the
Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in
Rule

13a-15(e)

or

15d-15(e)

of the
Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, the Company’s
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting.

Management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
(as defined in
Rule

13a-15(f)

or

15d-15(f)

of the
Exchange Act). Under the supervision and with the participation
of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted
an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over
financial reporting based upon the framework in



Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on that evaluation, the Company’s
management concluded that its internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of December 31, 2005. (See
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting on page 64 in the Company’s 2005 Annual
Report to Shareholders.)

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005, has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their Report of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm on page 65 in the
Company’s 2005 Annual Report to Shareholders, and is
incorporated herein by reference.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

There has been no change in the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting during the Company’s most recent
fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting.
