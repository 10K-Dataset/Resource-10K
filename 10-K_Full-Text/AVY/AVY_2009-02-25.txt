PART I

Item 1.

BUSINESS

Avery Dennison Corporation (“Avery Dennison,” the
    “Company,” “Registrant,” “Issuer,”
    which may be referred to as “we” or “us”)
    was incorporated in 1977 in the state of Delaware as Avery
    International Corporation, the successor corporation to a
    California corporation of the same name, which was incorporated
    in 1946. In 1990, the Company merged one of its subsidiaries
    into Dennison Manufacturing Company (“Dennison”), as a
    result of which Dennison became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
    Company, and in connection with which Company’s name was
    changed to Avery Dennison Corporation.

Our homepage on the
    internet is www.averydennison.com and you can learn more about
    us by visiting our Web site. Our Web site address provided in
    this annual report on

Form 10-K

is not intended to function as a hyperlink and the information
    on our Web site is not and should not be considered part of this
    report and is not incorporated by reference in this document.

Our businesses include the production of pressure-sensitive
    materials, office products and a variety of tickets, tags,
    labels and other converted products. Some pressure-sensitive
    materials are sold to label printers and converters that
    “convert” the materials into labels and other products
    through embossing, printing, stamping and die-cutting. Some are
    sold by us in converted form as printable media, tapes and
    reflective sheeting. We also manufacture and sell a variety of
    office products and other converted products and other items not
    involving pressure-sensitive components, such as binders,
    organizing systems, markers, fasteners, business forms, as well
    as tickets, tags, radio-frequency identification
    (“RFID”) inlays, and imprinting equipment for retail
    and apparel manufacturers.

A pressure-sensitive, or self-adhesive, material is one that
    adheres to a surface by press-on contact. It generally consists
    of four elements: a face material, which may be paper, metal
    foil, plastic film or fabric; an adhesive, which may be
    permanent or removable; a release coating; and a backing
    material to protect the adhesive against premature contact with
    other surfaces, and which can also serve as the carrier for
    supporting and dispensing individual labels. When the products
    are to be used, the release coating and protective backing are
    removed, exposing the adhesive, and the label or other face
    material is pressed or rolled into place.

Because self-adhesive materials are easy to apply without the
    need for adhesive activation, the use of self-adhesive materials
    often provides cost savings compared with other materials that
    require heat- or moisture-activated adhesives. Self-adhesive
    materials also provide consistent and versatile adhesion and are
    available in a large selection of materials in nearly any size,
    shape and color.

Our reporting segments are:

•

Pressure-sensitive Materials

•

Retail Information Services

•

Office and Consumer Products

In addition to our reporting segments, we have other specialty
    converting businesses comprised of several businesses that
    produce specialty tapes and highly engineered labels including
    RFID inlays and labels, and other converted products.

Although our segment structure remained the same as reported in
    the prior year, in 2008, we transferred a business from our
    other specialty converting businesses to Retail Information
    Services to align with a change in our internal reporting
    structure. Prior year amounts included herein have been
    reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

On June 15, 2007, we completed the acquisition of Paxar
    Corporation (“Paxar”), a global leader in retail tag,
    ticketing, and branding systems. The Paxar operations are
    included in the Company’s Retail Information Services
    segment. In accordance with the terms of the acquisition
    agreement, each outstanding share of Paxar common stock was
    converted into the right to receive $30.50 in cash. See Retail
    Information Services Segment below for further information.

On April 1, 2008, we completed the acquisition of DM Label
    Group (“DM Label”), a manufacturer of labels, tags and
    tickets for retail and apparel applications, including woven
    labels. DM Label operations are included in the



Company’s Retail Information Services segment. Since the
    acquisition, the impact of this acquisition on our revenues was
    approximately $36 million.

In 2008, the Pressure-sensitive Materials segment contributed
    approximately 54% of our total sales, while the Retail
    Information Services and Office and Consumer Products segments
    contributed approximately 23% and 14%, respectively, of our
    total sales.

In 2008, international operations constituted a significant
    portion of our business and represented approximately 65% of our
    sales. We expanded our operations, focusing particularly on
    Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe. As of December 27,
    2008, we operated approximately 200 manufacturing and
    distribution facilities located in over 60 countries, and
    employed approximately 36,000 persons worldwide.

We are subject to certain risks referred to in Item 1A,
    “Risk Factors,” and Item 3, “Legal
    Proceedings,” below, including those normally attending
    international and domestic operations, such as changes in
    economic or political conditions, currency fluctuations,
    exchange control regulations and the effect of international
    relations and domestic affairs of foreign countries on the
    conduct of business, legal proceedings, and the availability and
    pricing of raw materials.

Except as set forth below, no single customer represented 10% or
    more of our net sales or trade receivables at year end 2008 and
    2007. However, our ten largest customers at year end 2008
    represented approximately 13% of trade accounts receivable and
    consisted of five customers of our Office and Consumer Products
    segment, four customers of our Pressure-sensitive Materials
    segment and one customer of both these segments. The financial
    position and operations of these customers are monitored on an
    ongoing basis (see “Critical Accounting Policies and
    Estimates” of Item 7, “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial
    Condition”). United States export sales are not a
    significant part of our business. Backlogs are not considered
    material in the industries in which we compete.

Pressure-sensitive
    Materials Segment

The Pressure-sensitive Materials segment manufactures and sells
    Fasson-, JAC-, and Avery Dennison-brand pressure-sensitive
    materials, Avery-brand graphics and graphic films, Avery
    Dennison-brand reflective products, and performance polymers.
    The business of this segment is generally not seasonal, except
    for certain outdoor graphics and reflective products and
    operations in Western Europe. Pressure-sensitive materials
    consist primarily of papers, plastic films, metal foils and
    fabrics, which are coated with Company-developed and purchased
    adhesives,



and then laminated with specially coated backing papers and
    films. They are sold in roll or sheet form with either solid or
    patterned adhesive coatings, and are available in a wide range
    of face materials, sizes, thicknesses and adhesive properties.
    These materials are sold to label printers and converters for
    labeling, decorating, fastening, electronic data processing and
    special applications on a worldwide basis.

Graphic products consist of a variety of films and other
    products sold to the architectural, commercial sign, digital
    printing, and other related markets. We also sell durable cast
    and reflective films to the construction, automotive, and fleet
    transportation markets, scrim-reinforced vinyl material for
    banner sign applications, and reflective films for traffic and
    safety applications. Our graphic and reflective businesses are
    organized on a worldwide basis to serve the expanding commercial
    graphic arts market, including wide-format digital printing
    applications. We also manufacture and sell proprietary films
    that are used for outdoor, weather-resistant applications.

Performance polymer products include a range of solvent- and
    emulsion-based acrylic polymer adhesives, protective coatings
    and other polymer additives for internal use, as well as for
    sale to other companies.

In this segment, our larger competitors are Raflatac, a
    subsidiary of UPM-Kymmene; Morgan Adhesives
    (“MACtac”), a division of the Bemis Company; and 3M
    Company (for graphic and reflective products). Entry of
    competitors into the field of pressure-sensitive adhesives and
    materials may be limited by capital requirements and a need for
    technical knowledge. We believe that our relative size and scale
    of operations, our ability to serve our customers with a broad
    line of quality products and service programs, our distribution
    and brand strength, and the development and commercialization of
    new products are among the more significant factors in
    developing and maintaining our competitive position.

Retail
    Information Services Segment

The Retail Information Services segment designs, manufactures
    and sells a wide variety of price marking and brand
    identification products for retailers, apparel manufacturers,
    distributors and industrial customers on a worldwide basis. The
    business of this segment is seasonal, with higher volume
    generally in advance of the back-to-school, spring, and holiday
    shipping periods.

Our brand identification products include woven and printed
    labels, graphic tags and barcode tags. Our information
    management products include price tickets, carton labels, RFID
    tags and printing applications for supply chain and security
    management. Our solution enabling products include barcode
    printers, molded plastic fastening and application devices and
    security management products.

As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Paxar in
    June 2007. The combination of the Paxar business into this
    segment increases our presence in the retail information and
    brand identification market, broadens the range of our product
    and service capabilities, and improves our ability to meet
    customer demands for product innovation. The integration of this
    acquisition into our operations has resulted in significant cost
    synergies.

In this segment, some of our competitors are SML Group,
    Checkpoint Systems, Inc. and Shore To Shore, Inc. We believe
    that our ability to serve our customers with product innovation,
    a comprehensive brand identification and information management
    product line, our global distribution network, service, quality,
    and geographic reach are the key advantages in developing and
    maintaining our competitive position.

Office
    and Consumer Products Segment

The Office and Consumer Products segment manufactures and sells
    a wide range of Avery-brand printable media and other products.
    The business of this segment is seasonal, with higher volume
    related to the back-to-school season.

This segment’s products are generally sold through office
    products superstores, mass market distributors, wholesalers and
    dealers. We manufacture and sell a wide range of Avery-brand
    products for office, school and home uses: printable media, such
    as copier, ink-jet and laser printer labels, related computer
    software, ink-jet and laser printer card and index products; and
    organization, filing and presentation products, such as binders,
    dividers and sheet protectors. We also offer a wide range of
    other stationery products, including writing instruments,
    markers,



adhesives and specialty products under brand names such as
    Avery,

Marks-A-Lot

and HI-LITER. The extent of product offerings varies by
    geographic market.

In this segment, our larger competitors are Acco Brands
    Corporation, Esselte Corporation and manufacturers of private
    brands. We believe that our brand strength, a large installed
    base of software that facilitates the use of many of our
    products, our ability to serve our customers with a broad line
    of quality products, and the development and commercialization
    of new products are among the more significant factors in
    developing and maintaining our competitive position.

Other
    specialty converting businesses

Other specialty converting businesses include our specialty
    tape, industrial, performance films and automotive products,
    business media, RFID and security printing businesses. These
    businesses manufacture and sell specialty tapes, highly
    engineered films, RFID inlays, pressure-sensitive postage stamps
    and other converted products. These businesses are generally not
    seasonal, except for certain automotive products due to plant
    shutdowns by automotive manufacturers.

The specialty tape business manufactures and sells single- and
    double-coated tapes and adhesive transfer tapes for use in
    non-mechanical fastening, bonding and sealing systems in various
    industries, which are sold to industrial and medical original
    equipment manufacturers, converters, and disposable diaper
    producers worldwide. These products are sold in roll form and
    are available in a wide range of face materials, sizes,
    thicknesses and adhesive properties.

Our industrial and automotive products businesses primarily
    consist of custom pressure-sensitive and heat-seal labels for
    the automotive and durable goods industries. These products are
    sold primarily to original equipment manufacturers.

Our performance films business produces a variety of decorative
    and functional films, primarily for the automotive industry,
    that are designed for injection mold applications.

Our business media business designs and markets customized
    products for printing and information workflow applications.

Our RFID business manufactures RFID inlays and labels and makes
    use of our existing distribution by marketing to our label
    converting customers.

Our security printing business manufactures and sells
    self-adhesive battery labels to a battery manufacturer, and
    self-adhesive stamps to the U.S. Postal Service.

In addition, we sell specialty print-receptive films to the
    industrial label market, metallic dispersion products to the
    packaging industry, and proprietary wood grain and other
    patterns of film laminates for housing exteriors, and interior
    and exterior automotive applications.

We compete with a number of diverse businesses. Our largest
    competitor for this group of businesses is 3M Company in the
    specialty tape business. Entry of competitors into these
    specialty converting businesses may be limited by capital and
    technical requirements. We believe that our ability to serve our
    customers with quality, cost effective products and the
    development and commercialization of new products are among the
    more significant factors in developing and maintaining our
    competitive position.

Research
    and Development

Many of our current products are the result of our research and
    development efforts. Our expenses for research, design and
    testing of new products and applications by our operating units
    and the Avery Research Center (the “Research Center”)
    located in Pasadena, California were $94 million in 2008,
    $95.5 million in 2007, and $87.9 million in 2006. A
    significant number of our research and development activities
    are conducted at the Research Center, which supports each of our
    operating segments.

Our operating units’ research efforts are directed
    primarily toward developing new products and operating
    techniques and improving product performance, often in close
    association with customers. The Research Center



supports our operating units’ patent and product
    development work, and focuses on improving adhesives, materials
    and coating processes, as well as related product applications
    and ventures. These efforts often focus on projects relating to
    printing and coating technologies, as well as adhesive, release
    and ink chemistries.

The loss of individual patents or licenses would not be material
    to us taken as a whole, nor to our operating segments
    individually. Our principal trademarks are Avery, Fasson, Avery
    Dennison and the Company’s symbol. These trademarks are
    significant in the markets in which our products compete.

Three-Year
    Summary of Segment Information

Certain financial information on our reporting segments and
    other specialty converting businesses for the three years ended
    December 27, 2008, which appear in Note 12,
    “Segment Information,” in the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements beginning on page 69 of our 2008
    Annual Report to Shareholders, are incorporated herein by
    reference.

Other
    Matters

We use various raw materials, primarily paper, plastic films and
    resins, as well as specialty chemicals purchased from various
    commercial and industrial sources, which are subject to price
    fluctuations. Although shortages could occur from time to time,
    these raw materials are generally available.

We produce a majority of our self-adhesive materials using
    water-based emulsion and hot-melt adhesive technologies.
    Emissions from these operations contain small amounts of
    volatile organic compounds, which can be regulated by agencies
    of federal, state, local and foreign governments. We continue to
    evaluate the use of alternative materials and technologies to
    minimize these emissions.

A portion of our manufacturing process for self-adhesive
    materials utilizes certain organic solvents which, unless
    controlled, would be emitted into the atmosphere. Emissions of
    these substances are regulated by agencies of federal, state,
    local and foreign governments. In connection with the
    maintenance and acquisition of certain manufacturing equipment,
    we invest in solvent capture and control units to assist in
    regulating these emissions.

We have developed adhesives and adhesive processing systems that
    minimize the use of solvents. Emulsion adhesives, hot-melt
    adhesives or solventless silicone systems have been installed in
    our facilities in Peachtree City, Georgia; Fort Wayne and
    Greenfield, Indiana; and Quakertown, Pennsylvania; as well as in
    other plants in the United States, Argentina, Australia,
    Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, France, Germany,
    India, Korea, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands,
    South Africa, Thailand and the United Kingdom.

Based on current information, we do not believe that the cost of
    complying with applicable laws regulating the discharge of
    materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the
    protection of the environment, will have a material effect upon
    our capital expenditures, consolidated financial position or
    results of operations.

For information regarding our potential responsibility for
    cleanup costs at certain hazardous waste sites, see “Legal
    Proceedings” (Part I, Item 3) and
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of
    Operations and Financial Condition” (Part II,
    Item 7).

Item 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

Our ability to attain our goals and objectives is materially
    dependent on numerous factors and risks, including but not
    limited to, the following:

The
    demand for our products is impacted by the effects of, and
    changes in, worldwide conditions, which could have an adverse
    effect on our sales and profitability.

We have operations in over 60 countries and our domestic and
    international operations are strongly influenced by matters
    beyond our control, including changes in the political, social,
    economic and labor conditions, tax laws (including
    U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), and international
    trade regulations (including tariffs) in the countries in which
    we operate, as well as the impact of these conditions on the
    underlying demand for our products.



Adverse
    conditions in the global economy and disruption of financial
    markets could negatively impact our customers, suppliers and our
    business.

Financial markets in the United States, Europe and Asia have
    experienced significant disruption in recent months, including,
    among other things, significant volatility in security prices,
    severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating
    downgrades, declines in asset valuations, inflation, reduced
    consumer spending, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
    rates. While currently these conditions have not impaired our
    ability to access credit markets and finance our operations,
    there can be no assurance that there will not be a further
    deterioration in financial markets in major economies. These
    economic developments affect our customers and our suppliers and
    businesses such as ours. In addition, they could have a variety
    of negative effects such as reduction in revenues, increased
    costs, lower gross margin percentages, increased allowances for
    doubtful accounts

and/or

write-offs of accounts receivable, require recognition of
    impairments of capitalized assets, including goodwill and other
    intangibles, and could otherwise have material adverse effects
    on our business, results of operations, financial condition and
    cash flows.

We are not able to predict the duration and severity of the
    current disruption in financial markets and adverse economic
    conditions in the U.S. and other countries.

Foreign
    currency exchange rates, and fluctuations in those rates, may
    affect our sales and profitability.

Approximately 65% of our sales are from international
    operations. Fluctuations in currencies can cause transaction,
    translation and other losses to us, which can negatively impact
    our sales and profitability. Margins on sales of our products in
    foreign countries could be materially and adversely affected by
    foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

We monitor our foreign currency exposures and may, from time to
    time, use hedging instruments to mitigate exposure to certain
    transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The use of such
    hedging activities may not offset any, or more than a portion
    of, the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in
    foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in
    place.

We are
    affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences. If
    we do not compete effectively, we could lose market share and
    experience falling prices, adversely affecting our financial
    results.

We are at risk that our competitors will expand in our key
    markets and implement new technologies making them more
    competitive. There is also the possibility that competitors will
    be able to offer additional products, services, lower prices, or
    other incentives that we cannot or will not offer or that will
    make our products less profitable. There can be no assurance
    that we will be able to compete successfully against current and
    future competitors.

We are also at risk with regards to changes in customer order
    patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained
    by customers and the timing of customer purchases, which may be
    affected by announced price changes, changes in the
    Company’s incentive programs, or the customer’s
    ability to achieve incentive goals. Changes in customers’
    preferences for our products can also affect the demand for our
    products.

As a
    manufacturer, our sales and profitability are dependent upon the
    cost and availability of raw materials and energy, which are
    subject to price fluctuations, and our ability to control or
    pass on costs of raw materials and labor.

Inflationary and other increases in the costs of raw materials,
    labor and energy have occurred in the past and are expected to
    recur, and our performance depends in part on our ability to
    pass on these cost increases to customers in our selling prices
    for products, and to effect improvements in productivity. Also,
    it is important that we are able to obtain timely delivery of
    materials, equipment, and packaging from suppliers, and to make
    timely delivery to customers. A disruption to our supply chain
    could adversely affect our sales and profitability.



Potential
    adverse developments in legal proceedings, investigations and
    other legal, compliance and regulatory matters, including those
    involving product and trade compliance, Foreign Corrupt
    Practices Act issues and other matters, could impact us
    materially.

Our financial results could be materially adversely impacted by
    an unfavorable outcome to pending or future litigation and
    investigations, including but not limited to, proceedings or
    lawsuits related to class actions seeking treble damages for
    alleged unlawful competitive practices, the impact of potential
    violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and
    other legal, compliance and regulatory matters, including, but
    not limited to, product, customs and trade compliance matters.
    See Item 1, “Legal Proceedings.” There can be no
    assurance that any investigation or litigation outcome will be
    favorable.

Our
    future results may be affected if we generate less productivity
    improvement than projected.

We are undertaking efforts to reduce costs in many of our
    operations, including closure of facilities, headcount
    reductions, organizational simplification and restructuring,
    process standardization, and manufacturing relocation, and using
    a variety of tools such as Lean Sigma and Kaizen events, to
    increase productivity, which is not assured. Lower levels of
    productivity could reduce profitability. In addition, cost
    reduction actions could expose us to additional production risk
    and loss of sales.

We have
    acquired companies and may continue to acquire other companies.
    Acquisitions come with significant risks and uncertainties,
    including those related to integration, technology and
    personnel.

In order to grow our product lines and expand into new markets,
    we have made acquisitions and may do so in the future. For
    example, we acquired DM Label and Paxar in 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. Various risks, uncertainties, and costs are
    associated with the acquisitions. Effective integration of
    systems, controls, objectives, personnel, product lines,
    markets, customers, suppliers, production facilities and cost
    savings can be difficult to achieve and the results are
    uncertain, particularly across our geographically dispersed
    organization. We may not be able to retain key personnel of an
    acquired company and we may not be able to successfully execute
    integration strategies or achieve projected performance targets
    set for the business segment into which an acquired company is
    integrated. Both prior to and after the closing of the
    transactions, our business and those of the acquired company or
    companies may suffer due to uncertainty or diversion of
    management attention.

There can be no assurance that acquisitions will be successful
    and contribute to our profitability and we may not be able to
    identify new acquisition opportunities in the future.

Our
    substantial indebtedness could limit our ability to incur
    additional debt to fund business needs over the medium
    term.

As a result of the Paxar acquisition in 2007, our debt levels
    approximately doubled. Although significant debt reduction is
    anticipated over the medium term from the generation of cash
    flow in our underlying businesses, circumstances both within and
    beyond our control could cause debt levels to remain elevated
    for a longer time frame than anticipated. These higher debt
    levels could negatively impact our ability to meet other
    business needs or opportunities and could result in higher
    financing costs.

Slower
    growth in key markets could adversely affect our
    profitability.

Our business could be negatively impacted by a decline in key
    end use markets or applications for our products. Our overall
    performance will be influenced by these markets.

Our
    customers are widely diversified, but in certain portions of our
    business, industry concentration has increased the importance
    and decreased the number of significant customers.

In particular, sales of our office and consumer products in the
    United States are concentrated in a few major customers,
    principally office product superstores, mass market distributors
    and wholesalers. The business risk associated with this
    concentration, including increased credit risks for these and
    other customers, and the possibility of related bad debt
    write-offs, could negatively affect our margins and profits.



Our
    ability to develop and successfully market new products and
    applications is important for our business.

The timely introduction of new products and improvements in
    current products helps determine our success. Research and
    development for each of our operating segments is complex and
    uncertain and requires innovation and anticipation of market
    trends. We could focus on products that ultimately are not
    accepted by customers or we could suffer delays in production or
    launch of new products that could compromise our competitive
    position in such product markets.

Infringing
    intellectual property rights of third parties or inadequately
    acquiring or protecting our intellectual property and patents
    could harm our ability to compete or grow.

Because our products involve complex technology and chemistry,
    we are from time to time involved in litigation involving
    patents and other intellectual property. Parties have filed, and
    in the future may file, claims against us alleging that we have
    infringed their intellectual property rights. If we are held
    liable for infringement, we could be required to pay damages or
    obtain licenses or to cease making or selling certain products.
    There can be no assurance that licenses will be available at
    all, or will be available on commercially reasonable terms, and
    the cost to defend these claims, whether or not meritorious, or
    to develop new technology could be significant and could divert
    the attention of management.

We also could have our intellectual property infringed. We
    attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual
    property and proprietary information, by relying on the patent,
    trademark, copyright and trade secret laws of the U.S. and
    other countries, as well as on nondisclosure agreements, but it
    may be possible for a third party to obtain our information
    without our authorization, to independently develop similar
    technologies, or to breach a non-disclosure agreement entered
    into with us. In addition, many of the countries in which we
    operate do not have intellectual property laws that protect
    proprietary rights as fully as in the U.S. The use of our
    intellectual property by someone else without our authorization
    could reduce or eliminate certain competitive advantages we
    have, cause us to lose sales, or otherwise harm our business.
    Further, the costs involved to protect our intellectual property
    rights could adversely impact our profitability.

We have obtained and applied for some U.S. and foreign
    trademark registrations and patents, and will continue to
    evaluate whether to register additional trademarks and seek
    patents as appropriate. We cannot guarantee that any of the
    pending applications will be approved by the applicable
    government authorities. Further, we cannot assure that the
    validity of our patents or our trademarks will not be
    challenged. In addition, third parties might be able to develop
    competing products using technology that avoids our patents.

Changes
    in our tax rates could affect our future results.

Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in
    the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax
    rates, expirations of tax holidays, changes in the valuation of
    deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws and
    regulations or their interpretation. We are subject to the
    regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax
    authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse
    outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the
    adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance
    that the outcomes from these examinations will not have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating
    results.

The
    amount of various taxes we pay is subject to ongoing compliance
    requirements and audits by federal, state and foreign tax
    authorities.

Our estimate of the potential outcome of uncertain tax issues is
    subject to our assessment of relevant risks, facts, and
    circumstances existing at that time. We use these assessments to
    determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and
    other tax-related accounts. Our future results may include
    favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax
    liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved,
    which may impact our effective tax rate

and/or

our
    financial results.

We have
    deferred tax assets that we may not be able to use under certain
    circumstances.

If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in
    certain jurisdictions, or if there is a significant change in
    the time period within which the underlying temporary
    differences become taxable or deductible, we



could be required to increase our valuation allowances against
    our deferred tax assets. This would result in an increase in our
    effective tax rate, and an adverse effect on our future
    operating results. In addition, changes in statutory tax rates
    may also change our deferred tax assets or liability balances,
    with either favorable or unfavorable impact on our effective tax
    rate. Our deferred tax assets may also be impacted by new
    legislation or regulation.

The level
    of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the
    actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect
    our earnings and cash flows in future periods. Changes in
    accounting standards and government regulations could also
    affect our pension and postretirement plan expense and funding
    requirements.

Assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations
    and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plan and other
    postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by us in consultation
    with outside actuaries. In the event that we determine that
    changes are warranted in the assumptions used, such as the
    discount rate, expected long term rate of return, or health care
    costs, our future pension and projected postretirement benefit
    expenses could increase or decrease. Due to changing market
    conditions or changes in the participant population, the
    actuarial assumptions that we use may differ from actual
    results, which could have a significant impact on our pension
    and postretirement liability and related costs. Funding
    obligations are determined based on the value of assets and
    liabilities on a specific date as required under relevant
    government regulations for each plan. Future pension funding
    requirements, and the timing of funding payments, could be
    affected by legislation enacted by the relevant governmental
    authorities.

In order
    for us to remain competitive, it is important to recruit and
    retain highly-skilled employees. We also utilize various
    outsourcing arrangements for certain services.

There is significant competition to recruit and retain skilled
    employees. Due to expansion in certain markets and the ongoing
    productivity efforts and recent employee reductions, it may be
    difficult for us to retain and recruit sufficient numbers of
    highly-skilled employees.

We have outsourced certain services to multiple third-party
    service providers, and may outsource other services in the
    future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies. Service
    provider delays, resource availability, business issues or
    errors may lead to disruption in our businesses

and/or

increased costs. If we do not effectively develop, implement and
    manage outsourcing strategies, or if third-party providers do
    not perform effectively and timely, or we experience problems
    with a transition, we may not be able to achieve our expected
    cost savings, and may have to incur additional costs and
    experience delays to correct errors made by such service
    providers.

We need
    to comply with numerous environmental, health, and safety
    laws.

Due to the nature of our business, we are subject to
    environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations,
    including those related to the disposal of hazardous waste from
    our manufacturing processes. Compliance with existing and future
    environmental, health and safety laws could subject us to future
    costs or liabilities; impact our production capabilities;
    constrict our ability to sell, expand or acquire facilities; and
    generally impact our financial performance. We have accrued
    liabilities for environmental

clean-up

sites, including sites for which governmental agencies have
    designated us as a potentially responsible party, where it is
    probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of
    loss can be reasonably estimated. However, because of the
    uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and
    remediation activities, future expense to remediate currently
    identified sites and other sites, which could be identified in
    the future for cleanup, could be higher than the liability
    currently accrued.

We are
    subject to risks associated with the availability and coverage
    of various types of insurance.

We have various types of insurance including property, workers
    compensation and general liability. Insurance costs can be
    unpredictable and may adversely impact our financial results. We
    retain some portion of our insurable risks, and therefore,
    unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of insured limits
    could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.



Significant
    disruption to our information technology infrastructure could
    adversely impact our operations, sales, customer relations, and
    financial results.

We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of a large
    and complex information technology infrastructure to link our
    worldwide divisions. Like other information technology systems,
    ours is susceptible to a number of factors including, but not
    limited to, damage or interruptions resulting from a variety of
    causes such as obsolescence, natural disasters, power failures,
    human error, viruses and data security breaches. We upgrade and
    install new systems, which, if installed or programmed
    incorrectly or if installation is delayed, could cause delays or
    cancellation of customer orders, impede the manufacture or
    shipment of products, and disrupt the processing of
    transactions. We have implemented certain measures to reduce our
    risk related to system and network disruptions, but if a
    disruption occurs, we could incur significant losses and
    remediation costs.

Additionally, we rely on services provided by third-party
    vendors for a significant portion of our information technology
    support, development and implementation, which may make our
    operations vulnerable to such third parties’ failure to
    perform adequately.

Miscalculation
    of our infrastructure needs could adversely impact our financial
    results.

Projected requirements of our infrastructure investments may
    differ from actual levels if our volume growth is not as we
    anticipate. Our infrastructure investments are generally
    long-term in nature, and it is possible that these investments
    may not generate our expected return due to changes in the
    marketplace, failures to complete implementation, and other
    factors. Significant changes from our expected need for

and/or

returns on infrastructure investments could adversely affect our
    financial results.

Our share
    price may be volatile.

Our stock price, which has at times experienced substantial
    volatility, is influenced by changes in the overall stock market
    and demand for equity securities in general. Other factors,
    including current performance and market expectations for our
    future performance, the level of perceived growth of our
    industries, and announcements concerning investigations, can
    also impact our share price. There can be no assurance that our
    stock price will be less volatile in the future.

If our
    credit ratings are downgraded, we may have difficulty obtaining
    acceptable short- and long-term financing from capital
    markets.

Credit ratings are a significant factor in our ability to raise
    short-term and long-term financing. The credit ratings assigned
    to us also impact the interest rates on our commercial paper and
    other borrowings. If our credit ratings are further downgraded,
    our financial flexibility could decrease and the cost to borrow
    would increase.

Our
    reputation, sales, and earnings could be affected adversely if
    the quality of our products and services does not meet customer
    expectations.

There are occasions when we manufacture products with quality
    issues resulting from defective materials, manufacturing,
    packaging or design. Many of these issues are discovered before
    shipping, thus causing delays in shipping, delays in the
    manufacturing process, and occasionally cancelled orders. When
    issues are discovered after shipment, this causes additional
    shipping costs, possible discounts, possible refunds, and
    potential loss of future sales. Both pre-shipping and
    post-shipping quality issues can result in financial
    consequences along with a negative impact on our reputation.

Some of
    our products are sold by third parties.

Our products are not only sold by us, but by third-party
    distributors and retailers as well. Some of our distributors
    also market products that compete with our products. Changes in
    the financial or business condition or purchasing decisions of
    these third parties or their customers could affect our sales
    and profitability.



We
    outsource some of our manufacturing. If there are significant
    changes in the quality control or financial or business
    condition of these outsourced manufacturers, our business could
    be negatively impacted.

We manufacture most of our products, but we also use third-party
    manufacturers, for example, for specialty jobs or capacity
    overflow. Outsourced manufacturers reduce our ability to prevent
    product quality issues, late deliveries, customer
    dissatisfaction and compliance with customer requirements for
    labor standards. Because of possible quality issues and customer
    dissatisfaction, outsourced manufacturers could have an adverse
    effect on our business and financial results.

An
    impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively
    impact our consolidated results of operations and net
    worth.

Goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is not
    amortized, but is reviewed for impairment at least annually or
    more frequently if impairment indicators are present. In
    assessing the carrying value of goodwill, we make estimates and
    assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates, and
    discount rates based on our business plans, economic
    projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data.
    There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and
    management’s judgment in applying these factors. Goodwill
    valuations have been calculated using an income approach based
    on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting
    unit. We could be required to evaluate the carrying value of
    goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience
    disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in
    operating results, divestiture of a significant component of our
    business or sustained market capitalization declines. These
    types of events and the resulting analyses could result in
    goodwill impairment charges in the future. Impairment charges
    could substantially affect our financial results in the periods
    of such charges.

Changes
    in our business strategies may increase our costs and could
    affect the profitability of our businesses.

As changes in our business environment occur, we may need to
    adjust our business strategies to meet these changes or we may
    otherwise find it necessary to restructure our operations or
    particular businesses. When these changes occur, we may incur
    costs to change our business strategy and may need to write down
    the value of assets. We may also need to invest in new
    businesses that have short-term returns that are negative or low
    and whose ultimate business prospects are uncertain. In any of
    these events, our costs may increase, our assets may be
    impaired, or our returns on new investments may be lower than
    prior to the change in strategy.

The risks described above are not exclusive. If any of the above
    risks actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash
    flows or financial condition could suffer, which might cause the
    value of our securities to decline.

Item 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

The Company has been designated by the U.S. Environmental
    Protection Agency (“EPA”)

and/or

other
    responsible state agencies as a potentially responsible party
    (“PRP”) at seventeen waste disposal or waste recycling
    sites, including Paxar sites, which are the subject of separate
    investigations or proceedings concerning alleged soil

and/or

groundwater contamination and for which no settlement of the
    Company’s liability has been agreed. The Company is
    participating with other PRPs at such sites, and anticipates
    that its share of cleanup costs will be determined pursuant to
    remedial agreements entered into in the normal course of
    negotiations with the EPA or other governmental authorities.

The Company has accrued liabilities for these and certain other
    sites, including sites in which governmental agencies have
    designated the Company as a PRP, where it is probable that a
    loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be
    reasonably estimated. However, because of the uncertainties
    associated with environmental assessment and remediation
    activities, future expense to remediate the currently identified
    sites and any sites which could be identified in the future for
    cleanup could be higher than the liability currently accrued.

As of December 27, 2008, the Company’s estimated
    accrued liability associated with compliance and remediation
    costs was approximately $60 million, including estimated
    liabilities related to the Company’s recent acquisitions.
    See also Note 8, “Contingencies,” in the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 60 of
    the Company’s 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is
    incorporated herein by reference.

On April 24, 2003, Sentry Business Products, Inc. filed a
    purported class action on behalf of direct purchasers of label
    stock in the United States District Court for the Northern
    District of Illinois against the Company, UPM, Bemis and certain
    of their subsidiaries seeking treble damages and other relief
    for alleged unlawful competitive practices with allegations
    including that the defendants attempted to limit competition
    between themselves through anticompetitive understandings. Ten
    similar complaints were filed in various federal district
    courts. In November 2003, the cases were transferred to the
    United States District Court for the Middle District of
    Pennsylvania and



consolidated for pretrial purposes. Plaintiffs filed a
    consolidated complaint on February 16, 2004, which the
    Company answered on March 31, 2004. On April 14, 2004,
    the court separated the proceedings as to class certification
    and merits discovery, and limited the initial phase of discovery
    to the issue of the appropriateness of class certification. On
    January 4, 2006, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. On
    January 20, 2006, the Company filed an answer to the
    amended complaint. On August 14, 2006, the plaintiffs moved
    to certify a proposed class. The Company and other defendants
    opposed this motion. On March 1, 2007, the court heard oral
    argument on the issue of the appropriateness of class
    certification. On August 28, 2007, plaintiffs moved to lift
    the discovery stay, which the Company opposed. The court
    substantively granted class certification on November 19,
    2007. The Company filed a petition to appeal this decision on
    December 4, 2007, which was denied on March 6, 2008.
    On July 22, 2008, the district court held a hearing to set
    a schedule for merits discovery. The court subsequently entered
    an order that requires the parties to complete fact discovery by
    June 22, 2009. Dispositive motions are due on
    March 19, 2010. On January 27, 2009, the Company moved
    the court to decertify the class. The Company intends to defend
    these matters vigorously.

On May 21, 2003, The Harman Press filed in the Superior
    Court for the County of Los Angeles, California, a purported
    class action on behalf of indirect purchasers of label stock
    against the Company, UPM and UPM’s subsidiary Raflatac
    (“Raflatac”), seeking treble damages and other relief
    for alleged unlawful competitive practices with allegations
    including that the defendant parties attempted to limit
    competition between themselves through anticompetitive
    understandings. Three similar complaints were filed in various
    California courts. In November 2003, on petition from the
    parties, the California Judicial Council ordered the cases be
    coordinated for pretrial purposes. The cases were assigned to a
    coordination trial judge in the Superior Court for the City and
    County of San Francisco on March 30, 2004. On
    September 30, 2004, The Harman Press amended its complaint
    to add Bemis’ subsidiary Morgan Adhesives Company
    (“MACtac”) as a defendant. On January 21, 2005,
    American International Distribution Corporation filed a
    purported class action on behalf of indirect purchasers in the
    Superior Court for Chittenden County, Vermont. Similar actions
    were filed by Richard Wrobel, on February 16, 2005, in the
    District Court of Johnson County, Kansas; and by Chad and Terry
    Muzzey, on February 16, 2005 in the District Court of
    Scotts Bluff County, Nebraska. On February 17, 2005, Judy
    Benson filed a purported multi-state class action on behalf of
    indirect purchasers in the Circuit Court for Cocke County,
    Tennessee. The Nebraska, Kansas and Vermont cases are currently
    stayed. Defendants’ motion to dismiss the Tennessee case,
    filed on March 30, 2006, is pending. The Company intends to
    defend these matters vigorously.

The Board of Directors created an ad hoc committee comprised of
    certain independent directors to oversee the foregoing matters.

The Company is unable to predict the effect of these matters at
    this time, although the effect could be adverse and material.

In 2005, the Company contacted relevant authorities in the
    U.S. and reported on the results of an internal
    investigation of potential violations of the U.S. Foreign
    Corrupt Practices Act. The transactions at issue were carried
    out by a small number of employees of the Company’s
    reflective business in China, and involved, among other things,
    impermissible payments or attempted impermissible payments. The
    payments or attempted payments and the contracts associated with
    them appear to have been minor in amount and of limited
    duration. Corrective and disciplinary actions have been taken.
    Sales of the Company’s reflective business in China in 2005
    were approximately $7 million. Based on findings to date,
    no changes to the Company’s previously filed financial
    statements are warranted as a result of these matters. However,
    the Company expects that fines or other penalties could be
    incurred. While the Company is unable to predict the financial
    or operating impact of any such fines or penalties, it believes
    that its behavior in detecting, investigating, responding to and
    voluntarily disclosing these matters to authorities should be
    viewed favorably.

In addition, on or about October 10, 2008, the Company
    notified relevant authorities that it had discovered
    questionable payments to certain foreign customs and other
    regulatory officials by some employees of its recently acquired
    companies. These payments do not appear to have been made for
    the purpose of obtaining business from any governmental entity.
    The Company is in the process of conducting a review and is
    taking remedial measures to comply with the provisions of the
    U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.



The Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various other
    lawsuits, claims and inquiries, most of which are routine to the
    nature of the business. Based upon current information,
    management believes that the resolution of these other matters
    will not materially affect the Company’s financial position.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
    CONDITION

ORGANIZATION
    OF INFORMATION

Management’s Discussion and Analysis provides a narrative
    concerning our financial performance and condition that should
    be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial
    statements. It includes the following sections:

•   Definition of Terms


•   Overview and Outlook


•   Analysis of Results of Operations


•   Results of Operations by Segment


•   Financial Condition


•   Uses and Limitations of
    Non-GAAP Measures


•   Related Party Transactions


•   Critical Accounting Policies and
    Estimates


•   Recent Accounting Requirements


•   Safe Harbor Statement


DEFINITION
    OF TERMS

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States of America, or GAAP. Our discussion of financial results
    includes several non-GAAP measures to provide additional
    information concerning Avery Dennison Corporation’s (the
    “Company’s”) performance. These non-GAAP
    financial measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a
    substitute for, GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP
    financial measures are intended to supplement our presentation
    of our financial results that are prepared in accordance with
    GAAP. Refer to “Uses and Limitations of
    Non-GAAP Measures.”

We use the following terms:

•

Organic sales growth (decline)

refers to the change in
    sales excluding the estimated impact of currency translation,
    acquisitions and divestitures;

•

Segment operating income (loss)

refers to income before
    interest and taxes;

•

Free cash flow

refers to cash flow from operations and
    net proceeds from sale of investments, less payments for
    property, plant and equipment, software and other deferred
    charges; and

•

Operational working capital

refers to trade accounts
    receivable and inventories, net of accounts payable.

As a result of the sale of our raised reflective pavement
    marker business during 2006 (discussed below in
    “Divestitures”), the discussions which follow reflect
    our restated results for the accounting change, as well as
    summary results from our continuing operations unless otherwise
    noted. However, the net income and net income per share
    discussions include the impact of discontinued operations.



OVERVIEW
    AND OUTLOOK

Overview

Sales

Our sales from continuing operations increased 6% in 2008
    compared to growth of 13% in 2007, driven primarily by the
    acquisitions of Paxar Corporation (“Paxar”) and DM
    Label Group (“DM Label”) and the effect of currency
    translation.

Totals may not sum due to rounding

On an organic basis, the decline of 3% in 2008 reflected
    worsening global economic conditions in 2008, which were
    experienced first in the U.S., then Western Europe, then in our
    emerging markets (Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America).
    Organic sales growth of 1% in 2007 reflected international
    growth, partially offset by slower and more competitive market
    conditions in North America.

Net
    Income

Net income decreased $37 million, or 12%, in 2008 compared
    to 2007.

Negative factors affecting the change in net income included:

•

Reduced fixed cost leverage due to sales decline on an organic
    basis

•

Cost inflation, including raw material and energy costs

•

Incremental interest expense and amortization of intangibles
    related to the Paxar and DM Label acquisitions

•

The carryover effect of a more competitive pricing environment
    in the roll materials business in the prior year, partially
    offset by current year price increases

Positive factors affecting the change in net income included:

•

Cost savings from productivity improvement initiatives,
    including savings from restructuring actions

•

Benefits from foreign currency translation and acquisitions

•

Lower effective tax rate

•

Lower asset impairment and restructuring charges related to cost
    reduction actions

•

Lower transition costs related to the integration of Paxar

Acquisitions

We completed the Paxar acquisition on June 15, 2007. The
    combination of the Paxar business into our Retail Information
    Services segment increases our presence in the retail
    information and brand identification market, combines
    complementary strengths and broadens the range of our product
    and service capabilities, improves our ability to meet customer
    demands for product innovation and improved quality of service,
    and facilitates expansion into new product and geographic
    segments. See “Paxar Acquisition-related Actions”
    below for information on cash costs incurred and cost synergies
    achieved during integration.

We completed the DM Label acquisition on April 1, 2008. DM
    Label operations are included in our Retail Information Services
    segment.



See Note 2, “Acquisitions,” to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for further information.

Paxar
    Acquisition-related Actions

The following integration actions resulted in headcount
    reductions of approximately 1,695 positions in our Retail
    Information Services segment:

Recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income

At year end, the Paxar integration was essentially complete.
    Cost synergies resulting from the integration were approximately
    $20 million in 2007 and an incremental $88 million in
    2008. We expect to realize incremental savings of approximately
    $12 million in 2009.

Refer to Note 2, “Acquisitions,” to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Cost
    Reduction Actions

Q4
    2008 — 2009 Actions

In response to worsening market conditions, we are undertaking
    new restructuring actions that began in the fourth quarter of
    2008 that are expected to impact approximately 10% of the
    Company’s global workforce. Refer to the
    “Outlook” section for total estimated costs to be
    incurred and annualized savings expected to be achieved through
    these actions.

In the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded $12.3 million in
    pretax charges related to these restructuring actions,
    consisting of severance and related employee costs, asset
    impairment charges, and lease cancellation costs. Severance and
    employee related costs related to approximately 700 positions,
    impacting all of our segments and geographic regions. We expect
    to realize savings of approximately $18 million in 2009
    related to these charges.

Q1
    2008 — Q3 2008 Actions

During the first three quarters of 2008, we implemented cost
    reduction actions resulting in pretax charges of
    $22.8 million, including severance and employee related
    costs for approximately 645 positions, asset impairment charges,
    and lease cancellation costs. We expect to achieve annualized
    savings of approximately $20 million (most of which will
    benefit 2009) as a result of these restructuring actions.

Q4
    2006 — 2007 Actions

We incurred $31.4 million in pretax charges related to cost
    reduction actions initiated from late 2006 through the end of
    2007, including severance and employee related costs for
    approximately 555 positions, asset impairment charges, and lease
    cancellation costs. Savings from these restructuring actions,
    net of transition costs, were



approximately $5 million in 2008 and $32 million in
    2007. We expect to realize incremental savings of
    $8 million in 2009.

Q4
    2005 — Q3 2006 Actions

During 2007 and 2006, we realized annualized pretax savings (net
    of transition costs) of over $90 million, resulting from
    restructuring actions initiated in the fourth quarter of 2005.
    These restructuring actions resulted in headcount reductions of
    approximately 1,150 positions, which impacted all of our
    segments and geographic regions and were completed in 2006.

Refer to Note 10, “Cost Reduction Actions,” to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Divestitures

The divestiture of our raised reflective pavement marker
    business, which had sales of approximately $23 million in
    2005, was completed during the second quarter of 2006 and
    resulted in a tax benefit due to capital losses arising from the
    sale of the business. The results of this business have been
    accounted for as discontinued operations in 2006. This business
    was previously included in the Pressure-sensitive Materials
    segment.

In addition, the divestitures of two product lines were
    completed in the first quarter of 2006. The first product line,
    which was included in the Office and Consumer Products segment,
    had estimated sales of $60 million in 2005, with minimal
    impact to income from operations. The second product line, which
    was included in other specialty converting businesses, had
    annual sales of approximately $10 million in 2005, with
    minimal impact to income from operations.

Free
    Cash Flow

We use free cash flow as a measure of funds available for other
    corporate purposes, such as dividends, debt reduction,
    acquisitions, and repurchases of common stock. Management
    believes that this measure provides meaningful supplemental
    information to our investors to assist them in their financial
    analysis of the Company. Management believes that it is
    appropriate to measure cash flow (including net proceeds from
    sale of investments) after spending on property, plant,
    equipment, software and other deferred charges because such
    spending is considered integral to maintaining or expanding our
    underlying business. This measure is not intended to represent
    the residual cash available for discretionary purposes. Refer to
    “Uses and Limitations of Non-GAAP Measures” for
    further information regarding limitations of this measure.

Net proceeds from sale of investments are related to the sale of
    securities held by our captive insurance company and other
    investments in 2008 and a sale of a long-term investment in 2006.

The increase in free cash flow in 2008 of $121 million is
    primarily due to increased cash flow provided by operating
    activities and reduced capital spending, partially offset by
    lower net income compared to 2007.

The decrease in free cash flow in 2007 of $87 million
    reflects higher spending on property, plant and equipment and
    software and other deferred charges, as well as lower net income
    compared to 2006.

See “Analysis of Results of Operations” and
    “Liquidity” in “Financial Condition” below
    for more information.



Legal
    Proceedings

We are a named defendant in purported class actions in the
    U.S. seeking treble damages and other relief for alleged
    unlawful competitive practices.

As previously disclosed, we have discovered instances of conduct
    by certain employees that potentially violate the
    U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. We reported that
    conduct to authorities in the U.S. and we believe it is
    possible that fines or other penalties could be incurred.

The Board of Directors created an ad hoc committee comprised of
    certain independent directors to oversee the foregoing matters.

We are unable to predict the effect of these matters at this
    time, although the effect could be adverse and material. These
    and other matters are reported in Note 8,
    “Contingencies,” to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Outlook

Certain statements contained in this section are
    “forward-looking statements” and are subject to
    certain risks and uncertainties. Refer to our “Safe Harbor
    Statement” herein.

In light of the global economic environment, we are not
    providing a 2009 earnings forecast at this time. If current
    exchange rate trends continue, they would have an unfavorable
    effect on earnings in 2009.

We expect incremental pension and other employee-related
    expenses and contributions in 2009.

In response to increased uncertainty resulting from worsening
    global economic conditions, we initiated new cost reduction
    actions that target approximately $150 million in
    annualized savings by 2010, of which an estimated
    $70 million, net of transition costs, is expected to
    benefit 2009. We expect to incur approximately $120 million
    of restructuring charges associated with these actions, with the
    majority to be incurred in 2009.

In addition to the savings from these new actions, we expect
    approximately $40 million of savings from previously
    implemented actions, which includes $12 million of benefits
    from the Paxar integration.

The total incremental savings from implemented cost reduction
    actions discussed above are expected to be $110 million for
    2009. We anticipate higher charges related to restructuring
    actions in 2009 compared to 2008.

We anticipate lower interest expense in 2009, subject to
    currently anticipated retirements

and/or

refinancings of currently outstanding indebtedness, and assuming
    a continuation of current market rates for our variable interest
    rate debt and commercial paper.

The annual effective tax rate will be impacted by future events
    including changes in tax laws, geographic income mix, tax
    audits, closure of tax years, legal entity restructuring, and
    release of, or accrual for, valuation allowances on deferred tax
    assets. The effective tax rate can potentially have wide
    variances from quarter to quarter, resulting from interim
    reporting requirements and the recognition of discrete events.

We anticipate our capital and software expenditures to be in the
    range of $120 million to $150 million in 2009.

Sales

Sales increased 6% in 2008 and 13% in 2007 driven primarily by
    acquisitions and the effect of currency translation. The
    acquisitions of Paxar and DM Label increased sales by an
    estimated $450 million in 2008. The acquisition of Paxar
    increased sales by an estimated $510 million in 2007.
    Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on the
    change in sales of approximately $167 million in 2008
    compared to approximately $232 million in 2007.

On an organic basis, sales declined 3% in 2008 and grew 1% in
    2007. The decline in 2008 primarily reflected worsening global
    economic conditions in 2008, which were experienced first in the
    U.S., then Western Europe, then in our emerging markets. Organic
    sales growth of 1% in 2007 reflected international growth,
    partially offset by slower and more competitive market
    conditions in North America.

Organic sales growth (or decline) by our major regions of
    operation was as follows:

On an organic basis, international sales were roughly flat in
    2008, compared to growth of 4% in 2007. The growth in 2007
    reflected increases in most of our businesses outside of the
    U.S., particularly in our emerging markets.

In the U.S., sales on an organic basis declined 7% in 2008 and
    4% in 2007 due primarily to the slowdown in the
    U.S. economy, combined with the reduction of inventories by
    customers, particularly in the Office and Consumer Products
    segment.

In our Pressure-sensitive Materials segment, soft market
    conditions experienced in the second half of 2007 in the roll
    materials businesses in North America and Europe continued in
    2008, spreading to Latin America and Asia. In our Retail
    Information Services segment, we continued to experience
    weakness in domestic retail apparel markets in 2008 and began to
    experience weakness in the European retail markets. Our other
    specialty converting businesses also experienced declines in
    2008 primarily due to lower volume in products sold to the
    automotive and housing construction industries.



Refer to “Results of Operations by Segment” for
    further information on segments.

Gross
    Profit

Gross profit margin in 2008 decreased from 2007 as higher gross
    profit margin associated with sales from the Paxar business and
    savings from restructuring actions and other sources of
    productivity were more than offset by the carryover effect of
    prior year price competition in the roll materials business,
    higher raw material and other cost inflation, negative product
    mix shifts (lower sales of higher gross profit margin products),
    as well as reduced fixed cost leverage on an organic basis.

Gross profit margin in 2007 decreased from 2006 due to price
    competition and unfavorable product mix in the roll materials
    business and higher raw material costs. The negative effect of
    these factors was partially offset by the addition of the higher
    gross profit margin Paxar business, as well as benefits from our
    ongoing productivity improvement and cost reduction actions.

Marketing,
    General and Administrative Expense

Marketing, general and administrative expense in 2008 increased
    from 2007, as benefits from productivity improvement initiatives
    and lower net transition costs related to the Paxar and DM Label
    acquisitions were more than offset by:

•

Costs associated with the acquired businesses (totaling
    approximately $123 million, including $15 million in
    incremental amortization of intangibles)

•

The negative impact of fluctuations in foreign currency
    (approximately $13 million)

•

Higher employee costs

Marketing, general and administrative expense in 2007 increased
    from 2006, as savings from restructuring actions and other cost
    reductions were more than offset by:

•

Costs associated with the Paxar business and related integration
    expense (totaling approximately $185 million, including
    $40 million in integration-related transition costs and
    $12 million in amortization of intangibles)

•

The negative impact of foreign currency translation
    (approximately $30 million).

Interest
    Expense

Interest expense increased 10%, or approximately
    $11 million, in 2008 compared to 2007 due to an increase in
    borrowings to fund the Paxar and DM Label acquisitions,
    partially offset by the benefit of lower interest rates.

    valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets,
    favorable geographic income mix, and a $24.8 million
    detriment from accruals for uncertain tax positions. Refer to
    Note 11, “Taxes on Income,” for more information.

Income
    from Discontinued Operations

Income from discontinued operations includes the divestiture of
    our raised reflective pavement markers business as noted in the
    “Overview” section above. The divestiture of this
    business was completed during 2006 and resulted in a tax benefit
    ($14.9 million) due to capital losses arising from the sale
    of the business and a gain on sale of $1.3 million.

Income from discontinued operations included net sales of
    approximately $7 million in 2006.

Net
    Sales

Sales in our Pressure-sensitive Materials segment increased 4%
    in 2008 and 8% in 2007. The increase in reported sales for this
    segment included a favorable impact of foreign currency
    translation of approximately $132 million in 2008 and
    approximately $174 million in 2007.

Organic sales growth was 1% in 2008 and 3% in 2007, which
    reflected growth in our roll materials business in Asia, Latin
    America and Europe, partially offset by declines in our North
    American roll materials businesses. The growth resulting from
    market expansion in our roll materials business in Asia and
    Latin America during 2007 slowed in 2008. In Asia, the roll
    materials business experienced high single-digit growth in 2008
    compared to double-digit growth in 2007. In Latin America, the
    roll materials business experienced low single-digit growth in
    2008 compared to mid single-digit growth in 2007. Our roll
    materials business in Europe experienced low single-digit
    organic sales growth in both 2008 and 2007.

In our North American roll materials business, slow market
    conditions in 2008 and 2007 resulted in the low single-digit
    decline in sales on an organic basis. In 2007, a more
    competitive environment due in part to capacity additions in the
    industry led to price reductions to maintain market share.

In our graphics and reflective business, sales declined on an
    organic basis at a mid single-digit rate in 2008, as growth in
    Asia and Latin America was more than offset by declines in the
    U.S. and Europe. The decline primarily reflected lower
    promotional spending on graphic products by businesses in
    response to weak market conditions. In 2007, our graphics and
    reflective business experienced mid single-digit organic sales
    growth, as strong international growth was partially offset by
    declines in the U.S.

Operating
    Income

Decreased operating income in 2008 reflected the negative
    effects of raw material and other cost inflation and prior year
    price reductions (which more than offset the initial benefits of
    recent price increases), and negative product mix, partially
    offset by higher unit volume, and cost savings from
    restructuring and productivity improvement initiatives.

Increased operating income in 2007 reflected higher sales and
    cost savings from restructuring and productivity improvement
    initiatives. These initiatives were partially offset by a more
    competitive pricing environment and unfavorable product mix in
    the roll materials business, higher raw material costs, and
    transition costs related to restructuring actions.

Operating income for all three years reflected restructuring and
    asset impairment charges. In 2008, operating income included
    lease cancellation charges. In 2007, operating income included a
    reversal of an accrual related to a lawsuit. In 2006, operating
    income included a gain on sale of assets, legal fees related to
    a lawsuit, and lease cancellation charges.

Net
    Sales

Sales in our Retail Information Services segment increased 32%
    in 2008 compared to an increase of 76% in 2007. In 2008, the
    increase reflected an estimated $450 million in sales from
    the Paxar and DM Label acquisitions and the favorable impact of
    foreign currency translation (approximately $7 million). In
    2007, the increase reflected an estimated $510 million in
    sales from the Paxar acquisition and the favorable impact of
    foreign currency translation (approximately $17 million).

On an organic basis, sales declined 6% in 2008 reflecting
    continued weakness in the domestic retail apparel markets and
    weakness experienced in the European retail markets. Organic
    sales growth of approximately 1% in 2007 reflected increased
    sales for the European retail market, partially offset by a
    decline in orders related to apparel shipped to North American
    retailers and brand owners.

Operating
    Income

Increased operating income in 2008 reflected higher sales,
    incremental synergies and lower transition costs related to the
    Paxar integration, and savings from restructuring and
    productivity improvement initiatives, partially offset by raw
    material and other cost inflation, and incremental amortization
    of acquisition intangibles.

Operating loss in 2007 reflected transition costs and
    integration-related asset impairment charges associated with the
    Paxar acquisition, amortization of acquisition intangibles and
    higher expenses due to investments for growth in Asia, including
    higher employee-related costs. Higher operating costs were
    partially offset by higher sales and savings from restructuring
    and productivity improvement initiatives.

Restructuring costs, asset impairment and lease cancellation
    charges were incurred in all three years.

Net
    Sales

Sales in our Office and Consumer Products segment decreased 8%
    in 2008 and 5% in 2007. The decline in reported sales in both
    years reflected lower sales on an organic basis, partially
    offset by the favorable impact of



foreign currency translation (approximately $12 million in
    2008 and $25 million in 2007). In 2007, the decline
    included the negative impact of product line divestitures
    (approximately $9 million).

On an organic basis, sales declined approximately 9% in 2008 and
    7% in 2007. These declines reflected a combination of weak end
    market demand and tighter inventory controls by customers.

Operating
    Income

Decreased operating income in 2008 reflected lower sales and
    cost inflation, partially offset by price increases and savings
    from restructuring actions and other productivity improvement
    initiatives.

Decreased operating income in 2007 reflected lower sales and
    higher raw material costs, partially offset by savings from
    restructuring actions and productivity improvement initiatives.

Restructuring costs were incurred in all three years and asset
    impairment charges were incurred in 2008 and 2006. Operating
    income in 2007 included lease cancellation costs and expense
    related to a divestiture. In 2006, operating income included a
    gain from sale of assets, a gain from curtailment and settlement
    of a pension obligation, and a net gain from a product line
    divestiture.

Net
    Sales

Sales in our other specialty converting businesses decreased 6%
    in 2008 and increased 3% in 2007. In 2008, the decrease
    reflected lower sales on an organic basis, partially offset by
    the favorable impact of foreign currency translation
    (approximately $17 million). In 2007, the increase
    reflected the favorable impact of foreign currency translation
    (approximately $16 million), partially offset by the impact
    of a product line divestiture, net of a small acquisition
    (approximately $2 million).

On an organic basis, sales declined 8% in 2008, reflecting lower
    volume in products sold to the automotive and housing
    construction industries, and the negative effect of exiting
    certain low-margin products in our specialty tape business,
    partially offset by growth in our radio-frequency identification
    (“RFID”) division. In 2007, sales grew 1% on an
    organic basis, as the loss of sales from exiting certain
    low-margin products in our specialty tape business was more than
    offset by solid growth in other parts of the specialty tape
    business, as well as growth of the RFID division.

Operating
    Income

Decreased operating income for these businesses in 2008
    reflected lower sales and cost inflation, partially offset by
    the benefit of productivity improvement initiatives and a
    reduction in operating loss in our RFID division.

Increased operating income for these businesses in 2007
    reflected higher sales, savings from restructuring and
    productivity improvement initiatives, and a reduction in
    operating loss from the RFID division.

Operating income for all years included restructuring costs and
    asset impairment charges.

    exclude the impact of foreign currency translation, the impact
    of acquisitions and divestitures and certain non-cash
    transactions (discussed in “Analysis of Selected Balance
    Sheet Accounts” below).

In 2008, cash flow provided by operating activities improved
    compared to 2007 due to improved collection of trade accounts
    receivable; extended payment terms on accounts payable;
    decreased purchases and better management of inventory; lower
    rebate payments; and lower income tax payments, net of refunds.
    These positive factors were partially offset by higher payments
    for interest and higher material costs.

In 2007, cash flow provided by operating activities decreased
    compared to 2006 primarily due to shorter vendor payment terms
    on accounts payable and higher payments for income taxes. These
    negative factors were partially offset by the collection of
    value-added tax receivables in Europe in other current assets
    and lower contributions to our pension plans.

Payments
    for acquisitions

On April 1, 2008, we completed the acquisition of DM Label.

On June 15, 2007, we completed the acquisition of Paxar.
    This acquisition was initially funded by commercial paper
    borrowings, supported by a bridge revolving credit facility.



Refer to Note 2, “Acquisitions,” to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

Payments for acquisitions during 2007 also included buy-outs of
    minority interest shareholders associated with certain
    subsidiaries of RVL Packaging, Inc. and Paxar of approximately
    $4 million.

Capital
    and Software Spending

Significant capital projects in 2008 included investments for
    expansion in China and India serving both our materials and
    retail information services businesses. Significant information
    technology projects in 2008 included customer service and
    standardization initiatives.

Proceeds
    from Sale of Businesses and Investments

In 2008, we sold securities primarily held by our captive
    insurance company.

In 2006, we sold a long-term investment (proceeds of
    approximately $16 million), divested our raised reflective
    pavement marker business in the U.S. (proceeds of
    approximately $9 million), and divested a product line in
    Europe (proceeds of approximately $4 million).

Borrowings
    and Repayment of Debt

At year end 2008, our borrowings outstanding under foreign
    short-term lines of credit were approximately $106 million
    (weighted-average interest rate of 6.9%), compared to
    approximately $70 million at year end 2007
    (weighted-average interest rate of 10.6%).

Short-term variable rate domestic borrowings were
    $558 million at December 27, 2008 (weighted-average
    interest rate of 0.9%), compared to $990.2 million at
    December 29, 2007 (weighted-average interest rate of 5.2%).
    At December 27, 2008, short-term variable rate domestic
    borrowings were from a mix of commercial paper and the revolving
    credit agreement. During 2007, we increased our short-term
    borrowings to initially fund the Paxar acquisition, as noted
    above in “Payments for acquisitions,” as well as to
    support share repurchases. The change in outstanding commercial
    paper also reflects positive cash flow from operations.

We had medium-term notes of $50 million outstanding at year
    end 2008, compared to $100 million at year end 2007. In
    2008 and 2007, medium-term notes of $50 million and
    $60 million were paid on maturity, respectively.

Refer to “Capital Resources” below for further
    information on the 2008 and 2007 borrowings and repayment of
    debt.

Shareholders’
    Equity

Our shareholders’ equity was approximately
    $1.75 billion at year end 2008, compared to approximately
    $1.99 billion at year end 2007. Our annual dividend per
    share increased to $1.64 in 2008 from $1.61 in 2007.

Share
    Repurchases

On October 26, 2006, the Board of Directors authorized the
    Company to purchase an additional 5 million shares of the
    Company’s stock under our existing stock repurchase
    program, resulting in a total authorization of



approximately 7.4 million shares of the Company’s
    stock at that date. We repurchased approximately .2 million
    and .8 million shares in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Cash
    payments for these repurchased shares were approximately
    $10 million and approximately $63 million in 2008 and
    2007, respectively. Included in the 2007 cash payments were
    approximately $11 million related to shares repurchased in
    2006, which settled in 2007. As of December 27, 2008,
    approximately 3.9 million shares were available for
    repurchase under the Board of Directors’ authorization.

Analysis
    of Selected Balance Sheet Accounts

Long-lived
    Assets

Goodwill increased $33 million during 2008 due to
    preliminary identified goodwill associated with the DM Label
    acquisition ($45 million) and purchase price adjustments
    ($10 million) associated with the Paxar acquisition
    completed in June 2007, partially offset by foreign currency
    translation ($22 million).

Other intangibles resulting from business acquisitions decreased
    $11 million during 2008, which reflected normal
    amortization expense ($33 million) and the impact of
    foreign currency translation ($5 million), partially offset
    by our preliminary valuation of the intangible assets of the DM
    Label acquisition ($19 million) and incremental adjustments
    to intangible assets for the Paxar acquisition ($8 million).

Refer to Note 2, “Acquisitions,” to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

Other assets decreased $115 million during 2008 due
    primarily to decreases in long-term pension assets
    ($115 million) and cash surrender value of corporate-owned
    life insurance ($23 million), and the impact of foreign
    currency translation ($5 million), partially offset by
    increases in purchases of software and other deferred charges,
    net of related amortization ($23 million) and other assets
    ($5 million).

Other
    Shareholders’ Equity Accounts

The value of our employee stock benefit trust decreased
    $182 million in 2008 due to a decrease in the market value
    of shares held in the trust of approximately $174 million,
    and the issuance of shares under our employee stock option and
    incentive plans of approximately $8 million.

Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income reflected a loss
    of $367 million during 2008 due primarily to a decline in
    the value of pension assets and current year recognition and
    amortization of net pension transition obligation, prior service
    cost, and net actuarial losses in our U.S. and
    international pension and other postretirement plans
    ($191 million), as well as foreign currency translation
    ($177 million).

Impact of
    Foreign Currency Translation:

(In millions)




Change in net sales

$


$


$


Change in net income




In 2008, international operations generated approximately 67% of
    our net sales. Our future results are subject to fluctuations in
    foreign currency exchange and interest rates, which are
    influenced by global economic and political conditions.

The benefit to sales from currency translation in 2008 primarily
    reflected a benefit from sales denominated in Euros and Swiss
    Francs, as well as sales in the currencies of China, Brazil, and
    Australia, partially offset by a negative impact of sales in the
    currencies of South Korea, Great Britain and South Africa.

Translation gains and losses for operations in hyperinflationary
    economies are included in net income in the period incurred.
    Operations are treated as being in a hyperinflationary economy
    based on the cumulative inflation rate over the past three
    years. In 2008 and 2007, we had no operations in
    hyperinflationary economies. In 2006, the only hyperinflationary
    economy in which we operated was the Dominican Republic, which
    uses the U.S. dollar as its functional currency.



Effect
    of Foreign Currency Transactions

The impact on net income from transactions denominated in
    foreign currencies may be mitigated because the costs of our
    products are generally denominated in the same currencies in
    which they are sold. In addition, to reduce our income statement
    and cash flow exposure to transactions in foreign currencies, we
    may enter into foreign exchange forward, option and swap
    contracts, where available and appropriate.

Analysis
    of Selected Financial Ratios

We utilize certain financial ratios to assess our financial
    condition and operating performance, as discussed below.

Operational
    Working Capital Ratio

Working capital (current assets minus current liabilities) as a
    percent of net sales changed in 2008 primarily due to the impact
    of the Paxar acquisition and a decrease in short-term debt and
    accrued liabilities, partially offset by a decrease in net trade
    accounts receivable, inventories and current deferred tax
    assets, as well as a net increase in hedge liabilities and
    income taxes payable.

In February 2008, one of our subsidiaries entered into a credit
    agreement for a term loan credit facility with fifteen domestic
    and foreign banks for a total commitment of $400 million,
    which we guaranteed, maturing February 8, 2011. The
    proceeds from this term loan credit facility were used to reduce
    commercial paper borrowings (included in current liabilities)
    initially used to finance the Paxar acquisition.

Operational working capital, as a percent of net sales, is a
    non-GAAP measure and is shown below. We use this non-GAAP
    measure as a tool to assess our working capital requirements
    because it excludes the impact of fluctuations due to our
    financing and other activities (that affect cash and cash
    equivalents, deferred taxes, and other current assets and other
    current liabilities) that tend to be disparate in amount and
    timing and therefore, may increase the volatility of the working
    capital ratio from period to period. Additionally, the items
    excluded from this measure are not necessarily indicative of the
    underlying trends of our operations and are not significantly
    influenced by the day-to-day activities that are managed at the
    operating level. Refer to “Uses and Limitations of
    Non-GAAP Measures.” Our objective is to minimize our
    investment in operational working capital as a percentage of
    sales by reducing this ratio to maximize cash flow and return on
    investment.

    this change, which includes the impact of the Paxar acquisition
    and foreign currency translation, are discussed below.



Accounts
    Receivable Ratio

The average number of days sales outstanding was 61 days in
    2008 compared to 62 days in 2007, calculated using a
    four-quarter average accounts receivable balance divided by the
    average daily sales for the year. The current year average
    number of days sales outstanding benefited from improved payment
    terms with our customers. The prior year average number of days
    sales outstanding was impacted primarily by the acquisition of
    Paxar, as well as the timing of sales and collections.

Inventory
    Ratio

Average inventory turnover was 7.8 in both 2008 and 2007,
    calculated using the annual cost of sales divided by a
    four-quarter average inventory balance. The current year average
    inventory turnover reflected the continued improvement of
    inventory management to adjust to the demand of our customers.
    In the prior year, this ratio was impacted primarily by the
    acquisition of Paxar.

Accounts
    Payable Ratio

The average number of days payable outstanding was 54 days
    in 2008 compared to 53 days in 2007, calculated using a
    four-quarter average accounts payable balance divided by the
    average daily cost of products sold for the year. The current
    year average number of days payable outstanding was primarily
    due to improved payment terms with our suppliers, partially
    offset by lower inventory purchases. The prior year average
    number of days payable outstanding was impacted primarily by the
    timing of payments in Europe, partially offset by the
    acquisition of Paxar.

Debt-to-Capital
    Ratio

Year End



Debt-to-capital

55.8

%

53.1

%

The increase in the debt-to-capital ratio in 2008 was primarily
    due to lower shareholders’ equity, which reflected the
    recognition of net pension transition obligation, prior service
    cost, and net actuarial losses on our U.S. and
    international pension and other postretirement plans, and the
    negative impact of foreign currency translation, partially
    offset by a net decrease in debt.

Our various loan agreements in effect at year end require that
    we maintain specified ratios on total debt and interest expense
    in relation to certain measures of income. Under the loan
    agreements, the ratio of total debt to earnings before interest,
    taxes, depreciation, amortization, and other non-cash expenses
    for the most recent twelve-month fiscal period may not exceed
    3.5 to 1.0. In addition, earnings before interest, taxes, and
    other non-cash expenses, as a ratio to interest for the most
    recent twelve-month fiscal period may not be less than 3.5 to
    1.0. As of December 27, 2008, we were in compliance with
    these debt covenants. In January 2009, we amended the covenants
    included in the revolving credit agreement and term loan
    agreement to exclude certain restructuring charges and to adjust
    covenant levels. The adjusted covenant levels change quarterly
    and revert back to the

pre-amendment

levels during 2010. The amendments also reflect increased
    pricing levels for borrowings under both agreements, consistent
    with the current pricing environment. Refer to Note 15,
    “Subsequent Events,” to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for further information.

The fair value of our debt is estimated based on the discounted
    amount of future cash flows using the current rates offered to
    us for debt of the same remaining maturities. At year end, the
    fair value of our total debt, including short-term borrowings,
    was $1,944.2 million in 2008 and $2,250.7 million in
    2007.

Decreases in these ratios in 2008 compared to 2007 were
    primarily due to lower net income, as well as a higher yearly
    average of total debt outstanding and shareholders’ equity.
    These ratios are computed using actual net income and a
    five-quarter average denominator for equity and total debt
    accounts.

Capital
    Resources

Capital resources include cash flows from operations, cash and
    cash equivalents and debt financing. At year end 2008, we had
    cash and cash equivalents of $105.5 million held in
    accounts managed by third-party financial institutions. To date,
    we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our invested
    cash or cash equivalents; however, there is no assurance that
    access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be
    impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets.

Our $1 billion revolving credit facility, which supports
    our commercial paper programs in the U.S. and Europe,
    matures in 2012. Based upon our current outlook for our business
    and market conditions, we believe that this facility, in
    addition to the committed and uncommitted bank lines of credit
    maintained in the countries in which we operate, provide the
    liquidity to fund our operations. During the recent turmoil in
    the financial markets, we did not experience interruptions in
    our access to funding.

We have $.5 million of long-term debt maturities due in
    2009.

We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes
    in interest and foreign currency rates, and to possible
    liquidity and credit risks of our counterparties.

Our total debt decreased $46 million in 2008 to
    $2.21 billion compared to $2.26 billion at year end
    2007, reflecting primarily a decrease in short-term borrowings
    used for general operational requirements, partially offset by
    an increase in short-term borrowings associated with the DM
    Label acquisition. Refer to “Borrowings and Repayment of
    Debt” in the “Cash Flow from Financing
    Activities” section above for more information.

In August 2007, we amended our existing revolving credit
    agreement, increasing commitments from $525 million to
    $1 billion and extending the maturity to August 2012.
    Commitments were provided by twelve domestic and foreign banks.
    Financing available under the agreement will be used as a
    commercial paper

back-up

facility and is also available to finance other corporate
    requirements. In January 2009, we amended the covenants related
    to this issuance as described above. Refer to Note 15,
    “Subsequent Events,” to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for further information.

In September 2007, one of our subsidiaries issued
    $250 million

10-year

senior notes, which we guaranteed, bearing interest at a rate of
    6.625% per year, due October 2017. The net proceeds from the
    offering were approximately $247 million and were used to
    pay down current long-term debt maturities of $150 million
    and reduce commercial paper borrowings of $97 million
    initially used to finance the Paxar acquisition.

In the fourth quarter of 2007, we filed a shelf registration
    statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to permit
    the issuance of debt and equity securities. Proceeds from the
    shelf offering may be used for general corporate purposes,
    including repaying, redeeming or repurchasing existing debt, and
    for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. This
    shelf registration replaced the shelf registration statement
    filed in 2004. The HiMEDS units discussed below were issued
    under this registration statement.

In the fourth quarter of 2007, we issued $440 million of
    7.875% Corporate HiMEDS units, a mandatory convertible debt
    issue. These HiMEDS units are comprised of two
    components — purchase contracts obligating the holders
    to purchase from us a certain number of shares in 2010 ranging
    from approximately 6.8 million to approximately
    8.6 million shares (depending on the stock price at that
    time) and senior notes due in 2020. The net proceeds from the
    offering were approximately $427 million, which were used
    to reduce commercial paper borrowings initially used to finance
    the Paxar acquisition. In February 2009, we commenced an offer
    to exchange up to approximately 8.4 million units, or 95%,
    of our HiMEDS units, stated amount $50.00 per unit, in the form
    of Corporate HiMEDS units. As the exchange is not mandatory,
    there is no assurance that the exchange will occur in part or in
    its entirety. Refer to Note 15, “Subsequent
    Events,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    further information.



In February 2008, one of our subsidiaries entered into a credit
    agreement for a term loan credit facility with fifteen domestic
    and foreign banks for a total commitment of $400 million,
    which we guaranteed, maturing February 8, 2011. Financing
    available under the agreement is to be used for working capital
    and other general corporate purposes. We used the term loan
    credit facility to reduce commercial paper borrowings previously
    issued to fund the acquisition of Paxar. The term loan credit
    facility is subject to customary financial covenants, including
    a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio.
    In January 2009, we amended these covenants as described above.
    Refer to Note 15, “Subsequent Events,” to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

In February 2008, we terminated our bridge revolving credit
    agreement, dated June 13, 2007, with five domestic and
    foreign banks.

In addition, we have a

364-day

revolving credit facility in which a foreign bank provides us up
    to Euro 30 million ($42.2 million) in borrowings
    through March 5, 2009. With the approval of the bank, we
    may extend the revolving period and due date on an annual basis.
    Financing under this agreement is used to finance cash
    requirements of our European operations. As of December 27,
    2008, there was $42.2 million of debt outstanding under
    this agreement. There was no debt outstanding under this
    agreement as of December 29, 2007.

We had standby letters of credit outstanding of
    $70.6 million and $80.9 million at the end of 2008 and
    2007, respectively. The aggregate contract amount of outstanding
    standby letters of credit approximated fair value.

Our uncommitted lines of credit were approximately
    $468 million at year end 2008. Our uncommitted lines of
    credit have no commitment expiration date and may be cancelled
    by the banks or us at any time.

Credit ratings are a significant factor in our ability to raise
    short-term and long-term financing. The credit ratings assigned
    to us also impact the interest rates on our commercial paper and
    other borrowings. When determining a credit rating, the rating
    agencies place significant weight on our competitive position,
    business outlook, consistency of cash flows, debt level and
    liquidity, geographic dispersion and management team. We remain
    committed to retaining an investment grade rating.

In January 2009, we entered into an amendment to our credit
    agreement for a $400 million term loan credit facility
    (“Credit Facility”) maturing February 8, 2011.
    The amendment provides for the partial repayment of the loans
    under the Credit Facility in $15 million quarterly
    installments beginning April 2009 through December 2010, and
    $280 million payable upon maturity. Under the amended
    agreement, repayment of long-term debt and capital leases is
    scheduled as follows: $60.5 million in 2009,
    $60.6 million in 2010, $285.2 million in 2011, $0 in
    2012, $250 million in 2013, and $889 million
    thereafter. See Note 15, “Subsequent Events,” for
    more information.

Interest on floating rate debt was estimated using the index
    rate in effect as of December 27, 2008.

We enter into operating leases primarily for office and
    warehouse space and equipment for electronic data processing and
    transportation. The terms of our leases do not impose
    significant restrictions or unusual obligations, except for the
    facility in Mentor, Ohio as noted below. The table above
    includes minimum annual rental commitments on operating leases
    having initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms of one
    year or more.

On September 9, 2005, we completed the lease financing for
    a commercial facility (the “Facility”) located in
    Mentor, Ohio, used primarily for the new headquarters and
    research center for our roll materials division. The Facility
    consists generally of land, buildings, equipment and office
    furnishings. We have leased the Facility under an operating
    lease arrangement, which contains a residual value guarantee of
    $33.4 million. We estimate that the residual value of the
    Facility will not be less than the amount guaranteed.

We did not include purchase obligations or open purchase orders
    at year end 2008 in the table of contractual obligations above,
    because it is impracticable for us to either obtain such
    information or provide a reasonable estimate due to the
    decentralized nature of our purchasing systems.

The table above does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of
    approximately $23 million, which is the portion that may
    become payable during 2009. The resolution of the balance is
    contingent upon various unknown factors, and cannot be
    reasonably estimated. Refer to Note 11, “Taxes Based
    on Income” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    further information on unrecognized tax benefits.

Legal
    Proceedings

We are a named defendant in purported class actions in the
    U.S. seeking treble damages and other relief for alleged
    unlawful competitive practices.

The Board of Directors created an ad hoc committee comprised of
    certain independent directors to oversee the foregoing matters.

We are unable to predict the effect of these matters at this
    time, although the effect could be adverse and material. These
    and other matters are reported in Note 8,
    “Contingencies,” to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Environmental
    Matters

We have been designated by the U.S. Environmental
    Protection Agency (“EPA”)

and/or

other
    responsible state agencies as a potentially responsible party
    (“PRP”) at seventeen waste disposal or waste recycling
    sites, including former Paxar sites, which are the subject of
    separate investigations or proceedings concerning alleged soil

and/or

groundwater contamination and for which no settlement of our
    liability has been agreed upon. We are participating with other
    PRPs at such sites, and anticipate that our share of cleanup
    costs will be determined pursuant to remedial agreements to be
    entered into in the normal course of negotiations with the EPA
    or other governmental authorities.

We have accrued liabilities for these and certain other sites,
    including sites in which governmental agencies have designated
    us as a PRP, where it is probable that a loss will be incurred
    and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.
    However, because of the uncertainties associated with
    environmental assessment and remediation activities, future
    expense to remediate the currently identified sites and any
    sites which could be identified in the future for cleanup could
    be higher than the liability currently accrued.



Environmental liabilities, which include costs associated with
    compliance and remediation, were as follows:

As of December 27, 2008, approximately $2 million
    associated with these environmental liabilities is estimated to
    be paid within the next 12 months.

Our estimates could change depending on various factors, such as
    modification of currently planned remedial actions, changes in
    remediation technologies, changes in site conditions, a change
    in the estimated time to complete remediation, changes in laws
    and regulations affecting remediation requirements and other
    factors.

Other

In 2005, we contacted relevant authorities in the U.S. and
    reported the results of an internal investigation of potential
    violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The
    transactions at issue were carried out by a small number of
    employees of our reflective business in China, and involved,
    among other things, impermissible payments or attempted
    impermissible payments. The payments or attempted payments and
    the contracts associated with them appear to have been
    relatively minor in amount and of limited duration. Corrective
    and disciplinary actions have been taken. Sales of our
    reflective business in China in 2005 were approximately
    $7 million. Based on findings to date, no changes to our
    previously filed financial statements are warranted as a result
    of these matters. However, we believe that fines or other
    penalties could be incurred. While we are unable to predict the
    financial or operating impact of any such fines or penalties, we
    believe that our behavior in detecting, investigating,
    responding to and voluntarily disclosing these matters to
    authorities should be viewed favorably.

In addition, on or about October 10, 2008, we notified
    relevant authorities that we had discovered questionable
    payments to certain foreign customs and other regulatory
    officials by some employees of our recently acquired companies.
    These payments do not appear to have been made for the purpose
    of obtaining business from any governmental entity. We are in
    the process of conducting a review and are taking remedial
    measures to comply with the provisions of the U.S. Foreign
    Corrupt Practices Act.

We and our subsidiaries are involved in various other lawsuits,
    claims and inquiries, most of which are routine to the nature of
    our business. Based upon current information, we believe that
    the resolution of these other matters will not materially affect
    us.

We provide for an estimate of costs that may be incurred under
    our basic limited warranty at the time product revenue is
    recognized. These costs primarily include materials and labor
    associated with the service or sale of products. Factors that
    affect our warranty liability include the number of units
    installed or sold, historical and anticipated rate of warranty
    claims on those units, cost per claim to satisfy our warranty
    obligation and availability of insurance coverage. As these
    factors are impacted by actual experience and future
    expectations, we assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty
    liability and adjust the amounts as necessary.

We participate in international receivable financing programs
    with several financial institutions whereby advances may be
    requested from these financial institutions. Such advances are
    guaranteed by us. At December 27, 2008, we had guaranteed
    approximately $13 million.

As of December 27, 2008, we guaranteed up to approximately
    $22 million of certain of our foreign subsidiaries’
    obligations to their suppliers, as well as approximately
    $556 million of certain of our subsidiaries’ lines of
    credit with various financial institutions.

In the fourth quarter of 2007, we issued $440 million of
    7.875% Corporate HiMEDS units, a mandatory convertible debt
    issue. These HiMEDS units are comprised of two
    components — purchase contracts obligating the



holders to purchase from us a certain number of shares of our
    common stock in 2010 ranging from approximately 6.8 million
    to approximately 8.6 million shares (depending on the
    quoted price per share of our common stock at that time) and
    senior notes due in 2020. The net proceeds from the offering
    were approximately $427 million.

In February 2009, we commenced an offer to exchange up to
    approximately 8.4 million units, or 95%, of our HiMEDS
    units, stated amount $50.00 per unit, in the form of Corporate
    HiMEDS units. As the exchange is not mandatory, there is no
    assurance that the exchange will occur in part or in its
    entirety. Refer to Note 15, “Subsequent Events,”
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

USES
    AND LIMITATIONS OF NON-GAAP MEASURES

We use certain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the
    impact of certain events, activities or strategic decisions. The
    accounting effects of these events, activities or decisions,
    which are included in the GAAP measures, may make it difficult
    to assess the underlying performance of the Company in a single
    period. By excluding certain accounting effects, both positive
    and negative (e.g. gains on sales of assets, restructuring
    charges, asset impairments, etc.), from certain of our GAAP
    measures, management believes that it is providing meaningful
    supplemental information to facilitate an understanding of the
    Company’s “core” or “underlying”
    operating results. These non-GAAP measures are used internally
    to evaluate trends in our underlying business, as well as to
    facilitate comparison to the results of competitors for a single
    period.

Limitations associated with the use of our non-GAAP measures
    include (1) the exclusion of foreign currency translation
    and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures from the
    calculation of organic sales growth; (2) the exclusion of
    mandatory debt service requirements, as well as the exclusion of
    other uses of the cash generated by operating activities that do
    not directly or immediately support the underlying business
    (such as discretionary debt reductions, dividends, share
    repurchases, acquisitions, etc.) for calculation of free cash
    flow; and (3) the exclusion of cash and cash equivalents,
    short-term debt, deferred taxes, and other current assets and
    other current liabilities, as well as current assets and current
    liabilities of held-for-sale businesses, for the calculation of
    operational working capital. While some of the items the Company
    excludes from GAAP measures recur, these items tend to be
    disparate in amount and timing. Based upon feedback from
    investors and financial analysts, we believe that supplemental
    non-GAAP measures provide information that is useful to the
    assessment of the Company’s performance and operating
    trends.

RELATED
    PARTY TRANSACTIONS

From time to time, we enter into transactions in the normal
    course of business with related parties. We believe that such
    transactions are at arm’s length and for terms that would
    have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties.

One of our directors, Peter W. Mullin is the chairman, chief
    executive officer and a director of MC Insurance Services, Inc.
    (“MC”), Mullin Insurance Services, Inc.
    (“MINC”), and PWM Insurance Services, Inc.
    (“PWM”), executive compensation and benefit
    consultants and insurance agents. Mr. Mullin is also the
    majority stockholder of MC, MINC and PWM (collectively referred
    to as the “Mullin Companies”). In October 2008, the
    Mullin Companies’ executive benefit and insurance agency
    related entities (MC Insurance Agency Service, LLC, —
    “MCIA,” MullinTBG Insurance Agency Services,
    LLC — “MullinTBG,” and MullinTBG Advisory
    Services, LLC — “MullinTBG Advisors”) were
    sold to Prudential Financial (“Prudential”). We paid
    premiums to insurance carriers for life insurance placed by the
    Mullin Companies in connection with various of our employee
    benefit plans. The Mullin Companies and Prudential have advised
    us that they earned commissions from such insurance carriers for
    the placement and renewal of this insurance. Approximately 50%
    of these commissions were allocated to and used by MullinTBG (a
    previous affiliate of MC and now a wholly-owned affiliate of
    Prudential) to administer benefit plans and provide benefit
    statement information to participants under various of our
    employee benefit plans. During 2008, MullinTBG Advisors provided
    financial advisory services to participants in certain of our
    employee benefit plans. The Mullin Companies own a minority
    interest in M Financial Holdings, Inc. (“MFH”).
    Substantially all of the life insurance policies, which we
    placed through the Mullin Companies in 2008 and prior years, are
    issued by insurance carriers that participate in reinsurance
    agreements entered into between these insurance carriers and M
    Life Insurance Company (“M Life”), a wholly-owned
    subsidiary of MFH. Reinsurance returns earned by M Life are
    determined annually by the insurance carriers and can be
    negative or positive, depending upon the results of M



Life’s aggregate reinsurance pool, which consists of the
    insured lives reinsured by M Life. The Mullin Companies have
    advised us that they participated in net reinsurance gains of M
    Life. In addition, the Mullin Companies have advised us that
    they also participated in net reinsurance gains of M Life that
    are subject to risk of forfeiture. None of these transactions
    were significant to our financial position or results of
    operations.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    for the reporting period and as of the financial statement date.
    These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of
    assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities
    and the reported amounts of revenue and expense. Actual results
    could differ from those estimates.

Critical accounting policies are those that are important to the
    portrayal of our financial condition and results, and which
    require us to make difficult, subjective

and/or

complex judgments. Critical accounting policies cover accounting
    matters that are inherently uncertain because the future
    resolution of such matters is unknown. We believe that critical
    accounting policies include accounting for revenue recognition,
    sales returns and allowances, accounts receivable allowances,
    inventory and inventory reserves, long-lived asset impairments,
    goodwill, pension and postretirement benefits, income taxes,
    stock-based compensation, restructuring and severance costs,
    litigation and environmental matters, and business combinations.

Revenue
    Recognition

Sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
    exists, pricing is determinable, and collection is reasonably
    assured. Furthermore, sales, provisions for estimated returns,
    and the cost of products sold are recorded at the time title
    transfers to customers and when the customers assume the risks
    and rewards of ownership. Sales terms are generally f.o.b. (free
    on board) shipping point or f.o.b. destination, depending upon
    local business customs. For most regions in which we operate,
    f.o.b. shipping point terms are utilized and sales are recorded
    at the time of shipment, because this is when title and risk of
    loss are transferred. In certain regions, notably in Europe,
    f.o.b. destination terms are generally utilized and sales are
    recorded when the products are delivered to the customer’s
    delivery site, because this is when title and risk of loss are
    transferred. Actual product returns are charged against
    estimated sales return allowances.

Sales rebates and discounts are common practice in the
    industries in which we operate. Volume, promotional, price, cash
    and other discounts and customer incentives are accounted for as
    a reduction to gross sales. Rebates and discounts are recorded
    based upon estimates at the time products are sold. These
    estimates are based upon historical experience for similar
    programs and products. We review such rebates and discounts on
    an ongoing basis and accruals for rebates and discounts are
    adjusted, if necessary, as additional information becomes
    available.



Sales
    Returns and Allowances

Sales returns and allowances represent credits we grant to our
    customers (both affiliated and non-affiliated) for the return of
    unsatisfactory product or a negotiated allowance in lieu of
    return. We accrue for returns and allowances based upon the
    gross price of the products sold and historical experience for
    such products. We record these allowances based on the following
    factors: (i) customer specific allowances; and (ii) an
    estimated amount, based on our historical experience, for issues
    not yet identified.

Accounts
    Receivable Allowances

We are required to make judgments as to the collectibility of
    accounts receivable based on established aging policy,
    historical experience and future expectations. The allowances
    for doubtful accounts represent allowances for customer trade
    accounts receivable that are estimated to be partially or
    entirely uncollectible. These allowances are used to reduce
    gross trade receivables to their net realizable value. We record
    these allowances based on estimates related to the following
    factors: (i) customer specific allowances;
    (ii) amounts based upon an aging schedule; and
    (iii) an estimated amount, based on our historical
    experience, for issues not yet identified. No single customer
    represented 10% or more of our net sales or trade receivables at
    year end 2008 and 2007. However, our ten largest customers at
    year end 2008 represented approximately 13% of trade accounts
    receivable and consisted of five customers of our Office and
    Consumer Products segment, four customers of our
    Pressure-sensitive Materials segment and one customer of both
    these segments. The financial position and operations of these
    customers are monitored on an ongoing basis.

Inventory
    and Inventory Reserves

Inventories are stated at the lower-of-cost-or-market value and
    are categorized as raw materials,

work-in-progress

or finished goods. Cost is determined using the

first-in,

first-out (“FIFO”) method. Inventory reserves are
    recorded for matters such as damaged, obsolete, excess and
    slow-moving inventory. We use estimates to record these
    reserves. Slow-moving inventory is reviewed by category and may
    be partially or fully reserved for depending on the type of
    product and the length of time the product has been included in
    inventory.

Long-lived
    Asset Impairments

We record impairment charges when the carrying amounts of
    long-lived assets are determined not to be recoverable.
    Impairment is measured by assessing the usefulness of an asset
    or by comparing the carrying value of an asset to its fair
    value. Fair value is typically determined using quoted market
    prices, if available, or an estimate of undiscounted future cash
    flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its
    eventual disposition. The key estimates applied when preparing
    cash flow projections relate to revenues, gross margins,
    economic life of assets, overheads, taxation and discount rates.
    The amount of impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the
    carrying value over the fair value. Changes in market conditions
    and management strategy have historically caused us to reassess
    the carrying amount of our long-lived assets.

Goodwill

Our reporting units for the purpose of performing the impairment
    tests for goodwill consist of roll materials; retail information
    services; office and consumer products; graphics and reflective
    products; industrial products; and business media. For the
    purpose of performing the required impairment tests, we
    primarily apply a present value (discounted cash flow) method to
    determine the fair value of the reporting units with goodwill.
    We perform our annual impairment test of goodwill during the
    fourth quarter.

Our reporting units are composed of either a discrete business
    or an aggregation of businesses with similar economic
    characteristics. Certain factors may result in the need to
    perform an impairment test prior to the fourth quarter,
    including significant underperformance of our business relative
    to expected operating results, significant adverse economic and
    industry trends, significant decline in our market
    capitalization for an extended period of time relative to net
    book value, and a decision to divest an individual business
    within a reporting unit.



Goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step process. The
    first step is to identify if a potential impairment exists by
    comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying
    amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting
    unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit
    is not considered to have a potential impairment and the second
    step of the impairment is not necessary. However, if the
    carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the
    second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired
    and to measure the amount of impairment loss to recognize, if
    any.

The second step, if necessary, compares the implied fair value
    of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill. If the implied
    fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying amount, then
    goodwill is not considered impaired. However, if the carrying
    amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment
    loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

We estimate the fair value of our reporting units, using various
    valuation techniques, with the primary technique being a
    discounted cash flow analysis. A discounted cash flow analysis
    requires us to make various judgmental assumptions about sales,
    operating margins, growth rates and discount rates. Assumptions
    about discount rates are based on a weighted-average cost of
    capital for comparable companies. Assumptions about sales,
    operating margins, and growth rates are based on our forecasts,
    business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash
    flows and marketplace data. Assumptions are also made for
    varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term
    business plan period. Because of the increased uncertainty
    resulting from worsening global economic conditions, our revenue
    projections generally assumed reductions in 2009 and a period of
    recovery beginning in 2010.

Our first step impairment analysis for 2008 indicated that the
    fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded its carrying
    value. The fair values of our reporting units, except for the
    retail information services reporting unit, exceeded the
    carrying amount by more than 100% of the respective reporting
    unit’s book value of goodwill at December 27, 2008.
    The fair value of our retail information services reporting unit
    exceeded its carrying value by approximately 5% of its book
    value of goodwill at December 27, 2008 (approximately
    $1.2 billion).

In evaluating the fair value of our retail information services
    reporting unit, we assumed revenue declines for 2009 from 2008
    reflecting a continuation of weakness in the retail apparel
    markets. We then assumed revenue in 2010 increased to levels
    comparable with fiscal year 2007 (including estimated sales for
    Paxar and DM Label, adjusted for foreign currency translation).
    We also assumed a discount rate of 11.8% and a perpetual growth
    rate of 3% reflecting the market conditions in the fourth
    quarter of 2008.

The retail information services business is seasonal, with
    higher volume in the second quarter. We may need to perform an
    impairment test in the second quarter of 2009 if revenues or
    results for this reporting unit during the first and second
    quarters of 2009 are below our estimates, the perpetual growth
    rate is decreased below 2.7%, the discount rate increases above
    12%, or other key assumptions used in our fair value
    calculations in the fourth quarter of 2008 change.

Pension
    and Postretirement Benefits

Effective December 2006, we adopted the provisions of
    SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an
    amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and
    132(R).” Assumptions used in determining projected benefit
    obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension
    plan and other postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by
    management in consultation with outside actuaries. In the event
    we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used,
    such as the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return, or
    health care costs, future pension and postretirement benefit
    expenses could increase or decrease. Due to changing market
    conditions or changes in the participant population, the
    actuarial assumptions we use may differ from actual results,
    which could have a significant impact on our pension and
    postretirement liability and related cost.

Discount
    Rate

We, in consultation with our actuaries, annually review and
    determine the discount rates to be used in connection with our
    postretirement obligations. The assumed discount rate for each
    pension plan reflects market



rates for high quality corporate bonds currently available. In
    the U.S., our discount rate is determined by evaluating several
    yield curves consisting of large populations of high quality
    corporate bonds. The projected pension benefit payment streams
    are then matched with the bond portfolios to determine a rate
    that reflects the liability duration unique to our plans.

Long-term
    Return on Assets

We determine the long-term rate of return assumption for plan
    assets by reviewing the historical and expected returns of both
    the equity and fixed income markets, taking into consideration
    that assets with higher volatility typically generate a greater
    return over the long run. Additionally, current market
    conditions, such as interest rates, are evaluated and peer data
    is reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness.

Healthcare
    Cost Trend Rate

Our practice is to fund the cost of postretirement benefits on a
    cash basis. For measurement purposes, a 7% annual rate of
    increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits
    was assumed for 2009. This rate is expected to decrease to
    approximately 5% by 2011.

Income
    Taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary
    differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for
    financial and tax reporting purposes. Such amounts are adjusted,
    as appropriate, to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be
    in effect when the temporary differences reverse. A valuation
    allowance is recorded to reduce our deferred tax assets to the
    amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Changes in
    tax laws or accounting standards and methods may affect recorded
    deferred taxes in future periods.

Income taxes have not been provided on certain undistributed
    earnings of international subsidiaries because such earnings are
    considered to be indefinitely reinvested.

Pursuant to SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income
    Taxes,” when establishing a valuation allowance, we
    consider future sources of taxable income such as “future
    reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future
    taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and
    carryforwards” and “tax planning strategies.”
    SFAS No. 109 defines a tax planning strategy as
    “an action that: is prudent and feasible; an enterprise
    ordinarily might not take, but would take to prevent an
    operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused;
    and would result in realization of deferred tax assets.” In
    the event we determine the deferred tax assets will not be
    realized in the future, the valuation adjustment to the deferred
    tax assets will be charged to earnings in the period in which we
    make such a determination. We have also acquired certain net
    deferred tax assets with existing valuation allowances. If it is
    later determined that it is more likely than not that the
    deferred tax assets will be realized, we will release the
    valuation allowance to current earnings or adjust the purchase
    price allocation.

We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on
    estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual
    results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent
    years. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when
    identified.

The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits
    by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. Our estimate of
    the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to
    management’s assessment of relevant risks, facts, and
    circumstances existing at that time, pursuant to FASB
    Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN 48”),
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.” FIN 48
    requires a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial
    statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or
    expected to be taken in a tax return. We record a liability for
    the difference between the benefit recognized and measured
    pursuant to FIN 48 and tax position taken or expected to be
    taken on our tax return. To the extent that our assessment of
    such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded
    in the period in which the determination is made. We report
    tax-related interest and penalties as a component of income tax
    expense.

We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there
    will be a material change in the tax related balances or
    valuation allowance balances. However, due to the complexity of
    some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may be
    materially different from the current estimate.



Stock-Based
    Compensation

We recognize expense for stock-based compensation in accordance
    with the provisions of the SFAS No. 123(R),
    “Share-Based Payment.”

Valuation
    of Stock Options

Our stock-based compensation expense is the estimated fair value
    of options granted, amortized on a straight-line basis over the
    requisite service period. The fair value of each of our stock
    option awards is estimated on the date of grant using the
    Black-Scholes option-pricing model. This model requires input
    assumptions for our expected dividend yield, expected
    volatility, risk-free interest rate and the expected life of the
    options.

Expected dividend yield was based on the current annual dividend
    divided by the

12-month

average of our monthly stock price prior to grant.

Expected volatility for options was determined based on an
    average of implied and historical volatility.

Risk-free rate was based on the average of the 52-week average
    of the Treasury-Bond rate that has a term corresponding to the
    expected option term.

Expected term was determined based on historical experience
    under our stock option plans.

Forfeiture rate assumption was determined based on historical
    data of our stock option forfeitures.

Certain of the assumptions used above are based on
    management’s estimates. As such, if factors change and such
    factors require us to change our assumptions and estimates, our
    stock-based compensation expense could be significantly
    different in the future.

We have not capitalized costs associated with stock-based
    compensation.

Accounting
    for Income Taxes for Stock-based Compensation

We elected to use the short-cut method to calculate the
    historical pool of windfall tax benefits related to employee
    stock-based compensation awards. In addition, we elected to
    follow the tax ordering laws to determine the sequence in which
    deductions and net operating loss carryforwards are utilized, as
    well as the direct-only approach to calculating the amount of
    windfall or shortfall tax benefits.

Restructuring
    and Severance Costs

We account for restructuring costs including severance and other
    costs associated with exit or disposal activities following the
    guidance provided in SFAS No. 112, “Accounting
    for Postemployment Benefits,” and SFAS No. 146,
    “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
    Activities.” In the U.S., we have a severance pay plan
    (“Pay Plan”), which provides eligible employees with
    severance payments in the event of an involuntary termination
    due to qualifying cost reduction actions. We calculate severance
    pay using the severance benefit formula under the Pay Plan.
    Accordingly, we record provisions for such amounts and other
    related exit costs when they are probable and estimable as set
    forth under SFAS No. 112. In the absence of a Pay Plan
    or established local practices for overseas jurisdictions,
    liability for severance and other employee-related costs is
    recognized when the liability is incurred, following the
    guidance of SFAS No. 146.

Litigation
    and Environmental Matters

We are currently involved in various lawsuits, claims and
    inquiries, most of which are routine to the nature of our
    business. In accordance with SFAS No. 5,
    “Accounting for Contingencies,” when it is probable
    that obligations have been incurred and where a range of the
    cost of compliance or remediation can be estimated, the best
    estimate within the range, or if the most likely amount cannot
    be determined, the low end of the range is accrued. The ultimate
    resolution of these claims could affect future results of
    operations should our exposure be materially different from our
    earlier estimates or should liabilities be incurred that were
    not previously accrued.



Environmental expenditures are generally expensed. However,
    environmental expenditures for newly acquired assets and those
    which extend or improve the economic useful life of existing
    assets are capitalized and amortized over the remaining asset
    life. We review each reporting period our estimates of costs of
    compliance with environmental laws related to remediation and
    cleanup of various sites, including sites in which governmental
    agencies have designated us a potentially responsible party.
    When it is probable that obligations have been incurred and
    where a range of the cost of compliance or remediation can be
    estimated, the best estimate within the range is accrued. When
    the best estimate within the range cannot be determined, the low
    end of the range is accrued. Potential insurance reimbursements
    are not offset against potential liabilities, and such
    liabilities are not discounted.

Business
    Combinations

We account for business combinations using the accounting
    requirements of SFAS No. 141, “Business
    Combinations.” In accordance with SFAS No. 141,
    we record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from
    acquired businesses at fair value, and we make estimates and
    assumptions to determine such fair values.

We utilize a variety of assumptions and estimates that are
    believed to be reasonable in determining fair value for assets
    acquired and liabilities assumed. These assumptions and
    estimates include discounted cash flow analysis, growth rates,
    discount rates, current replacement cost for similar capacity
    for certain assets, market rate assumptions for certain
    obligations and certain potential costs of compliance with
    environmental laws related to remediation and cleanup of
    acquired properties. We also utilize information obtained from
    management of the acquired businesses and our own historical
    experience from previous acquisitions.

We apply significant assumptions and estimates in determining
    certain intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions (such
    as customer relationships, patents and other acquired
    technology, and trademarks and trade names and related
    applicable useful lives), property, plant and equipment,
    receivables, inventories, investments, tax accounts,
    environmental liabilities, stock option awards, lease
    commitments and restructuring and integration costs.
    Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may
    affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates
    or actual results. As such, increases to estimates are recorded
    as an adjustment to goodwill during the purchase price
    allocation period (generally within one year of the acquisition
    date) and as operating expenses thereafter.

Effective January 2009, we will adopt SFAS No. 141(R),
    “Business Combinations.” We are currently evaluating
    the impact of this Statement on our financial results of
    operations and financial position.

RECENT
    ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS

During 2008, we adopted certain accounting and financial
    disclosure requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (“FASB”), Emerging Issues Task Force
    (“EITF”) and Financial Interpretations by the staff of
    the FASB, none of which had a significant impact on our
    financial results of operations and financial position. Refer to
    Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    more information.

Certain of such risks and uncertainties are discussed in more
    detail in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,”
    to the Company’s Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for the year ended December 27, 2008, and include, but are
    not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to investment
    in development activities and new production facilities;
    fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials; ability
    of the Company to achieve and sustain targeted cost reductions;
    ability of the Company to generate sustained productivity
    improvement; successful integration of acquisitions; successful
    implementation of new manufacturing technologies and
    installation of manufacturing equipment; the financial condition
    and inventory strategies of customers; customer and supplier
    concentrations; changes in customer order patterns; loss of
    significant contract(s) or customer(s); timely development and
    market acceptance of new products; fluctuations in demand by
    retailers and other customers for our products; impact of
    competitive products and pricing; selling prices; possible
    increases in per unit product manufacturing costs due to less
    than full utilization of manufacturing capacity as a result of
    changing economic conditions and other factors; possible
    increases in payment time for receivables as a result of
    changing economic conditions or other factors; business mix
    shift; volatility of capital and credit markets; credit risks;
    ability of the Company to obtain adequate financing arrangements
    and to maintain access to capital; fluctuations in interest
    rates; fluctuations in pension, insurance and employee benefit
    costs; impact of legal proceedings, including a previous
    government investigation into industry competitive practices,
    and any related proceedings or lawsuits pertaining thereto or to
    the subject matter thereof related to the concluded
    investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice
    (“DOJ”) (including purported class actions seeking
    treble damages for alleged unlawful competitive practices, which
    were filed after the announcement of the DOJ investigation), as
    well as the impact of potential violations of the
    U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; changes in governmental
    regulations; changes in political conditions; fluctuations in
    foreign currency exchange rates and other risks associated with
    foreign operations; worldwide and local economic conditions;
    impact of epidemiological events on the economy and the
    Company’s customers and suppliers; acts of war, terrorism,
    natural disasters; and other factors.

The Company believes that the most significant risk factors that
    could affect its financial performance in the near-term include
    (1) the impact of economic conditions on underlying demand
    for the Company’s products; (2) the impact of
    competitors’ actions, including pricing, expansion in key
    markets, and product offerings; (3) the degree to which
    higher costs can be offset with productivity measures

and/or

passed on to customers through selling price increases, without
    a significant loss of volume; (4) potential adverse
    developments in legal proceedings

and/or

investigations, including possible fines, penalties, judgments
    or settlements; and (5) the ability of the Company to
    achieve and sustain targeted cost reductions.

The Company’s forward-looking statements represent judgment
    only on the dates such statements were made. By making such
    forward-looking statements, the Company assumes no duty to
    update them to reflect new, changed or unanticipated events or
    circumstances, other than as may be required by law.

Item 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Risk
    Management

We are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates and
    foreign currency exchange rates.

Our policy is not to purchase or hold foreign currency, interest
    rate or commodity contracts for trading purposes.

Our objective in managing the exposure to foreign currency
    changes is to reduce the risk to our earnings and cash flow
    associated with foreign exchange rate changes. As a result, we
    enter into foreign exchange forward, option and swap contracts
    to reduce risks associated with the value of our existing
    foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and
    anticipated foreign revenues and costs, when available and
    appropriate. The gains and losses on these contracts are
    intended to offset changes in the related exposures. We do not
    hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that would
    entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange
    rates on our consolidated net income.

Our objective in managing our exposure to interest rate changes
    is to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and
    cash flows. To achieve our objectives, we may periodically use
    interest rate contracts to manage the exposure to interest rate
    changes related to our borrowings. In June 2007 and August 2007,
    we entered into certain interest rate option contracts to hedge
    our exposure related to interest rate increases in connection
    with our



anticipated long-term debt issuances. Such debt issuances were
    intended to replace the short-term borrowings initially used to
    finance the Paxar acquisition and to support the refinancing of
    our current long-term debt maturities. In connection with these
    transactions, we paid $11.5 million as option premiums, of
    which $4.8 million was recognized during 2007 as a cash
    flow hedge loss in the Consolidated Statement of Income and
    $6.7 million is being amortized over the life of the
    related forecasted hedged transactions.

Additionally, we enter into certain natural gas futures
    contracts to reduce the risks associated with anticipated
    domestic natural gas used in manufacturing and operations. These
    amounts are not material to our financial statements.

In the normal course of operations, we also face other risks
    that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable. Such risks
    principally include changes in economic or political conditions,
    other risks associated with foreign operations, commodity price
    risk and litigation risk, which are not represented in the
    analyses that follow.

Foreign
    Exchange

Value-At-Risk

We use a

Value-At-Risk

(“VAR”) model to determine the estimated maximum
    potential

one-day

loss
    in earnings associated with both our foreign exchange positions
    and contracts. This approach assumes that market rates or prices
    for foreign exchange positions and contracts are normally
    distributed. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal
    market conditions. Firm commitments, accounts receivable and
    accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies, which
    certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were
    included in the model. Forecasted transactions, which certain of
    these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the
    model. The VAR was estimated using a variance-covariance
    methodology based on historical volatility for each currency.
    The volatility and correlation used in the calculation were
    based on two-year historical data obtained from one of our
    domestic banks. A 95% confidence level was used for a

one-day

time
    horizon.

The VAR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to
    represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred by
    us, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable
    changes in market factors.

The estimated maximum potential

one-day

loss
    in earnings for our foreign exchange positions and contracts was
    approximately $1.7 million at year end 2008.

Interest
    Rate Sensitivity

An assumed 30 basis point move in interest rates (10% of
    our weighted-average interest rate on floating rate debt)
    affecting our variable-rate borrowings would have had an
    estimated $4 million effect on our 2008 earnings.

Item 9A.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

As of the
    end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried
    out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
    participation of its management, including the Chief Executive
    Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of
    the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure
    controls and procedures (as defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

or

15d-15(e)

of the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, the
    Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer have concluded that the Company’s



disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide
    reasonable assurance that information is recorded, processed,
    summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
    SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is
    accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management,
    including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial
    Officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
    required disclosure.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting.

Management is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting (as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

or

15d-15(f)

of the Exchange Act). Under the supervision and with the
    participation of the Company’s management, including the
    Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the
    Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its
    internal control over financial reporting based upon the
    framework in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that
    evaluation, the Company’s management concluded that its
    internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
    December 27, 2008. (See Management’s Report on
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting on page 73 in the
    Company’s 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders.)

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 27, 2008, has been audited by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their Report of Independent
    Registered Public Accounting Firm on page 74 in the
    Company’s 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders, and is
    incorporated herein by reference. Management has excluded DM
    Label from its assessment of internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 27, 2008 because it was acquired
    by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2008.
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has also excluded DM Label from their
    audit of internal control over financial reporting. DM Label is
    a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues
    represent 3 percent and less than 1 percent,
    respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement
    amounts for the Company as of and for the year ended
    December 27, 2008.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting.

There have been no changes in the
    Company’s internal controls over financial reporting during
    the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or
    are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s
    internal controls over financial reporting.
