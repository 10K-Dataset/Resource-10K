Company Background

Avery Dennison Corporation ("Avery Dennison," the "Company," "Registrant," or "Issuer," which are generally referred to as "we" or "us") was
incorporated in Delaware in 1977 as Avery International Corporation, the successor corporation to a California corporation of the same name that had been incorporated in 1946. In 1990, we merged one
of our subsidiaries into Dennison Manufacturing Company ("Dennison"), as a result of which Dennison became our wholly-owned subsidiary and in connection with which our name was changed to Avery
Dennison Corporation. You can learn more about us by visiting our website at www.averydennison.com. Our website address provided in this Form 10-K is not intended to function as a hyperlink and
the information on our website is not, nor should it be considered, part of this report or incorporated by reference into this report.

Business Overview and Reportable Segments

Our businesses include the production of pressure-sensitive materials and a variety of tickets, tags, labels and other converted products. We
sell most of our pressure-sensitive materials to label printers and converters that convert the materials into labels and other products through embossing, printing, stamping and die-cutting. We sell
other pressure-sensitive materials in converted form as tapes and reflective sheeting. We also manufacture and sell a variety of other converted products and items not involving pressure-sensitive
components, such as fasteners, tickets, tags, radio-frequency identification ("RFID") inlays and tags, and imprinting equipment and related services, which we market to retailers, apparel
manufacturers, and brand owners.

Our
reportable segments for fiscal year 2017 were:

•

Label and Graphic Materials ("LGM");

•

Retail Branding and Information Solutions ("RBIS"); and

•

Industrial and Healthcare Materials ("IHM").

In
2017, the LGM, RBIS, and IHM segments made up approximately 68%, 23% and 9%, respectively, of our total sales.

In
2017, international operations constituted a substantial majority of our business, representing approximately 76% of our sales. As of December 30, 2017, we operated
approximately 180 manufacturing and distribution facilities worldwide with approximately 30,000 employees and had operations in over 50 countries.

Label and Graphic Materials Segment

Our LGM segment manufactures and sells Fasson®-, JAC®-, and Avery Dennison®-brand pressure-sensitive label
and packaging materials, Avery Dennison®- and Mactac®-brand graphics, and Avery Dennison®-brand reflective products. The business of this segment tends not to be
seasonal, except for certain outdoor graphics and reflective products.

Pressure-sensitive
materials consist primarily of papers, plastic films, metal foils and fabrics, which are coated with internally-developed and purchased adhesives, and then laminated
with specially-coated backing papers and films. They are sold in roll or sheet form with either solid or patterned adhesive coatings, and are available in a wide range of face materials, sizes,
thicknesses and adhesive properties.

A
pressure-sensitive, or self-adhesive, material is one that adheres to a surface by press-on contact. It generally consists of four layers: a face material, which may be paper, metal
foil, plastic film or fabric; an



adhesive,
which may be permanent or removable; a release coating; and a backing material to protect the adhesive from premature contact with other surfaces which can also serve as a carrier for
supporting and dispensing individual labels. When the products are to be used, the release coating and protective backing are removed, exposing the adhesive so that the label or other face material
may be pressed or rolled into place. Because they are easy to apply without the need for adhesive activation, self-adhesive materials can provide cost savings compared to other materials that require
heat- or moisture-activated adhesives and offer aesthetic and other advantages over alternative technologies.

Label
and packaging materials are sold worldwide to label converters for labeling, decorating, and specialty applications in the home and personal care, beer and beverage, durables,
pharmaceutical, wine and spirits, and food market segments. When used in package decoration applications, the visual appeal of self-adhesive materials can help increase sales of the products on which
the materials are applied. Self-adhesive materials are also used to convey variable information, such as bar codes for mailing or weight and price information for packaged meats and other foods.
Self-adhesive materials provide consistent and versatile adhesion and are available in a large selection of materials, which can be made into labels of varying sizes and shapes.

Our
graphics and reflective products include a variety of films and other products that are sold to the architectural, commercial sign, digital printing, and other related market
segments. We also sell durable cast and reflective films to the construction, automotive, and fleet transportation market segments and reflective films for traffic and safety applications. We provide
sign shops, commercial printers and designers a broad range of pressure-sensitive materials to enable them to create impactful and informative brand and decorative graphics. We have an array of
pressure-sensitive vinyl and specialty materials designed for digital imaging, screen printing and sign cutting applications.

In
the LGM segment, our larger competitors in label and packaging materials include Raflatac, a subsidiary of UPM-Kymmene Corporation; Lintec Corporation; Ritrama, Inc.; Flexcon
Corporation, Inc.; and various regional firms. For graphics and reflective products, our largest competitors are 3M Company ("3M") and the Orafol Group. We believe that entry of competitors
into the field of pressure-sensitive adhesives and materials is limited by technical knowledge and capital requirements. We believe that our technical expertise, size and scale of operations, broad
line of quality products and service programs, distribution capabilities, brand strength, and new product innovation are the primary advantages in maintaining and further developing our competitive
position.

Retail Branding and Information Solutions Segment

Our RBIS segment designs, manufactures and sells a wide variety of branding and information solutions to retailers, brand owners, apparel
manufacturers, distributors and industrial customers. This segment experiences some seasonality, with higher volume generally in advance of the spring, fall (back-to-school), and holiday shipping
periods. In recent years, as the apparel industry has moved to more frequent seasonal updates, this segment has experienced less seasonality.

The
branding solutions of RBIS include creative services, brand embellishments, graphic tickets, tags, and labels, and sustainable packaging. RBIS information solutions include
item-level RFID solutions; visibility and loss prevention solutions; price ticketing and marking; care, content, and country of origin compliance solutions; and brand protection and security
solutions.

In
the RBIS segment, our primary competitors include Checkpoint Systems, Inc., a subsidiary of CCL Industries Inc.; R-pac International Corporation; and SML Group Limited.
We believe that our global distribution network, reliable service, product quality and consistency, and ability to serve customers consistently with comprehensive solutions wherever they manufacture
are the key advantages in maintaining and further developing our competitive position.



Industrial and Healthcare Materials Segment

Our IHM segment manufactures and sells Fasson®-brand and Avery Dennison®-brand tapes and fasteners,
Vancive

TM

-brand medical pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) based materials and products, and performance polymers. Our tape products include coated tapes and adhesive transfer tapes that
are sold for use in non-mechanical fastening, bonding and sealing systems. IHM also manufactures and sells Yongle® brand tapes for wire harnessing and cable wrapping in automotive,
electrical, and general industrial applications. The mechanical fasteners are primarily precision extruded and injection-molded plastic devices used in various automotive, industrial, and retail
applications.

These
tapes and fasteners are sold worldwide to original equipment manufacturers, and their supply chain partners (tier one suppliers and converters). The tapes are available in roll
form and in a wide range of face materials, sizes, thicknesses and adhesive properties, and are used in various bonding and fastening applications in the automotive, electronics, building and
construction, other industrial, and personal care segments.

Our
Vancive-brand products include an array of PSA materials and products that address the needs of medical device manufacturers, converters, clinicians, and patients for surgical, wound
care, ostomy, diagnostic, electromedical and wearable device applications. Acquired in May 2017, Finesse Medical Ltd. has a range of products, including private-label wound and skin care
devices, sold to medical device manufacturers and regional distributors.

For
tapes and bonding solutions, our primary competitors include 3M; Tesa-SE, a subsidiary of Beiersdorf AG; Nitto Denko Corporation; and various regional firms. We believe that entry of
competitors into this field is limited by technical knowledge and capital requirements. We believe that our technical expertise, size and scale of operations, broad line of quality products and new
product innovation are the most significant advantages in maintaining and further developing our competitive position in this business. For Vancive products, we compete with a variety of specialized
medical tapes and converted products suppliers ranging from start-ups to multinational companies. We believe that entry into the medical solutions business is limited by capital and regulatory
requirements. For fastener products, there are a variety of competitors supplying extruded and injection molded fasteners and fastener attaching equipment. They range from smaller regional competitors
to multinational companies. We believe that entry into this business is limited by capital requirements and technical knowledge. For both our Vancive and fastener solutions businesses, we believe that
our ability to serve our customers with high-quality, cost-effective solutions and our innovation capabilities are the most significant factors in developing our competitive position.

Segment Financial Information

Certain financial information on our reporting segments for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015 appears in Note 15, "Segment Information,"
in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our 2017 Annual Report to Shareholders (our "2017 Annual Report") and is incorporated herein by reference.

Foreign Operations

Certain financial information about our sales by geographic area and property, plant and equipment in our U.S. and international operations for
fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015 appears in Note 15, "Segment Information," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our 2017 Annual Report and is incorporated herein by
reference.



Working Capital

Certain financial information about our working capital for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015 appears in the "Financial Condition" section of
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" (Part II, Item 7) and is incorporated herein by reference.

Research and Development

Many of our products are the result of our research and development efforts. Our research efforts are directed primarily toward developing new
products and operating techniques and improving productivity and product performance, often in close association with customers. These efforts include patent and product development work relating to
printing and coating technologies, as well as adhesive, release and ink chemistries in our LGM and IHM segments. Additionally, we focus on research projects related to RFID and external embellishments
in our RBIS segment and medical technologies in our IHM segment, for both of which we hold and license a number of patents.

Our
expenses for research and development were $93.4 million in 2017, $89.7 million in 2016, and $91.9 million in 2015.

Patents, Trademarks and Licenses

The loss of individual patents or licenses would not be material to us taken as a whole, nor to our operating segments individually. Our
principal trademarks are Avery Dennison, our logo, and Fasson. We believe these trademarks are strong in the market segments in which we compete.

Manufacturing and Environmental Matters

We use various raw materials – primarily paper, plastic films and resins, as well as specialty chemicals purchased from
various commercial and industrial sources – that are subject to price fluctuations. Although shortages can occur from time to time, these raw materials are generally available.

We
produce a majority of our self-adhesive materials using water-based emulsion and hot-melt adhesive technologies. A portion of our manufacturing process for self-adhesive materials
utilizes organic solvents, which, unless controlled, could be emitted into the atmosphere or contaminate soil or groundwater. Emissions from these operations contain small amounts of volatile organic
compounds, which are regulated by federal, state, local and foreign governments. We continue to evaluate the use of alternative materials and technologies to minimize these emissions. In connection
with the maintenance and acquisition of certain manufacturing equipment, we invest in solvent capture and control units to assist in regulating these emissions.

We
have developed adhesives and adhesive processing systems that minimize the use of solvents. Emulsion adhesives, hot-melt adhesives, and solventless and emulsion silicone systems have
been installed in many of our facilities.

Based
on current information, we do not believe that the cost of complying with applicable laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the
protection of the environment, will have a material effect upon our capital expenditures, consolidated financial position or results of operations.

For
information regarding our potential responsibility for cleanup costs at certain hazardous waste sites, see "Legal Proceedings" (Part I, Item 3) and "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" (Part II, Item 7).

Item 1A.        RISK FACTORS

The
risk factors described below, as well as the matters generally described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated herein by reference, could
materially adversely affect our business, including our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and cause the value of our securities to decline. The risks described below are not
exhaustive. Our ability to attain our goals and objectives is dependent on numerous factors and risks, including but not limited to, the primary ones described below.

The demand for our products is impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic, political and
market conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

In 2017, approximately 76% of our sales were from international operations. We have operations in over 50 countries and our domestic and
international operations are strongly influenced by matters beyond our control, including changes in political, social, economic and labor conditions, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign
earnings), and international trade regulations (including tariffs), as well as the impact of these changes on the underlying demand for our products.

Macroeconomic
developments such as slower growth in certain regions, the ongoing restructuring efforts relating to European sovereign and other debt obligations, the continuing
uncertainty surrounding the exit of the United Kingdom ("UK") from the European Union, the weakening or strengthening of local economies in which we operate, and uncertainty in the global credit or
financial markets leading to the loss of consumer confidence could result in a material adverse effect on our business as a result of, among other things, reduced consumer spending, declines in asset
valuations, diminished liquidity and credit availability, volatility in securities prices, credit rating downgrades, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Fluctuations in currencies,
such as the value of the euro and the British pound in 2017, can result in a variety of negative effects, including lower revenues, increased costs, lower gross margin percentages, increased
allowances for doubtful accounts and/or write-offs of accounts receivable, and required recognition of impairments of capitalized assets, including goodwill and other intangibles.

We
continue to face uncertainty with respect to trade relations between the U.S. and many of its trading partners. There remains a significant risk that tariffs or other restrictions
could be imposed on products imported from China, Mexico or other countries, or that relations with these countries could



more
broadly deteriorate. These countries could retaliate by imposing similar tariffs or restrictions on products exported from the U.S. Any of these actions or further developments in U.S. trade
relations could have a material adverse effect on our business.

In
addition, business and operational disruptions or delays caused by political, social or economic instability and unrest – such as the ongoing civil, political and
economic disturbances in places like Russia, Ukraine, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, North Korea and the related impact on global stability, terrorist attacks and the potential for other hostilities,
public health crises or natural disasters in various parts of the world – could contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that in turn could have material
adverse effects on our business. We are not able to predict the duration and severity of adverse economic, political or market conditions in the U.S. or other countries.

As a manufacturer, our sales and profitability are dependent upon the cost and availability of raw materials
and energy, which are subject to price fluctuations, and our ability to control or offset raw material and labor costs. Raw material cost increases could materially adversely affect our business.

The environment for raw materials used in our businesses could become challenging and volatile, impacting availability and pricing.
Additionally, energy costs can be volatile and unpredictable. Shortages and inflationary or other increases in the costs of raw materials, labor and energy have occurred in the past, and could recur.
Our performance depends in part on our ability to offset cost increases for raw materials by raising the selling prices for our products and improving productivity. For example, in 2017, we announced
targeted price increases in our LGM segment in all regions to address our outlook for raw material inflation, including in China, the U.S. and certain countries in Europe.

Also,
it is important for us to obtain timely delivery of materials, equipment, and other resources from suppliers, and to make timely delivery to customers. We may experience supply
chain interruptions due to natural and other disasters or other events, or our existing relationships with suppliers could be terminated in the future. Any such disruption to our supply chain could
have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability, and any sustained interruption in our receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on our business.

We are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences. If we do not compete effectively, we
could lose market share or reduce selling prices to maintain market share, which could materially adversely affect our business.

We are at risk that our competitors, which include certain of our customers, distributors, and suppliers, will expand in our key market segments
and implement new technologies, enhancing their competitive position relative to ours. Competitors also may be able to offer additional products, services, lower prices, or other incentives that we
cannot or would not offer or that would make our products less profitable. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors.

We
also are at risk to changes in customer order patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases, which may be affected
by announced price changes, changes in our incentive programs, or changes in the customer's ability to achieve incentive targets. Changes in customers' preferences for our products can also affect the
demand for our products. Decline in demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, in 2016, we announced a program loss in personal care tapes that had a
negative impact on our business during 2016 and 2017 compared to the prior year.



We have recently acquired companies and are likely to acquire other companies. Acquisitions come with
significant risks and uncertainties, including those related to integration, technology and employees.

To grow existing businesses and expand into new areas, we have made acquisitions and are likely to continue doing so. In 2016, we completed the
acquisition of the European business of Mactac, a leading manufacturer of high-quality pressure-sensitive materials serving several graphics, specialty labels and industrial tapes segments, for
$220 million. In 2017, we completed the following acquisitions for an aggregate of approximately $360 million: Yongle Tape Ltd., a China-based manufacturer of specialty tapes and
related products used in a variety of industrial markets; Finesse Medical Ltd., an Ireland-based manufacturer of healthcare products used in the management of wound care and skin conditions;
and the net assets of Hanita Coatings Rural Cooperative Association Limited, an Israel-based pressure-sensitive manufacturer of specialty films and laminates, and stock of certain of its subsidiaries.
Various risks, uncertainties, and costs are associated with acquisitions. Effective integration of systems, controls, employees, product lines, market segments, customers, suppliers, and
production facilities and cost savings can be difficult to achieve and the results of integration actions are uncertain. In addition, we may not be able to retain key employees of an acquired company
or successfully execute integration strategies and achieve projected performance targets for the business segment into which an acquired company is integrated. Both before and after the closing of an
acquisition, our business and those of the acquired company or companies may suffer due to uncertainty or diversion of management attention. There can be no assurance that any acquisitions will be
successful and contribute to our profitability and we may not be able to identify or execute new acquisition opportunities in the future.

Because some of our products are sold by third parties, our business depends in part on the financial health
of these parties.

Some of our products are sold not only by us, but also by third-party distributors. Some of our distributors also market products that compete
with our products. Changes in the financial or business conditions, including economic weakness, market trends or industry consolidation, or the purchasing decisions of these third parties or their
customers could materially adversely affect our business.

We outsource some of our manufacturing. If there are significant changes in the quality control or financial
or business condition of these outsourced manufacturers, our business could be negatively impacted.

We manufacture most of our products, but we also occasionally use third-party manufacturers to optimize production efficiencies, manage capacity
overflow, and produce specialty jobs, particularly in our RBIS segment. Outsourcing manufacturing reduces our ability to prevent product quality issues, late deliveries, customer dissatisfaction and
noncompliance with customer requirements. While we have stringent onboarding processes and continuous performance assessments for these outsourced manufacturers, we may experience quality issues and
customer dissatisfaction which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our operations and activities outside of the U.S. may subject us to risks different from and potentially
greater than those associated with our domestic operations

.

A
substantial portion of our employees and assets are located outside of the U.S. and, for the year ended December 30, 2017, approximately 76% of our sales were
generated from customers located outside of the U.S. International operations and activities involve risks that are different from and potentially greater than the risks we face with respect to our
domestic operations, including our less extensive knowledge of and relationships with contractors, suppliers, distributors and customers in certain of these markets; changes in foreign political,
regulatory and economic conditions, including nationally, regionally and locally; materially adverse effects of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies; laws and regulations impacting the
ability to repatriate foreign earnings; challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to sales, operations, taxes, employment and legal



proceedings;
establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate our international operations and monitor compliance with U.S. laws and regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and
similar foreign laws and regulations, including the United Kingdom's Bribery Act of 2010; differences in lending practices; challenges with complying with applicable export and import control laws and
regulations; and differences in languages, cultures and time zones.

The
realization of any of these risks or the failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations could expose us to liabilities and have a material adverse effect on our business.

In
June 2016, the UK held a referendum in which voters approved the UK's exit from the European Union (commonly known as "Brexit"). The immediate impact of Brexit was a significant
decline in the value of the British pound compared to the U.S. dollar. There may be further volatility in the value of the British pound and the economic stability of the UK, which may affect our
ability to sell products in the UK. There is also continued uncertainty as to how Brexit will affect the legal and regulatory environment in the UK and European Union, as well as whether other
countries in the European Union may approve similar measures and cause further uncertainty in the region. While our operations in the UK are relatively small, legal and regulatory changes in this
region could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our reputation, sales, and earnings could be materially adversely affected if the quality of our products and
services does not meet customer expectations. In addition, product liability claims or regulatory actions could materially adversely affect our business or reputation.

There are occasions when we experience product quality issues resulting from defective materials, manufacturing, packaging or design. These
issues are often discovered before shipping, causing delays in shipping, delays in the manufacturing process, and occasionally cancelled orders. When issues are discovered after shipment, they may
result in additional shipping costs, discounts, refunds, or loss of future sales. Both pre-shipping and post-shipping quality issues could have material adverse effects on our business and negatively
impact our reputation.

Claims
for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of our products arise in the ordinary course of our business. In addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments and
penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our business, product liability claims or regulatory actions could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation in the marketplace
and the value of our brands. We also could be required to recall and possibly discontinue the sale of potentially defective or unsafe products, which could result in adverse publicity and significant
expenses. Although we maintain product liability insurance coverage, potential product liability claims are subject to a deductible or may not be covered under the terms of the policy.

Changes in our business strategies may increase our costs and could affect the profitability of our
businesses.

As our business environment changes, we may need to adjust our business strategies or restructure our operations or particular businesses. We
are in the process of a multi-year transformation of our RBIS segment focused on accelerating growth through a more regionally driven business model intended to simplify our go-to-market strategy,
optimize management efficiencies and consolidate our manufacturing footprint. In addition, we have initiated restructuring and investment actions across our businesses designed to increase
profitability. As we continue to develop and adjust our growth strategies, we may invest in new businesses that have short-term returns that are negative or low and whose ultimate business prospects
are uncertain or unprofitable. For example, in 2015, we exited one of our anticipated growth platforms in our IHM segment to refocus our efforts on more profitable strategic alternatives. We cannot
provide assurance that we will achieve the intended results of any of our business strategies, which involve operational complexities, consume management attention and require substantial resources
and effort. If we fail to achieve the intended results of such actions, our costs could increase, our assets could be impaired, and our returns on investments could be lower.



Our growth strategy includes increased concentration in emerging markets, which could create greater exposure
to unstable political conditions, civil unrest, economic volatility and other risks applicable to international operations.

An increasing amount of our sales are derived from emerging markets, including countries in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe. The
profitable growth of our business in emerging markets is a significant focus of our long-term growth strategy and our regional results can fluctuate significantly based on economic conditions in these
regions, which occurred with our results in China in 2016. Our business operations may be adversely affected by the current and future political environment in China. Our ability to operate in China
may be adversely affected by changes in Chinese
laws and regulations or the interpretation thereof, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, raw materials, environmental regulations, land use rights, property, foreign
currency conversion, the regulation of private enterprises and other matters.

If
we are unable to successfully expand our business in China or other emerging markets or achieve the return on capital we expect as a result of our investments in these countries, our
financial performance could be materially adversely affected. In addition to the risks applicable to our international operations, factors that could have a material adverse effect on our operations
in these emerging markets include the lack of well-established or reliable legal systems and possible disruptions due to unstable political conditions, civil unrest or economic volatility. These
factors could have a material adverse effect on our business by decreasing consumer purchasing power, reducing demand for our products or impairing our ability to achieve our long-term goals.

If we are unable to develop and successfully market new products and applications, we could compromise our
competitive position.

The timely introduction of new products and improvements in current products helps determine our success. Many of our current products are the
result of our research and development efforts. Our research efforts are directed primarily toward developing new products and operating techniques and improving product performance, often in close
association with our customers or end users. These efforts include patent and product development work relating to printing and coating technologies, as well as adhesive, release and ink chemistries
in our LGM and IHM segments. Additionally, we focus on research projects related to RFID and external embellishments in our RBIS segment and medical technologies in our IHM segment, for both of which
we hold and license a number of patents. However, research and development is complex and uncertain, requiring innovation and anticipation of market trends. We could focus on products that ultimately
are not accepted by customers or end users or we could suffer delays in the production or launch of new products that may not lead to the recovery of our research and development expenditures and, as
a result, could compromise our competitive position.

Miscalculation of our infrastructure needs could have a material adverse effect on our business.

We may not be able to recoup the costs of our infrastructure investments if actual demand is not as we anticipate. In recent years, we expanded
our manufacturing facility located in Kunshan, China; moved our RBIS Vietnam business into a new, expanded facility; added a new coater to meet our projected demand for pressure-sensitive tapes in
China; and made additional investments in capacity to support growth in our U.S. graphics business, in Asia and Luxembourg, and in RFID and heat transfer technology. In addition, we added capacity
through our recent acquisitions of Mactac
Europe, Yongle Tapes, Hanita Coatings and Finesse Medical. Infrastructure investments, which are long-term in nature, may not generate the expected return due to changes in the marketplace, failures
to complete implementation, and other factors. Significant changes from our expected need for and/or returns on our infrastructure investments could materially adversely affect our business.



Our future profitability may be materially adversely affected if we generate less productivity improvement
than projected.

We engage in restructuring actions intended to reduce our costs and increase efficiencies across our business segments. For example, we are in
the process of a multi-year transformation of our RBIS segment focused on accelerating growth through a more regionally driven business model intended to simplify our go-to-market strategy, optimize
management efficiencies and consolidate our manufacturing footprint. In addition, we intend to continue efforts to reduce costs in our operations, which have in the past included, and may continue to
include, facility closures and square footage reductions, headcount reductions, organizational restructuring, process standardization, and manufacturing relocation. The success of these efforts is not
assured and lower levels of productivity could reduce profitability. In addition, cost reduction actions could expose us to production risk, loss of sales and employee turnover.

Foreign currency exchange rates, and fluctuations in those rates, may materially adversely affect our
business.

With approximately 76% of our sales for the fiscal year ending December 30, 2017 arising from foreign sales, we are subject to
fluctuations in foreign currencies, such as the euro and the Chinese Yuan (renminbi), which can cause transaction, translation and other losses, and could negatively impact our sales and
profitability. Margins on sales of our products in foreign countries could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

We
monitor our foreign currency exposures and may, from time to time, use hedging instruments to mitigate transactional and translational exposure to changes in foreign currencies. For
example, in 2017, we designated our €500 million senior notes as a net investment hedge of our investment in foreign operations to mitigate our foreign currency translation
exposure. The
effectiveness of our hedges in part depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows, which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services
and highly volatile exchange rates. Further, hedging activities may only offset a portion, or none at all, of the material adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates
over the limited time the hedges are in place and we may incur significant losses from hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility and foreign currency fluctuations.

Continued
concerns regarding the short- and long-term stability of the euro and its ability to serve as a single currency for countries in the Eurozone could lead individual countries to
revert, or threaten to revert, to their former local currencies, potentially dislocating the euro. If this were to occur, the assets we hold in a country that re-introduces its local currency could be
significantly devalued, the cost of raw materials or our manufacturing operations could substantially increase, and the demand and pricing for our products could be materially adversely affected.
Furthermore, if it were to become necessary for us to conduct business in additional currencies, we could be subject to additional earnings volatility as amounts in these currencies are translated
into U.S. dollars.

Difficulty in the collection of receivables as a result of economic conditions or other market factors could
have a material adverse effect on our business.

Although we have processes to administer credit granted to customers and believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate, we have
experienced, and in the future may experience, losses as a result of our inability to collect certain accounts receivable. The financial difficulties of a customer could result in reduced business
with that customer. We may also assume higher credit risk relating to receivables of a customer experiencing financial difficulty. If these developments occur, our inability to collect on our accounts
receivable from major customers could substantially reduce our cash flows and income and have a material adverse effect on our business.



Changes in our tax rates could affect our future results.

Our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in
the valuation of deferred tax assets and
liabilities, or changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation, including, among others, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "TCJA") enacted on December 22, 2017 in the U.S. There can
be no assurance that these changes will not have a material adverse effect on our business.

The TCJA may materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The TCJA has significantly changed the federal income taxation of U.S. corporations by, among other things, reducing the federal corporate
income tax rate, limiting interest deductions, permitting certain capital expenditures to be expensed immediately, adopting elements of a modified territorial tax system, imposing a one-time
transition tax on a deemed repatriation of all undistributed earnings and profits of certain U.S.-owned foreign corporations ("transition tax"), revising the rules governing foreign tax credits, and
introducing new anti-base erosion provisions. Certain changes became effective immediately, while others become effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. The legislation is
unclear in certain respects and may be subject to technical amendments, as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the Department of Treasury and Internal Revenue Service, any of which
could increase or decrease one or more impacts of the legislation. It is also unclear how these changes will affect state and local corporate taxation, which often uses federal taxable income as a
starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities.

While
our analysis and interpretation of the TCJA is ongoing, based on our current evaluation, the reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% required a write-down
of our net deferred income tax assets resulting in an estimated material noncash charge against earnings in the fourth quarter of 2017, the period in which the TCJA was enacted. This and other impacts
of the TCJA are subject to further adjustments in subsequent periods throughout 2018 in accordance with recent interpretive guidance issued by the SEC under Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118
("SAB 118"). Similarly, the transition tax resulted in a material charge against income in the fourth quarter of 2017. The limitation on interest deductions may negatively impact our effective
tax rate and cash flows going forward. There may be material adverse effects resulting from the TCJA of which we have not yet completed our analysis. These effects may relate to the potential
adjustments described above or future guidance and regulations.

The enactment of legislation implementing changes in taxation of international business activities, adoption
of other corporate tax reform policies, or other changes in tax legislation or policies could materially and adversely impact our financial position and results of operations.

In 2017, approximately 76% of our sales were generated from customers located outside of the U.S., and a substantial portion of our assets and
employees were located outside of the U.S. While we are taxed by local authorities on earnings from these sales, we have historically not
accrued U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on most of our undistributed earnings and profits for non-U.S. subsidiaries because we intend to indefinitely reinvest in the operations of those
subsidiaries. The TCJA imposed a one-time transition tax subjecting the undistributed earnings and profits of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to immediate U.S. taxation and eliminated future foreign tax
credit for foreign income taxes or withholding taxes paid with respect to certain foreign dividends. As a result, we accrued foreign withholding taxes in the fourth quarter of 2017 for certain
jurisdictions related to the future repatriation of cash and cash equivalents as of December 30, 2017. We continue to evaluate our indefinite reinvestment assertions, which may be subject to
adjustments throughout 2018 in accordance with SAB 118.

Corporate
tax reform, base-erosion efforts and tax transparency continue to be high priorities in many of the jurisdictions in which we do business. As a result, policies regarding
corporate income and other taxes in numerous jurisdictions are under heightened scrutiny, while tax reform legislation has been



proposed
or enacted in a number of jurisdictions. For example, the TCJA enacted broad U.S. corporate income tax reform, including the changes described above. The TCJA affected the tax position
reflected in our consolidated balance sheet and financial results in fiscal year 2017. Our cash tax payments in the U.S. starting in fiscal year 2018 may also be affected.

In
addition, many countries are beginning to implement legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation's Base
Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations and action plan, which aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy, with changes to cross-border tax, transfer-pricing documentation rules,
and nexus-based tax incentive practices. As a result of the heightened scrutiny of corporate taxation policies, prior decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate
income taxes could be subject to enforcement activities or legislative investigation and inquiry, which could also result in changes in tax policies or prior tax rulings. Any such changes in policies
or rulings may also result in the taxes we previously paid being subject to change.

Due
to the large scale of our international business activities, any substantial change in international corporate tax policies, enforcement activities or legislative initiatives could
have a material adverse effect on the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our business generally.

The amount of various taxes we pay is subject to ongoing compliance requirements and audits by federal, state
and foreign tax authorities.

We are subject to regular examinations of our income tax returns by various tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of material
adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. In addition, tax enforcement has become increasingly aggressive in recent years, including
continued actions by the European Commission related to illegal state aid, with increased focus on transfer pricing and intercompany documentation. Our estimate of the potential outcome of uncertain
tax issues is subject to our assessment of relevant risks, facts, and circumstances existing at the time. We use these assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and other
tax-related accounts. Our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved, which may materially
adversely impact our effective tax rate and have a material adverse effect on our business.

We have deferred tax assets that we may not be able to realize under certain circumstances.

If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions, or if there is a significant change in the time period
within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets. This would result in an
increase in our effective tax rate and could have a material adverse effect on our future results. In addition, changes in statutory tax rates may change our deferred tax asset or liability balances,
with either a favorable or unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate. The computation and assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets may also be materially impacted by new legislation
or regulations.

Significant disruption to the information technology infrastructure that stores our information could
materially adversely affect our business.

We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of a large and complex information technology infrastructure to link our global business.
Like other information technology systems, ours is susceptible to a number of risks including, but not limited to, damage or interruptions resulting from obsolescence, natural disasters, power
failures, human error, viruses, social engineering, phishing, ransomware or other malicious attacks and data security breaches. We upgrade and install new systems, which, if installed or programmed
incorrectly or on a delayed timeframe, could cause
delays or cancellations of customer orders, impede the manufacture or shipment of products, or disrupt the processing of transactions. For



example,
we are in the process of investing in information technology to upgrade the systems in both our LGM North America business and RBIS segment to drive business efficiency and supply chain
productivity. We have implemented measures to mitigate our risk related to system and network disruptions, but if a disruption were to occur, we could incur significant losses and remediation costs
that could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, we rely on services provided by third-party vendors for certain information technology processes, which makes our operations
vulnerable to a failure by any one of these vendors to perform adequately or maintain effective internal controls.

Security breaches could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which could cause our business
and reputation to suffer

.

We
maintain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form, which is stored in data centers and on our networks and third-party cloud services, including
confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations. Data
maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion, tampering and theft. We develop and maintain systems to prevent this from occurring, but the development and maintenance of these
systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Moreover, despite our efforts, the
possibility of intrusion, tampering and theft cannot be eliminated entirely. Our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error,
malfeasance or other disruptions. Additionally, we provide confidential, proprietary and personal information to third parties when it is necessary to pursue business objectives. While we obtain
assurances that these third parties will protect this information and, where appropriate, assess the protections employed by these third parties, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by
third parties may be compromised.

Any
such breach or attack could compromise our network, the network of a third party to whom we have disclosed confidential, proprietary or personal information, a data center where we
have stored such information or a third-party cloud service provider, and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss
of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, impair our ability to conduct business, or result in the loss or diminished value of
profitable opportunities and the loss of revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property. Contractual provisions with
third parties, including cloud service providers, may limit our ability to recover these losses. If personal information of our customers or employees were misappropriated, our reputation with our
customers and employees could be injured, resulting in loss of business or morale, and we could incur costs to compensate our customers or employees or pay damages or fines as a result of litigation
or regulatory actions arising out of any such incident. Data privacy legislation and regulation have been increasing in recent years – including, for example, the General Data
Protection Regulation in the EU and the Cyber Security Law in China – and although we take reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, there can be no
assurance that we will not be subject to regulatory action in the event of an incident.

From
time to time, we have experienced unauthorized intrusions into our network, and although these intrusions did not have a material adverse effect on our business, this may not be the
case going forward. We have taken many steps to improve the security of our networks and computer systems, including user education and phishing exercises to protect against social engineering and
inadvertent or intentional disclosure of data; implementing multi-factor authentication and advanced malware detection measures; upgrading legacy information technology systems; and establishing a
data loss prevention framework to better identify and protect our critical data. Despite these mitigation efforts, there can be no assurance that we are adequately protecting our information, that
third parties to whom we have disclosed such information or with whom we have stored such information (in data centers and on the cloud) are taking similar precautions, or that we will not continue to
experience future intrusions.



For us to remain competitive, it is important to recruit and retain our key management and highly-skilled
employees. We also utilize various outsourcing arrangements for certain services, and related delays, resource availability, or errors by these service providers may lead to increased costs or
disruption in our business.

There is significant competition to recruit and retain key management and highly-skilled employees. In particular, due to expansion to
additional geographies and our ongoing productivity efforts and recent employee restructuring actions, it may be difficult for us to recruit and retain sufficient numbers of highly-skilled employees.
We may also be unable to recruit and retain key management and highly-skilled employees if we do not offer market-competitive employment and compensation terms. If we fail to recruit or retain our key
management or sufficient numbers of highly-skilled employees, we could experience disruption in our businesses and difficulties managing our operations and implementing our business strategy.

Executive
succession planning is also important to our long-term success. For example, we experienced several recent key management changes, including promotions of long-serving and
experienced leaders to the positions of Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer in 2016 and 2017, respectively. While we believe we have appropriate leadership development programs and
succession plans in place, any failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving any of our key management or other highly-skilled employees could hinder our strategic
planning and execution.

In
addition, we have outsourced certain services to third-party service providers, and may outsource other services in the future to achieve cost savings and operating efficiencies.
Service provider delays, resource availability, business issues or errors may disrupt our businesses and/or increase costs. If we do not effectively develop, implement and manage outsourcing
relationships, if third-party providers do not perform effectively or in a timely manner, or if we experience problems with transitioning work to a third party, we may not be able to achieve our
expected cost savings, and may experience delays or incur additional costs to correct errors made by these service providers.

We have various non-U.S. collective labor arrangements, which make us subject to potential work stoppages,
union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes, any of which could adversely impact our business.

Work interruptions or stoppages could significantly impact the volume of products we have available for sale. In addition, collective bargaining
agreements, union contracts and labor laws may impair our ability to reduce labor costs by closing or downsizing manufacturing facilities because of limitations on personnel and salary changes and
similar restrictions. A work stoppage at one or more of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, if any of our customers were to experience a work stoppage,
that customer may halt or limit purchases of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our share price may be volatile.

Changes in our stock price may affect our access to, or cost of financing from, capital markets and may affect our stock-based compensation
arrangements, among other things. Our stock price, which has at times experienced, and may in the future experience, substantial volatility, is influenced by changes in the overall stock market and
demand for equity securities in general. Other factors, including our financial performance on a standalone basis and relative to our peers and competitors, as well as market expectations of our
future performance, the level of perceived growth of our industries, and other company-specific factors, can also materially adversely affect our share price. There can be no assurance that our stock
price will not be volatile in the future.



If our indebtedness increases significantly or our credit ratings are downgraded, we may have difficulty
obtaining acceptable short- and long-term financing.

Our overall level of indebtedness and credit ratings are significant factors in our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing. Higher
debt levels could negatively impact our ability to meet other business needs and could result in higher financing costs. The credit ratings assigned to us also impact the interest rates paid. A
downgrade of our short-term credit ratings could impact our ability to access the commercial paper markets and increase our borrowing costs. If our access to commercial paper markets were to become
limited and we were required to obtain short-term funding under our revolving credit facility or our other credit facilities, we would face increased exposure to variable interest rates.

An increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business.

In 2017, our average variable-rate borrowings were approximately $256 million. Increases in short-term interest rates would directly
impact the amount of interest we pay. Fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs and have a material adverse effect on our business.

In
response to the last global economic recession, extraordinary monetary policy actions of the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banking institutions, including the utilization of
quantitative easing, were taken to create and maintain a low interest rate environment. However, over the past few years the U.S. Federal Reserve has raised its benchmark interest rate, now between
1.25% and 1.5%, indicating that additional increases would be likely, which may result in significantly higher long-term interest rates. Such a transition may, among other things, reduce the
availability and/or increase the costs of obtaining new debt and refinancing existing indebtedness, and negatively impact the market price of our common stock.

Our current and future debt covenants may limit our flexibility.

Our credit facilities and the indentures governing our notes contain, and any of our future indebtedness likely would contain, restrictive
covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us. Among other things, these covenants restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, incur certain liens on our assets, make
certain investments, sell our assets or merge with third parties, and enter into certain transactions. We are also required to maintain specified financial ratios under certain conditions. These
restrictive covenants and ratios in our existing debt agreements and any future financing agreements may limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain activities and transactions that may be in our
long-term best interests and could place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors, which could materially adversely affect our business.

The level of returns on our pension and postretirement plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used for
valuation purposes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods. Changes in accounting standards and government regulations could also affect our pension and postretirement plan expense
and funding requirements.

We evaluate the assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plan and other
postretirement benefit plans in consultation with outside actuaries. In the event that we were to determine that changes were warranted in the assumptions used, such as the discount rate, expected
long-term rate of return, or mortality rates, our future pension and projected postretirement benefit expenses and funding requirements could increase or decrease. Because of changing market
conditions or changes in the participant population, the actuarial assumptions that we use may differ from actual results, which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement
liability and related costs. Funding obligations for each plan are determined based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date as required under applicable government regulations.
Future pension funding requirements, and the timing of funding payments, could also be affected by future legislation or regulation.



Our pension assets are significant and subject to market, interest and credit risk that may reduce their
value.

Changes in the value of our pension assets could materially adversely affect our earnings and cash flows. In particular, the value of our
investments may decline due to increases in interest rates or volatility in the financial markets. In addition, we may take actions to reduce the financial volatility associated with our pension
liabilities, which could result in charges in the nearer term. In 2016, we incurred approximately $41 million in non-cash charges in connection with the lump-sum settlement of certain pension
obligations to terminated vested employees in our U.S. pension plan, which reduced our pension liability by approximately $70 million. We continue to evaluate options to better manage the
volatility associated with our pension liabilities. Although we mitigate these risks by investing in high quality securities, ensuring adequate diversification of our investment portfolio and
monitoring our portfolio's overall risk profile, the value of our investments may nevertheless decline.

An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact our results of operations and net
worth.

Goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment annually (or more frequently if impairment
indicators are present). We review goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. In assessing fair value, we make estimates and assumptions about
sales, operating margins, growth rates, and discount rates based on our business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. There are inherent uncertainties
related to these factors and management's judgment in applying these factors. Goodwill valuations have been calculated primarily using an income approach based on the present value of projected future
cash flows of each reporting unit. We could be required to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to our business, unexpected significant
declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of our business or sustained market capitalization declines. These types of events could result in goodwill impairment charges in
the future. Impairment charges could substantially affect our business in the periods in which they are made.

Unfavorable developments in legal proceedings, investigations and other legal, environmental, compliance and
regulatory matters, could impact us in a materially adverse manner.

There can be no assurance that any outcome of any litigation, investigation or other legal, environmental, compliance and regulatory matter will
be favorable. Our financial results
could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome to pending or future litigation and investigations, and other legal, environmental, compliance and regulatory matters. See "Legal
Proceedings" (Part I, Item 3).

We are required to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various
international jurisdictions, and our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.

We are required to comply with the anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various international jurisdictions, such as
the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK's Bribery Act of 2010. If we fail to comply with anti-corruption laws, we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties, including
regulatory fines, monetary damages and incarceration for responsible employees and managers. In addition, if our distributors or agents fail to comply with these laws, we may also be materially
adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties.

We are required to comply with environmental, health, and safety laws at our operations around the world. The
costs of complying with these laws could materially adversely affect our business.

We are subject to national, state, provincial and/or local environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad,
including those related to the disposal of hazardous waste from our



manufacturing
processes. These laws are often unclear and subject to the discretion of the enforcing authorities. Compliance with existing and future environmental, health and safety laws could
subject us to future fees, penalties, costs or liabilities, impact our production capabilities, limit our ability to sell, expand or acquire facilities, and have a material adverse effect on our
business. Environmental and product content and product safety laws and regulations can be complex, change often, and be open to different interpretations. In addition, we could be materially and
adversely impacted by any environmental or product safety enforcement action affecting our suppliers, particularly in emerging markets.

We
have accrued liabilities for the environmental clean-up of certain sites, including sites for which U.S. governmental agencies have designated us as a potentially responsible party,
where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. See "Legal Proceedings" (Part I, Item 3). However, because of the
uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities, future expense to remediate currently identified sites and other sites that could be identified for cleanup in the
future could be higher than the liabilities accrued.

We are subject to governmental export and import control laws and regulations in certain jurisdictions where
we do business that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in these markets.

Certain of our products are subject to export control laws and regulations and may be exported only with an export license or through an
applicable export license exception. If we fail to comply with export licensing, customs regulations, economic sanctions or other laws, we could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties,
including economic sanctions against us, incarceration for responsible employees and managers, and the possible loss of export or import privileges. In addition, if our distributors fail to obtain
appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or permits, we may also be materially adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties. Obtaining the necessary export license for a
particular sale may be time consuming and expensive and could result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities.

Furthermore,
export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products to embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and persons. While we train our
employees to comply with these regulations, we cannot guarantee that a violation will not occur. A prohibited shipment could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties,
fines, civil and criminal sanctions and reputational harm. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing
regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could decrease our ability to export or sell our products internationally. Any limitation on
our ability to export or sell our products could materially adversely affect our business.

Infringing intellectual property rights of third parties or inadequately acquiring or protecting our
intellectual property could harm our ability to compete or grow.

Because our products involve complex technology and chemistry, we are involved from time to time in litigation involving patents and other
intellectual property. Parties have filed, and in the future may file, claims against us alleging that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. If we were held liable for infringement, we
could be required to pay damages, obtain licenses or cease
making or selling certain products. There can be no assurance that licenses would be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The defense of these claims, whether or not meritorious, or
the development of new technologies could cause us to incur significant costs and divert the attention of management.

We
also have valuable intellectual property upon which third parties may infringe. We attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual property and proprietary information by
relying on the patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws of the U.S. and other countries, as well as non-disclosure agreements. However, it may be possible for a third party to obtain our
information without our authorization, independently develop similar technologies, or breach a non-disclosure agreement



entered
into with us. In addition, many of the countries in which we operate do not have intellectual property laws that protect proprietary rights as fully as do laws in the U.S. The use of our
intellectual property by someone else without our authorization could reduce or eliminate certain competitive advantages we have, cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business. Further, the
costs associated with protecting our intellectual property rights could materially adversely impact our business.

We
have obtained and applied for U.S. and foreign trademark registrations and patents, and will continue to evaluate whether to register additional trademarks and apply for additional
patents. We cannot guarantee that any of the pending applications will be approved by the applicable government authorities. Further, we cannot assure that the validity of our patents or our
trademarks will not be challenged. In addition, third parties may be able to develop competing products using technology that avoids our patents.

We are subject to risks associated with the availability and coverage of various types of insurance.

We have various types of insurance, including property, workers' compensation, general liability, and environmental liability. Insurance costs
can be unpredictable and may materially adversely impact our business. We retain some portion of our insurable risks, and therefore, unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of insured limits could
have a material adverse effect on our business.

Item 3.        LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

As of December 30, 2017, we have been designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and/or other responsible state
agencies as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") at thirteen waste disposal or waste recycling sites that are the subject of separate investigations or proceedings concerning alleged soil and/or
groundwater contamination. No settlement of our liability related to any of the sites has been agreed upon. We are participating with other PRPs at these sites and anticipate that our share of
remediation costs will be determined pursuant to agreements that we negotiate with the EPA or other governmental authorities.

We
have accrued liabilities for sites where it is probable that a loss or cost will be incurred and the amount of loss or cost can be reasonably estimated. These estimates could change
as a result of changes in planned remedial actions, remediation technologies, site conditions, the estimated time to complete remediation, environmental laws and regulations, and other factors.
Because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities, future expenses to remediate these sites could be higher than the liabilities we have accrued;
however, we are unable to reasonably estimate a range of potential expenses. If information were to become available that allowed us to reasonably estimate a range of potential expenses in an amount
higher or lower than what we have accrued, we would adjust our environmental liabilities accordingly. In addition, we may be identified as a PRP at additional sites in the future. The range of
expenses for remediation of any future-identified sites would be addressed as they arise; until then, a range of expenses for such remediation cannot be determined.

As
of December 30, 2017, our accrued liability associated with environmental remediation was $21.1 million.

In
addition, we are involved in various lawsuits, claims, inquiries, and other regulatory and compliance matters, most of which are routine to the nature of our business. We have accrued
liabilities for matters where it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Because of the uncertainties associated with claims resolution and
litigation, future expenses to resolve these matters could be higher than the liabilities we have accrued; however, we are unable to reasonably estimate a range of potential expenses. If information
were to become available that allowed us to reasonably estimate a range of potential expenses in an amount higher or lower than what we have accrued, we would adjust our accrued liabilities
accordingly. Additional lawsuits, claims, inquiries, and other regulatory and compliance matters could arise in the future. The range of expenses for resolving any future matters would be assessed as
they arise; until then, a range of potential expenses for such resolution cannot be determined. Based upon current information, we believe that the impact of the resolution of these matters would not
be, individually or in the aggregate, material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Item 9.        CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

None.

Item 9A.        CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the
supervision and with
the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer as appropriate, to allow for timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and the Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon the framework in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, our
management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 30, 2017. (See Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting contained in
our 2017 Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.)

Management's
assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2017 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm contained in our 2017 Annual Report, which is also incorporated herein by
reference.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

We periodically assess our internal control environment. We are in the process of
investing in
information technology to upgrade the systems in our RBIS segment. Processes affected by this implementation include, among other things, order management, pricing, shipping, purchasing, general
accounting and planning. Where appropriate, we are reviewing related internal controls and making changes.

We
have excluded Yongle Tape Ltd. from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2017 because we acquired the company in a purchase
business combination during fiscal year 2017. Yongle Tape Ltd. is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues excluded from our assessment of internal control over financial
reporting represent 3% and 2%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 30, 2017.

Other
than the system implementation and acquisition referenced above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 9B.        OTHER INFORMATION

None.



PART III

Item 10.        DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

The information concerning directors and corporate governance called for by this Item is incorporated herein by reference from the definitive

Controller/Chief Accounting Officer. The Code is available on our investor website at www.investors.averydennison.com. We will satisfy the disclosure requirements of Item 5.05 of
