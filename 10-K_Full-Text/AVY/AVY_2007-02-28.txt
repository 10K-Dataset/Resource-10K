AVERY DENNISON CORPORATION

FISCAL YEAR 2006 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT



PART I

Item 1.

BUSINESS

Avery Dennison Corporation (“Avery Dennison,” the
“Company,” “Registrant,” “Issuer,”
which may be referred to as “we” or “us”)
was incorporated in 1977 in the state of Delaware as Avery
International Corporation, the successor corporation to a
California corporation of the same name, which was incorporated
in 1946. In 1990, the Company merged one of its subsidiaries
into Dennison Manufacturing Company (“Dennison”), as a
result of which Dennison became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company, and in connection with which Company’s name was
changed to Avery Dennison Corporation.

Our homepage on the
internet is www.averydennison.com and you can learn more about
us by visiting our Web site. Our Web site address provided in
this annual report on
Form

10-K

is not
intended to function as a hyperlink and the information on our
Web site is not and should not be considered part of this report
and is not incorporated by reference in this document.

Our businesses include the production of pressure-sensitive
materials, office products and a variety of tickets, tags,
labels and other converted products. Some pressure-sensitive
materials are “converted” into labels and other
products through embossing, printing, stamping and die-cutting,
and some are sold in unconverted form as base materials, tapes
and reflective sheeting. We also manufacture and sell a variety
of office products and other converted products and other items
not involving pressure-sensitive components, such as binders,
organizing systems, markers, fasteners, business forms, as well
as tickets, tags, and imprinting equipment for retail and
apparel manufacturers.

A pressure-sensitive, or self-adhesive, material is one that
adheres to a surface by press-on contact. It generally consists
of four elements: a face material, which may be paper, metal
foil, plastic film or fabric; an adhesive, which may be
permanent or removable; a release coating; and a backing
material to protect the adhesive against premature contact with
other surfaces, and which can also serve as the carrier for
supporting and dispensing individual labels. When the products
are to be used, the release coating and protective backing are
removed, exposing the adhesive, and the label or other face
material is pressed or rolled into place.

Self-adhesive materials may initially cost more than materials
using heat or moisture activated adhesives, but the use of
self-adhesive materials often provides cost savings because of
their easy and instant application, without the need for
adhesive activation. They also provide consistent and versatile
adhesion, with minimal adhesive deterioration and are available
in a large selection of materials in nearly any size, shape and
color.

Our reporting segments are:

•

Pressure-sensitive Materials

•

Office and Consumer Products

•

Retail Information Services

In addition to our reporting segments, we have other specialty
converting businesses comprised of several businesses that
produce specialty tapes and highly engineered labels including
radio frequency identification (“RFID”) inlays and
labels, and other converted products.

Although our segment structure remained the same as reported in
the prior year, in 2006, we transferred our business media
division from the Retail Information Services segment into other
specialty converting businesses to align with a change in our
internal reporting structure. Prior year amounts included herein
have been reclassified to conform to the current year
presentation.

In 2006, the Pressure-sensitive Materials segment contributed
approximately 58% of our total sales, while the Office and
Consumer Products and the Retail Information Services segments
contribute approximately 19% and 12%, respectively, of our total
sales.

In 2006, international operations constituted a significant
portion of our business and represented approximately 55% of our
sales. We expanded our operations, focusing particularly on
Asia, Latin America



and Eastern Europe. As of December 30, 2006, we operated
approximately 120 manufacturing and distribution facilities
located in over 40 countries, and employed approximately 22,700
persons worldwide.

We are subject to certain risks referred to in Item 1A,
“Risk Factors” and Item 3, “Legal
Proceedings” below, including those normally attending
international and domestic operations, such as changes in
economic or political conditions, currency fluctuations,
exchange control regulations and the effect of international
relations and domestic affairs of foreign countries on the
conduct of business, legal proceedings, and the availability and
pricing of raw materials.

Except as set forth below, no single customer represented 10% or
more of our net sales or trade receivables at year end 2006 and
2005. However, our ten largest customers at year end 2006
represented approximately 18% of trade accounts receivable and
consisted of six customers of our Office and Consumer Products
segment, three customers of our Pressure-sensitive Materials
segment and one customer of both these segments. The financial
position and operations of these customers are monitored on an
ongoing basis (see “Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates” of Item 7, “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial
Condition”). United States export sales are not a
significant part of our business. Backlogs are not considered
material in the industries in which we compete.

Pressure-sensitive Materials Segment

The Pressure-sensitive Materials segment manufactures and sells
Fasson-, JAC-, and Avery Dennison-brand pressure-sensitive
materials, Avery-brand graphics and graphic films, Avery
Dennison-brand reflective products, and performance polymers.
The business of this segment is generally not seasonal, except
for certain outdoor graphics and highway safety products and
operations in Western Europe. Pressure-sensitive materials
consist primarily of papers, plastic films, metal foils and
fabrics, which are coated with Company-developed and purchased
adhesives, and then laminated with specially coated backing
papers and films. They are sold in roll or sheet form with
either solid or patterned adhesive coatings, and are available
in a wide range of face materials, sizes, thicknesses and
adhesive properties. These materials are sold to label printers
and converters for labeling, decorating, fastening, electronic
data processing and special applications on a worldwide basis.

Graphic products consist of a variety of films and other
products sold to the architectural, commercial sign, digital
printing, and other related markets. We also sell durable cast
and reflective films to the construction, automotive, and fleet
transportation markets, scrim-reinforced vinyl material for
banner sign



applications, and reflective films for traffic and safety
applications. Our graphic and reflective businesses are
organized on a worldwide basis to serve the expanding commercial
graphic arts market, including wide-format digital printing
applications. We also manufacture and sell proprietary films
that are used for outdoor, weather-resistant applications.

Performance polymer products include a range of solvent- and
emulsion-based acrylic polymer adhesives, protective coatings
and other polymer additives for internal use, as well as for
sale to other companies.

In this segment, our larger competitors are Raflatac, a
subsidiary of UPM-Kymmene; Morgan Adhesives
(“MACtac”), a division of the Bemis Company; and 3M
Company (for graphic and reflective products). Entry of
competitors into the field of pressure-sensitive adhesives and
materials may be limited by capital requirements and a need for
technical knowledge. We believe that our relative size and scale
of operations, our ability to serve our customers with a broad
line of quality products and service programs, our distribution
and brand strength, and the development and commercialization of
new products are among the more significant factors in
developing and maintaining our competitive position.

Office and Consumer Products Segment

The Office and Consumer Products segment manufactures and sells
a wide range of Avery-brand printable media and other products.
The business of this segment is seasonal, with higher volume
related to the back-to-school season.

This segment’s products are generally sold through office
products superstores, mass market distributors, wholesalers and
dealers. We manufacture and sell a wide range of Avery-brand
products for office, school and home uses: printable media, such
as copier, ink-jet and laser printer labels, related computer
software, ink-jet and laser printer card and index products; and
organization, filing and presentation products, such as binders,
dividers and sheet protectors. We also offer a wide range of
other stationery products, including writing instruments,
markers, adhesives and specialty products under brand names such
as Avery, Marks-A-Lot and HI-LITER. The extent of product
offerings varies by geographic market.

In this segment, our larger competitors are Acco Brands
Corporation, Esselte Corporation and manufacturers of private
brands. We believe that our brand strength, a large installed
base of software that facilitates the use of many of our
products, our ability to serve our customers with a broad line
of quality products, and the development and commercialization
of new products are among the more significant factors in
developing and maintaining our competitive position.

Retail Information Services Segment

The Retail Information Services segment designs, manufactures
and sells a wide variety of price marking and brand
identification products for retailers, apparel manufacturers,
distributors and industrial customers on a worldwide basis. This
business is seasonal, with higher volume in advance of the
back-to-school and holiday shipping periods.

Our brand identification products include woven and printed
labels, graphic tags and barcode tags. Our information
management products include price tickets, carton labels, RFID
tags and printing applications for supply chain and security
management. Our solution enabling products include barcode
printers, molded plastic fastening and application devices and
security management products.

In this segment, our largest competitor is Paxar Corporation. We
believe that our ability to serve our customers with product
innovation, a comprehensive brand identification and information
management product line, our global distribution network,
service, quality, and geographic reach are the key advantages in
developing and maintaining our competitive position.

Other specialty converting businesses

Other specialty converting businesses include our specialty
tape, industrial, performance films and automotive products,
business media, RFID and security printing businesses. These
businesses manufacture



and sell specialty tapes, highly engineered films, RFID inlays,
pressure-sensitive postage stamps and other converted products.
These businesses are generally not seasonal, except for certain
automotive products due to typical summer plant shutdowns by
automotive manufacturers.

The specialty tape business manufactures and sells single- and
double-coated tapes and adhesive transfer tapes for use in
non-mechanical fastening, bonding and sealing systems in various
industries, which are sold to industrial and medical original
equipment manufacturers, converters, and disposable diaper
producers worldwide. These products are sold in roll form and
are available in a wide range of face materials, sizes,
thicknesses and adhesive properties.

Our industrial and automotive products businesses primarily
consist of custom pressure-sensitive and heat-seal labels for
the automotive and durable goods industries. These products are
sold primarily to original equipment manufacturers.

Our performance films business produces a variety of decorative
and functional films, primarily for the automotive industry,
that are designed for injection mold applications.

Our business media business designs and markets customized
products for printing and information workflow applications.

Our RFID business manufactures RFID inlays and labels and makes
use of our existing distribution by marketing to our label
converting customers.

Our security printing business manufactures and sells
self-adhesive battery labels to a battery manufacturer, and
self-adhesive stamps to the U.S. Postal Service.

In addition, we sell specialty print-receptive films to the
industrial label market, metallic dispersion products to the
packaging industry, and proprietary wood grain and other
patterns of film laminates for housing exteriors and interior
and exterior automotive applications.

We compete with a number of diverse businesses. Our largest
competitor for this group of businesses is 3M Company in the
specialty tape business. Entry of competitors into these
specialty converting businesses may be limited by capital and
technical requirements. We believe that our ability to serve our
customers with quality, cost effective products and the
development and commercialization of new products are among the
more significant factors in developing and maintaining our
competitive position.

Research and Development

Many of our current products are the result of our research and
development efforts. Our expenses for research, design and
testing of new products and applications by our operating units
and the Avery Research Center (the “Research Center”)
located in Pasadena, California were $87.9 million in 2006,
$85.4 million in 2005, and $81.8 million in 2004. A
significant number of our research and development activities
are conducted at the Research Center, which supports each of our
operating segments.

Our operating units’ research efforts are directed
primarily toward developing new products and operating
techniques and improving product performance, often in close
association with customers. The Research Center supports our
operating units’ patent and product development work, and
focuses on improving adhesives, materials and coating processes,
as well as related product applications and ventures. These
efforts often focus on projects relating to printing and coating
technologies and adhesive, release and ink chemistries.

The loss of individual patents or licenses would not be material
to us taken as a whole, nor to our operating segments
individually. Our principal trademarks are Avery, Fasson, Avery
Dennison and the Company’s symbol. These trademarks are
significant in the markets in which our products compete.

Three-Year Summary of Segment Information

Certain financial information on our reporting segments and
other specialty converting businesses for the three years ended
December 30, 2006, which appear in Note 12,
“Segment Information,” in the Notes to



Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 65 of
our 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders, are incorporated herein
by reference.

Other Matters

We use various raw materials, primarily paper, plastic films and
resins, and specialty chemicals, which we purchase from a
variety of commercial and industrial sources and which are
subject to price fluctuations. Although from time to time
shortages could occur, these raw materials currently are
generally available.

We produce a majority of our self-adhesive materials using
water-based emulsion and hot-melt adhesive technologies.
Emissions from these operations contain small amounts of
volatile organic compounds, which can be regulated by agencies
of federal, state, local and foreign governments. We continue to
evaluate the use of alternative materials and technologies to
minimize these emissions.

A portion of our manufacturing process for self-adhesive
materials utilizes certain organic solvents which, unless
controlled, would be emitted into the atmosphere. Emissions of
these substances are regulated by agencies of federal, state,
local and foreign governments. In connection with the
maintenance and acquisition of certain manufacturing equipment,
we invest in solvent capture and control units to assist in
regulating these emissions.

We have developed adhesives and adhesive processing systems that
minimize the use of solvents. Emulsion adhesives, hot-melt
adhesives or solventless silicone systems have been installed in
our facilities in Peachtree City, Georgia; Fort Wayne and
Greenfield, Indiana; and Quakertown, Pennsylvania; as well as in
other plants in the United States, Argentina, Australia,
Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, France, Germany,
India, Korea, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands,
South Africa, Thailand and United Kingdom.

Based on current information, we do not believe that the costs
of complying with applicable laws regulating the discharge of
materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the
protection of the environment, will have a material effect upon
our capital expenditures, consolidated financial position or
results of operations.

For information regarding our potential responsibility for
cleanup costs at certain hazardous waste sites, see “Legal
Proceedings” (Part I, Item 3) and
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of
Operations and Financial Condition” (Part II,
Item 7).

Item 1A.

RISK FACTORS

Our ability to attain our goals and objectives is materially
dependent on numerous factors and risks, including but not
limited to, the following:

The demand for our products is impacted by economic
conditions of the principal countries in which we operate. A
decline in the economies in these countries could have an
adverse effect on our sales and profitability.

We have operations in over 40 countries and our domestic and
international operations are strongly influenced by matters
beyond our control, including changes in the political, social,
economic, tax and regulatory environments (including tariffs) in
the countries in which we operate, as well as the impact of
economic conditions on underlying demand for our products. In
addition, approximately 55% of our sales are in foreign
currencies, which fluctuate in relation to one another and to
the United States dollar. Fluctuations in currencies can cause
transaction, translation and other losses to us, which can
negatively impact our sales and profitability.



We operate in some highly competitive markets. If we do not
compete effectively, we could lose market share and experience
falling prices, adversely affecting our financial results.

We are at risk that our competitors will expand in our key
markets and implement new technologies making them more
competitive. There is also the possibility that competitors will
be able to offer additional products, services, lower prices, or
other incentives that we cannot or will not offer or that will
make our products less profitable. There can be no assurance
that we will be able to compete successfully against current and
future competitors.

We are also at risk with regards to changes in customer order
patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained
by customers and the timing of customer purchases, which may be
affected by announced price changes, changes in the
Company’s incentive programs, or the customer’s
ability to achieve incentive goals. Changes in customers’
preferences for our products can also affect the demand for our
products.

As a manufacturer, our sales and profitability are also
dependent upon the cost and availability of raw materials and
energy, which are subject to price fluctuations, and the ability
to control or pass on costs of raw materials and labor.

Inflationary and other increases in the costs of raw materials,
labor and energy have occurred in the past and are expected to
recur, and our performance depends in part on our ability to
pass on to customers changes in costs in our selling prices for
products and on improvements in productivity. Also, it is
important that we are able to obtain timely delivery of
materials, equipment, and packaging from suppliers. A disruption
to our supply chain could adversely affect our sales and
profitability.

Potential adverse developments in legal proceedings and
investigations regarding competitive activities and other legal,
compliance and regulatory matters, including those involving
product liability, product and trade compliance, Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act issues and other matters, could impact us
materially.

Our financial results could be materially adversely impacted by
an unfavorable outcome to pending or future litigation and
investigations, including, without limitation, any relating to
the Canadian Department of Justice and Australian Competition
and Consumer Commission investigations, into industry
competitive practices and any related proceedings or lawsuits
pertaining to these investigations or to the subject matter
thereof (including purported class actions in the United States
seeking treble damages for alleged unlawful competitive
practices, and a purported class action related to alleged
disclosure and fiduciary duty violations pertaining to alleged
unlawful competitive practices, which were filed after the
announcement of the recently closed U.S. Department of
Justice investigation). See Item 3, “Legal
Proceedings.” There can be no assurance that any
investigation or litigation outcome will be favorable.

Our future results may be affected if we generate less
productivity improvement than projected.

We are undergoing efforts to reduce costs in many of our
operations, including closure of facilities, headcount
reductions, organizational simplification, process
standardization, and using a variety of tools such as Lean Sigma
and Kaizen events, to accomplish this productivity, which is not
assured. Lower levels of productivity could result in lower
production, sales, and profitability. Cost reduction actions, in
turn, could expose us to additional production risk.

Slower growth in key markets could adversely affect our
profitability.

Our business could be negatively impacted by a decline in key
end use markets or applications for our products. Our overall
performance will be influenced by these markets.

Our customers are widely diversified, but in certain portions
of our business, industry concentration has increased the
importance and decreased the number of significant customers.

In particular, sales of our office and consumer products in the
United States are concentrated in a few major customers,
principally office product superstores, mass market distributors
and wholesalers. The



business risk associated with this concentration, including
increased credit risks for these and other customers, and the
possibility of related bad debt

write-offs,

could
negatively affect our margins and profits.

Our ability to develop and successfully market new products
and applications is important in maintaining growth.

The timely introduction of new products and improvements in
current products helps determine our success. Research and
development for each of our operating segments is complex and
uncertain and requires innovation and anticipation of market
trends. We could focus on products that ultimately are not
accepted by customers.

Infringing intellectual property rights of third parties or
inadequately acquiring or protecting our intellectual property
and patents could harm our ability to grow.

Because our products involve complex technology and chemistry,
we are sometimes involved in litigation involving patents and
other intellectual property. Parties have filed, and in the
future may file, claims against us alleging that we have
infringed their intellectual property rights. We could be held
to be liable to pay damages or obtain licenses. There can be no
assurance that licenses will be available, or will be available
on commercially reasonable terms, and the cost to defend these
infringement claims and to develop new technology could be
significant.

We also could have our intellectual property infringed. We
attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual
property and proprietary information, but it may be possible for
a third party to obtain our information and develop similar
technologies. In addition, many of the countries in which we
operate have limited or no protection for intellectual property
rights. The costs involved to protect our intellectual property
rights could adversely impact our profitability.

The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing
audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities.

Our estimate of the potential outcome of uncertain tax issues is
subject to our assessment of relevant risks, facts, and
circumstances existing at that time. We use these assessments to
determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Our
future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments
to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments
are made or resolved, which may impact our effective tax rate
and our financial results.

We have deferred tax assets that we may not be able to use
under certain circumstances.

If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in
certain jurisdictions, or if there is a significant change in
the time period within which the underlying temporary
differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required
to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax
assets. This would result in an increase in our effective tax
rate, and an adverse effect on our future operating results. In
addition, changes in statutory tax rates may also change our
deferred tax assets or liability balances, with either favorable
or unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate. Our deferred
tax assets may also be impacted by new legislation or regulation.

The level of returns on pension and postretirement plan
assets and the actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes
could affect our earnings in future periods.

Assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations
and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plan and other
postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by us in consultation
with outside actuaries. Funding obligations are determined under
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and are measured
each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a
specific date. In the event that we determine that changes are
warranted in the assumptions used, such as the discount rate,
expected long term rate of return, or health care costs, our
future pension and projected postretirement benefit expenses
could increase or decrease. Due to changing market conditions or
changes in the participant population, the actuarial assumptions
that we use may differ from actual results, which could have a
significant impact on our pension and postretirement



liability and related costs. Future pension funding
requirements, and the timing of funding payments, could be
affected by legislation enacted in the U.S. Congress.

We have acquired companies and our interest in various
acquisition opportunities has increased. Acquisitions come with
significant risks and uncertainties, including integration,
technology and personnel.

In order to grow our product lines and expand into new markets,
we have made acquisitions and may do so in the future. Many
risks, uncertainties, and costs are associated with the
acquisitions. The integration of systems, objectives, personnel,
product lines, markets, customers, suppliers, and cost savings
can be difficult to achieve and the results are uncertain. There
can be no assurance that acquisitions will be successful and
contribute to our profitability.

In order for us to remain competitive, it is important to
recruit and retain highly-skilled employees.

There is significant competition to recruit and retain skilled
employees. Due to rapid expansion in certain markets and the
ongoing productivity efforts and recent employee reductions, it
may be difficult for us to retain and recruit sufficient numbers
of highly-skilled employees.

We need to comply with many environmental, health, and safety
laws.

Due to the nature of our business, we are subject to
environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations,
including those related to the disposal of hazardous waste from
our manufacturing processes. Compliance with existing and future
environmental, health and safety laws could subject us to future
costs or liabilities; impact our production capabilities;
constrict our ability to sell, expand or acquire facilities; and
generally impact our financial performance. We have accrued
liabilities for environmental

clean-up

sites,
including sites for which governmental agencies have designated
us as a potentially responsible party, where it is probable that
a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be
reasonably estimated. However, because of the uncertainties
associated with environmental assessment and remediation
activities, future expense to remediate currently identified
sites and other sites, which could be identified in the future
for cleanup, could be higher than the liability currently
accrued.

In order to mitigate risk, it is important that we obtain
various types of insurance.

We have various types of insurance including health, life, and
property. Insurance costs can be unpredictable and may adversely
impact our financial results.

Significant disruption to our information technology
infrastructure could adversely impact our operations, sales,
customer relations, and financial results.

We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of a large
and complex information technology infrastructure to link our
worldwide divisions. Like other information technology systems,
ours is susceptible to damage or interruptions caused by natural
disasters, power failures, viruses and security breaches. We
upgrade and install new systems, which if installed or
programmed incorrectly, could cause significant disruptions. We
have implemented various measures to manage our risk related to
system and network disruptions, but if a disruption occurs, we
could incur losses and costs for remediation and interruption of
operations.

Our share price may be volatile.

Our stock price is influenced by changes in the overall stock
market and demand for equity securities in general. Other
factors, including market expectations for our performance, the
level of perceived growth of our industries, announcements
concerning industry investigations have also impacted our share
price. There can be no assurance that our stock price will not
be less volatile in the future.

If our credit ratings are downgraded, we may have difficulty
obtaining acceptable short- and long-term financing from capital
markets.

Credit ratings are a significant factor in our ability to raise
short-term and long-term financing. The credit ratings assigned
to us also impact the interest rates on our commercial paper and
other borrowings. Standard



and Poor’s (“S&P”) has assigned us a credit
rating of

for

long-term financing. S&P has given us a negative outlook.
Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) has
assigned us a credit rating of P2 for short-term and A3 for
long-term financing. Moody’s has given us a stable outlook.
If our credit ratings were to be downgraded, our financial
flexibility would decrease and the cost to borrow would increase.

Our reputation, sales, and earnings could be affected
adversely if the quality of our products and services does not
meet customer expectations.

There are occasions when we ship products with quality issues
resulting from defective materials, manufacturing, packaging or
design. Many of these issues are discovered before shipping but
this causes delays in shipping, delays in the manufacturing
process, and occasionally cancelled orders. When the issues are
discovered after shipment, this causes additional shipping
costs, possible discounts, possible refunds, and potential loss
of future sales. Both pre-shipping and post-shipping quality
issues can result in financial consequences along with a
negative impact on our reputation.

Some of our products are sold by third parties.

Our products are not only sold by us, but by third party
distributors and retailers as well. Some of our distributors
also market products that compete with our products. Changes in
the financial or business condition or purchasing decisions of
these third parties could affect our sales and profitability.

We outsource some of our manufacturing. If there are
significant changes in the quality control or financial or
business condition of these outsourced manufacturers, our
business could be negatively impacted.

We manufacture most of our products, but occasionally
third-party manufacturers are needed for specialty jobs or
capacity overflow. Outsourced manufacturers reduce our ability
to control product failure, late deliveries, customer
dissatisfaction and compliance with customer requirements for
labor standards. Because of possible quality problems and
customer dissatisfaction, outsourced manufacturers could have an
adverse effect on our business and financial results.

The risks described above are not exclusive. Additional risks
not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be
less significant may also have an adverse effect on us. If any
of the above risks actually occur, our business, results of
operations, cash flows or financial condition could suffer,
which might cause the value of our securities to decline.

Item 3.     LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS

The Company has been designated by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (“EPA”) and/or other responsible
state agencies as a potentially responsible party
(“PRP”) at fourteen waste disposal or waste recycling
sites, which are the subject of separate investigations or
proceedings concerning alleged soil and/or groundwater
contamination and for which no settlement of the Company’s
liability has been agreed. The Company is participating with
other PRPs at all such sites, and anticipates that its share of
cleanup costs will be determined pursuant to remedial agreements
entered into in the normal course of negotiations with the EPA
or other governmental authorities.

The Company has accrued liabilities for these and certain other
sites, including sites in which governmental agencies have
designated the Company as a PRP, where it is probable that a
loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be
reasonably estimated. However, because of the uncertainties
associated with environmental assessment and remediation
activities, future expense to remediate the currently identified
sites and any sites which could be identified in the future for
cleanup could be higher than the liability currently accrued.

During the third quarter of 2006, the Company recognized an
additional liability of $13 million for estimated
environmental remediation costs for a former operating facility,
for which $2 million had been accrued in the second quarter
of 2006. The amount accrued represents the lower end of the
current estimated range of $15 million to $17 million
for costs expected to be incurred. Management considered
additional information provided by outside consultants in
revising its previous estimates of expected costs. This estimate
could change depending on various factors such as modification
of currently planned remedial actions, changes in the site
conditions, changes in the estimated time to complete
remediation, changes in laws and regulations affecting
remediation requirements and other factors.



Other amounts currently accrued are not significant to the
consolidated financial position of the Company and, based upon
current information, management believes it is unlikely that the
final resolution of these matters will significantly impact the
Company’s consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

On October 19, 2006, the U.S. Department of Justice
notified the Company that the U.S. Department of Justice
had decided to close its criminal investigation (initiated in
April 2003) into competitive practices in the label stock
industry without further action, as described below.

On November 15, 2006, the Company announced that it had
been notified by the European Commission (“EC”) that
the EC had closed its investigation (initiated in May 2004) into
the Company’s competitive activities in the label stock
industry with no action, as described below.

On April 14, 2003, the Company announced that it had been
advised that the U.S. Department of Justice was challenging
the proposed merger of UPM-Kymmene (“UPM”) and the
Morgan Adhesives (“MACtac”) division of Bemis Co.,
Inc. (“Bemis”) on the basis of its belief that in
certain aspects of the label stock industry “the
competitors have sought to coordinate rather than compete.”
The Company also announced that it had been notified that the
U.S. Department of Justice had initiated a criminal
investigation into competitive practices in the label stock
industry.

On April 15, 2003, the U.S. Department of Justice
filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Illinois seeking to enjoin the proposed
merger (“DOJ Merger Complaint”). The DOJ Merger
Complaint, which set forth the U.S. Department of
Justice’s theory of its case, included references not only
to the parties to the merger, but also to an unnamed
“Leading Producer” of North American label stock,
which is the Company. The DOJ Merger Complaint asserted that
“UPM and the Leading Producer have already attempted to
limit competition between themselves, as reflected in written
and oral communications to each other through high level
executives regarding explicit anticompetitive understandings,
although the extent to which these efforts have succeeded is not
entirely clear to the United States at the present time.”

In connection with the U.S. Department of Justice’s
investigation into the proposed merger, the Company produced
documents and provided testimony by Messrs. Neal,
Scarborough and Simcic (then CEO, President and Group Vice
President — Roll Materials Worldwide, respectively).
On July 25, 2003, the United States District Court for
the Northern District of Illinois entered an order enjoining the
proposed merger. UPM and Bemis thereafter agreed to terminate
the merger agreement. The court’s decision incorporated a
stipulation by the U.S. Department of Justice that the
paper label industry is competitive.

On April 24, 2003, Sentry Business Products, Inc. filed a
purported class action in the United States District Court for
the Northern District of Illinois against the Company, UPM,
Bemis and certain of their subsidiaries seeking treble damages
and other relief for alleged unlawful competitive practices,
essentially repeating the underlying allegations of the DOJ
Merger Complaint. Ten similar complaints were filed in various
federal district courts. In November 2003, the cases were
transferred to the United States District Court for the Middle
District of Pennsylvania and consolidated for pretrial purposes.
Plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint on February 16,
2004, which the Company answered on March 31, 2004. On
April 14, 2004, the court separated the proceedings as to
class certification and merits discovery, and limited the
initial phase of discovery to the issue of the appropriateness
of class certification. On January 4, 2006, plaintiffs
filed an amended complaint. The Company intends to defend these
matters vigorously.

On May 6, 2003, Sekuk Global Enterprises filed a purported
stockholder class action in the United States District Court for
the Central District of California against the Company and
Messrs. Neal, O’Bryant and Skovran (then CEO, CFO and
Controller, respectively) seeking damages and other relief for
alleged disclosure violations pertaining to alleged unlawful
competitive practices. Subsequently, another similar action was
filed in the same court. On September 24, 2003, the court
appointed a lead plaintiff, approved lead and liaison counsel
and ordered the two actions consolidated as the “In Re
Avery Dennison Corporation Securities Litigation.” Pursuant
to court order and the parties’ stipulation, plaintiff
filed a consolidated complaint in mid-February 2004. The court
approved a briefing schedule for defendants’ motion to
dismiss the consolidated complaint, with a contemplated hearing
date in June 2004. In January 2004, the parties stipulated to
stay the



consolidated action, including the proposed briefing schedule,
pending the outcome of the government investigation of alleged
anticompetitive conduct by the Company. The court has approved
the parties’ stipulation to stay the consolidated actions.
On January 12, 2007, the plaintiffs filed a notice of
voluntarily dismissal of the case without prejudice. On
January 17, 2007, the Court entered an order dismissing the
case.

On May 21, 2003, The Harman Press filed in the Superior
Court for the County of Los Angeles, California, a purported
class action on behalf of indirect purchasers of label stock
against the Company, UPM and UPM’s subsidiary Raflatac
(“Raflatac”), seeking treble damages and other relief
for alleged unlawful competitive practices, essentially
repeating the underlying allegations of the DOJ Merger
Complaint. Three similar complaints were filed in various
California courts. In November 2003, on petition from the
parties, the California Judicial Council ordered the cases be
coordinated for pretrial purposes. The cases were assigned to a
coordination trial judge in the Superior Court for San Francisco
County on March 30, 2004. A further similar complaint was
filed in the Superior Court for Maricopa County, Arizona on
November 6, 2003. Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the
Arizona complaint without prejudice on October 4, 2004. On
January 21, 2005, American International Distribution
Corporation filed a purported class action on behalf of indirect
purchasers in the Superior Court for Chittenden County, Vermont.
Similar actions were filed by Webtego on February 16, 2005,
in the Court of Common Pleas for Cuyahoga County, Ohio; by D.R.
Ward Construction Co. on February 17, 2005, in the Superior
Court for Maricopa County, Arizona; by Richard Wrobel, on
February 16, 2005, in the District Court of Johnson County,
Kansas; and by Chad and Terry Muzzey, on February 16, 2005
in the District Court of Scotts Bluff County, Nebraska. On
February 17, 2005, Judy Benson filed a purported
multi-state class action on behalf of indirect purchasers in the
Circuit Court for Cocke County, Tennessee. On October 7,
2005, Webtego voluntarily dismissed its complaint. On
February 16, 2007, D.R. Ward voluntarily dismissed its
complaint. The Company intends to defend the remaining matters
vigorously.

On August 15, 2003, the U.S. Department of Justice issued a
subpoena to the Company in connection with its criminal
investigation into competitive practices in the label stock
industry. The Company produced documents and provided testimony
in response to the subpoena.

On May 25, 2004, officials from the EC, assisted by
officials from national competition authorities, launched
unannounced inspections of and obtained documents from the
Company’s pressure-sensitive materials facilities in the
Netherlands and Germany. The investigation apparently sought
evidence of unlawful anticompetitive activities affecting the
European paper and forestry products sector, including the label
stock market. The Company cooperated with the investigation.

Based on published press reports, certain other European
producers of paper and forestry products received similar visits
from European authorities. One such producer, UPM, stated that
it had decided to disclose to competition authorities “any
conduct that has not comported with applicable competition
laws,” and that it had received conditional immunity in the
European Union (“EU”) and Canada with respect to
certain conduct it has previously disclosed to them, contingent
on full cooperation. In February 2006, UPM announced that the
U.S. Department of Justice had agreed not to prosecute UPM in
connection with the label stock investigation, and, further,
that UPM had received conditional immunity in jurisdictions in
addition to the EU and Canada.

On July 9, 2004, the Competition Law Division of the
Department of Justice of Canada notified the Company that it was
seeking information from the Company in connection with a label
stock investigation. The Company is cooperating with the
investigation.

On May 18, 2005, Ronald E. Dancer filed a purported
class action in the United States District Court for the Central
District of California against the Company, Mr. Neal, Karyn
Rodriguez (VP and Treasurer) and James Bochinski (then VP,
Compensation and Benefits), for alleged breaches of fiduciary
duty under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act to the
Company’s Employee Savings Plan and Plan participants. The
plaintiff alleges, among other things, that permitting
investment in and retention of Company Common Stock under the
Plan was imprudent because of alleged anticompetitive activities
by the Company, and that failure to disclose such activities to
the Plan and participants was unlawful. Plaintiff seeks an order
compelling defendants to compensate the Plan for any losses and
other relief. The parties stipulated to transfer the case to



the judge in the consolidated case, “In Re Avery Dennison
Corporation Securities Litigation” referenced above, and
the court has approved the parties’ stipulation to stay the
matter pending the outcome of the government investigation of
alleged anticompetitive conduct by the Company. The Company
intends to defend this matter vigorously.

On August 18, 2005, the Australian Competition and Consumer
Commission notified two of the Company’s subsidiaries,
Avery Dennison Material Pty Limited and Avery Dennison Australia
Pty Ltd, that it was seeking information in connection with a
label stock investigation. The Company is cooperating with the
investigation.

On October 19, 2006, the U.S. Department of Justice
notified the Company that the U.S. Department of Justice decided
to close its criminal investigation into competitive practices
in the label stock industry without further action.

On November 15, 2006, the Company announced that it had
been notified that the EC had closed its investigation into the
Company’s competitive activities in the label stock
industry, with no action.

The Board of Directors has created an ad hoc committee comprised
of independent directors to oversee the foregoing matters.

The Company is unable to predict the effect of these matters at
this time, although the effect could be adverse and material.

In 2005, the Company contacted relevant authorities in the U.S.
and reported on the results of an internal investigation of
potential violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
The transactions at issue were carried out by a small number of
employees of the Company’s reflectives business in China,
and involved, among other things, impermissible payments or
attempted impermissible payments. The payments or attempted
payments and the contracts associated with them appear to have
been relatively minor in amount and of limited duration.
Corrective and disciplinary actions have been taken. Sales of
the Company’s reflectives business in China in 2005 were
approximately $7 million. Based on findings to date, no
changes to the Company’s previously filed financial
statements are warranted as a result of these matters. However,
the Company expects that fines or other penalties could be
incurred. While the Company is unable to predict the financial
or operating impact of any such fines or penalties, it believes
that its behavior in detecting, investigating, responding to and
voluntarily disclosing these matters to authorities should be
viewed favorably.

The Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various other
lawsuits, claims and inquiries, most of which are routine to the
nature of the business. Based upon current information,
management believes that the resolution of these other matters
will not materially affect the Company’s financial position.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Management’s Discussion and Analysis provides a narrative
concerning our financial performance and condition that should
be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial
statements. It includes the following sections:

DEFINITION OF TERMS

Our discussion of financial results includes several non-GAAP
measures to provide additional information concerning Avery
Dennison Corporation’s (“the Company’s”)
performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in
accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP financial
measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to
supplement the presentation of our financial results that are
prepared in accordance with GAAP. (Refer to “Uses and
Limitations of Non-GAAP Measures.”)

We use the following terms:

While our segment structure remained the same as reported in the
prior year, in 2006, we transferred our business media division
from the Retail Information Services segment into other
specialty converting businesses, to align with a change in our
internal reporting structure. Prior year amounts included herein
have been reclassified to conform to the current year
presentation.

As a result of the sale of our raised reflective pavement
marker business during 2006 (discussed below in
“Acquisitions and Divestitures”), the discussions
which follow generally reflect summary results from our
continuing operations unless otherwise noted. However, the net
income and net income per share discussions include the impact
of discontinued operations.



OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK

Overview

Sales

Our sales from continuing operations increased 2% in 2006
compared to growth of 3% in 2005, reflecting the factors
summarized in the following table.

Organic sales growth in 2006 reflected increases in most of our
businesses outside of the U.S., particularly in the emerging
markets of Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America.

In the U.S., sales were approximately even with the prior year.
In our North American roll materials business, reduced market
share during the first quarter of 2006 (reflecting share loss
related to price increases implemented in 2005 and early 2006,
to offset higher raw material costs), as well as generally slow
market conditions, were offset by some share gain during the
second half of 2006. The benefit from growth of Avery-brand
products and a strong back-to-school season in our Office and
Consumer Products segment in the U.S. was offset by the loss of
sales from exiting certain low-margin private label business in
that segment.

Organic sales growth in 2005 reflected favorable changes in
pricing and product mix, primarily due to the impact of selling
price increases implemented to offset higher raw material costs.
This benefit was partially offset by a decrease in core unit
volume in 2005, reflecting the following factors:

•

Loss of market share in our North American roll materials
    business following our implementation of selling price increases
    during 2005 to offset higher raw material costs

•

The impact of an extra week in the 2004 fiscal year

•

Accelerated purchases by Office and Consumer Products customers
    in advance of our 2005 selling price increases, which shifted
    sales into the fourth quarter of 2004.

Net Income

Net income increased $141 million in 2006 compared to 2005.

Positive factors affecting the change in net income included:

Pressure-sensitive Materials (58% of net sales)

Our Pressure-sensitive Materials segment reported a 4% increase
in sales in 2006 compared to 2005. Organic sales growth was
approximately 3%, reflecting growth in our roll materials and
graphics and reflective businesses in Asia, Europe and Latin
America.

Operating income for this segment increased 17% in 2006,
reflecting higher sales and cost savings from restructuring and
productivity improvement initiatives. Operating income for this
segment included restructuring costs and asset impairments in
both 2006 and 2005 and transition costs in 2006.

Office and Consumer Products (19% of net sales)

Our Office and Consumer Products segment reported a 6% decrease
in sales in 2006 compared to 2005. On an organic basis, sales
declined approximately 1%, reflecting the loss of sales from
exiting certain

low-margin

private
label business and decreased volume in Europe. These declines
were partially offset by growth in North America for Avery-brand
products, a strong

Operating income for this segment increased 7% in 2006,
including the benefit from cost savings from productivity
improvement and restructuring initiatives. Operating income for
this segment included restructuring costs, asset impairments and
transition costs in both 2006 and 2005.

Retail Information Services (12% of net sales)

The Retail Information Services segment reported a
6% increase in sales in 2006 compared to 2005. Organic
sales growth was approximately 5%, reflecting continued growth
of the business in Asia, Latin America and Europe.

Operating income for this segment increased 19% in 2006,
reflecting higher sales and cost savings from restructuring and
productivity improvement initiatives. Operating income for this
segment included restructuring costs, asset impairments and
transition costs in 2006 and 2005.



Other specialty converting businesses (11% of net
sales)

Other specialty converting businesses reported a 1% increase in
sales in 2006 compared to 2005. Organic sales growth was
approximately 2%, reflecting solid growth in our specialty tape
business, partially offset by weakness in other businesses.

Operating income for these businesses increased 22% in 2006,
reflecting sales growth and cost savings from restructuring and
productivity improvement initiatives. Operating income for these
businesses included restructuring costs and asset impairments in
both 2006 and 2005.

As discussed above, sales in the U.S. were approximately
even with the prior year, due to slow market conditions in our
Pressure-sensitive Materials segment, the impact of prior year
share loss in our roll materials business, and loss of sales
from exiting low-margin private label business in our Office and
Consumer Products segment.

Organic growth in Europe reflected strong growth in the east and
modest growth in the west.

Growth in our Asian and Latin American businesses was due to
continued market expansion.

During late 2005 and 2006, we implemented cost reduction actions
related to restructuring, which have improved our global
operating efficiencies and are expected to result in annualized
pretax savings of $90 million to $100 million. We
estimate that approximately $50 million of these savings
(net of transition costs) were achieved in 2006, with the
balance to benefit 2007. These restructuring actions resulted in
headcount reductions of approximately 1,150 positions, which
impacted all of our segments and geographic regions and were
completed in 2006. We are reinvesting some of the savings in
future growth opportunities.

Additional restructuring actions were identified during the
fourth quarter of 2006. These actions are expected to be
completed during 2007, with savings expected to benefit 2008.

In 2005, we also incurred charges related to the planned
divestitures of several low-margin businesses and product lines,
as discussed in “Divestitures and Acquisitions.”

Restructuring charges associated with severance and asset
impairments recorded during 2004 were related to the completion
of the integration of the 2002 acquisition of Jackstädt
into our other existing businesses. We closed a manufacturing
facility in France during the first quarter of 2004 and a
manufacturing facility in Italy during the second quarter of
2004.

Refer to Note 10, “Cost Reduction Actions,” to
the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail.



Effective Rate of Taxes on Income

The effective tax rate was 17.2% for the full year 2006 compared
with 20.4% for the full year 2005.

Our effective tax rate in both years included benefits from:

In 2005, these benefits were partially offset by incremental
expense associated with the repatriation of accumulated foreign
earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.

Free Cash Flow

Free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure, is used as a
measure of funds available for other corporate purposes, such as
dividends, debt reduction, acquisitions, and repurchase of
common stock. Refer to “Uses and Limitations of Non-GAAP
Measures.”

Divestitures and Acquisitions

In December 2005, we announced our plan to sell our raised
reflective pavement marker business, which had sales of
approximately $23 million in 2005. The divestiture of this
business was completed during the second quarter of 2006 and
resulted in a tax benefit due to capital losses arising from the
sale of the business. The results of this business have been
accounted for as discontinued operations for the years presented
herein. This business was previously included in the
Pressure-sensitive Materials segment.

In December 2005, we also announced the divestiture of two
product lines. These divestitures were completed in the first
quarter of 2006. The first product line, which was included in
the Office and Consumer Products segment, had estimated sales of
$60 million in 2005, with minimal impact to income from
operations. The second product line, which was included in other
specialty converting businesses, had annual sales of
approximately $10 million in 2005, with minimal impact to
income from operations. As part of these divestitures, in 2005,
we recorded severance and other employee-related charges of
approximately $6 million and asset impairments of
approximately $9 million. These charges were included in
the “Other Expense, net” line of our Consolidated
Statement of Income, as noted in “Cost Reduction
Actions” above.

During the third quarter of 2004, we acquired Rinke Etiketten, a
privately held company in Germany. The incremental impact of
this acquisition on our net sales was approximately
$9 million during 2004, with an additional impact of
approximately $18 million in 2005. This business is
included in our Retail Information Services segment.



Investigations and Legal Proceedings

On October 19, 2006, we were notified by the U.S.
Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division
(“DOJ”) that the DOJ had decided to close its criminal
investigation (initiated in April 2003) into competitive
practices in the label stock industry without further action.

On November 15, 2006, we announced that we had been
notified by the European Commission (“EC”) that the EC
had closed its investigation (initiated in May 2004) into
competitive activities in the label stock industry with no
action.

In July 2004, we were notified by the Competition Law Division
of the Department of Justice of Canada that it was seeking
information in connection with a label stock investigation. In
August 2005, we were notified by the Australian Competition and
Consumer Commission that it was seeking information in
connection with a label stock investigation. We are cooperating
with these investigations.

We are a named defendant in purported class actions in the U.S.
seeking treble damages and other relief for alleged unlawful
competitive practices, which were filed after the announcement
of the DOJ investigation. We are also a named defendant in a
purported class action in the U.S. seeking damages and other
relief for alleged disclosure and fiduciary duty violations
pertaining to alleged unlawful competitive practices. We have
discovered instances of conduct by certain employees in China
that potentially violate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,
and we have reported that conduct to authorities in the U.S.
Accordingly, we expect that fines or other penalties may be
incurred.

We are unable to predict the effect of these matters at this
time, although the effect could be adverse and material. These
and other matters are reported in Note 8,
“Contingencies,” to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Outlook

In 2007, we expect low to mid single-digit revenue growth,
including a modest positive effect from foreign currency
translation. Our revenue expectations are subject to changes in
economic and market conditions.

We anticipate continued benefit from our productivity
improvement initiatives. In particular, we estimate that our
restructuring and business realignment efforts will reduce costs
by an additional $45 million compared to 2006. However, we
plan to reinvest some of the savings from these productivity
improvements in growth initiatives. This reinvestment includes
incremental spending of approximately $12 million to
$15 million related to investments in information
technology.

We estimate that pretax interest expense will be approximately
even with 2006, subject to changes in average debt outstanding.

We expect total restructuring and asset impairment charges in
2007 will be lower than the charges taken in 2006.

We anticipate an increase in our annual effective tax rate for
2007, subject to changes in tax laws and the geographic mix of
income, with potentially wide variances from quarter to quarter.

Reflecting these assumptions, we expect an increase in annual
earnings and free cash flow in comparison with 2006.
Additionally, the effect of share repurchase will benefit
earnings per share in 2007.

We expect capital expenditures in 2007 to be approximately
$160 million to $165 million, or approximately
$210 million to $225 million including software
investments, funded through operating cash flows. Major capital
projects in 2007 include expansion in China and India, serving
both our materials and retail information services businesses.
Major software investments relate to customer service and
standardization initiatives.

Sales

Sales increased 2% in 2006 compared to an increase of 3% in
2005. Organic sales growth was approximately 3% in 2006 compared
to approximately 1% in 2005. Organic sales growth in 2006
reflected increases in most of our businesses in Asia, Europe
and Latin America. Organic growth in Europe reflected strong
growth in the east and modest growth in the west. Growth in our
Asian and Latin American businesses was due to continued market
expansion.

On an organic basis, sales in the U.S. were approximately even
in 2006, compared to a decrease of approximately 3% in 2005. In
our North American roll materials business, reduced market share
during the first quarter of 2006 (reflecting share loss related
to price increases implemented in 2005 and early 2006 to offset
higher raw material costs), as well as generally slow market
conditions, were offset by some share gain during the second
half of 2006. The benefit from growth of Avery-brand products
and a strong

back-to

-school season
in our Office and Consumer Products segment in the U.S. was
offset by the loss of sales from exiting certain

low-margin

private
label business (approximate impact of $22 million) in that
segment.

Sales growth in 2005 was negatively impacted by an extra week in
the 2004 fiscal year and accelerated purchases by Office and
Consumer Products customers in advance of 2005 selling price
increases, both of which contributed to higher growth in 2004.
Combined, the accelerated purchases and extra week in 2004
represented an estimated $60 million to $70 million of
the change in sales between 2005 and 2004. The loss of market
share in our North American roll materials business also
affected sales growth in 2005.

Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on the
change in sales of approximately $21 million in 2006
compared to approximately $77 million in 2005.

Product line divestitures, net of incremental sales from
acquisitions, reduced sales by approximately $54 million in
2006. Incremental sales from acquisitions, net of divestitures,
contributed approximately $19 million in 2005.

Gross Profit

Gross profit margin in both 2006 and 2005 benefited from our
ongoing productivity improvement and cost reduction actions.



In 2006, these benefits were partially offset by:

In 2005, these benefits were partially offset by:

•

Unfavorable segment mix

•

Raw material inflation in excess of selling price increases

•

Higher costs related to our radio frequency identification
    (“RFID”) business (approximately $9 million)

In 2006, we reclassified shipping and handling costs to
“Cost of products sold” to align our businesses around
a standard accounting policy. In 2005, several of our businesses
included these costs in marketing, general and administrative
expenses (approximately $143 million for 2006,
$145 million for 2005, and $148 million for 2004);
previous results included herein have been reclassified for
comparability to the current year.

Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses

Marketing, general and administrative expense as a percent of
sales in 2006 and 2005 reflected the benefit of productivity
improvement initiatives and cost reduction actions.

In 2006, these benefits were offset by:

•

Recognition of stock option expense (approximately
    $21 million)

•

Increased spending on information systems and marketing
    (approximately $19 million)

•

Increase in pension, medical and other employee-related costs
    (approximately $12 million)

In 2005, these benefits were offset by:

Interest Expense

Interest expense decreased in 2006 and 2005. The decreases were
due to a reduction in debt outstanding, partially offset by an
increase in interest rates.

In 2006 and 2005, “Other expense, net,” consisted of

cost reduction actions and divestitures, as well as other items
discussed below.

During late 2005 and 2006, we implemented cost reduction actions
related to restructuring which have improved our global
operating efficiencies and are expected to result in annualized
pretax savings of $90 million to $100 million. We
estimate that approximately $50 million of these savings
(net of transition costs) have been achieved in 2006. These
restructuring actions resulted in a headcount reduction of
approximately 1,150 positions, which impacted all of our
segments and geographic regions, and were completed in 2006. We
are reinvesting some of the savings in future growth
opportunities. Refer to Note 10, “Cost Reduction
Actions,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more
information.

The other items included in “Other expense, net,” in
2006 included:

In 2005, other items included in “Other expense, net,”
consisted of the gain on the sale of assets, partially offset by
costs related to a patent lawsuit.

In 2004, “Other expense, net,” consisted of charges
for productivity improvement actions, primarily related to the
completion of the Jackstädt integration actions.

Net Income:

Taxes on Income

Our 2006 effective tax rate included the benefit of changes in
the geographic mix of income and continued improvements in our
global tax structure, as well as the following:

•

Net benefit from several favorable global tax audit settlements
    (approximately $8.1 million)

•

Release of certain valuation allowances (approximately
    $5.2 million)



Our 2005 effective tax rate included the benefit of changes in
the geographic mix of income and continued improvements in our
global tax structure, as well as the following:

•

Release of certain valuation allowances (approximately
    $15.6 million)

•

Net benefit from several favorable global tax audit settlements
    (approximately $9 million)

In 2005, these benefits were partially offset by the incremental
expense of $13.5 million associated with the repatriation
of accumulated foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation
Act of 2004.

Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations

Income (loss) from discontinued operations includes the
divestiture of our raised reflective pavement markers business
as noted in the Overview section above. The divestiture of this
business was completed during 2006 and resulted in a tax benefit
($14.9 million) due to capital losses arising from the sale
of the business and a gain on sale of $1.3 million.

Based on our estimated value of the raised reflective pavement
markers business in 2005, we concluded that associated goodwill
and intangible assets from our acquisition of this business were
impaired. The resulting pretax impairment charge was
approximately $74 million in 2005.

Income from discontinued operations included net sales of
approximately $7 million in 2006, $23 million in 2005
and $24 million in 2004.

Refer to the Discontinued Operations section of Note 1,
“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the

Net Sales

Sales in our Pressure-sensitive Materials segment increased 4%
in both 2006 and 2005. Organic sales growth was approximately 3%
in 2006 and 2% in 2005.

Organic sales growth in 2006 reflected growth in our roll
materials and graphics and reflective businesses in Asia, Latin
America, and Europe. Organic growth in 2005 reflected the
positive impact of pricing and product mix, resulting from
increased selling prices implemented to offset higher raw
material costs. The extra week in the 2004 fiscal year
contributed to slower growth in 2005.

In our North American roll materials business, 2005 sales
declined on an organic basis at a low single-digit rate, while
2006 sales were even with the prior year. The loss of market
share following our implementation of selling price increases in
2005 and early 2006 contributed to this decline. Both years were
also affected by generally slow market conditions. Some share
gain during the second half of 2006 offset these factors.



Our roll materials business in Europe experienced low
single-digit organic sales growth in 2006, reflecting strong
growth in the east. In 2005, this business experienced high
single-digit organic sales growth reflecting solid growth in the
west and stronger growth in the east.

Market expansion contributed to double-digit organic sales
growth in the roll materials business in Asia in both 2006 and
2005. The roll materials business in Latin America experienced
high single-digit organic sales growth in 2006, resulting from
market expansion. In 2005, this region experienced low
single-digit organic sales growth due to market expansion and
selling price increases, partially offset by loss of market
share from selling price increases and loss of sales with a
large customer.

Our graphics and reflective business experienced mid
single-digit organic sales growth in 2006, as strong
international growth was partially offset by a decline in the
U.S. On an organic basis, sales in this business were unchanged
in 2005.

The changes in reported sales for the segment included a
favorable impact of foreign currency translation of
approximately $15 million in 2006 and approximately
$58 million in 2005.

Operating Income

Increased operating income in 2006 and 2005 reflected higher
sales and cost savings from restructuring and productivity
improvement initiatives. Operating income for all years
reflected restructuring, asset impairment and lease cancellation
charges. In 2006, operating income was also impacted by
transition costs associated with restructuring and stock option
expense.

Net Sales

Sales in our Office and Consumer Products segment decreased 6%
in 2006, while sales decreased 3% in 2005. The decline in
reported sales in 2006 reflected the impact of a product line
divestiture in Europe (approximately $51 million). Foreign
currency translation had a favorable impact on the change in
reported sales of approximately $1 million in 2006 and
$8 million in 2005.

On an organic basis, sales declined approximately 1% in 2006.
The decline reflected the loss of sales from exiting certain
low-margin private label business at the end of 2005
(approximately $22 million), partially offset by growth in
Avery-brand products, a strong back-to-school season in North
America, and accelerated purchases by customers in late 2006 in
advance of our 2007 selling price increases for certain product
lines.

In 2005, sales on an organic basis declined 4%, reflecting a
shift in volume to late 2004 (due to customers’ accelerated
purchases in advance of selling price increases effective
January 1, 2005), as well as the benefit from an extra week
in the 2004 fiscal year. Declines in core unit volume in 2005
were partially offset by increased selling prices, implemented
to offset higher raw material costs.



Operating Income

Operating income in 2006 reflected cost savings from
productivity improvement and restructuring actions, partially
offset by associated transition costs, higher raw material and
energy-related costs, increased marketing costs, an increase in
the LIFO reserve, and stock option expense.

Operating income in 2005 reflected charges related to
restructuring, asset impairment and net losses associated with
product line divestitures, partially offset by cost savings from
restructuring and productivity initiatives. The selling price
increases in 2005 offset the cumulative effect of raw material
inflation over the 2004 to 2005 period.

Net Sales

Sales in our Retail Information Services segment increased 6% in
both 2006 and 2005. The increase in both years reflected
continued growth of the business in Asia, Latin America and
Europe, as well as incremental sales from acquisitions, net of
product line divestitures. Organic sales growth was
approximately 5% in 2006 and 2% in 2005.

The impact of acquisitions, net of product line divestitures,
was approximately $3 million in 2006 and $21 million
in 2005. Foreign currency translation contributed to the
increase in sales by approximately $3 million in 2006 and
$7 million in 2005.

Operating Income

Operating income in 2006 and 2005 benefited from productivity
improvement actions, including the migration of production from
Hong Kong to lower cost facilities in mainland China. Benefits
from productivity initiatives were offset by increased spending
for information systems, stock option expense and other
incremental employee-related costs in 2006, and higher costs
associated with growth initiatives in 2005. Operating income in
both years included charges for restructuring, asset impairment,
and lease cancellation.

sales growth was approxi-



mately 2% in 2006, reflecting solid growth in our specialty tape
business, partially offset by weakness in other businesses. In
2005, organic sales growth of 4% reflected growth in most
businesses.

Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on the
change in sales of approximately $1 million in 2006 and
$4 million in 2005.

Operating Income

Operating income for these businesses increased in 2006,
reflecting cost savings from restructuring and productivity
improvement initiatives, partially offset by stock option
expense. Operating income in both years included charges for
restructuring and asset impairment.

The change in operating income in 2005 primarily reflected
incremental costs related to the development of the RFID
business.

Cash Flow Provided by Operating Activities:

For cash flow purposes, changes in assets and liabilities
exclude the impact of foreign currency translation and the
impact of acquisitions and divestitures and certain non-cash
transactions (discussed in “Analysis of Selected Balance
Sheet Accounts” below).

In 2006, cash flow provided by operating activities was
negatively impacted by changes in working capital, as shown
below:

Uses of cash

•

Other current assets primarily reflected the timing of
    collection of value-added tax receivables in Europe

•

Inventories reflected increased purchases to support higher

•

Long-term retirement benefits and other liabilities reflected
    benefit payments, partially offset by contributions of
    approximately $39 million to our pension and postretirement
    health benefit plans

Borrowings and Repayment of
Debt

At year end 2006, our borrowings outstanding under foreign
short-term lines of credit were $101.5 million
(weighted-average interest rate of 9.6%), compared to
$108.3 million at year end 2005 (weighted-average interest
rate of 6.6%).

Short-term variable rate commercial paper borrowings were
$154.4 million at December 30, 2006 (weighted-average
interest rate of 5.0%) compared to $255.3 million at
December 31, 2005 (weighted-average interest rate of 2.3%).

We had medium-term notes of $160 million outstanding at
year end 2006 and 2005. In 2005, medium-term notes of
$73 million were paid on maturity. Outstanding medium-term
notes have maturities from 2007 through 2025 and accrue interest
at fixed rates ranging from 5.9% to 7.5%.

In August 2004, we issued $150 million in floating rate
senior notes due in 2007 under our 2001 shelf registration
statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”). These notes are callable at par.

Shareholders’ Equity

Our shareholders’ equity was $1.68 billion at year end
2006, compared to $1.51 billion at year end 2005. Our
annual dividend per share increased to $1.57 in 2006 from $1.53
in 2005.

Share Repurchases

On October 26, 2006, the Board of Directors authorized an
additional 5 million shares of the Company’s stock for
our repurchase program, resulting in a total authorization of
approximately 7.4 million shares of the Company’s
stock at that date. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we
repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares. As of
December 30, 2006, approximately 4.9 million shares
were available for repurchase under the Board of Directors’
authorization.

In the fourth quarter of 2005, we repurchased approximately
..7 million shares under an agreement related to the L&E
Packaging (“L&E”) acquisition and recorded such
amount to treasury stock. (See the Other section of
“Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements” below for further details.)

Analysis of Selected Balance Sheet Accounts

Long-lived Assets

Goodwill increased $43 million during 2006 primarily due to
foreign currency translation (approximately $32 million)
and goodwill associated with an acquisition (approximately
$10 million).

Other intangibles resulting from business acquisitions decreased
$3 million during 2006 due to amortization expense recorded
during 2006 (approximately $11 million) partially offset by
the impact of foreign currency translation (approximately
$6 million) and acquired intangibles associated with an
acquisition (approximately $2 million).

Other assets decreased approximately $64 million during
2006 due primarily to a decrease in assets related to pension
and postretirement benefits (approximately $68 million).
Refer to Note 6, “Pensions and Other Postretirement
Benefits,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
more information on the change in accounting for pension and
postretirement benefits as a result of the adoption of Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
No. 158.

Other Shareholders’ Equity
Accounts

The value of our employee stock benefit trusts increased
$51 million in 2006, due to an increase in the market value
of shares held in the trusts (approximately $122 million),
partially offset by the issuance of shares under our stock and
incentive plans (approximately $71 million).



Accumulated other comprehensive loss increased by approximately
$39 million, due to foreign currency translation, partially
offset by the after-tax impact of the adoption of
SFAS No. 158 (approximately $57 million). Refer
to Note 6, “Pensions and Other Postretirement
Benefits,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Effect of Foreign Currency

International operations generate approximately 55% of our net
sales. Our future results are subject to changes in political
and economic conditions and the impact of fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange and interest rates. To reduce our
income statement exposure to transactions in foreign currencies,
we enter into foreign exchange forward, option and swap
contracts, where available and appropriate.

Impact of Foreign Currency Translation:




(In millions)

Change in net sales

$


$


$


Change in net income




While there was a benefit from foreign currency translation in
2006, this benefit was lower compared to prior years. The
benefit to sales in 2006 primarily reflected a benefit from
currencies in Canada, Brazil, Korea and China, partially offset
by a negative impact of the Euro and currencies in South Africa
and Australia. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations on
net income is smaller than the impact on net sales, because our
products are generally sourced in the currencies in which they
are sold. As a result, the impact of foreign exchange rates on
sales is matched with a partially offsetting impact on reported
expenses, thereby reducing the impact of foreign currency
fluctuations on net income.

Our net income for 2005 and 2004 included translation gains and
losses for operations in hyperinflationary economies, which
included Turkey. For accounting purposes, operations are treated
as being in a hyperinflationary economy, based on the cumulative
inflation rate over the past three years. Operations in
hyperinflationary economies consist of our operations in the
Dominican Republic, which use the U.S. dollar as the
functional currency. These operations were not significant to
our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In
2006, Turkey was removed from hyperinflationary status.

Analysis of Selected Financial Ratios

We utilize certain financial ratios to assess our financial
condition and operating performance, as discussed below.

Working Capital Ratio

Working capital (current assets minus current liabilities,
excluding working capital of

held-for

-sale
business), as a percent of net sales, decreased in 2006
primarily due to an increase in short-term debt. Working capital
from continuing operations, as a percent of net sales, is shown
below. We use this non-GAAP measure as a tool to assess our
working capital requirements because it excludes the impact of
fluctuations due to our financing activities. (Refer to
“Uses and Limitations of

Non-GAAP

Measures.”) The timing of financing activities is not
necessarily related to our current operations and would tend to
distort the working capital ratio from period to period. Our
objective is to minimize our investment in working capital from
operations by reducing this ratio, to maximize cash flow and
return on investment.

As a percent of sales, working capital from continuing
operations in 2006 weakened compared to 2005. In 2006, the
change primarily reflected a decrease in cash and cash
equivalents and income taxes payable. Working capital changes
included the impact of currency.

Accounts Receivable Ratio

The average number of days sales outstanding was 58 days in
2006 and 2005, calculated using a four-quarter average accounts
receivable balance divided by the average daily sales for the
year.

Inventory Ratio

Average inventory turnover was 8.5 in 2006 compared to 8.8 in
2005, calculated using the annual cost of sales divided by a
four-quarter average inventory balance. The decrease is due to
higher average inventory levels, primarily to support customer
service initiatives.

Debt Ratios

The decrease in the total debt to total capital ratio in 2006
was due to a decrease in total debt outstanding and an increase
in shareholders’ equity.

Our various loan agreements in effect at year end require that
we maintain specified ratios of consolidated debt and
consolidated interest expense in relation to certain measures of
income. We were in compliance with these covenants as shown in
the table above.

The fair value of our debt is estimated based on the discounted
amount of the related cash flows using the current rates offered
to us for debt of the same remaining maturities. At year end,
the fair value of our total debt, including short-term
borrowings, was $963 million in 2006 and $1.1 billion
in 2005.

Increases in these ratios in 2006 compared to 2005 were
primarily due to higher net income. These ratios are computed
using actual net income and a five-quarter average denominator
for equity and total debt accounts.

Capital Resources

Capital resources include cash flows from operations and debt
financing. We maintain adequate financing arrangements at
competitive rates. These financing arrangements consist of our
commercial paper programs in the U.S. and Europe, committed and
uncommitted bank lines of credit in the countries where we
operate, callable commercial notes, and long-term debt,
including medium-term notes.

Capital from Debt

Our total debt decreased approximately $120 million in 2006
to $968 million compared to year end 2005, reflecting
payments of debt, partially offset by the impact of foreign
currency translation.

In July 2004, we entered into a revolving credit agreement with
ten domestic and foreign banks for a total commitment of
$525 million, expiring July 16, 2009. We use the
financing available under this agreement as a commercial paper

back-up

facility and to
finance other corporate requirements. There was no debt
outstanding under this agreement as of year end 2006 and 2005.

In addition, we have a

364-day

revolving
credit facility with a foreign bank to provide up to
Euro 30 million ($39.6 million) in borrowings
through July 31, 2007. With the approval of the bank, we
may extend the revolving period and due date on an annual basis.
Our intention is to negotiate an extension of this facility in
2007. Financing under this agreement is used to finance cash
requirements of our European operations. As of year end 2006,
$26.3 million was outstanding under this agreement.

We had standby letters of credit outstanding of
$77.1 million and $81.2 million at the end of 2006 and
2005, respectively.

Our uncommitted lines of credit were approximately
$359 million at year end 2006. Our uncommitted lines of
credit do not have a commitment expiration date and may be
cancelled by the banks or us at any time.

In the fourth quarter of 2004, we filed a shelf registration
statement with the SEC to permit the issuance of up to
$500 million in debt and equity securities. Proceeds from
the shelf offering may be used for general corporate purposes,
including repaying, redeeming or repurchasing existing debt, and
for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. As
of December 30, 2006, no securities had been issued under
this registration statement.

Credit ratings are a significant factor in our ability to raise
short-term and long-term financing. The credit ratings assigned
to us also impact the interest rates on our commercial paper and
other borrowings. When determining a credit rating, the rating
agencies place significant weight on our competitive position,
business outlook, consistency of cash flows, debt level and
liquidity, geographic dispersion and management team.

Interest on floating rate debt was estimated using the index
    rate in effect as of December 30, 2006.

We enter into operating leases primarily for office and
warehouse space and equipment for electronic data processing and
transportation. The terms of our leases do not impose
significant restrictions or unusual obligations, except for the
facility in Mentor, Ohio as noted below. The table above
includes minimum annual rental commitments on operating leases
having initial or remaining

non-cancelable

lease
terms of one year or more.

On September 9, 2005, we completed the lease financing for
a commercial facility (the “Facility”) located in
Mentor, Ohio, used primarily for the new headquarters and
research center for our roll materials division. The Facility
consists generally of land, buildings, equipment and office
furnishings. We have leased the Facility under an operating
lease arrangement, which contains a residual value guarantee of
$33.4 million. We do not expect the residual value of the
Facility to be less than the amount guaranteed.

We did not include purchase obligations or open purchase orders
at year end 2006 in the table of contractual obligations above,
because it is impracticable for us to either obtain such
information or provide a reasonable estimate due to the
decentralized nature of our purchasing systems.

Investigations and Legal
Proceedings

On October 19, 2006, we were notified by the DOJ that the
DOJ had decided to close its criminal investigation
(initiated in April 2003) into competitive practices in the
label stock industry without further action.

On November 15, 2006, we announced that we had been
notified by the EC that the EC had closed its
investigation (initiated in May 2004) into the Company’s
competitive activities in the label stock industry, with no
action.

In July 2004, we were notified by the Competition Law Division
of the Department of Justice of Canada that it was seeking
information in connection with a label stock investigation. In
August 2005, we were notified by the Australian Competition and
Consumer Commission that it was seeking information in
connection with a label stock investigation. We are cooperating
with these investigations.

We are a named defendant in purported class actions in the
U.S. seeking treble damages and other relief for alleged
unlawful competitive practices, which were filed after the
announcement of the DOJ investigation. We are also a named
defendant in a purported class action in the U.S. seeking
damages and other relief for alleged disclosure and fiduciary
duty violations pertaining to alleged unlawful competitive
practices.

We are unable to predict the effect of these matters at this
time, although the effect could be adverse and material. These
matters are reported in Note 8, “Contingencies,”
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



Environmental

We have been designated by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (“EPA”) and/or other responsible
state agencies as a potentially responsible party
(“PRP”) at fourteen waste disposal or waste recycling
sites, which are the subject of separate investigations or
proceedings concerning alleged soil and/or groundwater
contamination and for which no settlement of our liability has
been agreed upon. We are participating with other PRPs at such
sites, and anticipate that our share of cleanup costs will be
determined pursuant to remedial agreements to be entered into in
the normal course of negotiations with the EPA or other
governmental authorities.

We have accrued liabilities for these and certain other sites,
including sites in which governmental agencies have designated
us as a PRP, where it is probable that a loss will be incurred
and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.
However, because of the uncertainties associated with
environmental assessment and remediation activities, future
expense to remediate the currently identified sites and any
sites which could be identified in the future for cleanup could
be higher than the liability currently accrued.

During the third quarter of 2006, we recognized an additional
liability of $13 million for estimated environmental
remediation costs for a former operating facility, for which
$2 million had been accrued in the second quarter of 2006.
The amount accrued represents the lower end of the current
estimated range of $15 million to $17 million for
costs expected to be incurred. We considered additional
information provided by outside consultants in revising our
previous estimates of expected costs. This estimate could change
depending on various factors such as modification of currently
planned remedial actions, change in site conditions, change in
the estimated time to complete remediation, change in laws and
regulations affecting remediation requirements and other factors.

Other amounts currently accrued are not significant to our
consolidated financial position, and based upon current
information, we believe that it is unlikely that the final
resolution of these matters will significantly impact our
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

Other

In 2005, we contacted relevant authorities in the U.S. and
reported the results of an internal investigation of potential
violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The
transactions at issue were carried out by a small number of
employees of our reflectives business in China, and involved,
among other things, impermissible payments or attempted
impermissible payments. The payments or attempted payments and
the contracts associated with them appear to have been
relatively minor in amount and of limited duration. Corrective
and disciplinary actions have been taken. Sales of our
reflectives business in China in 2005 were approximately
$7 million. Based on findings to date, no changes to our
previously filed financial statements are warranted as a result
of these matters. However, we expect that fines or other
penalties may be incurred. While we are unable to predict the
financial or operating impact of any such fines or penalties, we
believe that our behavior in detecting, investigating,
responding to and voluntarily disclosing these matters to
authorities should be viewed favorably.

We and our subsidiaries are involved in various other lawsuits,
claims and inquiries, most of which are routine to the nature of
our business. Based upon current information, we believe that
the resolution of these other matters will not materially affect
us.

We provide for an estimate of costs that may be incurred under
our basic limited warranty at the time product revenue is
recognized. These costs primarily include materials and labor
associated with the service or sale of products. Factors that
affect our warranty liability include the number of units
installed or sold, historical and anticipated rate of warranty
claims on those units, cost per claim to satisfy our warranty
obligation and availability of insurance coverage. As these
factors are impacted by actual experience and future
expectations, we assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty
liability and adjust the amounts as necessary.



We participate in receivable financing programs, both
domestically and internationally, with several financial
institutions whereby we may request advances from these
financial institutions. At December 30, 2006, we guaranteed
approximately $22 million of these advances.

We also guaranteed up to approximately $22 million of
certain of our foreign subsidiaries’ obligations to their
suppliers as of December 30, 2006.

In connection with the L&E acquisition in 2002, we issued
approximately .7 million shares at $63.08 per share.
We also entered into an agreement with L&E whereby in the
event the value of our common shares fell below the price of the
shares that were issued to L&E (adjusted for dividends
received), during the period from January 1, 2005 through
December 31, 2007, L&E had the option to exercise a
true-up right. Upon exercise of this true-up right, we had the
option to (1) pay the difference in value to L&E, in
the form of (a) cash or (b) common shares, or
(2) repurchase the shares at the issued share price,
adjusted for dividends paid. The true-up obligation was reduced
by any shares sold by L&E to third parties. During 2005,
L&E sold 44,603 shares to third parties. On October 20,
2005, L&E notified us that it was exercising its true-up
right under the agreement for the remaining approximately
..7 million shares. We repurchased the remaining shares
under the agreement for $41 million in the fourth quarter
of 2005.

USES AND LIMITATIONS OF NON-GAAP MEASURES

Our presented non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of
certain events, activities or strategic decisions. The
accounting effects of these events, activities or decisions,
which are included in the GAAP measures, may make it difficult
to assess the underlying performance of the Company in a single
period. By excluding certain accounting effects, both positive
and negative (for example, divestitures and acquisitions), from
certain of our GAAP measures, management believes that it is
providing meaningful supplemental information to facilitate an
understanding of the Company’s “core” or
“underlying” operating results. These non-GAAP
measures are used internally to evaluate trends in our
underlying business, as well as to facilitate comparison to the
results of competitors for a single period.

Limitations associated with the use of our non-GAAP measures
include (1) the exclusion of foreign currency translation
and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures from the
calculation of organic sales growth; (2) the exclusion of
mandatory debt service requirements, as well as the exclusion of
other uses of the cash generated by operating activities that do
not directly or immediately support the underlying business
(such as discretionary debt reductions, dividends, share
repurchase, acquisitions, etc.) for calculation of free cash
flow; and (3) the exclusion of short-term debt from the
calculation of working capital ratio from continuing operations.
While some of the items the Company excludes from GAAP measures
recur, these items tend to be disparate in amount and timing.
Based upon feedback from investors and financial analysts, we
believe that supplemental non-GAAP measures provide information
that is useful to the assessment of the Company’s
performance and operating trends.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

From time to time, we enter into transactions in the normal
course of business with related parties. We believe that such
transactions are at arm’s length and for terms that would
have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties.

One of our directors, Peter W. Mullin is the chairman, chief
executive officer and a director of MC Insurance Services,
Inc. (“MC”), Mullin Insurance Services, Inc.
(“MINC”), and PWM Insurance Services, Inc.
(“PWM”), executive compensation and benefit
consultants and insurance agents. Mr. Mullin is also the
majority stockholder of MC, MINC and PWM (collectively referred
to as the “Mullin Companies”). We paid premiums to
insurance carriers for life insurance placed by the Mullin
Companies in connection with several of our employee benefit
plans. The Mullin Companies have advised us that they earned
commissions from such insurance carriers for the placement and
renewal of this insurance. Approximately 50% of these
commissions were allocated to and used by MC Insurance
Agency Services, LLC, and MullinTBG Insurance Agency Services
(affiliates of MC) to administer benefit plans and provide
benefit statements to participants under several of our employee
benefit plans. The Mullin Companies own a minority interest in
M Financial



Holdings, Inc. (“MFH”). Substantially all of the life
insurance policies, which we placed through the Mullin Companies
in 2006 and prior years, are issued by insurance carriers that
participate in reinsurance agreements entered into between these
insurance carriers and M Life Insurance Company
(“M Life”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of MFH.
Reinsurance returns earned by M Life are determined
annually by the insurance carriers and can be negative or
positive, depending upon the results of M Life’s
aggregate reinsurance pool, which consists of the insured lives
reinsured by M Life. The Mullin Companies have advised us
that they participated in net reinsurance gains of M Life.
None of these transactions were significant to our financial
position or results of operations.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions for the reporting period and as of the
financial statement date. These estimates and assumptions affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure
of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue
and expense. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Critical accounting policies are those that are important to the
portrayal of our financial condition and results, and which
require us to make difficult, subjective and/or complex
judgments. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters
that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of
such matters is unknown. We believe that critical accounting
policies include accounting for revenue recognition, sales
returns and allowances, accounts receivable allowances,
inventory and inventory reserves, long-lived asset impairments,
pensions and postretirement benefits, income taxes, stock-based
compensation, restructuring and severance costs and litigation.

Revenue Recognition

Sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, pricing is determinable, and collection is reasonably
assured. Furthermore, sales, provisions for estimated returns,
and the cost of products sold are recorded at the time title
transfers to customers and when the customers assume the risks
and rewards of ownership. Sales terms are generally f.o.b. (free
on board) shipping point or f.o.b. destination, depending upon
local business customs. For most regions in which we operate,
f.o.b. shipping point terms are utilized and sales are recorded
at the time of shipment, because this is when title and risk of
loss are transferred. In certain regions, notably in Europe,
f.o.b. destination terms are generally utilized and sales are
recorded when the products are delivered to the customer’s
delivery site, because this is when title and risk of loss are
transferred. Actual product returns are charged against
estimated sales return allowances.

Sales rebates and discounts are common practice in the
industries in which we operate. Volume, promotional, price, cash
and other discounts and customer incentives are accounted for as
a reduction to gross sales. Rebates and discounts are recorded
based upon estimates at the time products are sold. These
estimates



are based upon historical experience for similar programs and
products. We review such rebates and discounts on an ongoing
basis and accruals for rebates and discounts are adjusted, if
necessary, as additional information becomes available.

Sales Returns and Allowances

Sales returns and allowances represent credits we grant to our
customers (both affiliated and non-affiliated) for the return of
unsatisfactory product or a negotiated allowance in lieu of
return. We accrue for returns and allowances based upon the
gross price of the products sold and historical experience for
such products. We record these allowances based on the following
factors: (i) customer specific allowances; and (ii) an
estimated amount, based on our historical experience, for issues
not yet identified.

Accounts Receivable Allowances

We are required to make judgments as to the collectibility of
accounts receivable based on established aging policy,
historical experience and future expectations. The allowances
for doubtful accounts represent allowances for customer trade
accounts receivable that are estimated to be partially or
entirely uncollectible. These allowances are used to reduce
gross trade receivables to their net realizable value. We record
these allowances based on estimates related to the following
factors: (i) customer specific allowances;
(ii) amounts based upon an aging schedule; and
(iii) an estimated amount, based on our historical
experience, for issues not yet identified. No single customer
represented 10% or more of our net sales or trade receivables at
year end 2006 and 2005. However, our ten largest customers at
year end 2006 represented approximately 18% of trade accounts
receivable and consisted of six customers of our Office and
Consumer Products segment, three customers of our
Pressure-sensitive Materials segment and one customer of both
these segments. The financial position and operations of these
customers are monitored on an ongoing basis.

Inventory and Inventory Reserves

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value and
are categorized as raw materials, work-in-progress or finished
goods. Cost is determined using methods that approximate both
the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) and last-in,
first-out (“LIFO”) methods. Inventories valued using
the LIFO method comprised 29% and 32% of inventories before LIFO
adjustment at year end 2006 and 2005, respectively. The
Company’s international operations are on the FIFO basis of
inventory cost accounting. U.S. operations use both FIFO and
LIFO. Our limited use of the LIFO valuation methodology reflects
the tax-basis election in place at the time of previous
acquisitions of businesses in the U.S.

Inventory reserves are recorded for damaged, obsolete, excess
and slow-moving inventory. We use estimates to record these
reserves. Slow-moving inventory is reviewed by category and may
be partially or fully reserved for depending on the type of
product and the length of time the product has been included in
inventory.

Long-lived Asset Impairments

We record impairment charges when the carrying amounts of
long-lived assets are determined not to be recoverable.
Impairment is measured by assessing the usefulness of an asset
or by comparing the carrying value of an asset to its fair
value. Fair value is typically determined using quoted market
prices, if available, or an estimate of undiscounted future cash
flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its
eventual disposition. The amount of impairment loss is
calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the fair
value. Changes in market conditions and management strategy have
historically caused us to reassess the carrying amount of our
long-lived assets.



Pensions and Postretirement Benefits

In December 2006, we adopted the provisions of
SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an
amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and
132(R)”:

Assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations
and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plan and other
postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by management in
consultation with outside actuaries. In the event we determine
that changes are warranted in the assumptions used, such as the
discount rate, expected long term rate of return, or health care
costs, future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could
increase or decrease. Due to changing market conditions or
changes in the participant population, the actuarial assumptions
we use may differ from actual results, which could have a
significant impact on our pension and postretirement liability
and related cost.

Discount Rate

We, in consultation with our actuaries, annually review and
determine the discount rates to be used in connection with our
postretirement obligations. The assumed discount rate for each
pension plan reflects market rates for high quality corporate
bonds currently available. In the U.S., our discount rate is
determined by evaluating several yield curves consisting of
large populations of high quality corporate bonds. The projected
pension benefit payment streams are then matched with the bond
portfolios to determine a rate that reflects the liability
duration unique to our plans.

Long-term Return on Assets

We determine the long-term rate of return assumption for plan
assets by reviewing the historical and expected returns of both
the equity and fixed income markets, taking into consideration
that assets with higher volatility typically generate a greater
return over the long run. Additionally, current market
conditions, such as interest rates, are evaluated and peer data
is reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness.

Healthcare Cost Trend Rate

Our practice is to fund the cost of postretirement benefits on a
cash basis. For measurement purposes, a 9% annual rate of
increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits
was assumed for 2007. This rate is expected to decrease to
approximately 5% by 2011.

Income Taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary
differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial and tax reporting purposes. Such amounts are adjusted,
as appropriate, to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be
in effect when the temporary differences reverse. A valuation
allowance is recorded to reduce our deferred tax assets to the
amount that is more likely than not to be realized.

When establishing a valuation allowance, we consider future
sources of income such as forecasted earnings, the mix of
earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and prudent
and feasible tax planning.



In the event we determine that we would not be able to realize
our deferred tax assets in the future, the valuation adjustment
to the deferred tax assets is charged to earnings in the period
in which we make such a determination. Likewise, if later it is
determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax
assets would be realized, we would release the previously
provided valuation allowance.

We calculate current and deferred tax provisions based on
estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual
results reflected in income tax returns filed during the
following years. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded
when identified in the subsequent years.

The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits
by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. Our estimate of
the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to
management’s assessment of relevant risks, facts, and
circumstances existing at that time. We believe that we have
adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable outcomes related
to these matters. However, our future results may include
favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax
liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved,
which may impact our effective tax rate on a quarterly basis.

Stock-Based Compensation

Effective January 1, 2006, we began recognizing expense for
stock-based compensation to comply with the provisions of the
reissued SFAS No. 123(R), using the modified
prospective application transition method. As permitted by this
transition method, results for the prior periods have not been
restated. In addition, we continued to recognize compensation
cost related to outstanding unvested awards as of
December 31, 2005 under the original provisions of
SFAS No. 123. Stock-based compensation expense for all
awards granted after December 31, 2005 was based on the
grant date fair value estimated in accordance with
SFAS No. 123(R).

Valuation of Stock Options

Our stock-based compensation expense is the estimated fair value
of options granted, amortized on a straight-line basis over the
requisite service period. The fair value of each of our stock
option awards is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model. This model requires input
assumptions for our expected dividend yield, expected
volatility, risk-free interest rate and the expected life of the
options.

Expected dividend yield was based on the current annual dividend
divided by the 12-month average monthly stock price prior to
grant.

Expected volatility for options granted during 2006 was based on
both historical and implied volatility. Expected volatility for
options granted prior to 2006 was based on historical volatility
of our stock price.

Risk-free rate was based on the average of the weekly

T-Bond

rate over the
expected option term.

Expected term was determined based on historical experience
under our stock option plans.

Forfeiture rate assumption was determined based on historical
data of our stock option forfeitures over the last twelve years.

Certain of the assumptions used above are based on
management’s estimates. As such, if factors change and such
factors require us to change our assumptions and estimates, our
stock-based compensation expense could be significantly
different in the future.

We have not capitalized costs associated with stock-based
compensation.

Accounting for Income Taxes for Stock-based Compensation

We elected to use the short-cut method to calculate the
historical pool of windfall tax benefits related to employee
stock-based compensation awards.



Restructuring and Severance Costs

We account for restructuring costs including severance and other
costs associated with exit or disposal activities following the
guidance provided in SFAS No. 112, “Accounting
for Postemployment Benefits,” and SFAS No. 146,
“Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities.” In the U.S., we have a severance pay plan
(“Pay Plan”), which provides eligible employees with
severance payments in the event of an involuntary termination
due to qualifying cost reduction actions. We calculate severance
pay using the severance benefit formula under the Pay Plan.
Accordingly, we record provisions for such amounts and other
related exit costs when they are probable and estimable as set
forth under SFAS No. 112. In the absence of a Pay
Plan, liability for severance and other employee-related costs
are recognized when the liability is incurred and follow the
guidance of SFAS No. 146.

Litigation and Environmental

We are currently involved in various lawsuits, claims and
inquiries, most of which are routine to the nature of our
business. In accordance with SFAS No. 5,
“Accounting for Contingencies,” we accrue estimates of
the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these
claims. The ultimate resolution of these claims could affect
future results of operations should our exposure be materially
different from our earlier estimates or should liabilities be
incurred that were not previously accrued.

RECENT ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS

During 2006, we adopted several accounting and financial
disclosure requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”), Emerging Issues Task Force
(“EITF”) and Financial Interpretations by the staff of
the FASB. The requirements with the most significant impact were
the reissued SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based
Payment,” and SFAS No. 158, “Employers’
Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and
132(R).” (Refer to Note 1, “Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies,” to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for more information.)

SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT

The matters discussed in this Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and
other sections of this Annual Report contain
“forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These
statements, which are not statements of historical fact, may
contain estimates, assumptions, projections and/or expectations
regarding future events, which may or may not occur. Words such
as “aim,” “anticipate,” “assume,”
“believe,” “continue,” “could,”
“estimate,” “expect,” “guidance,”
“intend,” “may,” “objective,”
“plan,” “potential,” “project,”
“seek,” “shall,” “should,”
“target,” “will,” “would,” or
variations thereof and other expressions, which refer to future
events and trends, identify forward-looking statements. Such
forward-looking statements, and financial or other business
targets, are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which
could cause actual results to differ materially from expected
results, performance or achievements of the Company expressed or
implied by such forward-looking statements.

Certain of such risks and uncertainties are discussed in more
detail in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,”
to the Company’s Annual Report on
Form

10-K

for the
year ended December 30, 2006, and include, but are not
limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to investment in
development activities and new production facilities, timely
development and successful market acceptance of new products,
fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials, ability
of the Company to achieve and sustain targeted cost reductions,
impact of competitive products and pricing, business mix shift,
credit risks, ability to obtain adequate financing arrangements,
fluctuations in pension, insurance and employee benefit costs,
successful integration of acquisitions, successful
implementation of new manufacturing technologies and
installation of manufacturing equipment, customer and supplier
concentrations, financial condition and inventory strategies of
customers, changes in customer order patterns, loss of
significant contract(s) or customer(s), legal proceedings,
including the Canadian Department of Justice and Australian
Competition Consumer Commission investigations into



industry competitive practices and any related proceedings or
lawsuits pertaining to these investigations or to the subject
matter thereof or of the recently concluded investigations by
the DOJ and the EC (including purported class actions seeking
treble damages for alleged unlawful competitive practices, and a
purported class action related to alleged disclosure and
fiduciary duty violations pertaining to alleged unlawful
competitive practices, which were filed after the announcement
of the DOJ investigation), impact of potential violations of the
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act based on issues in
China, changes in governmental regulations, fluctuations in
interest rates, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
and other risks associated with foreign operations, changes in
economic or political conditions, acts of war, terrorism,
natural disasters, impact of epidemiological events on the
economy, the Company’s customers and suppliers, and other
factors.

The Company believes that the most significant risk factors that
could affect its ability to achieve its stated financial
expectations in the near-term include (1) the impact of
economic conditions on underlying demand for the Company’s
products; (2) the impact of competitor’s actions,
including expansion in key markets, product offerings and
pricing; (3) the impact of changes in raw material and
energy-related costs and associated changes in selling prices;
(4) potential adverse developments in legal proceedings
and/or investigations regarding competitive activities,
including possible fines, penalties, judgments or settlements;
and (5) the ability of the Company to achieve and sustain
targeted cost reductions.

The Company’s forward-looking statements represent judgment
only on the dates such statements were made. By making such
forward-looking statements, the Company assumes no duty to
update them to reflect new, changed or unanticipated events or
circumstances, other than as may be required by law.

Item 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Risk Management

We are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates and
foreign currency exchange rates.

Our policy is not to purchase or hold foreign currency, interest
rate or commodity contracts for trading purposes.

Our objective in managing the exposure to foreign currency
changes is to reduce the risk to our earnings and cash flow
associated with foreign exchange rate changes. As a result, we
enter into foreign exchange forward, option and swap contracts
to reduce risks associated with the value of our existing
foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and
anticipated foreign revenues and costs, when available and
appropriate. The gains and losses on these contracts are
intended to offset changes in the related exposures. We do not
hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that would
entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange
rates on our consolidated net income.

Our objective in managing our exposure to interest rate changes
is to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and
cash flows. To achieve our objectives, we may periodically use
interest rate contracts to manage net exposure to interest rate
changes related to our borrowings. In connection with the
issuance of the $250 million

10-year

senior notes in
2003, we settled a forward starting interest rate swap at a loss
of approximately $32.5 million. The loss is currently being
amortized to interest expense over 10 years, which
corresponds to the term of the related debt.

Additionally, we enter into certain natural gas futures
contracts to reduce the risks associated with anticipated
domestic natural gas used in manufacturing and operations. These
amounts are not material to our financial statements.

In the normal course of operations, we also face other risks
that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable. Such risks
principally include changes in economic or political conditions,
other risks associated with foreign operations, commodity price
risk and litigation risk, which are not represented in the
analyses that follow.



Foreign Exchange Value-At-Risk

We use a Value-At-Risk (“VAR”) model to determine the
estimated maximum potential one-day loss in earnings associated
with both our foreign exchange positions and contracts. This
approach assumes that market rates or prices for foreign
exchange positions and contracts are normally distributed. The
VAR model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions.
Firm commitments, accounts receivable and accounts payable
denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these
instruments are intended to hedge, were included in the model.
Forecasted transactions, which certain of these instruments are
intended to hedge, were excluded from the model. The VAR was
estimated using a variance-covariance methodology based on
historical volatility for each currency. The volatility and
correlation used in the calculation were based on two-year
historical data obtained from one of our domestic banks. A 95%
confidence level was used for a one-day time horizon.

The VAR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to
represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred by
us, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable
changes in market factors.

The estimated maximum potential one-day loss in earnings for our
foreign exchange positions and contracts was approximately
$.5 million at year end 2006.

Interest Rate Sensitivity

An assumed 40 basis point move in interest rates (10% of
our weighted-average interest rate on floating rate debt)
affecting our variable-rate borrowings would have had an
immaterial effect on our 2006 earnings.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

As of the end of the
period covered by this report, the Company carried out an
evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of
its management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the
Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and
operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in
Rule

13a-15(e)

or

15d-15(e)

of the
Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, the Company’s
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have
concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and
procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that
information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and
forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting.

Management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
(as defined in
Rule

13a-15(f)

or

15d-15(f)

of the
Exchange Act). Under the supervision and with the participation
of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted
an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over
financial reporting based upon the framework in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the



Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, the
Company’s management concluded that its internal control
over financial reporting was effective as of December 30,
2006. (See Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting on page 68 in the Company’s 2006
Annual Report to Shareholders.)

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 30, 2006, has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their Report of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm on page 69 in the
Company’s 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders, and is
incorporated herein by reference.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

During the third quarter of 2006, the Company implemented an
upgrade to its financial reporting and consolidation system and
installed new finance and accounting software for its Retail
Information Services business in Asia. The Company reviewed both
systems as they were being implemented, as well as the internal
controls affected by the implementation. Where appropriate, the
Company made changes to affected internal controls.

During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company outsourced
certain of its shared service functions for accounts receivable,
accounts payable, and general ledger accounting to a third-party
service provider. As part of the transition process, the Company
reviewed the related internal controls and determined that the
design of the controls surrounding these processes satisfies the
control objectives of the Company. Where appropriate, the
Company made changes to affected internal controls. The Company
also tested the operating effectiveness of the controls, and
determined that they were operating effectively.

Except for these changes, there have been no changes in the
Company’s internal controls over financial reporting during
the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or
are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s
internal controls over financial reporting. The Company believes
that its internal controls, as modified, were operating
effectively as of December 30, 2006.
