PART I

Item 1.

BUSINESS

Avery Dennison Corporation (“Avery Dennison,” the
    “Company,” “Registrant,” “Issuer,”
    which may be referred to as “we” or “us”)
    was incorporated in 1977 in the state of Delaware as Avery
    International Corporation, the successor corporation to a
    California corporation of the same name, which was incorporated
    in 1946. In 1990, the Company merged one of its subsidiaries
    into Dennison Manufacturing Company (“Dennison”), as a
    result of which Dennison became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
    Company, and in connection with which Company’s name was
    changed to Avery Dennison Corporation.

Our homepage on the
    internet is www.averydennison.com and you can learn more about
    us by visiting our Web site. Our Web site address provided in
    this annual report on

Form 10-K

is not intended to function as a hyperlink and the information
    on our Web site is not and should not be considered part of this
    report and is not incorporated by reference in this document.

Our businesses include the production of pressure-sensitive
    materials, office products and a variety of tickets, tags,
    labels and other converted products. Some pressure-sensitive
    materials are “converted” into labels and other
    products through embossing, printing, stamping and die-cutting,
    and some are sold in unconverted form as base materials, tapes
    and reflective sheeting. We also manufacture and sell a variety
    of office products and other converted products and other items
    not involving pressure-sensitive components, such as binders,
    organizing systems, markers, fasteners, business forms, as well
    as tickets, tags, and imprinting equipment for retail and
    apparel manufacturers.

A pressure-sensitive, or self-adhesive, material is one that
    adheres to a surface by press-on contact. It generally consists
    of four elements: a face material, which may be paper, metal
    foil, plastic film or fabric; an adhesive, which may be
    permanent or removable; a release coating; and a backing
    material to protect the adhesive against premature contact with
    other surfaces, and which can also serve as the carrier for
    supporting and dispensing individual labels. When the products
    are to be used, the release coating and protective backing are
    removed, exposing the adhesive, and the label or other face
    material is pressed or rolled into place.

Self-adhesive materials may initially cost more than materials
    using heat or moisture activated adhesives, but the use of
    self-adhesive materials often provides cost savings because of
    their easy and instant application, without the need for
    adhesive activation. They also provide consistent and versatile
    adhesion, with minimal adhesive deterioration and are available
    in a large selection of materials in nearly any size, shape and
    color.

Our reporting segments are:

•

Pressure-sensitive Materials

•

Office and Consumer Products

•

Retail Information Services

In addition to our reporting segments, we have other specialty
    converting businesses comprised of several businesses that
    produce specialty tapes and highly engineered labels including
    radio frequency identification (“RFID”) inlays and
    labels, and other converted products.

Although our segment structure remained the same as reported in
    the prior year, in 2006, we transferred our business media
    division from the Retail Information Services segment into other
    specialty converting businesses to align with a change in our
    internal reporting structure. Prior year amounts included herein
    have been reclassified to conform to the current year
    presentation.

On June 15, 2007, we completed the acquisition of Paxar
    Corporation (“Paxar”), a global leader in retail tag,
    ticketing, and branding systems. The Paxar operations were
    included in the Company’s Retail Information Services
    segment. In accordance with the terms of the acquisition
    agreement, each outstanding share of Paxar common stock was
    converted into the right to receive $30.50 in cash. See Retail
    Information Services Segment below for further information.



In 2007, the Pressure-sensitive Materials segment contributed
    approximately 55% of our total sales, while the Retail
    Information Services and Office and Consumer Products segments
    contribute approximately 19% and 16%, respectively, of our total
    sales.

In 2007, international operations constituted a significant
    portion of our business and represented approximately 60% of our
    sales. We expanded our operations, focusing particularly on
    Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe. As of December 29,
    2007, we operated approximately 200 manufacturing and
    distribution facilities located in 60 countries, and
    employed approximately 37,000 persons worldwide.

We are subject to certain risks referred to in Item 1A,
    “Risk Factors” and Item 3, “Legal
    Proceedings” below, including those normally attending
    international and domestic operations, such as changes in
    economic or political conditions, currency fluctuations,
    exchange control regulations and the effect of international
    relations and domestic affairs of foreign countries on the
    conduct of business, legal proceedings, and the availability and
    pricing of raw materials.

Except as set forth below, no single customer represented 10% or
    more of our net sales or trade receivables at year end 2007 and
    2006. However, our ten largest customers at year end 2007
    represented approximately 17% of trade accounts receivable and
    consisted of six customers of our Office and Consumer Products
    segment, three customers of our Pressure-sensitive Materials
    segment and one customer of both these segments. The financial
    position and operations of these customers are monitored on an
    ongoing basis (see “Critical Accounting Policies and
    Estimates” of Item 7, “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial
    Condition”). United States export sales are not a
    significant part of our business. Backlogs are not considered
    material in the industries in which we compete.

Pressure-sensitive
    Materials Segment

The Pressure-sensitive Materials segment manufactures and sells
    Fasson-, JAC-, and Avery Dennison-brand pressure-sensitive
    materials, Avery-brand graphics and graphic films, Avery
    Dennison-brand reflective products, and performance polymers.
    The business of this segment is generally not seasonal, except
    for certain outdoor graphics and highway safety products and
    operations in Western Europe. Pressure-sensitive materials
    consist primarily of papers, plastic films, metal foils and
    fabrics, which are coated with Company-developed and purchased
    adhesives, and then laminated with specially coated backing
    papers and films. They are sold in roll or sheet form with
    either solid or patterned adhesive coatings, and are available
    in a wide range of face materials, sizes,



thicknesses and adhesive properties. These materials are sold to
    label printers and converters for labeling, decorating,
    fastening, electronic data processing and special applications
    on a worldwide basis.

Graphic products consist of a variety of films and other
    products sold to the architectural, commercial sign, digital
    printing, and other related markets. We also sell durable cast
    and reflective films to the construction, automotive, and fleet
    transportation markets, scrim-reinforced vinyl material for
    banner sign applications, and reflective films for traffic and
    safety applications. Our graphic and reflective businesses are
    organized on a worldwide basis to serve the expanding commercial
    graphic arts market, including wide-format digital printing
    applications. We also manufacture and sell proprietary films
    that are used for outdoor, weather-resistant applications.

Performance polymer products include a range of solvent- and
    emulsion-based acrylic polymer adhesives, protective coatings
    and other polymer additives for internal use, as well as for
    sale to other companies.

In this segment, our larger competitors are Raflatac, a
    subsidiary of UPM-Kymmene; Morgan Adhesives
    (“MACtac”), a division of the Bemis Company; and 3M
    Company (for graphic and reflective products). Entry of
    competitors into the field of pressure-sensitive adhesives and
    materials may be limited by capital requirements and a need for
    technical knowledge. We believe that our relative size and scale
    of operations, our ability to serve our customers with a broad
    line of quality products and service programs, our distribution
    and brand strength, and the development and commercialization of
    new products are among the more significant factors in
    developing and maintaining our competitive position.

Retail
    Information Services Segment

The Retail Information Services segment designs, manufactures
    and sells a wide variety of price marking and brand
    identification products for retailers, apparel manufacturers,
    distributors and industrial customers on a worldwide basis. This
    business is seasonal, with higher volume in advance of the
    back-to-school and holiday shipping periods.

Our brand identification products include woven and printed
    labels, graphic tags and barcode tags. Our information
    management products include price tickets, carton labels, RFID
    tags and printing applications for supply chain and security
    management. Our solution enabling products include barcode
    printers, molded plastic fastening and application devices and
    security management products.

As discussed above, we completed the acquisition of Paxar in
    June 2007. The combination of the Paxar business into this
    segment increases our presence in the expanding and fragmented
    retail information and brand identification market, combines
    complementary strengths and broadens the range of our product
    and service capabilities, improves our ability to meet customer
    demands for product innovation and improved quality of service,
    and facilitates expansion into new product and geographic
    segments. The integration of the acquisition into our operations
    is also expected to result in significant cost synergies.

In this segment, some of our competitors are SML Group,
    Checkpoint and Shore To Shore. We believe that our ability to
    serve our customers with product innovation, a comprehensive
    brand identification and information management product line,
    our global distribution network, service, quality, and
    geographic reach are the key advantages in developing and
    maintaining our competitive position.

Office
    and Consumer Products Segment

The Office and Consumer Products segment manufactures and sells
    a wide range of Avery-brand printable media and other products.
    The business of this segment is seasonal, with higher volume
    related to the back-to-school season.

This segment’s products are generally sold through office
    products superstores, mass market distributors, wholesalers and
    dealers. We manufacture and sell a wide range of Avery-brand
    products for office, school and home uses: printable media, such
    as copier, ink-jet and laser printer labels, related computer
    software, ink-jet and laser printer card and index products; and
    organization, filing and presentation products, such as binders,
    dividers and sheet protectors. We also offer a wide range of
    other stationery products, including writing instruments,
    markers,



adhesives and specialty products under brand names such as
    Avery,

Marks-A-Lot

and HI-LITER. The extent of product offerings varies by
    geographic market.

In this segment, our larger competitors are Acco Brands
    Corporation, Esselte Corporation and manufacturers of private
    brands. We believe that our brand strength, a large installed
    base of software that facilitates the use of many of our
    products, our ability to serve our customers with a broad line
    of quality products, and the development and commercialization
    of new products are among the more significant factors in
    developing and maintaining our competitive position.

Other
    specialty converting businesses

Other specialty converting businesses include our specialty
    tape, industrial, performance films and automotive products,
    business media, RFID and security printing businesses. These
    businesses manufacture and sell specialty tapes, highly
    engineered films, RFID inlays, pressure-sensitive postage stamps
    and other converted products. These businesses are generally not
    seasonal, except for certain automotive products due to typical
    summer plant shutdowns by automotive manufacturers.

The specialty tape business manufactures and sells single- and
    double-coated tapes and adhesive transfer tapes for use in
    non-mechanical fastening, bonding and sealing systems in various
    industries, which are sold to industrial and medical original
    equipment manufacturers, converters, and disposable diaper
    producers worldwide. These products are sold in roll form and
    are available in a wide range of face materials, sizes,
    thicknesses and adhesive properties.

Our industrial and automotive products businesses primarily
    consist of custom pressure-sensitive and heat-seal labels for
    the automotive and durable goods industries. These products are
    sold primarily to original equipment manufacturers.

Our performance films business produces a variety of decorative
    and functional films, primarily for the automotive industry,
    that are designed for injection mold applications.

Our business media business designs and markets customized
    products for printing and information workflow applications.

Our RFID business manufactures RFID inlays and labels and makes
    use of our existing distribution by marketing to our label
    converting customers.

Our security printing business manufactures and sells
    self-adhesive battery labels to a battery manufacturer, and
    self-adhesive stamps to the U.S. Postal Service.

In addition, we sell specialty print-receptive films to the
    industrial label market, metallic dispersion products to the
    packaging industry, and proprietary wood grain and other
    patterns of film laminates for housing exteriors and interior
    and exterior automotive applications.

We compete with a number of diverse businesses. Our largest
    competitor for this group of businesses is 3M Company in
    the specialty tape business. Entry of competitors into these
    specialty converting businesses may be limited by capital and
    technical requirements. We believe that our ability to serve our
    customers with quality, cost effective products and the
    development and commercialization of new products are among the
    more significant factors in developing and maintaining our
    competitive position.

Research
    and Development

Many of our current products are the result of our research and
    development efforts. Our expenses for research, design and
    testing of new products and applications by our operating units
    and the Avery Research Center (the “Research Center”)
    located in Pasadena, California were $95.5 million in 2007,
    $87.9 million in 2006, and $85.4 million in 2005. A
    significant number of our research and development activities
    are conducted at the Research Center, which supports each of our
    operating segments.

Our operating units’ research efforts are directed
    primarily toward developing new products and operating
    techniques and improving product performance, often in close
    association with customers. The Research Center



supports our operating units’ patent and product
    development work, and focuses on improving adhesives, materials
    and coating processes, as well as related product applications
    and ventures. These efforts often focus on projects relating to
    printing and coating technologies and adhesive, release and ink
    chemistries.

The loss of individual patents or licenses would not be material
    to us taken as a whole, nor to our operating segments
    individually. Our principal trademarks are Avery, Fasson, Avery
    Dennison and the Company’s symbol. These trademarks are
    significant in the markets in which our products compete.

Three-Year
    Summary of Segment Information

Certain financial information on our reporting segments and
    other specialty converting businesses for the three years ended
    December 29, 2007, which appear in Note 12,
    “Segment Information,” in the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements beginning on page 72 of our 2007
    Annual Report to Shareholders, are incorporated herein by
    reference.

Other
    Matters

We use various raw materials, primarily paper, plastic films and
    resins, and specialty chemicals, which we purchase from a
    variety of commercial and industrial sources and which are
    subject to price fluctuations. Although from time to time
    shortages could occur, these raw materials currently are
    generally available.

We produce a majority of our self-adhesive materials using
    water-based emulsion and hot-melt adhesive technologies.
    Emissions from these operations contain small amounts of
    volatile organic compounds, which can be regulated by agencies
    of federal, state, local and foreign governments. We continue to
    evaluate the use of alternative materials and technologies to
    minimize these emissions.

A portion of our manufacturing process for self-adhesive
    materials utilizes certain organic solvents which, unless
    controlled, would be emitted into the atmosphere. Emissions of
    these substances are regulated by agencies of federal, state,
    local and foreign governments. In connection with the
    maintenance and acquisition of certain manufacturing equipment,
    we invest in solvent capture and control units to assist in
    regulating these emissions.

We have developed adhesives and adhesive processing systems that
    minimize the use of solvents. Emulsion adhesives, hot-melt
    adhesives or solventless silicone systems have been installed in
    our facilities in Peachtree City, Georgia; Fort Wayne and
    Greenfield, Indiana; and Quakertown, Pennsylvania; as well as in
    other plants in the United States, Argentina, Australia,
    Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, France, Germany,
    India, Korea, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands,
    South Africa, Thailand and United Kingdom.

Based on current information, we do not believe that the costs
    of complying with applicable laws regulating the discharge of
    materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the
    protection of the environment, will have a material effect upon
    our capital expenditures, consolidated financial position or
    results of operations.

For information regarding our potential responsibility for
    cleanup costs at certain hazardous waste sites, see “Legal
    Proceedings” (Part I, Item 3) and
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of
    Operations and Financial Condition” (Part II,
    Item 7).

Item 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

Our ability to attain our goals and objectives is materially
    dependent on numerous factors and risks, including but not
    limited to, the following:

The
    demand for our products is impacted by economic conditions of
    the principal countries in which we operate. A decline in the
    economies in these countries could have an adverse effect on our
    sales and profitability.

We have operations in 60 countries and our domestic and
    international operations are strongly influenced by matters
    beyond our control, including changes in the political, social,
    economic, tax and regulatory environments (including tariffs) in
    the countries in which we operate, as well as the impact of
    economic conditions on underlying demand for our products. In
    addition, approximately 60% of our sales are from international
    operations.



Fluctuations in currencies can cause transaction, translation
    and other losses to us, which can negatively impact our sales
    and profitability.

We
    operate in some highly competitive markets. If we do not compete
    effectively, we could lose market share and experience falling
    prices, adversely affecting our financial results.

We are at risk that our competitors will expand in our key
    markets and implement new technologies making them more
    competitive. There is also the possibility that competitors will
    be able to offer additional products, services, lower prices, or
    other incentives that we cannot or will not offer or that will
    make our products less profitable. There can be no assurance
    that we will be able to compete successfully against current and
    future competitors.

We are also at risk with regards to changes in customer order
    patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained
    by customers and the timing of customer purchases, which may be
    affected by announced price changes, changes in the
    Company’s incentive programs, or the customer’s
    ability to achieve incentive goals. Changes in customers’
    preferences for our products can also affect the demand for our
    products.

We have
    acquired companies and our interest in various acquisition
    opportunities has increased. Acquisitions come with significant
    risks and uncertainties, including those related to integration,
    technology and personnel.

In order to grow our product lines and expand into new markets,
    we have made acquisitions and may do so in the future, for
    example, we acquired Paxar Corporation in 2007. Various risks,
    uncertainties, and costs are associated with the acquisitions.
    Effective integration of systems, controls, objectives,
    personnel, product lines, markets, customers, suppliers,
    production facilities and cost savings can be difficult to
    achieve and the results are uncertain, particularly across our
    geographically dispersed organization. We may not be able to
    retain key personnel of an acquired company and we may not be
    able to successfully execute integration strategies or achieve
    projected performance targets set for the business segment into
    which an acquired company is integrated. Both prior to and after
    the closing of the transactions, our business and those of the
    acquired companies may suffer due to uncertainty or diversion of
    management attention.

There can be no assurance that acquisitions will be successful
    and contribute to our profitability and we may not be able to
    identify new acquisition opportunities in the future.

Our
    increased level of indebtedness following the Paxar acquisition
    could limit our ability to incur additional debt to fund
    business needs over the medium term.

As a result of the Paxar acquisition, our debt levels
    approximately doubled. Although significant debt reduction is
    anticipated over the medium term from both the cash flow
    generation of our underlying businesses and the synergies
    expected from the acquisition, circumstances both within and
    beyond our control could cause debt levels to remain elevated
    for a longer time frame than anticipated. These higher debt
    levels could negatively impact our ability to meet other
    business needs or opportunities and could result in higher
    financing costs.

Potential
    adverse developments in legal proceedings and an investigation
    regarding competitive activities and other legal, compliance and
    regulatory matters, including those involving product and trade
    compliance, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act issues and other
    matters, could impact us materially.

Our financial results could be materially adversely impacted by
    an unfavorable outcome to pending or future litigation and
    investigations, including an Australian Competition and Consumer
    Commission investigation into industry competitive practices,
    lawsuits pertaining to this investigation or to the subject
    matter of now concluded investigations by the
    U.S. Department of Justice, the European Commission, and
    the Competition Law Division of the Department of Justice of
    Canada (including purported class actions in the United States
    seeking treble damages for alleged unlawful competitive
    practices, and a purported class action related to alleged
    disclosure and fiduciary duty violations pertaining to alleged
    unlawful competitive practices, which were filed after the
    announcement of the U.S. Department of Justice
    investigation), the impact of potential violations of the
    U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act based on issues in
    China, and other legal, compliance and regulatory matters,
    including product and trade compliance. See Item 1,
    “Legal Proceedings.” There can be no assurance that
    any investigation or litigation outcome will be favorable.



Our
    future results may be affected if we generate less productivity
    improvement than projected.

We are undertaking efforts to reduce costs in many of our
    operations, including closure of facilities, headcount
    reductions, organizational simplification and restructuring,
    process standardization, and manufacturing relocation, and using
    a variety of tools such as Lean Sigma and Kaizen events, to
    increase productivity, which is not assured. Lower levels of
    productivity could reduce profitability. In addition, cost
    reduction actions could expose us to additional production risk
    and loss of sales.

As a
    manufacturer, our sales and profitability are also dependent
    upon the cost and availability of raw materials and energy,
    which are subject to price fluctuations, and the ability to
    control or pass on costs of raw materials and labor.

Inflationary and other increases in the costs of raw materials,
    labor and energy have occurred in the past and are expected to
    recur, and our performance depends in part on our ability to
    pass on these cost increases to customers in our selling prices
    for products, and to effect improvements in productivity. Also,
    it is important that we are able to obtain timely delivery of
    materials, equipment, and packaging from suppliers, and to make
    timely delivery to customers. A disruption to our supply chain
    could adversely affect our sales and profitability.

Slower
    growth in key markets could adversely affect our
    profitability.

Our business could be negatively impacted by a decline in key
    end use markets or applications for our products. Our overall
    performance will be influenced by these markets.

Our
    customers are widely diversified, but in certain portions of our
    business, industry concentration has increased the importance
    and decreased the number of significant customers.

In particular, sales of our office and consumer products in the
    United States are concentrated in a few major customers,
    principally office product superstores, mass market distributors
    and wholesalers. The business risk associated with this
    concentration, including increased credit risks for these and
    other customers, and the possibility of related bad debt
    write-offs, could negatively affect our margins and profits.

Our
    ability to develop and successfully market new products and
    applications is important in maintaining growth.

The timely introduction of new products and improvements in
    current products helps determine our success. Research and
    development for each of our operating segments is complex and
    uncertain and requires innovation and anticipation of market
    trends. We could focus on products that ultimately are not
    accepted by customers or we could suffer delays in production or
    launch of new products that could compromise our competitive
    position in such product markets.

Infringing
    intellectual property rights of third parties or inadequately
    acquiring or protecting our intellectual property and patents
    could harm our ability to compete or grow.

Because our products involve complex technology and chemistry,
    we are from time to time involved in litigation involving
    patents and other intellectual property. Parties have filed, and
    in the future may file, claims against us alleging that we have
    infringed their intellectual property rights. If we are held
    liable for infringement, we could be required to pay damages or
    obtain licenses or to cease making or selling certain products.
    There can be no assurance that licenses will be available at
    all, or will be available on commercially reasonable terms, and
    the cost to defend these claims, whether or not meritorious, or
    to develop new technology could be significant and could divert
    the attention of management.

We also could have our intellectual property infringed. We
    attempt to protect and restrict access to our intellectual
    property and proprietary information, by relying on the patent,
    trademark, copyright and trade secret laws of the U.S. and
    other countries, as well as on nondisclosure agreements, but it
    may be possible for a third party to obtain our information
    without our authorization, to independently develop similar
    technologies, or to breach non-disclosure agreement entered into
    with us. In addition, many of the countries in which we operate
    do not have intellectual property laws that protect proprietary
    rights as fully as in the U.S. The use of our intellectual
    property by someone else without our authorization could reduce
    or eliminate certain competitive advantage we have, cause us



to lose sales, or otherwise harm our business. Further, the
    costs involved to protect our intellectual property rights could
    adversely impact our profitability.

We have obtained and applied for some U.S. and foreign
    trademark registrations and patents, and will continue to
    evaluate whether to register additional trademarks and seek
    patents as appropriate. We cannot guarantee that any of the
    pending applications will be approved by the applicable
    government authorities. Further, we cannot assure that the
    validity of our patents or our trademarks will not be
    challenged. In addition, third parties might be able to develop
    competing products using technology that avoids our patents.

The
    amount of various taxes we pay is subject to ongoing compliance
    requirements and audits by federal, state and foreign tax
    authorities.

Our estimate of the potential outcome of uncertain tax issues is
    subject to our assessment of relevant risks, facts, and
    circumstances existing at that time. We use these assessments to
    determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and
    other tax-related accounts. Our future results may include
    favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax
    liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved,
    which may impact our effective tax rate

and/or

our
    financial results. We are in the process of reviewing
    Paxar’s compliance with such requirements.

We have
    deferred tax assets that we may not be able to use under certain
    circumstances.

If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in
    certain jurisdictions, or if there is a significant change in
    the time period within which the underlying temporary
    differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required
    to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax
    assets. This would result in an increase in our effective tax
    rate, and an adverse effect on our future operating results. In
    addition, changes in statutory tax rates may also change our
    deferred tax assets or liability balances, with either favorable
    or unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate. Our deferred
    tax assets may also be impacted by new legislation or regulation.

The level
    of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets and the
    actuarial assumptions used for valuation purposes could affect
    our earnings in future periods. Changes in accounting standards
    and government regulations could also affect our pension and
    postretirement plan expense and funding requirements.

Assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations
    and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plan and other
    postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by us in consultation
    with outside actuaries. In the event that we determine that
    changes are warranted in the assumptions used, such as the
    discount rate, expected long term rate of return, or health care
    costs, our future pension and projected postretirement benefit
    expenses could increase or decrease. Due to changing market
    conditions or changes in the participant population, the
    actuarial assumptions that we use may differ from actual
    results, which could have a significant impact on our pension
    and postretirement liability and related costs. Funding
    obligations are determined based on the value of assets and
    liabilities on a specific date as required under relevant
    government regulations for each plan. Future pension funding
    requirements, and the timing of funding payments, could be
    affected by legislation enacted by the relevant governmental
    authorities.

In order
    for us to remain competitive, it is important to recruit and
    retain highly-skilled employees. We also utilize various
    outsourcing arrangements for certain services.

There is significant competition to recruit and retain skilled
    employees. Due to rapid expansion in certain markets and the
    ongoing productivity efforts and recent employee reductions, it
    may be difficult for us to retain and recruit sufficient numbers
    of highly-skilled employees. We have outsourced certain services
    to multiple third-party service providers, and may outsource
    other services in the future to achieve cost savings and
    efficiencies. Service provider delays, resource availability,
    business issues or errors may lead to disruption in our
    businesses

and/or

increased costs. If we do not effectively develop, implement and
    manage outsourcing strategies, third-party providers do not
    perform effectively and timely, or we experience problems with a
    transition, we may experience disruption in our businesses, we
    may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings, and we may
    have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such
    service providers.



We need
    to comply with many environmental, health, and safety
    laws.

Due to the nature of our business, we are subject to
    environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations,
    including those related to the disposal of hazardous waste from
    our manufacturing processes. Compliance with existing and future
    environmental, health and safety laws could subject us to future
    costs or liabilities; impact our production capabilities;
    constrict our ability to sell, expand or acquire facilities; and
    generally impact our financial performance. We have accrued
    liabilities for environmental

clean-up

sites, including sites for which governmental agencies have
    designated us as a potentially responsible party, where it is
    probable that a loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of
    loss can be reasonably estimated. We are in the process of
    reviewing the environmental matters related to Paxar. However,
    because of the uncertainties associated with environmental
    assessment and remediation activities, future expense to
    remediate currently identified sites and other sites, which
    could be identified in the future for cleanup, could be higher
    than the liability currently accrued.

In order
    to mitigate risk, it is important that we obtain various types
    of insurance.

We have various types of insurance including property, workers
    compensation and general liability. Insurance costs can be
    unpredictable and may adversely impact our financial results.

Significant
    disruption to our information technology infrastructure could
    adversely impact our operations, sales, customer relations, and
    financial results.

We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of a large
    and complex information technology infrastructure to link our
    worldwide divisions. Like other information technology systems,
    ours is susceptible to damage or interruptions caused by
    obsolescence, natural disasters, power failures, viruses and
    security breaches. We upgrade and install new systems, which if
    installed or programmed incorrectly or if installation is
    delayed, could cause significant disruptions. We have
    implemented certain measures to reduce our risk related to
    system and network disruptions, but if a disruption occurs, we
    could incur losses and costs for remediation and interruption of
    operations. Additionally, we rely on services provided by
    third-party vendors for a significant portion of our information
    technology support, development and implementation.

Our share
    price may be volatile.

Our stock price is influenced by changes in the overall stock
    market and demand for equity securities in general. Other
    factors, including market expectations for our performance, the
    level of perceived growth of our industries, and announcements
    concerning industry investigations, have also impacted our share
    price. There can be no assurance that our stock price will be
    less volatile in the future.

If our
    credit ratings are downgraded, we may have difficulty obtaining
    acceptable short- and long-term financing from capital
    markets.

Credit ratings are a significant factor in our ability to raise
    short-term and long-term financing. The credit ratings assigned
    to us also impact the interest rates on our commercial paper and
    other borrowings. If our credit ratings were further downgraded,
    our financial flexibility could decrease and the cost to borrow
    would increase.

Our
    reputation, sales, and earnings could be affected adversely if
    the quality of our products and services does not meet customer
    expectations.

There are occasions when we manufacture products with quality
    issues resulting from defective materials, manufacturing,
    packaging or design. Many of these issues are discovered before
    shipping but this causes delays in shipping, delays in the
    manufacturing process, and occasionally cancelled orders. When
    the issues are discovered after shipment, this causes additional
    shipping costs, possible discounts, possible refunds, and
    potential loss of future sales. Both pre-shipping and
    post-shipping quality issues can result in financial
    consequences along with a negative impact on our reputation.



Some of
    our products are sold by third parties.

Our products are not only sold by us, but by third party
    distributors and retailers as well. Some of our distributors
    also market products that compete with our products. Changes in
    the financial or business condition or purchasing decisions of
    these third parties or their customers could affect our sales
    and profitability.

We
    outsource some of our manufacturing. If there are significant
    changes in the quality control or financial or business
    condition of these outsourced manufacturers, our business could
    be negatively impacted.

We manufacture most of our products, but we also use third-party
    manufacturers, for example, for specialty jobs or capacity
    overflow. Outsourced manufacturers reduce our ability to prevent
    product quality issues, late deliveries, customer
    dissatisfaction and compliance with customer requirements for
    labor standards. Because of possible quality issues and customer
    dissatisfaction, outsourced manufacturers could have an adverse
    effect on our business and financial results.

The risks described above are not exclusive. Additional risks
    not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be
    less significant may also have an adverse effect on us. If any
    of the above risks actually occur, our business, results of
    operations, cash flows or financial condition could suffer,
    which might cause the value of our securities to decline.

Item 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

The Company has been designated by the U.S. Environmental
    Protection Agency (“EPA”)

and/or

other
    responsible state agencies as a potentially responsible party
    (“PRP”) at eighteen waste disposal or waste recycling
    sites, including Paxar sites, which are the subject of separate
    investigations or proceedings concerning alleged soil

and/or

groundwater contamination and for which no settlement of the
    Company’s liability has been agreed. The Company is
    participating with other PRPs at such sites, and anticipates
    that its share of cleanup costs will be determined pursuant to
    remedial agreements entered into in the normal course of
    negotiations with the EPA or other governmental authorities.

The Company has accrued liabilities for these and certain other
    sites, including sites in which governmental agencies have
    designated the Company as a PRP, where it is probable that a
    loss will be incurred and the cost or amount of loss can be
    reasonably estimated. However, because of the uncertainties
    associated with environmental assessment and remediation
    activities, future expense to remediate the currently identified
    sites and any sites which could be identified in the future for
    cleanup could be higher than the liability currently accrued.

As of December 29, 2007, the Company’s estimated
    liability associated with compliance and remediation costs was
    approximately $38 million, including preliminary
    liabilities related to the acquisition of Paxar. See also
    Note 2, “Acquisitions,” in the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 50 of
    the Company’s 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is
    incorporated herein by reference.

During 2006, the Company recognized $15 million for
    estimated environmental remediation costs for a former operating
    facility. Of the amount accrued, which represented the lower end
    of the current estimated range of $15 million to
    $17 million for costs expected to be incurred,
    approximately $9 million remained accrued as of
    December 29, 2007. Management considered additional
    information provided by outside consultants in revising its
    previous estimates of expected costs. This estimate could change
    depending on various factors, such as modification of currently
    planned remedial actions, changes in the site conditions, a
    change in the estimated time to complete remediation, changes in
    laws and regulations affecting remediation requirements and
    other factors.

Other amounts currently accrued are not significant to the
    consolidated financial position of the Company and, based upon
    current information, management believes it is unlikely that the
    final resolution of these matters will significantly impact the
    Company’s consolidated financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

In April 2003, the U.S. Department of Justice
    (“DOJ”) filed a complaint challenging the then
    proposed merger UPM-Kymmene (“UPM”) and the Morgan
    Adhesives (“MACtac”) division of Bemis Co., Inc.
    (“Bemis”). The complaint alleged, among other things,
    that “UPM and [Avery Dennison] have already attempted to
    limit competition between themselves, as reflected in written
    and oral communications to each other through high level
    executives regarding explicit anticompetitive understandings,
    although the extent to which these efforts have succeeded is not
    entirely clear to the United States at the present time.”
    The DOJ concurrently announced a criminal investigation into
    competitive practices in the label stock industry. Other
    investigations into competitive practices in the label stock
    industry were subsequently initiated by the European Commission,
    the Competition Law Division of the Department of Justice of
    Canada, and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.
    The Company cooperated with all of these investigations, and
    all, except the Australian investigation which is continuing,
    have subsequently been terminated without further action by the
    authorities.

On April 24, 2003, Sentry Business Products, Inc. filed a
    purported class action on behalf of direct purchasers of label
    stock in the United States District Court for the Northern
    District of Illinois against the Company, UPM, Bemis and certain
    of their subsidiaries seeking treble damages and other relief
    for alleged unlawful competitive



practices, essentially repeating the underlying allegations of
    the DOJ merger complaint. Ten similar complaints were filed in
    various federal district courts. In November 2003, the cases
    were transferred to the United States District Court for the
    Middle District of Pennsylvania and consolidated for pretrial
    purposes. Plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint on
    February 16, 2004, which the Company answered on
    March 31, 2004. On April 14, 2004, the court separated
    the proceedings as to class certification and merits discovery,
    and limited the initial phase of discovery to the issue of the
    appropriateness of class certification. On January 4, 2006,
    plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. On January 20, 2006,
    the Company filed an answer to the amended complaint. On
    August 14, 2006, the plaintiffs moved to certify a proposed
    class. The Company and other defendants opposed this motion. On
    March 1, 2007, the court heard oral argument on the issue
    of the appropriateness of class certification. On
    August 28, 2007, plaintiffs moved to lift the discovery
    stay, which the Company opposed. On November 19, 2007, the
    court certified a class consisting of all direct purchasers of
    paper-based label stock from the defendants during the period
    from January 1, 1996 to July 25, 2003. The Company
    filed a petition to appeal this decision on December 4,
    2007. The Company’s petition is still pending. The Company
    intends to defend these matters vigorously.

On May 21, 2003, The Harman Press filed in the Superior
    Court for the County of Los Angeles, California, a purported
    class action on behalf of indirect purchasers of label stock
    against the Company, UPM and UPM’s subsidiary Raflatac
    (“Raflatac”), seeking treble damages and other relief
    for alleged unlawful competitive practices, essentially
    repeating the underlying allegations of the DOJ merger
    complaint. Three similar complaints were filed in various
    California courts. In November 2003, on petition from the
    parties, the California Judicial Council ordered the cases be
    coordinated for pretrial purposes. The cases were assigned to a
    coordination trial judge in the Superior Court for the City and
    County of San Francisco on March 30, 2004. On
    January 21, 2005, American International Distribution
    Corporation filed a purported class action on behalf of indirect
    purchasers in the Superior Court for Chittenden County, Vermont.
    Similar actions were filed by Richard Wrobel, on
    February 16, 2005, in the District Court of Johnson County,
    Kansas; and by Chad and Terry Muzzey, on February 16, 2005
    in the District Court of Scotts Bluff County, Nebraska. On
    February 17, 2005, Judy Benson filed a purported
    multi-state class action on behalf of indirect purchasers in the
    Circuit Court for Cocke County, Tennessee. These cases remain
    stayed pending the outcome of class certification proceedings in
    the federal actions. The Company intends to defend these matters
    vigorously.

The Board of Directors created an ad hoc committee comprised of
    independent directors to oversee the foregoing matters.

The Company is unable to predict the effect of these matters at
    this time, although the effect could be adverse and material.

In 2005, the Company contacted relevant authorities in the
    U.S. and reported on the results of an internal
    investigation of potential violations of the U.S. Foreign
    Corrupt Practices Act. The transactions at issue were carried
    out by a small number of employees of the Company’s
    reflective business in China, and involved, among other things,
    impermissible payments or attempted impermissible payments. The
    payments or attempted payments and the contracts associated with
    them appear to have been relatively minor in amount and of
    limited duration. Corrective and disciplinary actions have been
    taken. Sales of the Company’s reflective business in China
    in 2005 were approximately $7 million. Based on findings to
    date, no changes to the Company’s previously filed
    financial statements are warranted as a result of these matters.
    However, the Company expects that fines or other penalties could
    be incurred. While the Company is unable to predict the
    financial or operating impact of any such fines or penalties, it
    believes that its behavior in detecting, investigating,
    responding to and voluntarily disclosing these matters to
    authorities should be viewed favorably.

The Company and its subsidiaries are involved in various other
    lawsuits, claims and inquiries, most of which are routine to the
    nature of the business. Based upon current information,
    management believes that the resolution of these other matters
    will not materially affect the Company’s financial position.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
    CONDITION

ORGANIZATION
    OF INFORMATION

Management’s Discussion and Analysis provides a narrative
    concerning our financial performance and condition that should
    be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial
    statements. It includes the following sections:

•   Definition of Terms


•   Overview and Outlook


•   Analysis of Results of Operations


•   Results of Operations by Segment


•   Financial Condition


•   Uses and Limitations of
    Non-GAAP Measures


•   Related Party Transactions


•   Critical Accounting Policies and
    Estimates


•   Recent Accounting Requirements


•   Safe Harbor Statement


DEFINITION
    OF TERMS

Our discussion of financial results includes several non-GAAP
    measures to provide additional information concerning Avery
    Dennison Corporation’s (the “Company’s”)
    performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in
    accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP financial
    measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to
    supplement the presentation of our financial results, prepared
    in accordance with GAAP. Refer to “Uses and Limitations of
    Non-GAAP Measures.”

We use the following terms:

•

Organic sales growth

refers to the change in sales
    excluding the estimated impact of currency translation,
    acquisitions and divestitures;

•

Segment operating income

refers to income before interest
    and taxes;

•

Free cash flow

refers to cash flow from operations, less
    payments for capital expenditures, software and other deferred
    charges; and

•

Operational working capital

refers to trade accounts
    receivable and inventories, net of accounts payable.

Change in
    Accounting Method

Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2007, we changed our method
    of accounting for inventories for our U.S. operations from
    a combination of the use of the first-in, first-out
    (“FIFO”) and the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”)
    methods to the FIFO method. The inventories for our
    international operations continue to be valued using the FIFO
    method. We believe the change is preferable as the FIFO method
    better reflects the current value of inventories on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet; provides better matching of revenue
    and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income; provides
    uniformity across our operations with respect to the method for
    inventory accounting; and enhances comparability with peers.
    Furthermore, this application of the FIFO method will be
    consistent with our accounting of inventories for
    U.S. income tax purposes.



As a result of the accounting change discussed above and the
    sale of our raised reflective pavement marker business during
    2006 (discussed below in “Divestitures”), the
    discussions which follow reflect our restated results for the
    accounting change, as well as summary results from our
    continuing operations unless otherwise noted. However, the net
    income and net income per share discussions include the impact
    of discontinued operations.

OVERVIEW
    AND OUTLOOK

Overview

Sales

Our sales from continuing operations increased 13% in 2007
    compared to growth of 2% in 2006, driven primarily by the
    acquisition of Paxar Corporation (“Paxar”) and
    currency translation. Due to the diverse mix of our businesses
    and the expansion of our Retail Information Services segment,
    the allocation of organic sales growth into its components of
    volume growth and price and mix have become less useful in our
    analysis. We will continue to provide this information for those
    segments where it is useful.

Organic sales growth of 1% in 2007 and 3% in 2006 reflected
    increases in most of our businesses outside of the U.S.,
    particularly in the emerging markets of Asia, Eastern Europe and
    Latin America. Organic sales growth (or decline) by our major

Outside of the U.S., sales increased on an organic basis by 4%
    and 5% in 2007 and 2006, respectively, due to market expansion
    and share gain in certain businesses.

In the U.S., sales on an organic basis declined 4% in 2007 due
    primarily to the slowdown in the U.S. retail environment,
    particularly in our Retail Information Services and Office and
    Consumer Products segments, as retailers lowered inventories in
    the face of slowing consumer demand. Our roll materials
    businesses in North America and Europe also experienced soft
    market conditions, especially in the second half of the year.
    These conditions, combined with capacity and demand imbalances,
    impacted pricing in these markets as well.

In 2006, U.S. sales were approximately even with 2005. The
    North American roll materials business was weak due to market
    share loss (related to price increases implemented in 2005 and
    early 2006, to offset higher raw material costs), as well as
    generally slow market conditions. The benefit from growth of
    Avery-brand products and a strong back-to-school season in our
    Office and Consumer Products segment in the U.S. was offset
    by the loss of sales from exiting certain low-margin private
    label business in that segment.

Net
    Income

Net income decreased $70 million in 2007 compared to 2006.

Negative factors affecting net income included:

•

Higher interest expense and amortization of intangibles related
    to the Paxar acquisition



•

Transition costs related to the integration of Paxar operations
    and other restructuring actions

•

Higher asset impairment and restructuring charges (including
    acquisition-related charges)

•

More competitive pricing environment and unfavorable product mix
    in the roll materials business

•

Higher raw material costs

•

Higher effective tax rate

Positive factors affecting net income included:

•

Higher sales, including sales from the Paxar acquisition, and a
    benefit from foreign currency translation

•

Cost savings from productivity improvement initiatives,
    including savings from restructuring actions

Acquisitions

On June 15, 2007, we completed the acquisition of Paxar
    Corporation (“Paxar”), a global leader in retail tag,
    ticketing, and branding systems. The combination of the Paxar
    business into our Retail Information Services segment increases
    our presence in the expanding and fragmented retail information
    and brand identification market, combines complementary
    strengths and broadens the range of our product and service
    capabilities, improves our ability to meet customer demands for
    product innovation and improved quality of service, and
    facilitates expansion into new product and geographic segments.
    The integration of this acquisition into our operations is also
    expected to result in significant cost synergies. Refer to the
    “Outlook” section herein for further information.

See Note 2, “Acquisitions,” to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for further information.

Divestitures

In December 2005, we announced our plan to sell our raised
    reflective pavement marker business, which had sales of
    approximately $23 million in 2005. The divestiture of this
    business was completed during the second quarter of 2006 and
    resulted in a tax benefit due to capital losses arising from the
    sale of the business. The results of this business have been
    accounted for as discontinued operations for the years presented
    herein. This business was previously included in the
    Pressure-sensitive Materials segment.

In December 2005, we also announced the divestiture of two
    product lines. These divestitures were completed in the first
    quarter of 2006. The first product line, which was included in
    the Office and Consumer Products segment, had estimated sales of
    $60 million in 2005, with minimal impact to income from
    operations. The second product line, which was included in other
    specialty converting businesses, had annual sales of
    approximately $10 million in 2005, with minimal impact to
    income from operations. As part of these divestitures, in 2005,
    we recorded severance and other employee-related charges of
    approximately $6 million and asset impairments of
    approximately $9 million. These charges were included in
    the “Other Expense, net” line of our Consolidated
    Statement of Income. Refer to Note 10, “Cost Reduction
    Actions,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    further detail.

From late 2006 through the end of 2007, we initiated new cost
    reduction actions that are expected to yield annualized pretax
    savings of $45 million to $50 million, in addition to
    cost synergies from the integration of Paxar discussed below. In
    2007, savings from these actions, net of transition costs, were
    approximately $5 million.



Incremental savings in 2008 associated with these actions are
    expected to be approximately $30 million, with the balance
    expected to be realized in 2009. These restructuring actions
    result in headcount reductions of approximately 555 positions,
    impacting all of our segments and geographic regions.

During 2007 and 2006, we realized annualized pretax savings (net
    of transition costs) of over $90 million, resulting from
    restructuring actions initiated in the fourth quarter of 2005.
    These restructuring actions resulted in headcount reductions of
    approximately 1,150 positions, which impacted all of our
    segments and geographic regions and were completed in 2006.

In 2005, we also incurred charges related to the planned
    divestitures of several low-margin businesses and product lines,
    as discussed in the “Divestitures” section.

Refer to Note 10, “Cost Reduction Actions,” to

In 2007, cost synergies resulting from the integration of Paxar
    were approximately $20 million. Incremental cost synergies
    expected to be achieved through 2010 are discussed in the
    “Outlook” section below. These integration actions
    result in headcount reductions of approximately 1,055 positions
    in our Retail Information Services segment.

Refer to Note 2, “Acquisitions” and Note 10,
    “Cost Reduction Actions,” to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for further detail.

Effective
    Rate of Taxes on Income

The effective tax rate was 19.1% for the full year 2007 compared
    with 17.6% for the full year 2006.

Unlike 2007, our effective tax rate for 2006 benefited from the
    following events:

•

Several favorable tax audit settlements in various jurisdictions
    and the closure of certain tax years

•

Release of certain valuation allowances



Free
    Cash Flow

Free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure, refers to cash flow
    from operating activities less spending on property, plant,
    equipment, software and other deferred charges. We use free cash
    flow as a measure of funds available for other corporate
    purposes, such as dividends, debt reduction, acquisitions, and
    repurchases of common stock. Management believes that this
    measure provides meaningful supplemental information to our
    investors to assist them in their financial analysis of the
    Company. Management believes that it is appropriate to measure
    cash after spending on property, plant, and equipment, software
    and other deferred charges because such spending is considered
    integral to maintaining or expanding our underlying business.
    This measure is not intended to represent the residual cash
    available for discretionary purposes. Refer to “Uses and
    Limitations of Non-GAAP Measures” section for further
    information regarding limitations of this measure.

    compared to 2006. See “Analysis of Results of
    Operations” and the Liquidity section of “Financial
    Condition” below for more information.

Investigations
    and Legal Proceedings

We previously announced that we had been notified by the
    European Commission, the United States Department of Justice
    (“DOJ”), the Competition Law Department of the
    Department of Justice of Canada and the Australian Competition
    and Consumer Commission of their respective criminal
    investigations into competitive practices in the label stock
    industry. We cooperated with all of these investigations, and
    all, except the Australian investigation which is continuing,
    have been terminated without further action by the authorities.

We are a named defendant in purported class actions in the
    U.S. seeking treble damages and other relief for alleged
    unlawful competitive practices, which were filed after the
    announcement of the DOJ investigation.

We have discovered instances of conduct by certain employees in
    China that potentially violate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
    Practices Act. We have reported that conduct to authorities in
    the U.S. and we believe it is possible that fines or other
    penalties may be incurred.

We are unable to predict the effect of these matters at this
    time, although the effect could be adverse and material. These
    and other matters are reported in Note 8,
    “Contingencies,” to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Outlook

In 2008, we anticipate a high single-digit to low double-digit
    rate of revenue growth, including both the benefit from the
    Paxar acquisition (approximately 6.5% benefit) and a modest
    benefit from foreign currency translation based on year end
    exchange rates. Our revenue assumptions are subject to changes
    in economic and market conditions.

We estimate that the total annual cost synergies associated with
    the Paxar integration to be in the range of $115 million to
    $125 million, with an estimated $60 million to
    $70 million of these cost synergies expected to represent
    incremental savings during 2008. To accomplish our synergy
    target, we will incur pretax cash costs estimated to be in the
    range of $165 million to $180 million. Approximately
    $75 million of these costs were incurred in 2007, and we
    estimate approximately $60 million to $70 million will
    be incurred in 2008.

We anticipate continued benefit from our ongoing productivity
    improvement initiatives. In addition to the synergies resulting
    from the Paxar integration described above, we anticipate our
    restructuring and business realignment efforts to yield
    incremental savings in 2008 of an estimated $30 million,
    net of transition costs. We



assume the benefits from these and other productivity
    initiatives will be partially offset by approximately 2%
    inflation of raw material costs (approximately $50 million
    to $55 million) based on current commodity pricing trends,
    as well as higher costs associated with general inflation and
    investments for growth during 2008.

We anticipate price increases in 2008 to at least partially
    offset raw material inflation.

We estimate interest expense to be in the range of
    $125 million to $135 million, approximately
    $20 million to $30 million higher than 2007, driven by
    acquisition-related debt. Our estimate is subject to changes in
    average debt outstanding and changes in market rates associated
    with the portion of our debt tied to variable interest rates.

We anticipate total restructuring and asset impairment charges
    in 2008 to be lower than the charges taken in 2007.

The annual effective tax rate will be impacted by future events
    including changes in tax laws, geographic income mix, tax
    audits, closure of tax years, legal entity restructuring, and
    the release of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. The
    effective tax rate can potentially have wide variances from
    quarter to quarter, resulting from interim reporting
    requirements and the recognition of discrete events.

We anticipate our capital and software expenditures before Paxar
    integration-related activities to be approximately
    $195 million in 2008. Capital and software expenditures
    related to the Paxar integration are expected to total
    $40 million to $45 million, of which approximately
    $25 million to $30 million is expected to be incurred
    during 2008. These costs are included in the total one-time cash
    cost estimate for the integration, discussed above.

Reflecting the foregoing assumptions, we expect an increase in
    annual earnings and free cash flow in comparison with 2007.

In 2006, we reclassified shipping and handling costs from
    “Marketing, general and administrative expense” to
    “Cost of products sold” to align our businesses around
    a standard accounting policy. Previous results included herein
    have been reclassified for comparability to the current year.

Sales

Sales increased 13% in 2007 compared to an increase of 2% in
    2006. The benefit of the Paxar acquisition, net of product line
    divestitures, increased sales by an estimated $500 million
    in 2007. Product line divestitures, net of incremental sales
    from acquisitions, reduced sales by approximately
    $54 million in 2006.

Foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on the
    change in sales of approximately $232 million in 2007
    compared to approximately $21 million in 2006.



Organic sales growth was approximately 1% in 2007 compared to
    approximately 3% in 2006. Organic sales growth in 2007 reflected
    growth in our Pressure-sensitive Materials segment and other
    specialty converting businesses, driven by expansion of
    international markets. This international growth was partially
    offset by slower and more competitive market conditions in our
    North American roll materials business (where unit volume growth
    was more than offset by negative price and mix). The organic
    sales growth in Pressure-sensitive Materials and other specialty
    converting businesses was offset by a decline in our Office and
    Consumer Products segment, due primarily to customer inventory
    reductions. Our Retail Information Services segment experienced
    organic sales growth of 1% in 2007, reflecting increased sales
    for the European retail market, partially offset by a decline in
    orders related to apparel shipped to North American retailers
    and brand owners.

On an organic basis, sales in the U.S. were approximately
    even in 2006, compared to a decrease of approximately 3% in
    2005. The North American roll materials business was impacted by
    slow market conditions and share loss resulting from price
    increases. The benefit from growth of Avery-brand products and a
    strong back-to-school season in our Office and Consumer Products
    segment in the U.S. was offset by the loss of sales from
    exiting certain low-margin private label business (approximate
    impact of $22 million) in that segment.

Refer to “Results of Operations by Segment” for
    further information on segments.

Gross
    Profit

Gross profit margin in 2007 decreased due to price competition
    and unfavorable product mix in the roll materials business and
    higher raw material costs. The negative effect of these factors
    was partially offset by the addition of the higher gross profit
    margin Paxar business, as well as benefits from our ongoing
    productivity improvement and cost reduction actions.

In 2006, the benefits of productivity improvement and cost
    reduction actions were partially offset by:

•

Unfavorable segment mix (faster growth in segments with lower
    gross profit margin as a percent of sales)

•

Energy-related cost inflation

•

Transition costs associated with restructuring

Marketing,
    General and Administrative Expenses

Marketing, general and administrative expense in 2007 increased
    from 2006, as savings from restructuring actions and other cost
    reductions were more than offset by:

•

Costs associated with the Paxar business and related integration
    expense (totaling approximately $185 million, including
    $40 million in integration-related transition costs and
    $12 million in amortization of intangibles)

•

The impact of foreign currency translation (approximately
    $30 million).

Marketing, general and administrative expense in 2006 increased
    from 2005, as the benefits from productivity improvement
    initiatives and cost reduction actions were more than offset by:

•

Recognition of stock option expense (approximately
    $21 million)

•

Increased spending on information systems and marketing
    (approximately $19 million)

•

Increase in pension, medical and other employee-related costs
    (approximately $12 million)

Interest
    Expense

Interest expense increased 90%, or approximately
    $50 million, in 2007 compared to 2006, due to an increase
    in borrowings to fund the Paxar acquisition, as well as an
    increase in interest rates.

    benefit of $8.1 million in 2006.

Income

Income (loss) from discontinued operations includes the
    divestiture of our raised reflective pavement markers business
    as noted in the Overview section above. The divestiture of this
    business was completed during 2006 and resulted in a tax benefit
    ($14.9 million) due to capital losses arising from the sale
    of the business and a gain on sale of $1.3 million.

Based on our estimated value of the raised reflective pavement
    markers business in 2005, we concluded that associated goodwill
    and intangible assets from our acquisition of this business were
    impaired. The resulting pretax impairment charge was
    approximately $74 million in 2005.

Income from discontinued operations included net sales of
    approximately $7 million in 2006, and $23 million in
    2005.

    “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

Net
    Sales

Sales in our Pressure-sensitive Materials segment increased 8%
    in 2007 compared to 4% growth in 2006. Organic sales growth in
    both 2007 and 2006 was approximately 3%.

Organic sales growth for 2007 and 2006 reflected growth in our
    roll materials and graphics and reflective businesses in Asia,
    Latin America and Europe, partially offset by declines in our
    North American roll materials businesses. For both years, market
    expansion in our roll materials business contributed to
    double-digit organic sales growth in Asia and mid single-digit
    organic sales growth in Latin America.

In both 2007 and 2006, our roll materials business in Europe
    experienced low single-digit organic sales growth.

In our North American roll materials business, 2007 sales on an
    organic basis declined at a low single-digit rate, while 2006
    sales were even with the prior year. Slow market conditions
    impacted both years. In 2007, a more competitive environment due
    in part to capacity additions in the industry led to price
    reductions to maintain market share. In 2006, the loss of market
    share following our implementation of selling price increases in
    2005 and early 2006 contributed to a decline in this business.

Our graphics and reflective business experienced mid
    single-digit organic sales growth in both 2007 and 2006, as
    strong international growth was partially offset by declines in
    the U.S.

The changes in reported sales for this segment included a
    favorable impact of foreign currency translation of
    approximately $174 million in 2007 and approximately
    $15 million in 2006.



Operating
    Income

Increased operating income in 2007 and 2006 reflected higher
    sales and cost savings from restructuring and productivity
    improvement initiatives. In 2007, these initiatives were
    partially offset by a more competitive pricing environment and
    unfavorable product mix in the roll materials business, higher
    raw material costs and transition costs related to restructuring
    actions. In 2006, these initiatives were partially offset by
    stock option expense.

Operating income for all three years reflected restructuring and
    asset impairment charges. In 2007, operating income included a
    reversal of a portion of an accrual related to a lawsuit. In
    2006, operating income included a gain on sale of assets, legal
    fees related to a lawsuit, and lease cancellation charges. In
    2005, operating income included an accrual related to a lawsuit,
    net of a gain on sale of assets.

Net
    Sales

Sales in our Retail Information Services segment increased 76%
    in 2007 compared to an increase of 6% in 2006. In 2007, the
    increase reflected an estimated $510 million in sales from
    the Paxar acquisition and the favorable impact of foreign
    currency translation (approximately $17 million). In 2006,
    the increase reflected growth of the business in Asia, Latin
    America and Europe, incremental sales from acquisitions
    (approximately $3 million) and the favorable impact of
    foreign currency translation (approximately $3 million).

Organic sales growth of approximately 1% in 2007 reflected
    increased sales for the European retail market, partially offset
    by a decline in orders related to apparel shipped to North
    American retailers and brand owners. Organic sales growth was 5%
    in 2006.

Operating
    Income

Operating loss in 2007 reflected transition costs and
    integration-related asset impairment charges associated with the
    Paxar acquisition, amortization of acquisition intangibles and
    higher expenses due to investments for growth in Asia, including
    higher employee-related costs. Higher operating costs were
    partially offset by higher sales and savings from restructuring
    and productivity initiatives.

In 2006, operating income benefited from productivity
    improvement actions, including the migration of production from
    Hong Kong to lower cost facilities in mainland China. Benefits
    from productivity initiatives were offset by increased spending
    for information systems, stock option expense and other
    incremental employee-related costs in 2006.

Operating income included integration-related software
    impairment charges in 2007. Restructuring costs, asset
    impairment and lease cancellation charges were incurred in all
    three years.

Net
    Sales

Sales in our Office and Consumer Products segment decreased 5%
    in 2007 and 6% in 2006. The decline in reported sales in 2007
    reflected lower sales on an organic basis, as well as the impact
    of product line divestitures (approximately $9 million).
    The decline in reported sales in 2006 reflected the impact of a
    product line divestiture in Europe (approximately
    $51 million). Foreign currency translation had a favorable
    impact on the change in reported sales of approximately
    $25 million in 2007 and $1 million in 2006.

On an organic basis, sales declined approximately 7% in 2007.
    The decline reflected customer inventory reductions resulting in
    part from a volume shift to the fourth quarter of 2006 in
    advance of January 2007 selling price increases for certain
    product lines, the loss of sales from exiting certain low margin
    business, and a weaker back-to-school season compared to the
    prior year.

In 2006, sales on an organic basis declined 1%, reflecting the
    loss of sales from exiting certain low-margin private label
    business at the end of 2005 (approximately $22 million),
    partially offset by growth in Avery-brand products, a strong
    back-to-school season in North America, and accelerated
    purchases by customers in late 2006 in advance of our 2007
    selling price increases for certain product lines.

Operating
    Income

Operating income in 2007 reflected lower sales, restructuring
    charges and related transition costs, and higher raw material
    costs, partially offset by savings from restructuring actions
    and productivity initiatives.

Operating income in 2006 reflected cost savings from
    productivity improvement and restructuring actions, partially
    offset by associated transition costs, higher raw material and
    energy-related costs, increased marketing costs and stock option
    expense.

Operating income in 2007 included lease cancellation costs and
    expense related to a divestiture. In 2006, operating income
    included a gain from sale of assets, a gain from curtailment and
    settlement of a pension obligation, and a net gain from a
    product line divestiture. Asset impairment charges were incurred
    in both 2005 and 2006, while restructuring costs were incurred
    in all three years.

Net
    Sales

Sales in our other specialty converting businesses increased 3%
    in 2007 and 1% in 2006. In 2007, the increase reflected the
    favorable impact of foreign currency translation (approximately
    $16 million), partially offset by the impact of a product
    line divestiture, net of a small acquisition (approximately
    $2 million). In 2006, a product line divestiture reduced
    reported sales by approximately $7 million, while foreign
    currency translation had a favorable impact on the change in
    sales of approximately $1 million.

Organic sales growth of approximately 1% in 2007 included the
    negative effect of exiting certain low-margin products in our
    specialty tape business (approximately $16 million). The
    loss of these sales was more than offset by solid growth in
    other parts of the specialty tape business, as well as growth of
    the RFID division. Organic sales growth of approximately 2% in
    2006 reflected solid growth in our specialty tape business,
    partially offset by weakness in other businesses.

Operating
    Income

Operating income for these businesses increased in 2007,
    reflecting higher sales, savings from restructuring and
    productivity initiatives, and a reduction in operating loss from
    the RFID division.

Operating income for these businesses increased in 2006,
    reflecting cost savings from restructuring and productivity
    improvement initiatives, partially offset by stock option
    expense.

Operating income for all years included restructuring and asset
    impairment charges.

Payments
    for acquisitions

On June 15, 2007, we completed the acquisition of Paxar. In
    accordance with the terms of the acquisition agreement, each
    outstanding share of Paxar common stock, par value $0.10 was
    converted into the right to receive $30.50 in cash. The total
    purchase price for this transaction was approximately
    $1.3 billion, including transaction costs of approximately
    $15 million. Cash paid for acquisitions is reported net of
    cash acquired of approximately $47 million. Funds to
    complete the acquisition were initially derived from commercial
    paper borrowings, supported by a bridge revolving credit
    facility. Refer to Note 2, “Acquisitions,” to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Payments for acquisitions during 2007 also include buy-outs of
    minority interest shareholders associated with certain
    subsidiaries of RVL Packaging, Inc. and Paxar of approximately
    $4 million.

Capital
    Spending

Significant capital projects in 2007 included investments for
    expansion in China and India serving both our materials and
    retail information services businesses. Significant information
    technology projects in 2007 included customer service and
    standardization initiatives.



Proceeds
    from Sale of Businesses and Investments

In 2006, we sold a long-term investment (proceeds of
    approximately $16 million), divested our raised reflective
    pavement marker business in the U.S. (proceeds of
    approximately $9 million), and divested a product line in
    Europe (proceeds of approximately $4 million).

Borrowings
    and Repayment of Debt

At year end 2007, our borrowings outstanding under foreign
    short-term lines of credit were $70.1 million
    (weighted-average interest rate of 10.6%), compared to
    $101.5 million at year end 2006 (weighted-average interest
    rate of 9.6%).

Short-term variable rate commercial paper borrowings were
    $990.2 million at December 29, 2007 (weighted-average
    interest rate of 5.2%) compared to $154.4 million at
    December 30, 2006 (weighted-average interest rate of 5.0%).
    During 2007, we increased our short-term borrowings to initially
    fund the Paxar acquisition, as noted above in “

Payments
    for acquisitions,

” as well as to support share
    repurchases. The change in outstanding commercial paper also
    reflects positive cash flow from operations.

We had medium-term notes of $100 million outstanding at
    year end 2007, compared to $160 million at year end 2006.
    In 2007, medium-term notes of $60 million were paid on
    maturity. Outstanding medium-term notes have maturities from
    2008 through 2025 and accrue interest at fixed rates ranging
    from 5.9% to 7.6%.

In September 2007, one of our subsidiaries issued
    $250 million

10-year

senior notes, which we guaranteed, bearing interest at a rate of
    6.625% per year, due October 2017. The net proceeds from the
    offering were approximately $247 million and were used to
    pay down current long-term debt maturities of $150 million
    and reduce commercial paper borrowings of $97 million
    initially used to finance the Paxar acquisition.

In November 2007, we issued $400 million of 7.875%
    Corporate HiMEDS units, a mandatory convertible debt issue. An
    additional $40 million of HiMEDS units were issued in
    December 2007 as a result of the exercise of the overallotment
    allocation from the initial issuance. Each HiMEDS unit is
    comprised of two components — a purchase contract
    obligating the holder to purchase from us a certain number of
    shares in 2010 ranging from approximately 6.8 million to
    approximately 8.6 million shares (depending on the stock
    price at that time) and a senior note due in 2020. The net
    proceeds from the offering were approximately $427 million,
    which were used to reduce commercial paper borrowings initially
    used to finance the Paxar acquisition.

Shareholders’
    Equity

Our shareholders’ equity was approximately
    $1.99 billion at year end 2007, compared to approximately
    $1.70 billion at year end 2006. Our annual dividend per
    share increased to $1.61 in 2007 from $1.57 in 2006.

Share
    Repurchases

On October 26, 2006, the Board of Directors authorized the
    Company to purchase an additional 5 million shares of the
    Company’s stock under our existing stock repurchase
    program, resulting in a total authorization of approximately
    7.4 million shares of the Company’s stock at that
    date. We repurchased approximately .8 million and
    2.5 million shares in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Cash
    payments for these repurchased shares were approximately



$63 million and approximately $158 million in 2007 and
    2006, respectively. Included in the 2007 cash payments were
    approximately $11 million related to shares repurchased in
    2006, but settled in 2007. As of December 29, 2007,
    approximately 4.1 million shares were available for
    repurchase under the Board of Directors’ authorization.

In 2005, we repurchased approximately .7 million shares
    under an agreement related to the L&E Packaging
    (“L&E”) acquisition and recorded such amount to
    treasury stock.

Analysis
    of Selected Balance Sheet Accounts

Long-lived
    Assets

Goodwill increased $967 million during 2007, primarily due
    to our preliminary valuation of goodwill associated with the
    Paxar acquisition completed in June 2007 ($931 million),
    buy-outs of minority interest shareholders ($4 million)
    associated with certain subsidiaries of RVL Packaging, Inc. and
    Paxar, and foreign currency translation ($32 million),
    partially offset by a tax adjustment related to a previous
    acquisition (less than $1 million).

Other intangibles resulting from business acquisitions increased
    approximately $219 million during 2007 due to our
    preliminary valuation of the intangible assets of the Paxar
    acquisition ($234 million), and the impact of foreign
    currency translation ($5 million), partially offset by
    amortization expense ($20 million).

Refer to Note 2, “Acquisitions,” to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Other assets increased approximately $63 million during
    2007 due primarily to purchases of software and other deferred
    charges ($64 million), an increase in the cash surrender
    value of corporate-owned life insurance ($17 million), debt
    issuance costs associated with current year issuances
    ($15 million), increase in long-term pension assets
    ($7 million), increase in other assets ($3 million),
    and the impact of foreign currency translation
    ($6 million), partially offset by normal amortization of
    software and other deferred charges ($31 million), and
    software asset impairments ($18 million).

Other
    Shareholders’ Equity Accounts

The value of our employee stock benefit trust decreased
    $174 million in 2007, due to a decrease in the market value
    of shares held in the trust of approximately $120 million,
    and the issuance of shares under our stock option and incentive
    plans of approximately $54 million.

Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) changed by
    approximately $135 million due to foreign currency
    translation (approximately $106 million), as well as the
    current year amortization and recognition of net pension
    transition obligation, prior service cost and net actuarial loss
    (approximately $29 million).

Impact of
    Foreign Currency Translation:

(In millions)




Change in net sales

$


$


$


Change in net income




In 2007, international operations generated approximately 63% of
    our net sales. Our future results are subject to changes in
    political and economic conditions and the impact of fluctuations
    in foreign currency exchange and interest rates.

The benefit to sales from currency translation in 2007 primarily
    reflected a benefit from sales denominated in Euros, as well as
    sales in the currencies of Great Britain, Australia, Brazil and
    China, partially offset by a negative impact of sales in the
    currencies of South Africa and Hong Kong.

Translation gains and losses for operations in hyperinflationary
    economies are included in net income in the period incurred.
    Operations are treated as being in a hyperinflationary economy
    based on the cumulative inflation rate over the past three
    years. In 2007, we had no operations in hyperinflationary
    economies. In 2006, the only hyperinflationary economy in which
    we operated was the Dominican Republic, which uses the
    U.S. dollar as the



functional currency. In 2005, our operations in
    hyperinflationary economies consisted of the Dominican Republic
    and Turkey; however, the impact on net income from these
    operations was not significant.

Effect
    of Foreign Currency Transactions

The impact on net income from transactions denominated in
    foreign currencies is mitigated because the costs of our
    products are generally denominated in the same currencies in
    which they are sold. In addition, to reduce our income statement
    exposure to transactions in foreign currencies, we enter into
    foreign exchange forward, option and swap contracts, where
    available and appropriate.

Analysis
    of Selected Financial Ratios

We utilize certain financial ratios to assess our financial
    condition and operating performance, as discussed below.

Operational
    Working Capital Ratio

Working capital (current assets minus current liabilities,
    excluding working capital of held-for-sale businesses) as a
    percent of net sales decreased in 2007 primarily due to an
    increase in short-term debt.

On February 8, 2008, one of our subsidiaries entered into a
    credit agreement for a term loan credit facility with fourteen
    domestic and foreign banks for a total commitment of
    $400 million, maturing February 8, 2011. The proceeds
    from this term loan credit facility were used to reduce
    commercial paper borrowings (included in current liabilities)
    initially used to finance the Paxar acquisition.

Operational working capital from continuing operations, as a
    percent of net sales, is a non-GAAP measure and is shown below.
    We use this non-GAAP measure as a tool to assess our working
    capital requirements because it excludes the impact of
    fluctuations due to our financing and other activities (that
    affect cash and cash equivalents, deferred taxes, other current
    assets and other current liabilities) that tend to be disparate
    in amount and timing and therefore, may increase the volatility
    of the working capital ratio from period to period.
    Additionally, the items excluded from this measure are not
    necessarily indicative of the underlying trends of our
    operations and are not significantly influenced by the
    day-to-day activities that are managed at the operating level.
    Refer to “Uses and Limitations of
    Non-GAAP Measures.” Our objective is to minimize our
    investment in operational working capital, as a percentage of
    sales, by reducing this ratio, to maximize cash flow and return
    on investment.

As a percent of sales, operational working capital from
    continuing operations in 2007 increased compared to 2006. The
    primary factors contributing to this change, which includes the
    impact of currency translation, are discussed below.

Accounts
    Receivable Ratio

The average number of days sales outstanding was 62 days in
    2007 compared to 58 days in 2006, calculated using a
    four-quarter average accounts receivable balance divided by the
    average daily sales for the year. The change is primarily due to
    the acquisition of Paxar, as well as the timing of sales and
    collections.

Inventory
    Ratio

Average inventory turnover was 7.8 in 2007 compared to 8.1 in
    2006, calculated using the annual cost of sales divided by a
    four-quarter average inventory balance. The change is primarily
    due to the acquisition of Paxar.

Accounts
    Payable Ratio

The average number of days payable outstanding was 58 days
    in 2007 compared to 61 days in 2006, calculated using a
    four-quarter average accounts payable balance divided by the
    average daily cost of products sold for the year. The change is
    primarily due to the timing of payments in Europe, partially
    offset by the acquisition of Paxar.

The increase in the total debt to total capital ratio in 2007
    was primarily due to a net increase in debt related to the Paxar
    acquisition and share repurchases, partially offset by an
    increase in shareholders’ equity.

Our various loan agreements in effect at year end require that
    we maintain specified ratios of consolidated debt and
    consolidated interest expense in relation to certain measures of
    income. We were in compliance with these covenants as shown in
    the table above.

The fair value of our debt is estimated based on the discounted
    amount of the related cash flows using the current rates offered
    to us for debt of the same remaining maturities. At year end,
    the fair value of our total debt, including short-term
    borrowings, was $2,250.7 million in 2007 and
    $963 million in 2006.

Decreases in these ratios in 2007 compared to 2006 were
    primarily due to lower net income, as well as higher equity and
    total debt outstanding. These ratios are computed using actual
    net income and a five-quarter average denominator for equity and
    total debt accounts.

Capital
    Resources

Capital resources include cash flows from operations and debt
    financing. We maintain adequate financing arrangements at
    competitive rates. These financing arrangements consist of our
    commercial paper programs in the



U.S. and Europe, committed and uncommitted bank lines of
    credit in the countries where we operate, callable commercial
    notes, and long-term debt, including medium-term notes.

Capital
    from Debt

Our total debt increased approximately $1.29 billion in
    2007 to $2.26 billion compared to year end 2006, reflecting
    increased short-term borrowings primarily related to the Paxar
    acquisition during the second quarter of 2007 and share
    repurchases.

We initially funded the Paxar acquisition by issuing commercial
    paper, supported by a bridge revolving credit facility (the
    “Credit Facility”) we entered into in June 2007 with
    five domestic and foreign banks. The Credit Facility had an
    initial total commitment of $1.35 billion, expiring
    June 11, 2008, for terms which are generally similar to
    existing credit facilities. Financing available under this
    agreement is permitted to be used for working capital,
    commercial paper

back-up

and
    other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. As of
    December 29, 2007, the outstanding commitment was
    $715 million.

In August 2007, we amended our existing revolving credit
    agreement, increasing commitments from $525 million to
    $1 billion and extending the maturity to August 2012.
    Commitments were provided by twelve domestic and foreign banks.
    Financing available under the agreement will be used as a
    commercial paper

back-up

facility and is also available to finance other corporate
    requirements, including acquisitions.

In September 2007, one of our subsidiaries issued
    $250 million

10-year

senior notes, which we guaranteed, bearing interest at a rate of
    6.625% per year, due October 2017. The net proceeds from the
    offering were approximately $247 million and were used to
    pay down current long-term debt maturities of $150 million
    and reduce commercial paper borrowings of $97 million
    initially used to finance the Paxar acquisition.

The Credit Facility and the revolving credit agreement are
    subject to customary financial covenants, including a maximum
    leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio, with which
    we are in compliance.

In November 2007, we issued $400 million of 7.875%
    Corporate HiMEDS units, a mandatory convertible debt issue. An
    additional $40 million of HiMEDS units were issued in
    December 2007 as a result of the exercise of the overallotment
    allocation from the initial issuance. Each HiMEDS unit is
    comprised of two components — a purchase contract
    obligating the holder to purchase from us a certain number of
    shares in 2010 ranging from approximately 6.8 million to
    approximately 8.6 million shares (depending on the stock
    price at that time) and a senior note due in 2020. The net
    proceeds from the offering were approximately $427 million,
    which were used to reduce commercial paper borrowings initially
    used to finance the Paxar acquisition.

In addition, we have a

364-day

revolving credit facility in which a foreign bank provides us up
    to Euro 40 million ($57.5 million) in borrowings
    through July 31, 2008. With the approval of the bank, we
    may extend the revolving period and due date on an annual basis.
    Financing under this agreement is used to finance cash
    requirements of our European operations. There was no debt
    outstanding under this agreement as of December 29, 2007
    and $26.3 million outstanding as of December 30, 2006.

We had standby letters of credit outstanding of
    $80.9 million (including $7.3 million of standby
    letters of credit we assumed from Paxar) and $77.1 million
    at the end of 2007 and 2006, respectively. The aggregate
    contract amount of outstanding standby letters of credit
    approximated fair value.

In connection with the Paxar acquisition, we have assumed
    additional debt of approximately $5 million, which remains
    outstanding at December 29, 2007.

Our uncommitted lines of credit were approximately
    $448.2 million at year end 2007. Our uncommitted lines of
    credit do not have a commitment expiration date and may be
    cancelled by the banks or us at any time.

In the fourth quarter of 2007, we filed a shelf registration
    statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to permit
    the issuance of debt and equity securities. Proceeds from the
    shelf offering may be used for general corporate purposes,
    including repaying, redeeming or repurchasing existing debt, and
    for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. This
    shelf registration replaced the shelf registration statement
    filed in 2004. The HiMEDS units discussed above were issued
    under this registration statement.



As discussed above, one of our subsidiaries entered into a
    credit agreement on February 8, 2008 for a term loan credit
    facility with fourteen domestic and foreign banks for a total
    commitment of $400 million, maturing February 8, 2011.
    The proceeds from this term loan credit facility were used to
    reduce commercial paper borrowings initially used to finance the
    Paxar acquisition.

Credit ratings are a significant factor in our ability to raise
    short-term and long-term financing. The credit ratings assigned
    to us also impact the interest rates on our commercial paper and
    other borrowings. When determining a credit rating, the rating
    agencies place significant weight on our competitive position,
    business outlook, consistency of cash flows, debt level and
    liquidity, geographic dispersion and management team.

    lowered our long-term rating from A- to BBB+, and A3 to Baa1,
    respectively, due to the incremental debt incurred as a result
    of the Paxar acquisition. We remain committed to retaining a
    solid investment grade rating.

Interest on floating rate debt was estimated using the index
    rate in effect as of December 29, 2007.

We enter into operating leases primarily for office and
    warehouse space and equipment for electronic data processing and
    transportation. The terms of our leases do not impose
    significant restrictions or unusual obligations, except for the
    facility in Mentor, Ohio as noted below. The table above
    includes minimum annual rental commitments on operating leases
    having initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms of one
    year or more.

On September 9, 2005, we completed the lease financing for
    a commercial facility (the “Facility”) located in
    Mentor, Ohio, used primarily for the new headquarters and
    research center for our roll materials group. The Facility
    consists generally of land, buildings, equipment and office
    furnishings. We have leased the Facility under an operating
    lease arrangement, which contains a residual value guarantee of
    $33.4 million. We do not expect the residual value of the
    Facility to be less than the amount guaranteed.

We did not include purchase obligations or open purchase orders
    at year end 2007 in the table of contractual obligations above,
    because it is impracticable for us to either obtain such
    information or provide a reasonable estimate due to the
    decentralized nature of our purchasing systems.



The table above does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of
    $125 million, the timing of which is uncertain, except for
    approximately $7 million that may become payable during
    2008. Refer to Note 11, “Taxes Based on Income”
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information
    on unrecognized tax benefits.

Investigations
    and Legal Proceedings

We previously announced that we had been notified by the
    European Commission, the United States Department of Justice
    (“DOJ”), the Competition Law Department of the
    Department of Justice of Canada and the Australian Competition
    and Consumer Commission of their respective criminal
    investigations into competitive practices in the label stock
    industry. We cooperated with all of these investigations, and
    all, except the Australian investigation which is continuing,
    have been terminated without further action by the authorities.

We are a named defendant in purported class actions in the
    U.S. seeking treble damages and other relief for alleged
    unlawful competitive practices, which were filed after the
    announcement of the DOJ investigation.

We are unable to predict the effect of these matters at this
    time, although the effect could be adverse and material. These
    and other matters are reported in Note 8,
    “Contingencies,” to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Environmental

We have been designated by the U.S. Environmental
    Protection Agency (“EPA”)

and/or

other
    responsible state agencies as a potentially responsible party
    (“PRP”) at eighteen waste disposal or waste recycling
    sites, including Paxar sites, which are the subject of separate
    investigations or proceedings concerning alleged soil

and/or

groundwater contamination and for which no settlement of our
    liability has been agreed upon. We are participating with other
    PRPs at such sites, and anticipate that our share of cleanup
    costs will be determined pursuant to remedial agreements to be
    entered into in the normal course of negotiations with the EPA
    or other governmental authorities.

We have accrued liabilities for these and certain other sites,
    including sites in which governmental agencies have designated
    us as a PRP, where it is probable that a loss will be incurred
    and the cost or amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.
    However, because of the uncertainties associated with
    environmental assessment and remediation activities, future
    expense to remediate the currently identified sites and any
    sites which could be identified in the future for cleanup could
    be higher than the liability currently accrued.

As of December 29, 2007, our estimated liability associated
    with compliance and remediation costs was approximately
    $38 million, including preliminary liabilities related to
    the acquisition of Paxar. See also Note 2,
    “Acquisitions,” to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

During 2006, we recognized $15 million for estimated
    environmental remediation costs for a former operating facility.
    Of the amount accrued, which represented the lower end of the
    current estimated range of $15 million to $17 million
    for costs expected to be incurred, approximately $9 million
    remained accrued as of December 29, 2007. We considered
    additional information provided by outside consultants in
    revising our previous estimates of expected costs. This estimate
    could change depending on various factors, such as modification
    of currently planned remedial actions, changes in site
    conditions, a change in the estimated time to complete
    remediation, changes in laws and regulations affecting
    remediation requirements and other factors.

Other amounts currently accrued are not significant to our
    consolidated financial position, and based upon current
    information, we believe that it is unlikely that the final
    resolution of these matters will significantly impact our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows.

Other

In 2005, we contacted relevant authorities in the U.S. and
    reported on the results of an internal investigation of
    potential violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices
    Act. The transactions at issue were carried out by a small
    number of employees of our reflective business in China, and
    involved, among other things, impermissible payments or
    attempted impermissible payments. The payments or attempted
    payments and the contracts associated with them appear to have
    been relatively minor in amount and of limited duration.
    Corrective and disciplinary



actions have been taken. Sales of our reflective business in
    China in 2005 were approximately $7 million. Based on
    findings to date, no changes to our previously filed financial
    statements are warranted as a result of these matters. However,
    we believe that fines or other penalties could be incurred.
    While we are unable to predict the financial or operating impact
    of any such fines or penalties, we believe that our behavior in
    detecting, investigating, responding to and voluntarily
    disclosing these matters to authorities should be viewed
    favorably.

We and our subsidiaries are involved in various other lawsuits,
    claims and inquiries, most of which are routine to the nature of
    our business. Based upon current information, we believe that
    the resolution of these other matters will not materially affect
    us.

We provide for an estimate of costs that may be incurred under
    our basic limited warranty at the time product revenue is
    recognized. These costs primarily include materials and labor
    associated with the service or sale of products. Factors that
    affect our warranty liability include the number of units
    installed or sold, historical and anticipated rate of warranty
    claims on those units, cost per claim to satisfy our warranty
    obligation and availability of insurance coverage. As these
    factors are impacted by actual experience and future
    expectations, we assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty
    liability and adjust the amounts as necessary.

We participate in international receivable financing programs
    with several financial institutions whereby advances may be
    requested from these financial institutions. Such advances are
    guaranteed by us. At December 29, 2007, we had guaranteed
    approximately $17 million.

As of December 29, 2007, we guaranteed up to approximately
    $22 million of certain of our foreign subsidiaries’
    obligations to their suppliers, as well as approximately
    $476 million of certain of our subsidiaries’ lines of
    credit with various financial institutions.

In November 2007, we issued $400 million of 7.875%
    Corporate HiMEDS units, a mandatory convertible debt issue. An
    additional $40 million of HiMEDS units were issued in
    December 2007 as a result of the exercise of the overallotment
    allocation from the initial issuance. Each HiMEDS unit is
    comprised of two components — a purchase contract
    obligating the holder to purchase from us a certain number of
    shares in 2010 ranging from approximately 6.8 million to
    approximately 8.6 million shares (depending on the stock
    price at that time) and a senior note due in 2020. The net
    proceeds from the offering were approximately $427 million,
    which were used to reduce commercial paper borrowings initially
    used to finance the Paxar acquisition.

USES
    AND LIMITATIONS OF NON-GAAP MEASURES

We use certain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the
    impact of certain events, activities or strategic decisions. The
    accounting effects of these events, activities or decisions,
    which are included in the GAAP measures, may make it difficult
    to assess the underlying performance of the Company in a single
    period. By excluding certain accounting effects, both positive
    and negative (e.g. gains on sales of assets, restructuring
    charges, asset impairments, etc.), from certain of our GAAP
    measures, management believes that it is providing meaningful
    supplemental information to facilitate an understanding of the
    Company’s “core” or “underlying”
    operating results. These non-GAAP measures are used internally
    to evaluate trends in our underlying business, as well as to
    facilitate comparison to the results of competitors for a single
    period.

Limitations associated with the use of our non-GAAP measures
    include (1) the exclusion of foreign currency translation
    and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures from the
    calculation of organic sales growth; (2) the exclusion of
    mandatory debt service requirements, as well as the exclusion of
    other uses of the cash generated by operating activities that do
    not directly or immediately support the underlying business
    (such as discretionary debt reductions, dividends, share
    repurchase, acquisitions, etc.) for calculation of free cash
    flow; and (3) the exclusion of cash and cash equivalents,
    short-term debt, deferred taxes, and other current assets and
    other current liabilities, as well as current assets and current
    liabilities of held-for-sale businesses, for the calculation of
    operational working capital. While some of the items the Company
    excludes from GAAP measures recur, these items tend to be
    disparate in amount and timing. Based upon feedback from
    investors and financial analysts, we believe that supplemental
    non-GAAP measures provide information that is useful to the
    assessment of the Company’s performance and operating
    trends.



RELATED
    PARTY TRANSACTIONS

From time to time, we enter into transactions in the normal
    course of business with related parties. We believe that such
    transactions are at arm’s length and for terms that would
    have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties.

One of our directors, Peter W. Mullin is the chairman, chief
    executive officer and a director of MC Insurance Services, Inc.
    (“MC”), Mullin Insurance Services, Inc.
    (“MINC”), and PWM Insurance Services, Inc.
    (“PWM”), executive compensation and benefit
    consultants and insurance agents. Mr. Mullin is also the
    majority stockholder of MC, MINC and PWM (collectively referred
    to as the “Mullin Companies”). We paid premiums to
    insurance carriers for life insurance placed by the Mullin
    Companies in connection with various of our employee benefit
    plans. The Mullin Companies have advised us that they earned
    commissions from such insurance carriers for the placement and
    renewal of this insurance. Approximately 50% of these
    commissions were allocated to and used by MullinTBG Insurance
    Agency Services, LLC (an affiliate of MC) to administer
    benefit plans and provide benefit statements to participants
    under various of our employee benefit plans. The Mullin
    Companies own a minority interest in M Financial Holdings, Inc.
    (“MFH”). Substantially all of the life insurance
    policies, which we placed through the Mullin Companies in 2007
    and prior years, are issued by insurance carriers that
    participate in reinsurance agreements entered into between these
    insurance carriers and M Life Insurance Company (“M
    Life”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of MFH. Reinsurance
    returns earned by M Life are determined annually by the
    insurance carriers and can be negative or positive, depending
    upon the results of M Life’s aggregate reinsurance pool,
    which consists of the insured lives reinsured by M Life. The
    Mullin Companies have advised us that they participated in net
    reinsurance gains of M Life. In addition, the Mullin Companies
    have advised us that they also participated in net reinsurance
    gains of M Life that are subject to risk of forfeiture. None of
    these transactions were significant to our financial position or
    results of operations.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    for the reporting period and as of the financial statement date.
    These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of
    assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities
    and the reported amounts of revenue and expense. Actual results
    could differ from those estimates.

Critical accounting policies are those that are important to the
    portrayal of our financial condition and results, and which
    require us to make difficult, subjective

and/or

complex judgments. Critical accounting policies cover accounting
    matters that are inherently uncertain because the future
    resolution of such matters is unknown. We believe that critical
    accounting policies include accounting for revenue recognition,
    sales returns and allowances, accounts receivable allowances,
    inventory and inventory reserves, long-lived asset impairments,
    pensions and postretirement benefits, income taxes, stock-based
    compensation, restructuring and severance costs, litigation and
    environmental, and business combinations.



Revenue
    Recognition

Sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
    exists, pricing is determinable, and collection is reasonably
    assured. Furthermore, sales, provisions for estimated returns,
    and the cost of products sold are recorded at the time title
    transfers to customers and when the customers assume the risks
    and rewards of ownership. Sales terms are generally f.o.b. (free
    on board) shipping point or f.o.b. destination, depending upon
    local business customs. For most regions in which we operate,
    f.o.b. shipping point terms are utilized and sales are recorded
    at the time of shipment, because this is when title and risk of
    loss are transferred. In certain regions, notably in Europe,
    f.o.b. destination terms are generally utilized and sales are
    recorded when the products are delivered to the customer’s
    delivery site, because this is when title and risk of loss are
    transferred. Actual product returns are charged against
    estimated sales return allowances.

Sales rebates and discounts are common practice in the
    industries in which we operate. Volume, promotional, price, cash
    and other discounts and customer incentives are accounted for as
    a reduction to gross sales. Rebates and discounts are recorded
    based upon estimates at the time products are sold. These
    estimates are based upon historical experience for similar
    programs and products. We review such rebates and discounts on
    an ongoing basis and accruals for rebates and discounts are
    adjusted, if necessary, as additional information becomes
    available.

Sales
    Returns and Allowances

Sales returns and allowances represent credits we grant to our
    customers (both affiliated and non-affiliated) for the return of
    unsatisfactory product or a negotiated allowance in lieu of
    return. We accrue for returns and allowances based upon the
    gross price of the products sold and historical experience for
    such products. We record these allowances based on the following
    factors: (i) customer specific allowances; and (ii) an
    estimated amount, based on our historical experience, for issues
    not yet identified.

Accounts
    Receivable Allowances

We are required to make judgments as to the collectibility of
    accounts receivable based on established aging policy,
    historical experience and future expectations. The allowances
    for doubtful accounts represent allowances for customer trade
    accounts receivable that are estimated to be partially or
    entirely uncollectible. These allowances are used to reduce
    gross trade receivables to their net realizable value. We record
    these allowances based on estimates related to the following
    factors: (i) customer specific allowances;
    (ii) amounts based upon an aging schedule; and
    (iii) an estimated amount, based on our historical
    experience, for issues not yet identified. No single customer
    represented 10% or more of our net sales or trade receivables at
    year end 2007 and 2006. However, our ten largest customers at
    year end 2007 represented approximately 17% of trade accounts
    receivable and consisted of six customers of our Office and
    Consumer Products segment, three customers of our
    Pressure-sensitive Materials segment and one customer of both
    these segments. The financial position and operations of these
    customers are monitored on an ongoing basis.

Inventory
    and Inventory Reserves

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value and
    are categorized as raw materials,

work-in-progress

or finished goods. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2007, we
    changed the method of accounting for inventories for our
    U.S. operations from a combination of the use of FIFO and
    LIFO methods to the FIFO method. The inventories for our
    international operations continue to be valued using the FIFO
    method. We believe this change is preferable as the FIFO method
    better reflects the current value of inventories on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet; provides better matching of revenue
    and expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income; provides
    uniformity across our operations with respect to the method for
    inventory accounting; and enhances comparability with peers.
    Furthermore, this application of the FIFO method will be
    consistent with our accounting of inventories for
    U.S. income tax purposes.

The change in accounting method from LIFO to FIFO method was
    completed in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (“SFAS”) No. 154, “Accounting
    Changes and Error Corrections.” We applied this change in
    accounting principle by retrospectively restating prior
    years’ financial statements. Refer to the Financial



Presentation and Inventories sections of Note 1,
    “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Inventory reserves are recorded for damaged, obsolete, excess
    and slow-moving inventory. We use estimates to record these
    reserves. Slow-moving inventory is reviewed by category and may
    be partially or fully reserved for depending on the type of
    product and the length of time the product has been included in
    inventory.

Long-lived
    Asset Impairments

We record impairment charges when the carrying amounts of
    long-lived assets are determined not to be recoverable.
    Impairment is measured by assessing the usefulness of an asset
    or by comparing the carrying value of an asset to its fair
    value. Fair value is typically determined using quoted market
    prices, if available, or an estimate of undiscounted future cash
    flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its
    eventual disposition. The key estimates applied when preparing
    cash flow projections relate to revenues, gross margins,
    economic life of assets, overheads, taxation and discount rates.
    The amount of impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the
    carrying value over the fair value. Changes in market conditions
    and management strategy have historically caused us to reassess
    the carrying amount of our long-lived assets.

Pensions
    and Postretirement Benefits

In December 2006, we adopted the provisions of
    SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an
    amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and
    132(R)”:

a)

Recognition of the funded status of the Company’s defined
    benefit and postretirement benefit plan (with a corresponding
    reversal of minimum pension liability under
    SFAS No. 87);

b)

Recognition of the gains or losses, prior service costs or
    credits and transition assets or obligations remaining from the
    initial application of SFAS Nos. 87 and 106 as a component
    of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax;

c)

Measurement of the defined benefit plan assets and obligations
    as of the Company’s fiscal year end; and

d)

Disclosure of additional information about the effects of the
    amortization of gains or losses, prior service costs or credits,
    and transition assets or obligations (remaining from the initial
    application of SFAS Nos. 87 and 106) on net periodic
    benefit cost for the next fiscal year.

Assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations
    and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plan and other
    postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by management in
    consultation with outside actuaries. In the event we determine
    that changes are warranted in the assumptions used, such as the
    discount rate, expected long-term rate of return, or health care
    costs, future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could
    increase or decrease. Due to changing market conditions or
    changes in the participant population, the actuarial assumptions
    we use may differ from actual results, which could have a
    significant impact on our pension and postretirement liability
    and related cost.

Discount
    Rate

We, in consultation with our actuaries, annually review and
    determine the discount rates to be used in connection with our
    postretirement obligations. The assumed discount rate for each
    pension plan reflects market rates for high quality corporate
    bonds currently available. In the U.S., our discount rate is
    determined by evaluating several yield curves consisting of
    large populations of high quality corporate bonds. The projected
    pension benefit payment streams are then matched with the bond
    portfolios to determine a rate that reflects the liability
    duration unique to our plans.

Long-term
    Return on Assets

We determine the long-term rate of return assumption for plan
    assets by reviewing the historical and expected returns of both
    the equity and fixed income markets, taking into consideration
    that assets with higher volatility



typically generate a greater return over the long run.
    Additionally, current market conditions, such as interest rates,
    are evaluated and peer data is reviewed to check for
    reasonability and appropriateness.

Healthcare
    Cost Trend Rate

Our practice is to fund the cost of postretirement benefits on a
    cash basis. For measurement purposes, an 8% annual rate of
    increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits
    was assumed for 2008. This rate is expected to decrease to
    approximately 5% by 2011.

Income
    Taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary
    differences between the amount of assets and liabilities for
    financial and tax reporting purposes. Such amounts are adjusted,
    as appropriate, to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be
    in effect when the temporary differences reverse. A valuation
    allowance is recorded to reduce our deferred tax assets to the
    amount that is more likely than not to be realized.

Pursuant to SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income
    Taxes,” when establishing a valuation allowance, we
    consider future sources of taxable income such as “future
    reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future
    taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and
    carryforwards” and “tax planning strategies.”
    SFAS No. 109 defines a tax planning strategy as
    “an action that: is prudent and feasible; an enterprise
    ordinarily might not take, but would take to prevent an
    operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused;
    and would result in realization of deferred tax assets.” In
    the event we determine the deferred tax assets will not be
    realized in the future, the valuation adjustment to the deferred
    tax assets will be charged to earnings in the period in which we
    make such a determination. We have also acquired certain net
    deferred tax assets with existing valuation allowances. If it is
    later determined that it is more likely than not that the
    deferred tax assets will be realized, we will release the
    valuation allowance to current earnings or adjust the purchase
    price allocation, consistent with the manner of origination.

We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on
    estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual
    results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent
    years. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when
    identified

The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits
    by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. Our estimate of
    the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to
    management’s assessment of relevant risks, facts, and
    circumstances existing at that time, pursuant to Financial
    Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN 48”),
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.” FIN 48
    requires a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial
    statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or
    expected to be taken in a tax return. We record a liability for
    the difference between the benefit recognized and measured
    pursuant to FIN 48 and tax position taken or expected to be
    taken on our tax return. To the extent that our assessment of
    such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded
    in the period in which the determination is made. We report
    tax-related interest and penalties as a component of income tax
    expense.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Effective January 1, 2006, we began recognizing expense for
    stock-based compensation to comply with the provisions of the
    reissued SFAS No. 123(R), using the modified
    prospective application transition method. As permitted by this
    transition method, results for the prior periods have not been
    restated. In addition, we continued to recognize compensation
    cost related to outstanding unvested awards as of
    December 31, 2005 under the original provisions of
    SFAS No. 123. Stock-based compensation expense for all
    awards granted after December 31, 2005 was based on the
    grant date fair value estimated in accordance with
    SFAS No. 123(R).

Valuation
    of Stock Options

Our stock-based compensation expense is the estimated fair value
    of options granted, amortized on a straight-line basis over the
    requisite service period. The fair value of each of our stock
    option awards is estimated on the date



of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. This
    model requires input assumptions for our expected dividend
    yield, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate and the
    expected life of the options.

Expected dividend yield was based on the current annual dividend
    divided by the

12-month

average of our monthly stock price prior to grant.

Expected volatility for options granted during 2007 represented
    an average of implied and historical volatility. Expected
    volatility for options granted prior to 2006 was based on
    historical volatility of our stock price.

Risk-free rate was based on the average of the 52-week average
    of the Treasury-Bond rate that has a term corresponding to the
    expected option term.

Expected term was determined based on historical experience
    under our stock option plans.

Forfeiture rate assumption was determined based on historical
    data of our stock option forfeitures over the last twelve years
    prior to 2007.

Certain of the assumptions used above are based on
    management’s estimates. As such, if factors change and such
    factors require us to change our assumptions and estimates, our
    stock-based compensation expense could be significantly
    different in the future.

We have not capitalized costs associated with stock-based
    compensation.

Accounting
    for Income Taxes for Stock-based Compensation

We elected to use the short-cut method to calculate the
    historical pool of windfall tax benefits related to employee
    stock-based compensation awards. In addition, we elected to
    follow the tax ordering laws to determine the sequence in which
    deductions and net operating loss carryforwards are utilized, as
    well as the direct-only approach to calculating the amount of
    windfall or shortfall tax benefits.

Restructuring
    and Severance Costs

We account for restructuring costs including severance and other
    costs associated with exit or disposal activities following the
    guidance provided in SFAS No. 112, “Accounting
    for Postemployment Benefits,” and SFAS No. 146,
    “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
    Activities.” In the U.S., we have a severance pay plan
    (“Pay Plan”), which provides eligible employees with
    severance payments in the event of an involuntary termination
    due to qualifying cost reduction actions. We calculate severance
    pay using the severance benefit formula under the Pay Plan.
    Accordingly, we record provisions for such amounts and other
    related exit costs when they are probable and estimable as set
    forth under SFAS No. 112. In the absence of a Pay Plan
    or established local practices for overseas jurisdictions,
    liability for severance and other employee-related costs is
    recognized when the liability is incurred, following the
    guidance of SFAS No. 146.

Litigation
    and Environmental

We are currently involved in various lawsuits, claims and
    inquiries, most of which are routine to the nature of our
    business. In accordance with SFAS No. 5,
    “Accounting for Contingencies,” when it is probable
    that obligations have been incurred and where a range of the
    cost of compliance or remediation can be estimated, the best
    estimate within the range, or if an amount cannot be determined
    and be the most likely, the low end of the range is accrued. The
    ultimate resolution of these claims could affect future results
    of operations should our exposure be materially different from
    our earlier estimates or should liabilities be incurred that
    were not previously accrued.

Environmental expenditures are generally expensed. However,
    environmental expenditures for newly acquired assets and those
    which extend or improve the economic useful life of existing
    assets are capitalized and amortized over the remaining asset
    life. We review each reporting period our estimates of costs of
    compliance with environmental laws related to remediation and
    cleanup of various sites, including sites in which governmental
    agencies have designated us a potentially responsible party.
    When it is probable that obligations have been incurred and
    where a range of the cost of compliance or remediation can be
    estimated, the best estimate within the range, or if



an amount cannot be determined and be the most likely, the low
    end of the range is accrued. Potential insurance reimbursements
    are not offset against potential liabilities, and such
    liabilities are not discounted.

Business
    Combinations

We account for business combinations using the accounting
    requirements of SFAS No. 141, “Business
    Combinations.” In accordance with SFAS No. 141,
    we record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from
    acquired businesses at fair value, and we make estimates and
    assumptions to determine such fair values. We engage third-party
    valuation specialists to assist us in determining these fair
    value estimates.

We utilize a variety of assumptions and estimates that are
    believed to be reasonable in determining fair value for assets
    acquired and liabilities assumed. These assumptions and
    estimates include estimated future cash flows, growth rates,
    current replacement cost for similar capacity for certain
    assets, market rate assumptions for certain obligations and
    certain potential costs of compliance with environmental laws
    related to remediation and cleanup of acquired properties. We
    also utilize information obtained from management of the
    acquired businesses and our own historical experience from
    previous acquisitions.

We apply significant assumptions and estimates in determining
    certain intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions (such
    as customer relationships, patents and other acquired
    technology, and trademarks and trade names and related
    applicable useful lives), property, plant and equipment,
    receivables, inventories, investments, tax accounts,
    environmental liabilities, stock option awards, lease
    commitments and restructuring and integration costs.
    Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may
    affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates
    or actual results. As such, decreases to fair value of assets
    acquired and liabilities assumed (including cost estimates for
    certain obligations and liabilities) are recorded as an
    adjustment to goodwill indefinitely, whereas increases to the
    estimates are recorded as an adjustment to goodwill during the
    purchase price allocation period (generally within one year of
    the acquisition date) and as operating expenses thereafter.

RECENT
    ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS

During 2007, we adopted certain accounting and financial
    disclosure requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (“FASB”), Emerging Issues Task Force
    (“EITF”) and Financial Interpretations by the staff of
    the FASB. In 2006, the requirements with the most significant
    impact were the reissued SFAS No. 123(R),
    “Share-Based Payment,” and SFAS No. 158,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements
    No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R).” Refer to Note 1,
    “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

SAFE
    HARBOR STATEMENT

The matters discussed in this Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and
    other sections of this Annual Report contain
    “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the
    Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These
    statements, which are not statements of historical fact, may
    contain estimates, assumptions, projections

and/or

expectations regarding future events, which may or may not
    occur. Words such as “aim,” “anticipate,”
    “assume,” “believe,” “continue,”
    “could,” “estimate,” “expect,”
    “guidance,” “intend,” “may,”
    “objective,” “plan,” “potential,”

    “should,” “target,” “will,”
    “would,” or variations thereof and other expressions,
    which refer to future events and trends, identify
    forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements, and
    financial or other business targets, are subject to certain
    risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to
    differ materially from expected results, performance or
    achievements of the Company expressed or implied by such
    forward-looking statements.

Certain of such risks and uncertainties are discussed in more
    detail in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,”
    to the Company’s Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for the year ended December 29, 2007, and include, but are
    not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to investment
    in development activities and new production facilities;
    fluctuations in cost and availability of raw materials; ability
    of the Company to achieve and sustain targeted cost reductions,
    including synergies from the integration of the Paxar business
    in the time and the cost anticipated; ability of the Company to
    generate sustained productivity improvement; successful
    integration of acquisitions; successful implementation of new
    manufacturing technologies and installation of manufacturing
    equipment; the financial



condition and inventory strategies of customers; customer and
    supplier concentrations; changes in customer order patterns;
    loss of significant contract(s) or customer(s); timely
    development and market acceptance of new products; impact of
    competitive products and pricing; selling prices; business mix
    shift; credit risks; ability of the Company to obtain adequate
    financing arrangements; fluctuation of interest rates;
    fluctuation in pension, insurance and employee benefit costs;
    impact of legal proceedings, including the Australian
    Competition and Consumer Commission investigation into industry
    competitive practices, and any related proceedings or lawsuits
    pertaining to this investigation or to the subject matter
    thereof or of the concluded investigations by the DOJ, the EC,
    and the Canadian Department of Justice (including purported
    class actions seeking treble damages for alleged unlawful
    competitive practices, which were filed after the announcement
    of the DOJ investigation), as well as the impact of potential
    violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act based
    on issues in China; changes in governmental regulations; changes
    in political conditions; fluctuations in foreign currency
    exchange rates and other risks associated with foreign
    operations; worldwide and local economic conditions; impact of
    epidemiological events on the economy and the Company’s
    customers and suppliers; acts of war, terrorism, natural
    disasters; and other factors.

The Company believes that the most significant risk factors that
    could affect its ability to achieve its stated financial
    expectations in the near-term include (1) the impact of
    economic conditions on underlying demand for the Company’s
    products; (2) the degree to which higher raw material and
    energy-related costs can be passed on to customers through
    selling price increases, without a significant loss of volume;
    (3) the impact of competitor’s actions, including
    pricing, expansion in key markets, and product offerings;
    (4) potential adverse developments in legal proceedings

and/or

investigations regarding competitive activities, including
    possible fines, penalties, judgments or settlements; and
    (5) the ability of the Company to achieve and sustain
    targeted cost reductions, including expected synergies
    associated with the Paxar acquisition.

The Company’s forward-looking statements represent judgment
    only on the dates such statements were made. By making such
    forward-looking statements, the Company assumes no duty to
    update them to reflect new, changed or unanticipated events or
    circumstances, other than as may be required by law.

Item 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Risk
    Management

We are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates and
    foreign currency exchange rates.

Our policy is not to purchase or hold foreign currency, interest
    rate or commodity contracts for trading purposes.

Our objective in managing the exposure to foreign currency
    changes is to reduce the risk to our earnings and cash flow
    associated with foreign exchange rate changes. As a result, we
    enter into foreign exchange forward, option and swap contracts
    to reduce risks associated with the value of our existing
    foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and
    anticipated foreign revenues and costs, when available and
    appropriate. The gains and losses on these contracts are
    intended to offset changes in the related exposures. We do not
    hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that would
    entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange
    rates on our consolidated net income.

Our objective in managing our exposure to interest rate changes
    is to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and
    cash flows. To achieve our objectives, we may periodically use
    interest rate contracts to manage the exposure to interest rate
    changes related to our borrowings. In June 2007 and August 2007,
    we entered into certain interest rate option contracts to hedge
    our exposure related to interest rate increases in connection
    with our anticipated long-term debt issuances. Such debt
    issuances were intended to replace the short-term borrowings
    initially used to finance the Paxar acquisition and to support
    the refinancing of our current long-term debt maturities. In
    connection with these transactions, we paid $11.5 million
    as option premiums, of which $4.8 million was recognized
    during the year as a cash flow hedge loss in the Consolidated
    Statement of Income and $6.7 million is being amortized
    over the life of the related forecasted hedged transactions.

Additionally, we enter into certain natural gas futures
    contracts to reduce the risks associated with anticipated
    domestic natural gas used in manufacturing and operations. These
    amounts are not material to our financial statements.



In the normal course of operations, we also face other risks
    that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable. Such risks
    principally include changes in economic or political conditions,
    other risks associated with foreign operations, commodity price
    risk and litigation risk, which are not represented in the
    analyses that follow.

Foreign
    Exchange

Value-At-Risk

We use a

Value-At-Risk

(“VAR”) model to determine the estimated maximum
    potential

one-day

loss
    in earnings associated with both our foreign exchange positions
    and contracts. This approach assumes that market rates or prices
    for foreign exchange positions and contracts are normally
    distributed. The VAR model estimates were made assuming normal
    market conditions. Firm commitments, accounts receivable and
    accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies, which
    certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were
    included in the model. Forecasted transactions, which certain of
    these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the
    model. The VAR was estimated using a variance-covariance
    methodology based on historical volatility for each currency.
    The volatility and correlation used in the calculation were
    based on two-year historical data obtained from one of our
    domestic banks. A 95% confidence level was used for a

one-day

time
    horizon.

The VAR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to
    represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred by
    us, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable
    changes in market factors.

The estimated maximum potential

one-day

loss
    in earnings for our foreign exchange positions and contracts was
    approximately $.3 million at year end 2007.

Interest
    Rate Sensitivity

An assumed 50 basis point move in interest rates (10% of
    our weighted-average interest rate on floating rate debt)
    affecting our variable-rate borrowings would have had an
    estimated $5 million effect on our 2007 earnings.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

As of the
    end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried
    out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
    participation of its management, including the Chief Executive
    Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of
    the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure
    controls and procedures (as defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

or

15d-15(e)

of the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, the
    Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure
    controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable
    assurance that information is recorded, processed, summarized
    and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
    rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and
    communicated to the Company’s management, including the
    Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer as
    appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
    disclosure.



Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting.

Management is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting (as defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

or

15d-15(f)

of the Exchange Act). Under the supervision and with the
    participation of the Company’s management, including the
    Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the
    Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its
    internal control over financial reporting based upon the
    framework in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that
    evaluation, the Company’s management concluded that its
    internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
    December 29, 2007. (See Management’s Report on
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting on page 76 in the
    Company’s 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders.)

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 29, 2007, has been audited by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their Report of Independent
    Registered Public Accounting Firm on page 77 in the
    Company’s 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders, and is
    incorporated herein by reference. Management has excluded Paxar
    Corporation from its assessment of internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 29, 2007 because it was
    acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination
    during 2007. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has also excluded Paxar
    Corporation from their audit of internal control over financial
    reporting. Paxar Corporation is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose
    total assets and total revenues represent 9 percent and
    8 percent, respectively, of the related consolidated
    financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended
    December 29, 2007.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting.

During the third quarter of 2006, the
    Company implemented an upgrade to its financial reporting and
    consolidation system and installed new finance and accounting
    software for its Retail Information Services business in Asia.
    The Company reviewed both systems as they were being
    implemented, as well as the internal controls affected by the
    implementation. Where appropriate, the Company made changes to
    affected internal controls.

During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company outsourced
    certain of its shared service functions for accounts receivable,
    accounts payable, and general ledger accounting to a third-party
    service provider. As part of the transition process, the Company
    reviewed the related internal controls and determined that the
    design of the controls surrounding these processes satisfies the
    control objectives of the Company. Where appropriate, the
    Company made changes to affected internal controls. The Company
    also tested the operating effectiveness of the controls, and
    determined that they were operating effectively.

In connection with the acquisition of Paxar, the Company has
    performed certain due diligence procedures related to
    Paxar’s financial reporting and disclosure controls. As
    part of the ongoing integration, the Company continues to assess
    the overall control environment of this business.

Except for these changes, there have been no changes in the
    Company’s internal controls over financial reporting during
    the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or
    are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s
    internal controls over financial reporting. The Company believes
    that its internal controls, as modified, were operating
    effectively as of December 29, 2007.
