Instrumentation

Our Instrumentation segment provides monitoring and control instruments for marine, environmental, industrial and other applications, as well as electronic test and measurement equipment.  We also provide power and communications connectivity devices for distributed instrumentation systems and sensor networks deployed in mission critical, harsh environments.

Marine Instrumentation

We offer a variety of products designed for use in harsh underwater environments, instruments that measure currents and other physical properties in the water column, systems that create acoustic images of objects beneath the water’s surface, including the bottom of a body of water, and sensors that determine the geologic structure below the bottom.  We also design and manufacture vehicles that utilize and transport these sensors over and beneath the water’s surface.

We design and manufacture geophysical streamer cables, hydrophones, seismic energy sources and specialty products used in offshore hydrocarbon exploration to locate oil and gas reserves beneath the ocean floor.  We are a leading supplier of marine seismic energy sources and replacement parts for offshore energy exploration. Our Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (“ADCPs”) precisely measure currents at varying depths in oceans and rivers, and our Doppler Velocity Logs (“DVLs”) are used for navigation by civilian and military surface ships, unmanned underwater vehicles and naval divers.  In addition to our DVLs, which are acoustic navigation devices, we design and manufacture inertial sensing and navigation products, as well as subsea pipe and cable detection systems for offshore energy, oceanographic and military marine markets.  We also design and manufacture remotely-controlled and tethered instrumentation deployment vehicles used for current measurement, seafloor mapping and measurement of physical parameters such as salinity.

Additionally, we design and manufacture single and multibeam hydrographic survey instrumentation used in port surveys, dredging, pre- and post-installation of offshore energy infrastructure and other challenging underwater applications.  Our multibeam sonar systems range from portable high-resolution systems used on tripods, autonomous and remotely-operated underwater vehicles (“AUVs” and “ROVs”) to full ocean depth vessel-mounted oceanographic systems as well as sub bottom profilers that can survey structures beneath the seafloor.  They can also be used to detect objects in front of the mounted system.  Our multibeam sonar systems can be used to create highly accurate maps of underwater offshore constructions, wrecks or quay walls in harbors, and in particular, high-quality maps of the seafloor.  They can also be used to detect objects in front of the mounted system.  With advanced imaging capabilities, our sonars create images of hidden structures on the seafloor and are also used to create real-time images of the environment in the oceans and enable precise navigation of AUVs and ROVs.  Our products are being utilized in both commercial and defense applications where we provide systems for detecting mines in the water.  We provide solutions that are ready-to-operate and fully-installed, including a comprehensive software package that ties together the variety of sensors that may be configured on an AUV or ROV platform.

, respectively, were derived from contracts with agencies of, and prime contractors to, the U.S. Government. Information on our sales to the U.S. Government, including direct sales as a prime contractor and indirect sales as a subcontractor, is as follows (in millions):

Our principal U.S. Government customer is the U.S. Department of Defense. These sales represented

18%

,

21%

and

19%

of our total sales for

and


, respectively.  In both 2017 and 2016, our largest program with the U.S. Government was the Mission Operations and Integration contract with the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center which represented 1.5% of our total sales in both years.  In 2015, our largest program with the U.S. Government was the Engineering Solutions and Prototyping contract with the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, which represented 1.5% of our total sales.

As described under risk factors, there are risks associated with doing business with the U.S. Government. In


, approximately

58%

of our U.S. Government prime contracts and subcontracts were fixed-price type contracts, compared to

54%

in


and

54%

in


.  Under these types of contracts, we bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may exceed the fixed contract price.  Such contracts are typically not subject to renegotiation of profits if we fail to anticipate technical problems, estimate costs accurately or control costs during performance.  Additionally, U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the U.S. Government at its convenience, without identification of any default.  When contracts are terminated for convenience, we recover costs incurred or committed, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination.  We had

$916.4 million

at

January 1, 2017

, and

$802.8 million

at

January 3, 2016

.  We expect to fulfill

93%

of such backlog of confirmed orders during 2018.  The increase in total backlog in 2017 primarily reflects backlog related to e2v, which was acquired in 2017.

Seasonality

No material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal.

Raw Materials and Suppliers

Generally, our businesses have experienced minimal fluctuations in the supply of raw materials, but not without some price volatility.  While some of our businesses provide services, for those businesses that sell hardware and product, a portion of the value that we provide is labor-oriented, such as design, engineering, assembly and test activities.  In manufacturing our products, we use our own production capabilities and also third party suppliers and subcontractors, including international sources.  Some of the items we use for the manufacture of our products, including certain gyro components for some marine navigation applications, certain magnets and helix wire for our traveling wave tubes, certain infrared detectors substrates and certain ceramics and molding compounds used in our sonar systems, as well as certain scintillator materials used in the production of our X-ray detectors, are purchased from limited or single sources, including international sources, due to technical capability, price and other factors.  At times we have experienced difficulty in procuring raw materials, components, sub-assemblies and other supplies required in our manufacturing processes due to shortages and supplier imposed allocation of components.



Sales and Marketing

Our sales and marketing approach varies by segment and by products within our segments.  A shared fundamental tenet is the commitment to work closely with our customers to understand their needs, with an aim to secure preferred supplier and longer-term relationships.

Our segments use a combination of internal sales forces, third-party distributors and commissioned sales representatives to market and sell our products and services.  Our Teledyne Instruments companies and other businesses have been working over the years to consolidate or share internal sales and servicing efforts.  Several Teledyne businesses have been marketing and selling products collaboratively to similar customers to promote “one-stop” shopping under singular “brand” names, including Teledyne Marine, Teledyne Oil & Gas, Teledyne Water Quality, Teledyne Microwave Solutions, Teledyne HiRel Electronics and Teledyne Advanced Chemistry Systems.

Products are also advertised in appropriate trade journals and by means of various websites.  To promote our products and other capabilities, our personnel regularly participate in relevant trade shows and professional associations.

Many of our government contracts are awarded after a competitive bidding process in which we seek to emphasize our ability to provide superior products and technical solutions in addition to competitive pricing.

Through Teledyne Technologies International Corp. and other subsidiaries, we have established offices in foreign countries to facilitate international sales for various businesses. Locations include Brazil, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates.

Competition

We believe that technological capabilities and innovation and the ability to invest in the development of new and enhanced products are critical to obtaining and maintaining leadership in our markets and the industries in which we compete.  Although we have certain advantages that we believe help us compete effectively in our markets, each of our markets is highly competitive.  With regard to our defense businesses, it is common in the defense industry for work on programs to be shared among a number of companies, including competitors.  In any event, because of the diversity of products sold and the number of markets we serve, we encounter a wide variety of competitors, none of which we believe offer all of the same product and service lines or serve all of the same markets as we do.  Our businesses vigorously compete on the basis of quality, product performance and reliability, technical expertise, price and service. Many of our competitors have, and potential competitors could have, greater name recognition, a larger installed base of products, more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial, technological and personnel resources than we do.

Research and Development

Our research and development efforts primarily involve engineering and design related to improving existing products and developing new products and technologies in the same or similar fields.  We incurred a total of

$508.4 million

in


,

$458.3 million

in


and

$476.6 million

in


on research and development and bid and proposal costs.  Customer-funded research and development, most of which was attributable to work under contracts with the U.S. Government, represented approximately

65%

,

63%

and

66%

of total research and development and bid and proposal costs for


,


and


, respectively.

In


, we incurred

$177.7 million

in Company-funded research and development and bid and proposal costs.  We expect the level of Company-funded research and development and bid and proposal costs to be approximately

$180.0 million

in 2018.

Intellectual Property

While we own and control various intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, confidential information, trademarks, trade names, and copyrights, which, in the aggregate, are of material importance to our business, we believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent upon any one intellectual property or related group of such properties.  We own several hundred active patents and are licensed to use certain patents, technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others.  Similarly, other companies are licensed to use certain patents, technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by us.

Patents, patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law, in accordance with their terms or otherwise.  We do not expect the expiration or termination of these patents, patent applications and license agreements to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.



Employees

We consider our relations with our employees to be good.  At

December 31, 2017

, our total workforce consisted of approximately

10,340

employees, of which approximately

6,760

employees were located in the United States.

Executive Officers of the Registrant

Teledyne’s executive management includes:



*

Such officers are subject to the reporting and other requirements of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Dr. Robert Mehrabian and Teledyne are parties to a Fifth Amended and Restated Employment Agreement dated as of October 22, 2013, which was amended on September 28, 2015.  Under the amended agreement, we will employ Dr. Mehrabian as the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Teledyne through December 31, 2019, at an annual base salary that is currently $995,000. The agreement provides that Dr. Mehrabian is entitled to participate in Teledyne’s annual incentive bonus plan (“AIP”) and other executive compensation and benefit programs. The agreement provides Dr. Mehrabian with a non-qualified pension arrangement, under which Teledyne will pay him annually starting six months following his retirement and for a period of 10 years, as payments supplemental to any accrued pension under our qualified pension plan, an amount equal to 50% of his base compensation as in effect on retirement.

Ten current members of management have entered into change of control severance agreements. The agreements have a three-year, automatically renewing term, except as noted below. The executive is entitled to severance benefits if (1) there is a change in control of the Company and (2) within three months before or 24 months after the change in control, either we terminate the executive’s employment for reasons other than cause or the executive terminates the employment for good reason. “Severance benefits” currently consist of:

•

A cash payment equal to three times in the case of Dr. Mehrabian or two times in the other cases the sum of (i) the executive’s highest annual base salary within the year preceding the change in control and (ii) the Annual Incentive Plan bonus target for the year in which the change in control occurs or the average actual bonus payout for the three years immediately preceding the change in control, whichever is higher.

•

A cash payment for the current Annual Incentive Plan bonus cycle based on the fraction of the year worked times the Annual Incentive Plan target objectives at 100%.

•

Payment in cash for unpaid performance share program awards, assuming applicable goals are met, at 120% of performance targets.

•

Continued equivalent health and welfare (e.g., medical, dental, vision, life insurance and disability) benefits at our expense for a period of up to 36 months (24 months in some agreements) after termination (with the executive bearing any portion of the cost the executive bore prior to the change in control); provided, however, such benefits would be discontinued to the extent the executive receives similar benefits from a subsequent employer.

•

Removal of restrictions on restricted stock issued under our restricted stock award programs.



•

Full vesting under the Company’s pension plans (within legal parameters) such that the executive shall be entitled to receive the full accrued benefit under all such plans in effect as of the date of the change in control, without any actuarial reduction for early payment.

•

Up to $25,000 ($15,000 in some agreements) reimbursement for actual professional outplacement services.

•

Immediate vesting of all stock options, with options being exercisable for the full remainder of the term.

•

There is no “gross up payment” to hold the executive harmless against the impact, if any, of federal excise taxes imposed on executive as a result of “excess parachute” payments as defined in Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code. The executive will receive the better of, on an after-tax basis, (a) the unreduced excess parachute payment with no tax gross up payment, or (b) a parachute payment reduced to a level below which an excise tax is imposed.

•

Certain payments are deferred for six months following a separation of service to assure compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.

The Company has entered into individual Indemnification Agreements with directors and certain officers and executives of Teledyne, including those members of Executive Management listed above. The Indemnification Agreements provide the directors and executives who are parties to the agreements with a stand-alone contractual right to indemnification and expense advancement to the greatest extent allowable under Delaware law. The Indemnification Agreements also provide:

•

In a third-party proceeding, an indemnitee is entitled to indemnification if the indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company and, if in a criminal action or proceeding, if the indemnitee had no reason to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful. In a third party proceeding, the indemnification obligation covers reasonable expenses, judgment fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the indemnity.

•

In proceedings by or in the name of the Company (e.g., derivative suits), an indemnitee is entitled to indemnification if the indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company. In derivative suits, the indemnification obligation covers reasonable expenses, but in proceedings where the Company is alleging harm caused by the indemnitee, the indemnitee would generally not be entitled to be indemnified for judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement (otherwise the Company would effectively not recover any damages), unless a Delaware or other court determines otherwise despite the finding of liability.

•

The Company has an obligation to advance, on an unsecured and interest free basis, reasonable expenses incurred by the indemnitee within 30 days of the indemnitee’s request. The indemnitee does not need to meet any standard of conduct to be entitled to advancement of expenses and there is no determination requirement to be made by the Board in connection with the advancements of expenses. An indemnity must repay any amounts advanced if it ultimately determined that the indemnity is not entitled to indemnification.

Our indemnification obligations do not cover the following situations: (1) where indemnification payments have been made under director’s and officer’s insurance or other indemnification provisions; (2) where the claim is based on disgorgement of short-swing profits under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act; (3) where the claim is based on reimbursement by the indemnitee to the Company of a bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation if required under the Exchange Act (e.g., in connection with a restatement as a result of the Company’s noncompliance with the financial reporting requirements required by Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act); or (4) where the proceeding is initiated by the indemnitee (other than proceedings that are consented to by the Board or that the indemnitee initiates against the Company to enforce the Agreement).

Under the Indemnification Agreements, in the event of a change in control or we reduce or do not renew our director’s and officer’s insurance coverage, we are required to purchase (or cause the acquirer or successor to the Company to purchase or maintain) a six-year tail policy, subject to a 200% premium cap. The agreements continue until the later of (i) 10 years after the indemnitee ceases to serve as a director or officer, and (ii) one year following the final termination of any proceeding subject to the agreement.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

Risk Factors; Cautionary Statement as to Forward-Looking Statements

The following text highlights various risks and uncertainties associated with Teledyne.  These factors could materially affect “forward-looking statements” (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) that we may make from time to time, including forward-looking statements contained in “Item 1. Business” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Form 10-K and in Teledyne’s


Annual Report to Stockholders.  It is not possible for management to predict all such factors, and new factors may emerge.  Additionally, management cannot assess the impact of each such factor on Teledyne or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

A new global recession, continued economic uncertainty in Europe or an economic downturn in China may adversely affect us.

If another global recession emerges, if economic uncertainty in Europe continues or worsens, or if economic growth in China substantially slows, we may experience declines in revenues, profitability and cash flows from reduced orders, payment delays, collection difficulties, increased price pressures for our products, increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories or other factors caused by the economic problems of customers.   If negative conditions in the global credit markets prevent our customers’ access to credit or render them insolvent, orders for our products may decrease, which would result in lower revenue.  Likewise, if our suppliers face challenges in obtaining credit, in selling their products, or otherwise in operating their businesses or remaining solvent, they may become unable to offer the materials we use to manufacture our products.  These events could adversely impact our ability to manufacture affected products and could also result in reductions in our revenue, increased price competition, and increased operating costs, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

We develop and manufacture products for customers in the energy exploration and production markets, domestic and international commercial aerospace markets, the semiconductor industry, the consumer electronics, telecommunications and automotive industries, each of which has been cyclical, exhibited rapid changes and suffered from fluctuating market demands. A cyclical downturn in these markets may materially affect future operating results.  In 2015 and 2016, for example, our revenue and income were negatively impacted by the downturn in energy markets.

In addition, we sell products and services to customers in industries that are sensitive to the level of general economic activity and consumer spending habits and in more mature industries that are sensitive to capacity.  Adverse economic conditions affecting these industries may reduce demand for our products and services, which may reduce our revenues, profits or production levels.  Some of our businesses serve industries such as power generation and petrochemical refining, which may be negatively impacted in the event of future reductions in global capital expenditures and manufacturing capacity.

A material amount of our total revenues is derived from companies in the oil and gas industry, especially the offshore oil and gas industry, a historically cyclical industry with levels of activity that are significantly affected by the levels and volatility of oil and gas prices.

A material amount of our total revenues is derived from customers in or connected to the oil and gas exploration, development and production, especially the offshore oil and gas industry.  One of our largest commercial customers is in the offshore oil and gas industry and accounted for

2.3%

of total sales in


.  In 2017 and 2016, no commercial customer in the offshore oil and gas industry accounted for more than 2% of total sales.  The oil and gas industry is a historically cyclical industry characterized by significant changes in the levels of exploration and development activities.  In 2014 and again in 2015



and 2016, the price of Brent crude oil experienced dramatic declines, from a high of $116 per barrel in June 2014, to a low of $27 per barrel in January 2016 and was approximately $67 per barrel at the end of 2017.  Oil and gas prices, and market expectations of potential changes in those prices, significantly affect the levels of those activities.  Worldwide political, economic and military events have contributed to oil and gas price volatility and are likely to continue to do so in the future.  Any prolonged reduction in the overall level of offshore oil and gas exploration and development activities, whether resulting from changes in oil and gas prices or otherwise, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations of our businesses within our Instrumentation  segment.

Some factors that have affected and are likely to continue affecting oil and gas prices and the level of demand for our services and products include the following:

•

worldwide demand for oil and gas;

•

general economic and business conditions and industry trends;

•

the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, to set and maintain production levels;

•

the level of production by non-OPEC countries;

•

the ability of oil and gas companies to generate funds for capital expenditures;

•

domestic and foreign tax policy;

•

laws and governmental regulations that restrict exploration and development of oil and gas in various offshore jurisdictions;

•

laws and governmental regulation that restrict the use of hydraulic fracturing;

•

technological changes;

•

the political environment of oil-producing regions;

•

the price and availability of alternative fuels; and

•

climate change regulation that provide incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources.

Teledyne manufactures seismic sources, interconnects and data acquisition products used in offshore energy exploration.  When crude oil and natural gas prices are low, the level of marine seismic exploration activity typically decreases, potentially resulting in reduced demand for our products used in offshore energy exploration.  In addition, a decline in the level of capital spending by oil and natural gas companies may result in a reduced pace of development of new energy reserves, which could adversely affect demand for our products related to energy production, and, in certain instances, result in the cancellation, modification or rescheduling of existing orders.

With the 2017 acquisition of e2v, the risk profile of Teledyne may differ materially from prior years, which could materially change our results of operations.

On March 28, 2017, Teledyne acquired e2v, a leading designer, developer and manufacturer of radio frequency (“RF”) power systems, imaging solutions and semiconductors to the aerospace, security and defense, space, medical, scientific and industrial markets. e2v is headquartered in the United Kingdom, with key operations in the United Kingdom, France, the United States and Spain.  As a result of the acquisition of e2v, a greater percentage of Teledyne’s revenues and expenses arise from international sources.  The acquisition also significantly expands Teledyne’s international employee base and manufacturing footprint.  As a result of the acquisition of e2v, the financial results of Teledyne are more exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations and an increased proportion of assets, liabilities and earnings are denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies.  Following the acquisition, a significant proportion of Teledyne’s net assets, expenses and income are in non-U.S. dollar currencies, primarily the British pound, the Canadian dollar and the euro, while Teledyne’s financial results are presented in U.S. dollars. Teledyne’s financial results and capital ratios are therefore more sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates as a result of the acquisition.  A depreciation of non-U.S. dollar currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have an adverse impact on the combined company’s financial results.

While most of the products made and markets served by e2v are complementary to Teledyne, the acquisition of e2v expanded the size of Teledyne’s Digital Imaging segment relative to its other segments.  Continued innovation and research and development efforts will be required to maintain e2v’s leadership position in imaging products and semiconductor production. e2v’s business also may be more capital intensive than many of Teledyne’s other businesses, increasing Teledyne’s capital requirements.  Approximately 20 percent of e2v’s revenue relates to long-term contracts, many of which involve advancements in technology and are fixed price.  As discussed below, an inherent risk in fixed price contracts is that actual performance costs may exceed the projected costs on which the contracts are agreed.  The failure to anticipate technical problems, estimate costs accurately or control costs during the performance of a fixed price contract can reduce its profitability or result in a loss.



We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of e2v, or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected.

Even if the operations of the businesses of the Teledyne and e2v are integrated successfully, we may not realize the full benefits of the acquisition, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect, or the full benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all.  Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the two businesses.  All of these factors could adversely affect our earnings, decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition, or negatively impact the price of our common stock.  As a result, we cannot assure that the combination of Teledyne’s and e2v’s businesses will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the acquisition.

Our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with our covenants that apply to our indebtedness, could materially and adversely affect our business.

As of

December 31, 2017

, we had

$1,068.2 million

in total outstanding indebtedness.  This indebtedness included

$325.0 million

in senior unsecured notes,

$300.0 million

in Euro denominated notes,

$175.5 million

in term loans and

$165.0 million

outstanding under our

$750.0 million

2015-amended credit facility.  Our indebtedness could harm our business by, among other things, reducing the funds available to make acquisitions, capital expenditures, stock repurchases, or reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions.  Our indebtedness exposes us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates.  Our indebtedness could also have a material adverse effect on our business by increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business. General adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business could result in our inability to repay this indebtedness in a timely manner.

We are subject to the risks associated with international sales and international operations, which could harm our business or results of operations.

During


, sales to international customers accounted for approximately

46%

of our total revenues, compared with

43%

in


and

44%

in


.  In


, we sold products to customers in over 100 countries.  In


, the top five countries for international sales were

China

, the

United Kingdom

,

Germany

,

Japan

and

South Korea

, constituting approximately

21%

of our total sales.  Our acquisitions, including e2v in 2017 contributed to greater international sales and operations.  We anticipate that future sales to international customers will continue to account for a significant and increasing percentage of our revenues, particularly since business and growth plans for many Teledyne businesses focus on sales outside of the United States, including to emerging markets such as China, Brazil and West Africa.

Risks associated with international sales include, but are not limited to:

•

political and economic instability;

•

international terrorism;

•

export controls, including U.S. export controls related to China, sanctions related to Russia, and increased scrutiny of exports of marine instruments, digital imaging and other products;

•

changes in legal and regulatory requirements;

•

U.S. and foreign government policy changes affecting the markets for our products;

•

changes in tax laws and tariffs;

•

changes in U.S. - China and U.S. - Russia relations;

•

difficulties in protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights;

•

transportation, including piracy in international waters; and

•

exchange rate fluctuations.

Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Exchange rate fluctuations may negatively affect the cost of our products to international customers and therefore reduce our competitive position.  Given our several Canada-based businesses, volatility in the value of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar, or other foreign currencies, could adversely affect the business, operations and the financial condition of our Digital Imaging segment.

In June 2016, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (“E.U.”), commonly referred to as “Brexit.”  The announcement of Brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business.  The announcement of Brexit and the pending withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. may also create further global economic uncertainty, which may adversely impact the economies of the U.K., the E.U. countries and other nations, may cause our current and future customers to reduce their spending on our products and services, and may cause certain E.U.-based customers to source products from businesses based outside of the U.K.  For example, Brexit-related uncertainty could lead to a reconsideration by Airbus as to future investment and spending in the U.K., which could reduce sales for our U.K.-based businesses that supply Airbus.  Potential Brexit-related risks for our U.K.-based businesses also



include increased import duties, loss of customers in the E.U. delays in the movement of goods between the U.K. and the E.U. and loss of access to the E.U. labor pool.  Given our several U.K.-based businesses, including our 2017 acquisition of e2v, volatility in the value of the British pound relative to the U.S. dollar, or other foreign currencies, could increase the cost of raw materials and components for our U.K.-based businesses and could otherwise adversely affect the business, operations and the financial condition of our UK-based businesses.

Regional independence movements in Scotland and Spain could also adversely impact our businesses located in those jurisdictions.

Sales of our products and services internationally are subject to U.S. and local government regulations and procurement policies and practices including regulations relating to import-export control.  Violations of export control rules could result in the impositions of fines and penalties or the suspension of our ability to export items from one or more businesses or the entire corporation.  Depending on the scope of the suspension, this could have a material effect on our ability to perform certain international contracts.  Attempts by the Presidential Administration to withdraw from or materially modify international trade agreements could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Among other things, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from bribing foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment.  Further, in 2011, the United Kingdom also implemented the U.K. Bribery Act, which increased the level of anti-bribery law enforcement and compliance relative to the FCPA. Any determination that we had violated the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act, or equivalent anti-bribery and corruption laws in countries in which we do business could result in sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  While we have procedures and compliance programs in place and conduct FCPA and other trainings, we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls will always protect us from misconduct by our employees, agents or business partners.

Our international operations are subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations, including interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers, changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, consequences from changes in tax laws and regulatory requirements, difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, differing labor regulations, differing protection of intellectual property and geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war.  We are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales and expenses, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency, and may also become subject to interest rate risk inherent in any debt we incur, or financial investments we hold.

The E.U. adopted a comprehensive General Data Privacy Regulation (the “GDPR”) in May 2016 and which will become fully effective in May 2018.  The GDPR requires companies to satisfy new requirements regarding the handling of personal and sensitive data, including its use, protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves.  Failure to comply with GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue.  The GDPR and other similar laws and regulations, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions, may be costly to comply with, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject us to remedies that may harm our business, including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices.

Acquisitions involve inherent risks that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.

Our growth strategy includes acquisitions. Acquisitions involve various inherent risks, such as:

•

our ability to assess accurately the value, strengths, weaknesses, internal controls, contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates;

•

the potential loss of key personnel of an acquired business;

•

our ability to integrate acquired businesses and to achieve identified financial, operating and other synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition;

•

our ability to assess, integrate and implement internal controls of acquired businesses in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;

•

the distraction of management resulting from the need to integrate acquired businesses;

•

increased competition for acquisition targets, which may increase acquisition costs;

•

the potential impairment of assets;

•

potential unknown liabilities associated with a business we acquire or in which we invest, including environmental liabilities;

•

the risks associated with acquiring privately-held companies, which generally do not have as formal or comprehensive internal controls and compliance systems in place as public companies;

•

production delays associated with consolidating acquired facilities and manufacturing operations;



•

risks associated with owning and operating businesses internationally, including those arising from U.S. and foreign government policy changes or actions and exchange rate fluctuations; and

•

unanticipated changes in business and economic conditions affecting an acquired business.

While we conduct financial and other due diligence in connection with our acquisitions and generally seek some form of protection, including indemnification from a seller and sometimes an escrow of a portion of the purchase price to cover potential issues, such acquired companies may have weaknesses or liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition.  Further, indemnities or escrows may not fully cover such matters, particularly matters identified after a closing.

As they have over the last few years, acquisitions may also change the nature and level of various risks faced by Teledyne.  As noted above, our 2017 acquisition of e2v increases our international presence and the percentage of sales related to the Digital Imaging segment. These acquisitions, coupled with our other recently acquired companies, located outside of the United States, also increased the percentage of revenues and expenses that arise from international sources and consequently our exposure to U.S. and foreign policy changes and exchange rate fluctuations.  Additionally, the businesses of e2v and DALSA are more capital intensive than other Teledyne businesses, which could result in increasing Teledyne’s capital requirements.

Under SEC rules, Teledyne must issue a report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting.  The SEC permits a limited time-based exclusion for acquisitions to give a company an opportunity to evaluate more fully the internal controls of acquired companies and correct deficiencies and institute new or additional internal controls.  Our 2017 management’s report specifically excludes from its scope and coverage our 2017 acquisitions of e2v and SSI assets, allowing us additional time to evaluate existing internal controls and implement additional controls as appropriate.  With regard to future acquisitions, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to provide a report that contains no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses with respect to these acquired companies or other acquisitions.

In connection with our acquisitions, including ones which we do not complete, we may incur significant transaction costs. We are required to expense, as incurred, such transaction costs, which may have a material adverse impact on our quarterly financial results.  Further, the acquisitions of U.S. public companies, such as Bolt and LeCroy, routinely trigger purported class action lawsuits, filed by shareholders of the target companies, the defense of which has increased transaction costs, among other things.

Changes in future business conditions could cause business investments, goodwill and other long-lived assets to become impaired, resulting in significant losses and write-downs that would reduce our operating income.

On

December 31, 2017

, Teledyne’s goodwill was

$1,776.7 million

and net acquired intangible assets were

$398.9 million

.   Under current accounting guidance, we are required to test annually both acquired goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment based upon a fair value approach, rather than amortizing them over time.  We have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year.  We also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value.  These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, including a significant sustained decline in an entity’s market value, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business, or other factors.  If the fair market value is less than the carrying value, including goodwill, we could be required to record an impairment charge. The valuation of reporting units requires judgment in estimating future cash flows, discount rates and estimated product life cycles.  In making these judgments, we evaluate the financial health of the business, including such factors as industry performance, changes in technology and operating cash flows.  As we have grown through acquisitions, the amount of goodwill and net acquired intangible assets is a significant portion of our total assets.  As a result, the amount of any annual or interim impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken.  We also may be required to record an earnings charge or incur unanticipated expenses if, as a result of a change in strategy or other reason, we were to determine the value of other assets had been impaired.



United States and global responses to terrorism, concerns regarding nuclear proliferation and the safety of nuclear energy, continuing turmoil in Middle Eastern countries, increasing tension between the U.S. and Russia, potential hostilities involving North Korea, potential epidemics, potential future financial issues impacting airlines and volatile energy prices increase uncertainties with respect to many of our businesses and may adversely affect our business and results of operations.

United States’ and global responses to terrorism, continuing turmoil in Middle Eastern countries and nuclear proliferation concerns increase uncertainties with respect to U.S. and other business and financial markets and could adversely affect our business and operations.  Increasing tensions with Russia or the evolving nuclear threat from North Korea could disrupt the global economic recovery.

Air travel declines have occurred after terrorist attacks and heightened security alerts, as well as after the high-profile outbreaks of disease.  Travel by our sales and service personnel to various regions has been affected by such factors.  Additional declines in air travel resulting from such factors and other factors could adversely affect the financial condition of many of our commercial airline and aircraft manufacturer customers and, in turn, could adversely affect our Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment.  Terrorist attacks in Spain in 2017 and Paris in 2015 or the Syrian refugee crisis could result in governments in Europe imposing greater restrictions on the movement of personnel or goods, which could adversely impact our businesses located within the European Union or our ability to sell products in that region.  In addition, a prolonged virus epidemic or pandemic, or the threat thereof, could result in worker absences, lower productivity, voluntary closure of our offices and manufacturing facilities, disruptions in our supply chain, travel restrictions on our employees, and other disruptions to our businesses.  Moreover, health epidemics may force local health and government authorities to mandate the temporary closure of our offices and manufacturing facilities.

A future deterioration of financial performance of airlines could result in a reduction of discretionary spending for upgrades of avionics and in-flight communications equipment, which would adversely affect our Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment.

Higher oil prices could adversely affect commercial airline-related customers of our Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment.  Conversely, lower oil prices have decreased oil exploration and petrochemical refining activities and have hindered our marine and other instrumentation businesses.  In addition, instability in the Middle East or other oil-producing regions could adversely affect expansion plans of the oil and gas industry customers of our instrumentation and cable solutions businesses.

Our revenue from government contracts subjects us to many risks:

Our revenue from U.S. government contracts depends on the continued availability of funding from the U.S. Government, and, accordingly, we have the risk that funding for our existing contracts may be canceled or diverted to other uses or delayed.

We perform work on a number of contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense and other agencies and departments of the U.S. Government including sub-contracts with government prime contractors.  Sales under contracts with the U.S. Government as a whole, including sales under contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense, as prime contractor or subcontractor, represented approximately

24%

of our total revenue in


, compared with

27%

in


and

26%

in


.  Performance under government contracts has inherent risks that could have a material effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of Congressional appropriations and the failure of Congress to appropriate funds for programs in which we participate could negatively affect our results of operations.  The U.S. Government shutdown during 2013 negatively affected many of our businesses, and the failure by Congress to approve future budgets on a timely basis could delay procurement of our products and services and cause us to lose future revenues.  Any renewed emphasis on Federal deficit and debt reduction could lead to a further decrease in overall defense spending.  The continued war on terrorism also could result in a diversion of funds from programs in which Teledyne participates.  Budgetary concerns could result in future contracts being awarded more on price than on other competitive factors, and smaller defense budgets could result in government in-sourcing of programs and more intense competition on programs that are not in-sourced, which could result in lower revenues and profits.

The sequestration provision of the Budget Control Act of 2011 originally imposed $500.0 billion of defense cuts over nine years starting in fiscal year 2013, which represented approximately 9% of planned defense funding over the period.  On November 2, 2015, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (the “Budget Act”) was signed into law.  The Budget Act raises the statutory limit on the amount of permissible federal debt (the debt ceiling) until March 2017 and raises the sequester caps imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011 by $80.0 billion, split equally between defense and domestic spending ($50.0 billion in government fiscal year 2016 and $30.0 billion in government fiscal year 2017).  The President signed a continuing resolution in September 2016, which was extended in December 2016, and provided funding for the U.S. Government at fiscal



2016 levels through April 28, 2017.  In May 2017, the President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017 for appropriations through September 30, 2017.  Congress has yet to pass a budget for the U.S. Government’s fiscal year 2018, but, to date, the Government has continued to operate through continuing resolutions.  Uncertainty around the budget process delays new programs.  The total statutory spending cap remains at $1.1 trillion as set by the relief authorized in 2016 and 2017 by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 to the original sequestration specified by the Budget Act of 2011, which set discretionary caps through 2021.

Although the President has indicated his desire for increased defense spending, continued defense spending does not necessarily correlate to continued business for us, because not all of the programs in which we participate or have current capabilities may be provided with continued funding.  Changes in policy and budget priorities by the President, his Administration and the U.S. Congress for various Defense and NASA programs could continue to impact our Engineered Systems, Aerospace and Defense Electronics and Digital Imaging segments.  For example, changes in national space policy that affect NASA’s budget have occurred.  There have also been significant reductions in missile defense budgets.  Our Turbine Engines business, which is part of our Engineered Systems segment, is being impacted by delays in production runs under the Harpoon missile programs, and may be impacted by U.S. Department of Defense directives to introduce competitive bidding for programs on which we have previously served as sole source.  The JASSM missile program comes to an end in mid-2018.  The President has expressed concern over the cost of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. Our Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment may be impacted by volume and/or price reductions in connection with this program, to the extent they are imposed.  The timing of program cycles can affect our results of operations for a particular quarter or year, and cancellations of significant programs such as the Objective Simulation Framework (“OSF”) Littoral Combat Ship Gun Mission Modules or the Shallow Water Combat Submersible (“SWCS”) would affect our results.  It is also not uncommon for the U.S. Department of Defense to delay the timing of awards for major programs for six to twelve months.  Reductions and delays in research and development funding by the U.S. Government may continue to impact our revenues.  As DARPA reviews its programs aimed to technologically enhance U.S. military capabilities and national security, changes to the DARPA research and technology development programs in which we participate could occur.  Uncertainty over budgets or priorities with the Presidential Administration could result in  delays in funding, changes in funded programs and the timing of awards that could have a material impact on our revenues in 2018.  Finally, various U.S. Department of Defense initiatives, such as the emphasis on in-sourcing positions to the Government and anticipated reductions or cancellations of existing programs, could negatively impact our Engineered Systems segment.

Our participation in government programs may decrease or be subject to renegotiation as those programs evolve over time.

The U.S. Government has been placing emphasis on small business quotas and increasing small business contract set asides and minimum work percentages.  In some cases, prime contractors are required to reduce participation by large subcontractors like Teledyne in order to fill small business quotas and be responsive to proposals and bids.  As a result, our Engineered Systems segment could be significantly impacted.

Over time, and for a variety of reasons, programs can evolve and affect the extent of our participation.  We have been a significant participant in NASA programs, primarily through our Engineered Systems segment and through Teledyne Scientific Company. The prior Administration introduced significant changes to the national space policy, including the cancellation of the NASA’s Constellation Program which includes Ares launch vehicles.  Teledyne Brown Engineering has developed the Multi User System for Earth Sensing (“MUSES”) platform as part of our commercial space business.  The MUSES platform provides opportunities for imaging, technology demonstrations, and space qualification of payloads supporting research, scientific studies, humanitarian efforts for both government and commercial customers.  The MUSES platform depends on continued operation of the ISS, and we may not be successful in developing the technology or commercial relationships necessary to make this investment profitable.  While MUSES is now operational on the ISS, the delay in launch of equipment for use on the MUSES platform could have an adverse impact on the investment return on the platform.  The launch of MUSES was delayed in 2017 by launch failures of SpaceX.  Future launch failures could impact future instruments designed for this platform.  In early 2014, we were awarded a five-year $60.0 million contract by NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center to develop and manufacture the Launch Vehicle Stage Adapter for the Space Launch System, but failure to further transition our business successfully could result in reduced sales.  In addition, delayed funding and changes in support for NASA’s current space policy could negatively impact our business.  The Presidential Administration could also lead to changes to the nation’s space policy, some or all of which could materially impact our results.

Our contracts with the U.S. Government are subject to termination rights that could adversely affect us.

Most of our U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the U.S. Government either at its convenience or upon the default of the contractor.  Termination for convenience provisions provide only for the recovery of costs incurred or committed, settlement expenses, and profit on work completed prior to termination.  Termination for default clauses impose liability on the contractor for excess costs incurred by the U.S. Government in re-procuring undelivered items from another source.  We had

nine

U.S. Government contracts terminated for convenience in


, compared with

one

in


and

eight

in




.  No contracts were terminated for default during such three-year period.

We may lose money or generate less than expected profits on our fixed-price and other government contracts and we may lose money if we fail to meet certain pre-specified targets in government contracts.

There is no guarantee that U.S. Government contracts will be profitable.  A number of our U.S. Government prime contracts and subcontracts are fixed-price type contracts (

58%

of our total U.S. Government contracts were fixed-price in


,

54%

in


and

54%

in


).  Under these types of contracts, we bear the inherent risk that actual performance cost may exceed the fixed contract price.  Under such contracts, we must absorb cost overruns, notwithstanding the difficulty of estimating all of the costs we will incur in performing these contracts.  We cannot assure that our contract loss provisions in our financial statements will be adequate to cover all actual future losses.  We may lose money or generate lower profits on some contracts if we fail to meet these estimates.  We may also lose money on non-fixed price, cost-reimbursement contracts that contain dis-incentives or penalties related to cost, schedule or performance.

Our business is subject to government contracting regulations, including increasingly complex regulations on cybersecurity and our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm our operating results and prospects.

We, like other government contractors, are subject to various audits, reviews and investigations (including private party “whistleblower” lawsuits) relating to our compliance with federal and state laws.  More routinely, the U.S. Government may audit the costs we incur on our U.S. Government contracts, including allocated indirect costs.  Such audits could result in adjustments to our contract costs.  Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, and such costs already reimbursed would need to be refunded.  We have recorded contract revenues based upon costs we expect to realize on final audit.  In a worst case scenario, should a business or division involved be charged with wrongdoing, or should the U.S. Government determine that the business or division is not a “presently responsible contractor”, that business or division, and conceivably our Company as a whole, could be temporarily suspended or, in the event of a conviction, could be debarred for up to three years from receiving new government contracts or government-approved subcontracts.  In addition, we could expend substantial amounts defending against such charges and in damages, fines and penalties if such charges were proven or were to result in negotiated settlements.  The Department of Defense as well as other U.S. Government contracting agencies have adopted new rules and regulations requiring contractors to implement a set of cyber security measures to attain the safeguarding of contractor systems that process, store, or transmit certain information.  Implementation and compliance with these new cyber security requirements is complex and costly, and could result in unforeseen expenses, lower profitability and, in the case of non-compliance, penalties and damages, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business.

Our pension expense and the value of our pension assets are affected by factors outside of our control, including the performance of plan assets, the stock market, interest rates and actuarial experience.

We have a domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan covering most of our U.S. employees hired prior to 2004 or approximately

13%

of our active employees.  We also have several smaller domestic and foreign-based pension plans.  As of December 31, 2017, the value of the combined pension assets is greater than our combined pension benefit obligations. The accounting rules applicable to our pension plans require that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis, rather than as contributions are made to the plan.  Two significant elements in determining our pension income or pension expense are the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate used in projecting pension benefit obligations.  Declines in the stock market and lower rates of return could increase required contributions to our qualified pension plan and/or result in a change to shareholders’ equity.  Our investment strategy may not produce the expected returns if the credit, financial or stock markets deteriorate. Any decreases or increases in market interest rates will affect the discount rate assumption used in projecting pension benefit obligations.  In addition, changes in other actuarial assumptions such as mortality assumptions or change due to legislative or regulatory actions could impact our pension income or expense as well as funding obligations.  Each year beginning with 2014, the Society of Actuaries released revised mortality tables, which updated life expectancy assumptions.  In consideration of these tables, each year we review  the mortality assumptions used in determining our pension and post-retirement benefit obligations.  The impact of these mortality assumptions could increase our pension obligation and increase future pension expense.  In 2013, we made a voluntary pretax cash contribution of

$83.0 million

to the domestic pension plan.  No contributions were made to the domestic pension plan since the 2013 contribution.  If, and to the extent, decreases in our pension assets are not offset by voluntary contributions, recovered through future asset returns, mitigated by an increase in the rate at which the benefit obligation is discounted, or other actions, our required cash contributions and pension expense could increase under the plans.  In addition, we have sold approximately $46.1 million in pension liability to third parties in recent years.  To the extent any of these counterparties are unable to fulfill their obligations to retirees, we may have residual liability.  For additional discussion of pension matters, see the discussion under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” and Notes 2 and 11 to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



Our business and operations could suffer in the event of cyber security breaches.

Attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems have become more sophisticated and are sometimes successful.  These attempts, which might be related to industrial or foreign government espionage, activism, or other motivations, include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks, performing reconnaissance, impersonating authorized users, stealing, corrupting or restricting our access to data, among other activities.  We continue to update our infrastructure, security tools and processes to protect against security incidents, including both external and internal threats, and to prevent their recurrence.  Company personnel and third parties have been tasked to detect and investigate such incidents, but it is possible that we might not prevent or be aware of an incident or its magnitude and effects.  The theft, corruption, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business.  We are subject to U.S. Department of Defense regulations applicable to certain types of data residing on or transiting through certain information systems, and we expect these regulations will be incorporated into certain contracts we hold.  To the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of confidential or controlled information of employees, third parties or the U.S. Government, or any of the deployed security controls are deemed insufficient, we may incur liability or the loss of contracts or security clearances as a result. In addition, we expect to continue devoting additional resources to the security of our information technology systems.   More resources may be required in the defense arena to the extent the U.S. Government increases its cyber security mandates.  Unauthorized access to or control of our products, devices or systems could impact the safely or our customers and other third parties which could result in legal claims against us.  Security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable U.S. and international privacy and other laws, including the GDPR, and subject us to private consumer or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability.

We may not have sufficient resources to fund all future research and development and capital expenditures or possible acquisitions.

In order to remain competitive, we must make substantial investments in research and development of new or enhanced products and continuously upgrade our process technology and manufacturing capabilities.  Our Teledyne Scientific Company subsidiary, which serves as our primary research center, has been actively promoting and funding joint research and development projects with other Teledyne businesses, including our Teledyne Oil & Gas businesses, Teledyne Reynolds, Inc., Teledyne Brown Engineering, Inc., DALSA and LeCroy.  The business of Teledyne e2v, for which the design and development of specialized technology for high performance systems and equipment is integral, also requires substantial investments in research and development.  Additionally, some of our businesses are actively pursuing governmental support and funding for some of their research and development initiatives, including DALSA with respect to its CMOS and uncooled infrared image sensor development efforts as well as the expansion of DALSA’s semiconductor foundry in Bromont, Quebec.  Nonetheless, we may be unable to fund all of our research and development and capital investment needs or possible acquisitions.  Our ability to raise additional capital will depend on a variety of factors, some of which will not be within our control, including the existence of bank and capital markets, investor perceptions of us, our businesses and the industries in which we operate, and general economic conditions.  Failure to successfully raise needed capital or generate cash flow on a timely or cost-effective basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue, which would adversely affect our profitability.

Limitations in customer funding for applied research and development and technology insertion projects and government support for research and development expenditures may reduce our ability to apply our ongoing investments in some market areas.

We may be unable to successfully introduce new and enhanced products in a timely and cost-effective manner or increase our participation in new markets, which could harm our profitability and prospects.

Our operating results depend in part on our ability to introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis.  In order to improve our product development capabilities we purchased the research center that is now Teledyne Scientific Company in 2006 and in 2011 we purchased DALSA, which has access to a well-equipped MEMS research and development center.  In 2013, we opened a 52,000-square-foot technology development center in Daytona Beach, Florida primarily to serve the offshore oil and gas production and exploration industries.  We are currently upgrading infrastructure at Teledyne e2v’s facility in Chelmsford, U.K. and subject to customer and governmental support, we are planning to expand Teledyne DALSA’s MEMS foundry in Bromont, Quebec.  Successful product development and introduction depend on numerous factors, including our ability to anticipate customer and market requirements, changes in technology and industry standards, our ability to differentiate our offerings from offerings of our competitors, and market acceptance.  We may not be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced products in a timely and cost-effective manner or to develop and introduce products that satisfy customer requirements.



Our new products also may not achieve market acceptance or correctly address new industry standards and technological changes.  We may also lose any technological advantage to competitors if we fail to develop new products in a timely manner.

Additionally, new products may trigger increased warranty costs as information on such products is augmented by actual usage.  Accelerated entry of new products to meet heightened market demand and competitive pressures may cause additional warranty costs as development and testing time periods might be accelerated or condensed.

We intend to both adapt our existing technologies and develop new products to expand into new market segments.  We may be unsuccessful in accessing these and other new markets if our products do not meet our customers’ requirements, as a result of changes in either technology and industry standards or because of actions taken by our competitors.

Technological change and evolving industry and regulatory standards could cause some of our products or services to become obsolete or non-competitive.

The markets for some of our products and services are characterized by rapid technological development, evolving industry standards, changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements.  A faster than anticipated change in one or more of the technologies related to our products or services, or in market demand for products or services based on a particular technology, could result in faster than anticipated obsolescence of certain of our products or services and could lead to reduced sales of those products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Currently accepted industry and regulatory standards are also subject to change, which may contribute to the obsolescence of our products or services.  Failure to comply CE marking directives may prevent some of our products from being sold into Europe and the cost to comply with these directives may make our products non-competitive.  The political agenda of the Presidential Administration may affect the level of environmental regulations and enforcement and government spending on scientific research, which could adversely impact the sales of our products and services, including sales of pollution monitoring instruments and instruments used to measure the Earth’s climate and climate change, such as undersea gliders and space-based imaging sensors.   A change in China's recent economic policies promoting pollution reduction could result in lower sales or slower sales growth for our pollution monitoring and laboratory instrumentation to that country.

We may not be able to reduce the costs of our products to satisfy customers’ cost reduction mandates, which could harm our sales or margins.

More and more customers continue to seek price reductions of our products.  While we continually work to reduce our manufacturing and other costs of our products, without affecting product quality and reliability, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so and do so in a timely manner to satisfy the pricing pressures of our customers.  Cost reductions of raw materials and other components used in our products may be beyond our control depending on market conditions. Customers may seek lower cost products from China and other developing countries where manufacturing costs are lower.

The airline industry is heavily regulated, and if we fail to comply with applicable requirements, our results of operations could suffer.

Governmental agencies throughout the world, including the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, or the FAA, prescribe standards and qualification requirements for aircraft components, including virtually all commercial airline and general aviation products.  Specific regulations vary from country to country, although compliance with FAA requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries.  If any material authorization or approval qualifying us to supply our products is revoked or suspended, then the sale of the product would be prohibited by law, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

From time to time, the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations, which are usually more stringent than existing regulations.  If these proposed regulations are adopted and enacted, we may incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Recent trends by China’s aviation authority to relax restrictions on airspace may be reversed, and anticipated new regulations loosening airspace restrictions may not materialize, which could impact the future prospects of our commercial aerospace businesses.

Increasing competition could reduce the demand for our products and services.

Each of our markets is highly competitive.  Many of our competitors have, and potential competitors could have, greater name recognition, a larger installed base of products, more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution capabilities and greater financial, technological and personnel resources than we do.  New or existing competitors may also develop new technologies that could adversely affect the demand for our products and services. In particular, we face increased competition with respect to the sale of our flight data acquisition systems, which may intensify as certain of our patents related to these products expire in 2018 and upcoming years.  We also face new competition for our protocol analyzers products.  Industry acquisition and consolidation trends, particularly among aerospace and defense contractors, have adversely impacted demand for our aerospace and defense related engineering services as large prime contractors in-source increased amounts of



major acquisition programs and also require significant expansion in small business participation to meet Government contracting goals.  Low-cost competition from China and other developing countries could also result in decreased demand for our products. Increasing competition could reduce the volume of our sales or the prices we may charge, which would negatively impact our revenues.  Smaller defense budgets both in the United States and Europe could result in additional competition for new and existing defense programs.

Product liability claims, product recalls and field service actions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition and we may have difficulty obtaining product liability and other insurance coverage.

As a manufacturer and distributor of a wide variety of products, including monitoring instruments, products used in offshore oil and gas production, products used in transportation and commercial aviation and products used in medical devices (most recently including X-ray detectors and generators), our results of operations are susceptible to adverse publicity regarding the quality or safety of our products.  In part, product liability claims challenging the safety of our products may result in a decline in sales for a particular product, which could adversely affect our results of operations.  This could be the case even if the claims themselves are proven untrue or settled for immaterial amounts.

While we have general liability and other insurance policies concerning product liabilities, we have self-insured retentions or deductibles under such policies with respect to a portion of these liabilities.  Awarded damages could be more than our accruals.  We could incur losses above the aggregate annual policy limit as well.  We cannot assure that, for 2018 and in future years, insurance carriers will be willing to renew coverage or provide new coverage for product liability.

Product recalls can be expensive and tarnish our reputation and have a material adverse effect on the sales of our products.  We cannot assure that we will not have additional product liability claims or that we will not recall any products.

We have been joined, among a number of defendants (often over 100), in lawsuits alleging injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos.  In addition, because of the prominent “Teledyne” name, we may continue to be mistakenly joined in lawsuits involving a company or business that was not assumed by us as part of our 1999 spin-off.  To date, we have not incurred material liabilities in connection with these lawsuits.  However, our historic insurance coverage, including that of its predecessors, may not fully cover such claims and the defense of such matters.  Coverage typically depends on the year of purported exposure and other factors.  Nonetheless, we intend to vigorously defend our position against these claims.

Certain gas generators historically manufactured by Teledyne Energy Systems, Inc. contained a sealed, wetted asbestos component.  While the company has transitioned to a replacement material, had placed warning labels on its products and took care in the handling of this discontinued material by employees, there is no assurance that the company will not face product liability or workers

’

compensation claims involving this component.

Our Teledyne Brown Engineering, Inc.’s laboratory in Knoxville, Tennessee performs radiological analyses.  Our Teledyne DALSA Professional Imaging unit develops image sensors used in medical and dental X-ray applications along with portable X-ray generators used in non-destructive testing and security applications.  In addition, our Teledyne DALSA Digital Imaging unit develops equipment and sensors used in eye examination and general surgical vision applications.  Errors and omissions in analyses may occur or erroneous images could be captured.  Our insurance coverage or indemnities may not be adequate to cover potential problems associated with faulty radiological analyses.

Teledyne Brown Engineering, Inc. and other Teledyne companies manufacture components for customers in the nuclear power market, including utilities and certain governmental entities.  Certain liabilities associated with such products are covered by the Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act and other statutory and common law defenses, and we have received indemnities from some of our customers.  However, there is no assurance we will not face product liability claims related to such products or that our exposure will not exceed the amounts for which we have liability coverage or protection.

Our business and financial results could be adversely affected by conditions and other factors associated with our suppliers.

Some items we purchase for the manufacture of our products are purchased from limited or single sources of supply due to technical capability, price and other factors.  For example, DALSA has a single source of supply for CCD semiconductor wafers used to assemble image sensors and an external single source of supply for CMOS semiconductor wafers used to assemble X-ray panel products.  LeCroy continues to outsource a portion of its research and development activities to a third party engineering firm in Malaysia where it may be more difficult for us to enforce our intellectual property rights.  We have also outsourced from time to time the manufacturing of certain parts, components, subsystems and even finished products to single or limited sources, including international sources.  Disruption of these sources or supplier-imposed rationing of scarce components could cause delays or reductions in shipments of our products or increases in our costs, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or operations.  International sources possess additional risks, some of which are similar to those described above in regard to international sales.  With any continuing disruption in the global economy and financial markets, some of our suppliers may also continue to face issues gaining access to sufficient credit and materials to



maintain their businesses, which could reduce the availability of some components and, to the extent such suppliers are single source suppliers, could adversely affect our ability to continue to manufacture and sell our products.  Continuing economic pressure on suppliers may also trigger increased pricing or workforce reductions or reduced workweeks and a shrinking supply base, possibly creating longer lead times to obtain needed components for our products, delays in material acceptance and a greater risk of receiving counterfeit parts.

Some of our commercial product lines may have one or a limited number of customers, the loss of which could adversely affect our business or financial results.

While no commercial customer accounted for more than 10% of our total sales during


,


and


and we have hundreds of customers in the various industries that we serve, some of our product lines may have one or a few key customers the loss of which could adversely affect our business or financial results.  In


, 2016 or 2015, no commercial customer accounted for more than

3.0%

of total sales.

Newer products, such as our X-ray generators and X-ray panel products, may initially be more heavily dependent on a singular or limited number of customers until market acceptance is obtained or due to contractual terms.  Similarly, some older product lines may be more heavily dependent on a singular or limited number of customers.  In either such case, program delays of such customer or customers, as well as the loss of such customer or customers, could adversely affect our business or financial results.

Weaker demand for coal and gas-fired power plants, as evidenced by recent restructurings at power asset divisions of General Electric and Siemens, could result in lower sales of our instruments, systems and services for liquid and air analysis, process management and emissions compliance.

We face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties that we do not control, which could harm our business.

We sell a portion of our products through third parties such as distributors, value-added resellers and OEMs (collectively “distributors”).  Using third parties for distribution exposes Teledyne to many risks, including concentration, credit risk and compliance risks.  We may rely on one or more key distributors for a product, and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue.  Distributors may face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivables and financial results.  Violations of the FCPA or similar anti-bribery laws by distributors or other third party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business.  Competitors could also block our access to key distributors.  Failing to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position, and could result in sanctions against us.

Compliance with increasing environmental and climate change regulations, as well as the effects of potential environmental liabilities, could have a material adverse financial effect on us.

We, like other industry participants, are subject to various federal, state, local and international environmental laws and regulations.  We may be subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future, particularly as greenhouse gas emissions and climate change regulations and initiatives increase.  Future developments, administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental and climate change matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.  Environmental regulations on hydraulic fracturing and the use of seismic energy sources for offshore energy exploration could adversely affect some product lines of our Instrumentation segment.

Our manufacturing operations, including former operations, could expose us to material environmental liabilities.  Additionally, companies we acquire may have environmental liabilities that are not accurately assessed or brought to our attention at the time of the acquisition.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has focused on greenhouse gases (“GHGs”), maintaining GHGs threaten the public health and welfare of the American people.  The EPA also maintains that GHG emissions from on-road vehicles contribute to that threat.  The EPA’s endangerment finding covers emissions of six greenhouse gases. The EPA’s continuing efforts to limit GHG emissions could adversely affect our U.S. manufacturing operations, increase prices for energy, fuel and transportation, require us to accommodate changes in parameters, such as the way parts are manufactured, and may, in some cases, require us to redesign certain of our products.  This, or other federal or state regulations, could lead to increased costs, which we may not be able to recover from customers, delays in product shipments and loss of market share to competitors.

For additional discussion of environmental matters, see the discussion under the caption “Other Matters - Environmental” of “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operation and Financial Condition” and Note 14 to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



Our inability to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our future success.

Our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.  We also have a maturing workforce.  Some of our businesses, including those in traveling wave tube design and development, draw from a pool of specialized engineering talent that is small and currently shrinking.  While we have engaged in succession planning, the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our failure to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We may not be able to sell, exit or reconfigure businesses, facilities or product lines that we determine no longer meet with our growth strategy or that should be consolidated.

Consistent with our strategy to emphasize growth in our core markets, we continually evaluate our businesses to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy.  This review led to the decision to sell the net assets of the Printed Circuit Technology (“PCT”) business in 2016 and the general aviation piston engine businesses in 2011.   Over the years we have also consolidated some of our business units and facilities, including to deal with downturns in the defense and oil and gas industries, among other reasons.   In 2015, we began to consolidate some of our marine instrumentation businesses units and facilities, and it continued through 2017.  The operations of Teledyne Cormon are currently being relocated from the United Kingdom to Daytona Beach, Florida.   In 2017, we closed our remaining relays operations in Tijuana, Mexico, and relocated them to our owned Teledyne Relays’ facility in Hawthorne, California.   We may not be able to realize efficiencies and cost savings from our consolidation activities.  There is no assurance that our efforts will be successful.  If we do not successfully manage our current consolidation activities, or any other similar activities that we may undertake in the future, expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted.  Our ability to dispose of, exit or reconfigure businesses that may no longer be aligned with our growth strategy will depend on many factors, including the terms and conditions of any asset purchase and sale agreement, as well as industry, business and economic conditions.  We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to sell non-strategic businesses on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.  In addition, if the sale of any non-strategic business cannot be consummated or is not practical, alternative courses of action, including relocation of product lines or closure, may not be available to us or may be more costly than anticipated.

Natural and man-made disasters could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Several of our facilities, as a result of their locations, could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquakes, hurricanes, tornados, floods, ice storms or other natural disasters.  Many of our production facilities and our headquarters are located in California and thus are in areas with above average seismic activity and may also be at risk of damage in wildfires.  Teledyne DALSA’s semiconductor facilities in Quebec, Canada have been impacted by loss of electrical power caused by severe ice storms.  In addition, we have manufacturing facilities in the Southeastern United States and Texas that have been threatened and struck by major hurricanes.  In 2017 our businesses located in Houston were impacted by Hurricane Harvey and our business in Florida was threatened by Hurricanes Irma and Matthew.  Our facilities in Alabama, Florida, Nebraska, Tennessee and Virginia have also been threatened by tornados.  In June 2012, a tornado caused substantial damage to and interrupted business at our Teledyne Hastings Instruments facility in Hampton, Virginia.  If any of our California facilities, including our California headquarters, were to experience a catastrophic earthquake or wildfire loss or if any of our Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Nebraska, Tennessee or Texas facilities were to experience a catastrophic hurricane, storm, tornado or other natural disaster, or if DALSA’s facilities in Quebec experience long-term loss of electrical power, such event could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue, and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility or facilities.  While Teledyne has property insurance to partially reimburse it for losses caused by windstorm and earth movement, such insurance would not cover all possible losses.  In addition, our existing disaster recovery and business continuity plans (including those relating to our information technology systems) may not be fully responsive to, or minimize losses associated with, catastrophic events.

The environmental disaster triggered by the Deepwater Horizon rig explosion and oil spill in 2010 resulted in a moratorium on offshore oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico that adversely affected the results of operations of some of our Teledyne oil and gas businesses, although such adverse impact was offset, in part, by the products we manufacture that supported well-capping and environmental clean-up efforts.  Environmental regulations enacted in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon rig explosion and oil spill in 2010 have resulted in increased compliance costs to some of our Teledyne oil and gas businesses.  Similar future man-made disasters that limit or cease offshore oil and gas production or further exploration in the regions in which we sell our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Disasters that do not directly impact us can have an indirect adverse impact on our business.  For example, in 2011 the earthquake in northern Japan and the related tsunami and severe flooding in Thailand resulted in certain of our customers delaying orders for our products because they were unable to obtain critical supplies from vendors in the impacted areas.



Teledyne Brown Engineering, Inc. has developed, built, and launched a multi user system for earth sensing that is affixed to the ISS.  For the program to be financially successful, the 19 year-old ISS must continue to fly in a safe and human tended condition.  While certain spaceflight risks, such as a high-velocity debris impact to the station causing significant structural damage or necessitating the evacuation of the ISS, have been regarded as small, if such event were to occur, the ISS program continuation could be threatened, jeopardizing our investment and potential revenue generation from ISS-based Earth imaging.

We may not be able to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights, or third parties may claim infringement of their intellectual rights, each which may harm our ability to compete and thus harm our business.

Our ability to enforce and protect our patents, copyrights, software licenses, trade secrets, know-how, and other intellectual property rights is subject to general litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our intellectual property rights in various countries.  When we seek to enforce our rights, we have found that various claims may be asserted against us, including claims that our intellectual property right is invalid, is otherwise not enforceable or is licensed to the party against whom we are asserting a claim.  In addition, we may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties.  If we are not ultimately successful in defending ourselves against these claims in litigation, we may not be able to sell a particular product or family of products due to an injunction, or we may have to pay damages that could, in turn, harm our results of operations.  Our inability to enforce our intellectual property rights under these circumstances may harm our competitive position and our business.

Higher tax rates may harm our results of operations and cash flow.

Our effective tax rate for


was 20.8%, compared with

20.9%

for


and

24.3%

for


.  While in December 2017, the President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which in general lowers corporate tax rates in the United States, a number of factors may impact our effective tax rates, which could reduce our net income and increase our tax payments, including:

•

the relative amount of income we earn in jurisdictions;

•

changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including changes in the United States to the taxation of foreign income and expenses, changes in tax laws in foreign jurisdictions, and changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and governing body pronouncements and interpretations;

•

the resolution of issues arising from tax audits;

•

changes in valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, including deferred tax valuation allowances;

•

adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns;

•

increases in expense not deductible for tax purposes;

•

changes in available tax credits; and

•

any decision to repatriate non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes.

Our inability to efficiently implement changes to our enterprise resource planning software could result in higher than expected costs or otherwise adversely impact our internal controls environment, operations and profitability.

We continue to implement enterprise resource planning software systems, which are intended to improve our business processes in certain business units.  The costs associated with such systems can be significant and we could incur costs in excess of budgeted costs.  Any technical or other difficulties in developing or implementing this initiative may increase the costs of the project and have an adverse effect on our operations and reporting processes, including our internal controls over financial reporting.  As we make adjustments to operations as a result of this project, we may incur incremental expenses prior to realizing the benefits of a more efficient workforce and operating structure.  Although implementation has occurred in only selected business units to date and efforts have been made to minimize adverse impacts on our controls, we cannot assure that all such impacts have been mitigated.  Further, we may not realize anticipated cost improvements and greater efficiencies from the project.

Our financial statements are based on estimates required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (“GAAP”), and actual results may differ materially from those estimated under different assumptions or conditions.

Our financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP.  These principles require our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  For example, estimates are used when accounting for items such as asset valuations, allowances for doubtful accounts, allowance for excess and obsolete inventory, depreciation and amortization, impairment assessments, employee benefits, taxes, recall and warranty costs, product and general liability and contingencies. While we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time made, actual results may differ materially from those estimated.  Our most critical accounting estimates are described in the Management Discussion in this Form 10-K under “Critical Accounting Estimates.”



While we believe our internal control systems are effective, there are inherent limitations in all control systems, and misstatements resulting from error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.

We continue to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls, disclosure controls and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, cannot guarantee that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all possible errors or all fraud.  A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs.  Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.  These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.  Further, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more persons, or by management override of the controls.  The design of any system of controls is also based, in part, upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.  Over time, a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements resulting from error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.

Provisions of our governing documents, applicable law, and our Change in Control Severance Agreements could make an acquisition of Teledyne more difficult.

Our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, our Amended and Restated Bylaws and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware contain several provisions that could make the acquisition of control of Teledyne, in a transaction not approved by our Board of Directors, more difficult.  We have also entered into Change in Control Severance Agreements with ten members of our current management, which could have an anti-takeover effect. These provisions may prevent or discourage attempts to acquire our company.

The market price of our Common Stock has fluctuated significantly since we became a public company, and could continue to do so.

Since we became an independent public company on November 29, 1999, the market price of our Common Stock has fluctuated substantially and fluctuations in our stock price could continue.  In fiscal 2015, our stock price declined 15.2% and in fiscal 2016, our stock increased 38.7%, while in 2017 our stock price increased 47.3%.  Additional information regarding our historical stock price is set forth in Part II, Item 5 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Among the factors that could affect our stock price are:

•

quarterly variations in our operating results;

•

strategic actions by us or our competitors;

•

acquisitions;

•

divestitures;

•

stock repurchases;

•

adverse business developments;

•

war in the Middle East or elsewhere;

•

terrorists activities;

•

military or homeland defense activities;

•

changes to the U.S. Federal budget;

•

changes in the energy exploration or production, semiconductor, digital imaging, telecommunications, commercial aviation, and electronic manufacturing services markets;

•

general market conditions;

•

changes in tax laws;

•

general economic factors unrelated to our performance;

•

changes from analysts’ expectations in revenues, earnings or other financial results; and

•

one or more of the risk factors described in this report.

The stock markets in general, and the markets for high-technology companies in particular, have experienced a high degree of volatility that is not necessarily related to the operating performance of these companies. We cannot provide assurances as to our stock price.  We have in the past repurchased shares of our stock pursuant to board-approved stock repurchase programs.  We cannot provide assurances that we will continue to repurchase shares under those programs, or that our board will authorize new repurchase programs.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Teledyne Technologies Incorporated provides enabling technologies for industrial growth markets that require advanced technology and high reliability.  These markets include aerospace and defense, factory automation, air and water quality environmental monitoring, oceanographic research, deepwater oil and gas exploration and production, medical imaging and pharmaceutical research.  Our products include digital imaging sensors, cameras and systems within the visible, infrared and X-ray spectra, monitoring instrumentation for marine and environmental applications, harsh environment interconnects, electronic test and measurement equipment, aircraft information management systems, and defense electronics and satellite communication subsystems.  We also supply engineered systems for defense, space, environmental and energy applications.  We differentiate ourselves from many of our direct competitors by having a customer- and company-sponsored applied research center that augments our product development expertise.

Strategy/Overview

Our strategy continues to emphasize growth in our core markets of instrumentation, digital imaging, aerospace and defense electronics and engineered systems.  Our core markets are characterized by high barriers to entry and include specialized products and services not likely to be commoditized.  We intend to strengthen and expand our core businesses with targeted acquisitions and through product development.  We continue to focus on balanced and disciplined capital deployment among capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases.   We aggressively pursue operational excellence to continually improve our margins and earnings.  At Teledyne, operational excellence includes the rapid integration of the businesses we acquire.  Using complementary technology across our businesses and internal research and development, we seek to create new products to grow our company and expand our addressable markets. We continue to evaluate our businesses to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy.

Consistent with this strategy, in March 2017, we made our largest acquisition to date, e2v technologies plc (“e2v”).   e2v provides high performance image sensors and custom camera solutions and application specific standard products for the machine vision market.  In addition, e2v provides high performance space qualified imaging sensors and arrays for space science and astronomy.  e2v also produces components and subsystems that deliver high reliability radio frequency power generation for healthcare, industrial and defense applications.  Finally, the company provides high reliability semiconductors and board-level solutions for use in aerospace, space and communications applications.  We made one other acquisition in


, five acquisitions in


and three acquisitions in


.



In the third quarter of 2016, Teledyne completed the disposition of the net assets of its Printed Circuit Technology (“PCT”) business for $9.3 million in cash, resulting in no gain or loss.  PCT was part of the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment. In connection with the sale, we entered into a transition services agreement, effective July 8, 2016, to provide certain administrative services to facilitate the orderly transfer of the business operations to the buyer.  The transition services agreement terminated in 2017.  In addition, in 2016 we sold a former operating facility in California and recorded a pretax gain of $17.9 million.

As part of a continuing effort to reduce costs and improve operating performance, we may take actions to consolidate and relocate certain facilities and reduce headcount across various businesses, reducing our exposure to weak end markets and high cost locations.  We continue to seek cost reductions in our businesses.  The following pre-tax charges were incurred related to severance and facility consolidations (in millions):

At December 31, 2017, $1.5 million remains to be paid related to these actions.

Recent Acquisitions

The Company spent $

,


and


, respectively, net of any cash acquired.

On March 28, 2017, Teledyne completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding common stock of e2v for $770.7 million, including stock options and assumed debt, net of $24.4 million of cash acquired.  Most of e2v’s operations are included in the Digital Imaging and Aerospace and Defense Electronics segments.  The Instrumentation segment includes a small portion of e2v’s operations.  Principally located in Chelmsford, United Kingdom and Grenoble, France, e2v had sales of approximately £236 million for its fiscal year ended March 31, 2016.  e2v’s results have been included since the date of the acquisition and include $273.7 million in net sales and operating income of $37.3 million, which included $8.3 million in acquisition-related costs and $11.2 million in additional intangible asset amortization expense.

Fiscal year 2017 includes pretax charges of $27.0 million related to the acquisition of e2v, which included $13.0 million in transaction costs, including stamp duty, advisory, legal and other consulting fees and other costs recorded to selling, general and administrative expenses, $5.7 million in inventory fair value step-up amortization expense recorded to cost of sales, $6.0 million related to a foreign currency option contract expense to hedge the e2v purchase price recorded as other expense and $2.3 million in bank bridge facility commitment expense recorded to interest expense.  Of these amounts, $8.3 million impacted segment operating income.

On July 20, 2017 Teledyne Instruments, Inc. completed the acquisition of assets of Scientific Systems, Inc. (“SSI”) for $31.0 million in cash.  A subsequent cash payment of

$0.3 million

related to a purchase price adjustment was made in 2017.  Headquartered in State College, Pa., SSI is a manufacturer of precision components and specialized subassemblies used primarily in analytical and diagnostic instrumentation, such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) systems and specific medical devices.  SSI designs and manufactures high pressure positive-displacement piston pumps for a wide variety of analytical, clinical, sample prep and fluid-metering applications and is part of the Instrumentation segment.

On November 2, 2016, Teledyne Instruments, Inc. acquired assets of IN USA, Inc. (“IN USA”), headquartered in Norwood, Massachusetts, for $10.2 million in cash.  IN USA is a manufacturer of a range of ozone generators, ozone analyzers and other gas monitoring instruments utilizing ultraviolet and infrared based technologies.  Teledyne relocated and consolidated manufacturing into the new, owned facility of Teledyne Advanced Pollution Instrumentation in San Diego, California.  On



December 6, 2016, Teledyne Instruments, Inc. acquired Hanson Research Corporation (“Hanson Research”), headquartered in Chatsworth, California, for $25.0 million, net of cash acquired.  Hanson Research specializes in analytical instrumentation for the pharmaceutical industry.  On May 3, 2016, Teledyne DALSA, Inc., a Canadian-based subsidiary, acquired the assets and business of CARIS, Inc. (“CARIS”), based in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada, for $26.2 million, net of cash acquired.  CARIS is a leading developer of geospatial software designed for the hydrographic and marine community.  On April 15, 2016, Teledyne LeCroy, Inc., a U.S.-based subsidiary, acquired assets of Quantum Data, Inc. (“Quantum Data”), based in Elgin, Illinois, for $17.3 million in cash.  Quantum Data is a market leader in video protocol analysis test tools.  On April 6, 2016, Teledyne LeCroy, Inc. also acquired Frontline Test Equipment, Inc. (“Frontline”), based in Charlottesville, Virginia, for $13.7 million in cash.  Frontline is a market leader in wireless protocol analysis test tools.

Each of the 2016 acquisitions are part of the Instrumentation segment except for CARIS which is part of the Digital Imaging segment.

On June 5, 2015, Teledyne DALSA B.V., a Netherlands-based subsidiary, acquired Industrial Control Machines SA (“ICM”) for $

21.8 million

, net of cash acquired.  In December 2016, an additional $

2.5 million

was paid by Teledyne related to an indemnification holdback.  Based in Liège, Belgium, ICM is a leading supplier of portable X-ray generators for non-destructive testing applications, as well as complete X-ray imaging systems for on-site security screening and is part of the Digital Imaging segment.

On April 29, 2015, Teledyne DALSA, Inc. acquired the remaining

49%

noncontrolling interest in the parent company of Optech Incorporated (“Optech”).  As a result of the purchase of the remaining interest in Optech in 2015, the difference between the cash paid and the balance of noncontrolling interest was recorded to additional paid-in capital.  The balance of the noncontrolling interest of $

41.2 million

at December 28, 2014 decreased by $

0.3 million

for the net loss and $

1.3 million

in translation adjustments prior to the purchase which eliminated the remaining balance.  Teledyne no longer has any noncontrolling interests.

On February 2, 2015, Teledyne acquired Bowtech Products Limited (“Bowtech”) through a U.K.-based subsidiary for $

18.9 million

in cash, net of cash acquired and including an estimated working capital adjustment.  Based in Aberdeen, Scotland, Bowtech designs and manufactures harsh underwater environment vision systems and is part of the Instrumentation segment.

was

$335.6 million

, compared with

$253.8 million

for


, an increase of

32.2%

.  The increase in operating income primarily reflected higher operating income in each segment, partially offset by higher corporate expense.  Operating income in 2017 and 2016 included $4.2 million and $17.3 million in severance and facility consolidation costs, respectively.  The incremental operating income included in the results for 2017 from recent acquisitions was $43.8 million which included $13.0 million in additional intangible asset amortization expense.

Interest Expense and Other Income and Expense

Total interest expense, including credit facility fees and other bank charges, was $35.5 million in 2017 compared with $23.6 million in 2016 and reflected the impact of higher debt levels in 2017 due to the acquisition of e2v.  Interest income was $2.4 million in 2017 and $0.3 million in 2016.  Other expense in 2017 and 2016 reflected $6.0 million and $5.5 million, respectively, of expense for a foreign currency option contract related to the e2v acquisition.  Other income for 2016 included a gain of $17.9 million on the sale of a former operating facility in California.

Income Taxes

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted.  The Tax Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, implementing the territorial tax system and imposing a tax on deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings.  As a result of the Tax Act, Teledyne incurred provisional charges of $4.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily due to the repatriation tax and the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities.  In accordance with the Tax Act, the Company will elect to pay the repatriation tax liability over a period of eight years, with the first installment of $3.1 million due in 2018.  The remainder of the tax liability is recorded in non-current income tax payable.  The repatriation tax resulted in a net tax expense of $26.2 million and the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities resulted in a net tax benefit of $21.5 million.  The impacts of the Tax Act may differ from this estimate, possibly materially (and the amount of the provisional charge may accordingly be adjusted over the course of 2018), due to changes in interpretations and assumptions Teledyne has made, guidance that may be issued, and actions Teledyne may take as a result of the Tax Act.  These adjustments to the provisional charge related to the Tax Act will be recorded quarterly until the computations are complete which is expected no later than the fourth quarter of 2018.

The Company’s effective tax rate for 2017 was 20.8%, compared with 20.9% for 2016.  Total year 2017 reflected $21.9 million in net discrete income tax benefits, which included an $8.5 million income tax benefit related to the release of valuation allowance for which the deferred tax assets are now determined more-likely-than-not to be realizable and a $8.5 million income tax benefit as a result of the remeasurement of uncertain tax positions due to expiration of statute of limitation, partially offset by $4.6 million related to adjustments for uncertain tax positions.  Total year 2017 also includes $8.8 million in net discrete tax benefits related to share-based accounting.

Total year 2016 reflected $10.9 million in net discrete income tax benefits.  The net discrete income tax benefits of $10.9 million, includes $6.7 million in income tax expense related to the $17.9 million gain on the sale of the operating facility and a $8.5 million income tax benefit related to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, as well as $9.1 million income tax benefit for the remeasurement of uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statute of limitations, the release of valuation allowances and a favorable tax ruling in the Netherlands.

Excluding the net discrete income tax benefits in both years, and the gain and related taxes on the operating facility sale in 2016, the effective tax rates would have been 26.8% for 2017 and 27.4% for 2016.

Cost of sales as a percentage of sales for 2016 decreased to 79.9%, compared with 82.4% in 2015 reflected the lower margin space and marine manufacturing programs ending in 2015 and also reflected the impact of higher pension income.  Selling, general and administrative expenses, including research and development and bid and proposal expense, decreased to $20.0 million in 2016, compared with $22.3 million in 2015, and reflected the impact of lower sales. The selling, general and administrative expense percentage decreased to 7.7% for 2016, compared with 8.1% in 2015.

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources

Principal Capital Requirements

Our principal cash and capital requirements are to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures, income tax payments and debt service requirements, as well as acquisitions.  We may also deploy cash for the stock repurchase program.   It is anticipated that operating cash flow, together with available borrowings under the credit facility described below, will be sufficient to meet these requirements and could be used to fund acquisitions in 2018.  To support acquisitions, we may need to raise additional capital.  Our liquidity is not dependent upon the use of off-balance sheet financial arrangements.  We have no off-balance sheet financing arrangements that incorporate the use of special purpose or unconsolidated entities.

Credit Facility, Senior Notes and Term Loans

In March 2017, Teledyne entered into a $100.0 million term loan with a maturity date of October 30, 2019.  Subsequently, in March 2017, Teledyne entered into a cross currency swap to effectively convert the $100.0 million term loan to a €93.0 million denominated instrument with a fixed euro interest rate of 0.7055%.  The proceeds from the term loan were used in connection with the acquisition of e2v.  On April 18, 2017, Teledyne entered into a note purchase agreement for a private placement of €250.0 million of senior unsecured notes due through April 2024.  Teledyne used the proceeds of this private placement note issuance, among other things, to repay indebtedness and for general corporate purposes.  In September 2017, Teledyne repaid the $100.0 million 4.74% fixed rate senior notes at their maturity.

In December 2016, the Company entered into an amendment relating to unsecured term loans of $182.5 million in aggregate principal amount (the “Term Loans”) to extend the maturity date of the Term Loans from March 2019 to January 2022 and extending the date on which amortization of principal begins; and generally lowering the applicable rate for base rate and Eurocurrency loans.  The other material terms of the Term Loans, including covenants, remain unchanged.  In November 2015, the Company issued

$125.0 million

in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes (“senior unsecured notes”).  The notes consisted of $25.0 million of 2.81% senior unsecured notes due in November 2020, and $100.0 million of 3.28% senior unsecured notes due in November 2022.  Also in December 2015, the Company amended the $750.0 million unsecured credit facility (“credit facility”) to extend the maturity from March 2018 to December 2020.  Excluding interest and fees, no payments are due under the credit facility until it matures.  Borrowings under our credit facility and term loans are at variable rates which are, at our option, tied to a Eurocurrency rate equal to LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) plus an applicable rate or a base rate as defined in our credit agreements.  Eurocurrency rate loans may be denominated in U.S. dollars or an alternative currency as defined in the agreement.  Eurocurrency or LIBOR based loans under the facility typically have terms of one, two, three or six months and the interest rate for each such loan is subject to change if the loan is continued or converted following the applicable maturity date.  The Company has not drawn any loans with a term longer than three months under the credit facility.  Base rate loans have interest rates that primarily fluctuate with changes in the prime rate. Interest rates are also subject to change based on our consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement.  The credit facility also provides for facility fees that vary between 0.12% and 0.25% of the credit line, depending on our consolidated leverage ratio as calculated from time to time.



At

December 31, 2017

, we had

$6.7 million

in capital leases, of which

$1.3 million

is current and had

$29.6 million

in outstanding letters of credit.

Our credit facility, senior notes and term loans agreements require the Company to comply with various financial and operating covenants, including maintaining certain consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios, as well as minimum net worth levels and limits on acquired debt.  At

December 31, 2017

, the Company was in compliance with these covenants and we had a significant amount of margin between required financial covenant ratios and our actual ratios.  Currently, we do not believe our ability to undertake additional debt financing, if needed, is reasonably likely to be materially impacted by debt restrictions under our credit agreements subject to our complying with required financial covenants listed in the table below.

Financial covenant ratios and the actual ratios at

December 31, 2017

:

(a)

The Consolidated Leverage Ratio is equal to Net Debt/EBITDA as defined in our private placement note purchase agreement and our $750.0 million credit agreement.

(b)

The Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio is equal to EBITDA/Interest as defined in our private placement note purchase agreement and our $750.0 million credit agreement.



In the event of an acquisition, our debt instruments permit us, at our option, to exceed the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 3.25 to 1 for up to four quarters following the fiscal quarter in which the acquisition event occurs, provided that the Consolidated Leverage Ratio does not exceed 3.5 to 1.

Available borrowing capacity under the $750.0 million credit facility, which is reduced by borrowings and outstanding letters of credit, was

$558.7 million

at

December 31, 2017

.

Teledyne also has a $5.0 million uncommitted credit line which permits credit extensions up to $5.0 million plus an incremental $2.0 million solely for standby letters of credit.  This credit line is utilized, as needed, for periodic cash needs.  At

December 31, 2017

, no amounts were outstanding under this credit line.  At January 1, 2017, $3.5 million was outstanding under the credit line.

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our expected cash outflows resulting from financial contracts and commitments at

December 31, 2017

.  We have not included information on our normal recurring purchases of materials for use in our operations.

The amounts in the following table are generally consistent from year to year, closely reflect our levels of production and are not long-term in nature:

(a)

Interest expense related to the credit facility, including facility fees, is assumed to accrue at the rates in effect at year-end 2017 and is assumed to be paid at the end of each quarter with the final payment in December 2020 when the credit facility expires.

(b)

Includes imputed interest and the short-term portion of capital lease obligations.

(c)

Purchase obligations generally include contractual obligations for the purchase of goods and services and capital commitments.

Unrecognized tax benefits of $26.0 million are not included in the table above because $8.0 million is offset by deferred tax assets, and the remainder cannot be reasonably estimated to be settled in cash due to a lack of prior settlement history and offsetting credits.

At

December 31, 2017

, we were not required, and accordingly are not planning, to make any cash contributions to the domestic qualified pension plan for 2018.  Our minimum funding requirements after 2018, as set forth by ERISA, are dependent on several factors as discussed under “Accounting for Pension Plans” in the Critical Accounting Policies section of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.  Estimates beyond 2018 have not been provided due to the significant uncertainty of these amounts, which are subject to change until the Company’s pension assumptions can be updated at the appropriate times.  In addition, certain pension contributions are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. government under certain government contracts, therefore, the amounts noted are not necessarily indicative of the impact these contributions may have on our liquidity.  We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit plans.  These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See further discussion in Note 11 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.  Teledyne intends to continue to monitor and manage its defined benefit pension plans obligation and may take additional actions to manage risk in the future.



Operating Activities

In


, net cash provided by operating activities was

$374.7 million

, compared with

$317.0 million

in


and

$210.2 million

in


.  The higher cash provided by operating activities in 2017, compared with 2016, reflected cash flow from e2v and the impact of higher operating income, partially offset by $12.1 million in higher income tax payments.  The higher cash provided by operating activities in 2016, compared with 2015, reflected $61.9 million in lower income tax payments, lower annual bonus and regular payroll payments and higher customer advanced payments, partially offset by higher payments for severance, facility closure and relocation costs and lower operating income.

Free cash flow (cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures) was

$316.2 million

in


, compared with

$229.4 million

and

$163.2 million

in


.   Adjusted free cash flow reflects utilization of restricted cash from the sale of a former operating facility which funded, in part, the facility purchase pursuant to a 1031 like-kind exchange and was

in


.

a)

We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities (a measure prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles) less capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment.  Adjusted free cash flow reflects utilization of restricted cash from the sale of a former operating facility which funded, in part, the facility purchase pursuant to a 1031 like-kind exchange. The company believes that this supplemental non-GAAP information is useful to assist management and the investment community in analyzing the company’s ability to generate cash flow.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was

$831.2 million

,

$151.0 million

and

$109.9 million

for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Cash flows relating to investing activities consists primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures, except 2016 also includes $9.3 million of cash received from the sale of a business and cash received of $19.5 million from the sale of a former operating facility.

The higher capital spending amount in 2016, primarily reflected the purchase of an operating facility for $26.0 million.  During 2018 we plan to invest approximately

$80.0 million

in capital expenditures, principally to upgrade facilities and capital equipment, reduce manufacturing costs and introduce new products.

Acquisitions

Investing activities used cash for acquisitions and investments of

$774.1 million

,

$93.4 million

and

$66.7 million

,


and


, respectively (see “Recent Acquisitions”).  Teledyne funded the acquisitions primarily from borrowings under its credit facilities, issuance of senior notes and term loans and cash on hand.

For all acquisitions, the results of operations and cash flows are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of each respective acquisition.  Most of e2v’s operations are included in the Digital Imaging and Aerospace and Defense Electronics segments.  The Instrumentation segment includes a small portion of e2v’s operations.  The CARIS and ICM acquisitions are part of the Digital Imaging segment.  All other acquisitions in 2017, 2016 and 2015 are part of the Instrumentation segment.



The following table shows the purchase price (net of cash acquired), goodwill acquired and intangible assets acquired for the acquisitions and other investments made in

$393.7 million

, compared with net payments on debt of

$163.1 million

in 2016 and net proceeds from debt of

$77.4 million

Financing activities for 2017 reflected net borrowings from the $750.0 million credit facility of $165.0 million and the proceeds from a $100.0 million term loan and the proceeds from the private placement of €250.0 million of senior unsecured notes.  Financing activities in 2016 also included the payment of $11.6 million for an option contract in connection with the e2v acquisition.  In 2015, the Company issued $125.0 million of senior unsecured notes.

No

repurchases were made in 2017 or in 2016.  See Note 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our stock repurchase program.

Other Matters

Pension Plans

Teledyne has a domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all U.S. employees hired before January 1, 2004, or approximately

13%

of Teledyne’s active employees as of December 31, 2017.  As of January 1, 2004, new U.S. hires participate in a domestic defined contribution plan.  In 2017, 2016 and 2015, Teledyne’s domestic pension plan was over 100% funded, thus no cash contributions were made.  For the Company’s domestic pension plan, the discount rate for 2018 will decrease to 4.02% from 4.54% in 2017.  The Company also has several smaller domestic and foreign-based defined benefit pension plans.

Income Taxes

Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid.  We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense.

On a provisional basis, we intend to reinvest indefinitely the earnings of our material foreign subsidiaries in our operations outside of the United States.  The cash that the Company's foreign subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance foreign operations and investments, including acquisitions.  We estimate that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash requirements.  Due to the Tax Act, U.S. federal and applicable state income taxes have been accrued for the deemed repatriation.  At December 31, 2017, the amount of undistributed foreign



earnings was $324.3 million, for which we have not recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately $1.4 million for state corporate income taxes which would be due if reinvested foreign earnings were repatriated.  Should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings, we would need to adjust our income tax provision in the period we determined that we would no longer indefinitely reinvest the earnings outside the United States.

Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amount in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future.  In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations.  In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences.  The assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.  In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income.  Based on the Company’s history of operating earnings, expectations of future operating earnings and potential tax planning strategies, management believes that it is possible that some portion of deferred taxes will not be realized as a future tax benefit and therefore has recorded a valuation allowance.

We file income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction and in various states and foreign jurisdictions. The Company has substantially concluded on all U.S. federal income tax matters for all years through 2013, United Kingdom and France income tax matters for all years through 2014 and Canadian income tax matters for all years through 2009.

Costs and Pricing

Inflationary trends in recent years have been moderate. Current inventory costs, the increasing costs of equipment and other costs are considered in establishing sales pricing policies.  The Company emphasizes cost containment in all aspects of its business.

Hedging Activities and Market Risk Disclosures

Teledyne transacts business in various foreign currencies and has international sales and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, subjecting the Company to foreign currency risk.  The Company

’

s primary objective is to protect the United States dollar value of future cash flows and minimize the volatility of reported earnings.  The Company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily related to forecasted revenue and expenses denominated in Canadian dollars for our Canadian companies, including DALSA and in British pounds for our UK companies, including e2v.  These contracts are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges.  The Company has converted a US dollar denominated, variable rate debt obligation into a euro fixed rate obligation using a receive-float, pay fixed cross currency swap.  This cross currency swap is designated as a cash flow hedge.

The effectiveness of the cash flow hedge forward contracts, excluding time value, is assessed prospectively and retrospectively on a monthly basis using regression analysis, as well as using other timing and probability criteria.  To receive hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedges and must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions.  The effective portion of the cash flow hedge contracts’ gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these hedges is initially reported, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (

“

AOCI

”

) in stockholders’ equity until the underlying hedged item is reflected in our consolidated statements of income, at which time the effective amount in AOCI is reclassified to cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income.  Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI, net of tax, for forward contracts that will mature in the next 12 months total $3.2 million.  These gains are expected to be offset by anticipated losses in the value of the forecasted underlying hedged item.  Amounts related to the cross currency swap expected to be reclassified from AOCI into income in the coming 12 months total $2.2 million.

In the event that the gains or losses in AOCI are deemed to be ineffective, the ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value, if any, is reclassified to other income and expense.  In the event that the underlying forecasted transactions do not occur, or it becomes remote that they will occur, within the defined hedge period, the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges will be reclassified from AOCI to other income and expense.  During the current reporting period, all forecasted transactions occurred and, therefore, there were no such gains or losses reclassified to other income and expense.  As of

December 31, 2017

, Teledyne had foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to buy Canadian dollars and to sell U.S. dollars totaling

$80.6 million

.  These foreign currency forward contracts have maturities ranging from March 2018 to February 2019. e2v had foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to buy British pounds and to sell U.S. dollars totaling

$0.6 million

.  These foreign currency forward contracts have maturities ranging from March 2018 to April 2018.  Together these contracts had a fair value of $3.8 million.  The cross currency swap has notional amounts of $93.0 million euros equivalent to $100.0 million, and matures in October 2019.



In addition, the Company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign exchange rate risk associated with foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, including intercompany receivables and payables.  As of

December 31, 2017

, Teledyne had foreign currency contracts of this type in the following currency pairs (in millions):

These contracts had a fair value of

$3.8 million

at

December 31, 2017

.  The gains and losses on these derivatives which are not designated as hedging instruments, are intended to, at a minimum, partially offset the transaction gains and losses recognized in earnings.  All derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.  As discussed below, the accounting for gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value depends on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting.  Teledyne does not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes.

Notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate portions of our foreign currency exchange rate risks, there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations.  A hypothetical 10 percent price change of the U.S. dollar from its value at

December 31, 2017

, would result in a decrease or increase in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to buy Canadian dollars and to sell U.S. dollars by approximately

$8.1 million

.  A hypothetical 10 percent price change in the U.S. dollar from its value at December 31, 2017 would result in a decrease or increase in the fair value of our Euro/U.S. Dollar cross currency swap designated as a cash flow hedge by approximately

$10.2 million

.

Borrowings under our credit facility are at fixed rates that vary with the term and timing of each loan under the facility.  Loans under the facility typically have terms of one, two, three or six months and the interest rate for each such loan is subject to change if the loan is continued or converted following the applicable maturity date.  Interest rates are also subject to change based on our debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ratio.  As of

December 31, 2017

, we had$165.0 million outstanding under our $750.0 million credit facility.  Any borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit line are based on a fluctuating market interest rate and, consequently, the fair value of any outstanding debt should not be affected materially by changes in market interest rates.

We believe that adequate controls are in place to monitor any hedging activities.  Our primary exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.  We periodically evaluate these risks and have taken measures to mitigate these risks.  We own assets and operate facilities in countries that have been politically stable.

Environmental

We are subject to various federal, state, local and international environmental laws and regulations which require that we investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations.  These include sites at which Teledyne has been identified as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, and comparable state laws.  We are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites.  Reserves for environmental investigation and remediation totaled

$5.1 million

at

December 31, 2017

, and

$7.0 million

at

January 1, 2017

.  As investigation and remediation of these sites proceed and new information is received, the Company will adjust accruals to reflect new information.  Based on current information, we do not believe that future environmental costs, in excess of those already accrued, will materially and adversely affect our financial condition or liquidity.  See also our environmental risk factor disclosure beginning on page 25 and Notes 2 and 14 to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



Government Contracts

We perform work on a number of contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense and other agencies and departments of the U.S. Government including sub-contracts with government prime contractors.  Sales under these contracts with the U.S. Government, which included contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense, were approximately

24%

of total sales in


,

27%

of total sales in


and

26%

of total sales in


.  For a summary of sales to the U.S. Government by segment, see Note 12 to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Sales to the U.S. Department of Defense represented approximately

18%

,

21%

and

19%

of total sales for


,


and


, respectively.

Performance under government contracts has certain inherent risks that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.  Government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of Congressional appropriations, which usually occurs on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year.  See also our government contracts risks factor disclosure beginning on page 18.

For information on accounts receivable from the U.S. Government, see Note 5 to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Estimates and Reserves

Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities.  On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to product returns and replacements, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventories, intangible assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, pension and other postretirement benefits, long-term contracts, environmental, workers’ compensation and general liability, employee benefits and other contingencies and litigation.  We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time, the results of which form the basis for making our judgments.  Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  In some cases, such differences may be material.  See also Critical Accounting Policies.

The following table reflects significant reserves and valuation accounts, which are estimates and based on judgments as described above, at

December 31, 2017

, and

January 1, 2017

:

(a) This table should be read in conjunction with the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

(b) Includes both long-term and short-term reserves.

Some of the Company’s products are subject to standard warranties and the Company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties.  We regularly assess the adequacy of our pre-existing warranty liabilities and adjust amounts as necessary based on a review of historic warranty experience with respect to the applicable business or products, as well as the length and actual terms of the warranties, which are typically one year.  The product warranty reserve is included in current accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the balance sheet.



Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements.  Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  Our critical accounting policies are those that are reflective of significant judgment, complexity and uncertainty, and may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions.  We have identified the following as critical accounting policies: revenue recognition; accounting for pension plans; accounting for business combinations, goodwill and other long-lived assets; and accounting for income taxes.  For additional discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized when the earnings process is substantially complete and all of the following criteria are met: 1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; 2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; 3) our price to our customer is fixed or determinable; and 4) collectability is reasonably assured.

We determine the appropriate method by which we recognize revenue by analyzing the terms and conditions of our contracts or arrangements entered into with our customers.  The majority of our revenue relates to product sales and is recognized upon shipment to the customer, at fixed or determinable prices and with a reasonable assurance of collection, passage of title to the customer and fulfillment of all significant obligations.  Revenue is recognized net of estimated sales returns and other allowances.  The Company does not offer substantial sales incentives and credits to customers.  The remaining revenue is generally associated with long-term contracts to design, develop and manufacture highly engineered products used in commercial or defense applications.  Such contracts are generally accounted for using contract accounting, percentage-of-completion (“POC”) method.

The Company’s standard terms of sale are FOB shipping point.  For a small percentage of sales where title and risk of loss passes at destination point, and assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met, the Company recognizes revenue upon delivery to the customer.  If any significant obligation to the customer with respect to a sales transaction remains following shipment, revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations have been fulfilled.  In general, our revenue arrangements do not involve acceptance provisions based on customer specified acceptance criteria.  In those circumstances when customer specified acceptance criteria exist, and if we cannot demonstrate that the system meets those specifications prior to the shipment, then revenue is deferred until customer acceptance is obtained.

We have a few contracts that require the Company to warehouse certain goods, for which revenue is recognized when all risks of loss is borne by the customer and all other criteria for revenue recognition are met.

We also have a small number of multiple elements arrangements (i.e., free product, training, installation, additional parts, etc.).  If contract accounting does not apply, we allocate the contract price among the deliverables based on vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value to each element in the arrangement.  If objective and reliable evidence of fair value of any element is not available, we use our best estimate of selling price for purposes of allocating the total arrangement consideration among the elements.  Also, extended or non-customary warranties do not represent a significant portion of our revenue; however, when our revenue arrangements include an extended or non-customary warranty provision, the revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the extended warranty period.

For contracts that require substantial performance over a long time period (generally one or more years), revenue is recorded under the POC method.  We record net revenue and an estimated profit as work on our contracts progresses.  The POC method for these contracts is dependent on the nature of the contract or products provided.  Depending on the contract, we may measure the extent of progress toward completion using the units-of-delivery method, cost-to-cost method or upon attainment of scheduled performance contract milestones which could be time, event or expense driven.  For example, for cost-reimbursable contracts we use the cost-to-cost method to measure progress toward completion.  Under the cost-to-cost method of accounting, we recognize revenue and an estimated profit as allowable costs are incurred based on the proportion that the incurred costs bear to total estimated costs.  Another example, for contracts that require us to provide a substantial number of similar items, we record revenue and an estimated profit on a POC basis using units-of-delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract.  Occasionally, it is appropriate to combine individual customer orders and treat them as one arrangement when the underlying agreement was reached with the customer for a single large project.

Accounting for contracts using the POC method requires management judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenue and cost, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues.  Contract revenue may include estimated amounts not contractually agreed to by the customer, including price redetermination, cost or performance incentives (such as award and incentives fees), un-priced change orders, claims and requests for equitable adjustment. The POC method requires management’s judgment to make reasonably dependable cost estimates generally over a long time period. Since certain contracts extend over a long period of time, the impact of revisions in cost and revenue estimates during the progress of work



may adjust the current period earnings on a cumulative catch-up basis.  This method recognizes, in the current period, the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior quarters.  Additionally, if the current contract estimate indicates a loss, a provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the period that it becomes evident.  Contract cost and revenue estimates for significant contracts are generally reviewed and reassessed at least quarterly.  The percentage of Teledyne revenue recognized using any POC method was 28.6 % in 2017, 30.5% in 2016, and 31.2% in 2015.  The net aggregate effects of changes in estimates on contracts accounted for under the POC accounting method for 2017 and 2016, were $7.5 million and $1.9 million of unfavorable operating income, respectively, and $3.1 million of favorable operating income for 2015.

We do not believe that any discrete event or adjustment to an individual contract within the aggregate changes in contract estimates for


,


or


was material to the consolidated statements of income for such annual periods.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which provides a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance.  We adopted the new guidance effective January 1, 2018.  For a discussion of this new accounting standard see Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Pension Plans

Teledyne has a domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all U.S. employees hired before January 1, 2004, or approximately

13%

of Teledyne’s active employees.  As of January 1, 2004, new U.S. hires participate in a defined contribution plan only.  The Company also has several smaller domestic and foreign-based defined benefit pension plans.  At December 31, 2017, the benefit obligation for the domestic defined benefit pension plans totaled $812.3 million and the fair value of the net qualified plan assets totaled $896.0 million.  At December 31, 2017, the benefit obligation for the foreign-based pension plans totaled $57.8 million and the fair value of the net plan assets totaled $46.7 million.  The Company’s accounting for its defined benefit pension plans requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis, rather than as contributions are made to the plan.  In consultation with our actuaries, we determine the appropriate assumptions for use in determining the liability for future pension benefits.  Net actuarial gains or losses are amortized to expense on a plan-by-plan basis when they exceed the accounting corridor.  The accounting corridor is a defined range within which amortization of net gains and losses is not required and is equal to 10 percent of the greater of the market related value of assets or benefit obligations.  Gains or losses outside of the corridor are subject to amortization over our average employee future service period of approximately nine years.  Significant assumptions used in determining the Company’s pension income or expense is the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, participant mortality estimates, expected rates of increase in future compensation levels, employee turnover, as well as the assumed discount rate on pension obligations.  The Company has assumed, based upon the types of securities the domestic qualified pension plan assets are invested in and the long-term historical returns of these investments, that the long-term expected return on the domestic qualified pension plan assets will be

8.0%

in 2018 and the assumed discount rate for determining benefit obligations will be

4.02%

in 2018.   The Company’s long-term expected return on the domestic qualified pension assets used in


was 8.0% and the assumed discount rate used in


was

4.54%

.  The actual rate of return on the domestic qualified pension plan assets was 15.7% in


and 7.1% in


for its domestic qualified pension plan.  If the actual rate of return on pension assets is below the expected rate of return, the Company may be required to make additional contributions to the pension trust.  At December 31, 2017, the domestic qualified pension plan is over-funded and contributions are not required.  The Company did not make any cash contributions to its domestic qualified pension plan since 2013 when it made a voluntary pretax cash contribution of

$83.0 million

, before recovery from the U.S. Government.  Each year beginning with 2014, the Society of Actuaries has released revised mortality tables, which updated life expectancy assumptions.  In consideration of these tables, we updated the mortality assumptions used in determining our pension obligations.  Our plan remains over-funded after the impact of the new mortality assumptions, as well as from changes to other relevant assumptions.  At year-end


, the Company has a

$229.5 million

non-cash reduction to stockholders’ equity and a long-term additional liability of

$366.3 million

related to its pension plans. At year-end


, the Company had a

$249.6 million

non-cash reduction to stockholders’ equity and a long-term additional liability of

$369.6 million

related to its pension plans.

Differences in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on assets within the indicated range would have had the following impact on


pension expense (in millions):

See Note 11 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional pension disclosures.



Business Combinations, Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets

The results for all acquisitions are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of each respective acquisition. Business acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method by assigning the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill.  We determine the fair value of such assets and liabilities, generally in consultation with third-party valuation advisors.  Acquired intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives.  Adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the purchase price allocation period.

Goodwill and acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized.  We review goodwill and acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable.  The Company also performs an annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year.  We test goodwill and acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value.  These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, including a significant sustained decline in an entity’s market value, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business, or other factors.  Based on impairment tests completed in


, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded $0.2 million, $1.0 million and $0.5 million impairment to acquired intangible assets, respectively.  No impairment of goodwill was indicated in 2017, 2016 or 2015, based on the annual impairment test completed in the fourth quarter of each year.

For goodwill impairment testing, the Company estimates the fair value of the reporting units mainly through using a discounted cash flow model based on our best estimate of amounts and timing of future revenues and cash flows and our most recent business and strategic plans, and compares the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill.  The discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth, future operating margins, discount rates and terminal values over a multi-year period.  There are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management’s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment.  While the Company believes it has made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of its reporting units, it is possible a material change could occur.  If actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions, goodwill may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings.

As of

December 31, 2017

, the Company had 12 reporting units for goodwill impairment testing.  The carrying value of goodwill included in the Company’s individual reporting units ranges from $1.2 million to $687.6 million.  The Company’s analysis in 2017 indicated that in all instances, the fair value of the Company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge.  The excess of the estimated fair value over the carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value of the respective reporting unit) for each of the Company’s reporting units as of the fourth quarter of 2017, the annual testing date, ranged from approximately 29% to 2,124%.

Changes in our projections used in the discounted cash flow model could affect the estimated fair value of certain of the Company’s reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those values to the reporting unit carrying values.  Based on this sensitivity analysis, the Company did not identify any goodwill impairment.  Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill, differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis.

The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill (primarily trademarks and trade names) consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date.  The Company estimates the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangibles using a discounted cash flow model based on our best estimate of amounts and timing of future revenues from our most recent business and strategic plans, and compares the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the asset.

Income Taxes

Income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management’s assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements.  Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.  Uncertainty exists regarding tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns still under examination and positions expected to be taken in the current year and future returns.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise due to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax carryforwards.  Although we believe our income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals.  To the extent that the final tax outcome is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.  The provision for income taxes includes the impact of uncertain tax benefits that are considered appropriate, as well as the related



net interest.

Significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies.  In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.

We record uncertain tax benefits on the basis of a two-step process whereby (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the positions and (2) for those tax positions that meet the “more-likely-than-not” recognition threshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted.  The Tax Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, implementing the territorial tax system and imposing a tax on deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings.  As a result of the Tax Act, Teledyne incurred provisional charges of

$4.7 million

in the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily due to the repatriation tax and the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities.  In accordance with the Tax Act, the Company will elect to pay the repatriation tax liability over a period of eight years, with the first installment of

$3.1 million

due in 2018.  The remainder of the tax liability is recorded in non-current income tax payable.  The repatriation tax resulted in a net tax expense of

$26.2 million

and the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities resulted in a net tax benefit of

$21.5 million

.  The impacts of the Tax Act may differ from this estimate, possibly materially (and the amount of the provisional charge may accordingly be adjusted over the course of 2018), due to changes in interpretations and assumptions Teledyne has made, guidance that may be issued, and actions Teledyne may take as a result of the Tax Act.  These adjustments to the provisional charge related to the Tax Act will be recorded quarterly until the computations are complete which is expected no later than the fourth quarter of 2018.

An increase of 100 basis point increase in our nominal tax rate would have resulted in additional income tax provision for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, of $2.9 million. For a description of the Company’s tax accounting policies, refer to Note 2 and Note 10 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Recent Accounting Standards

Safe Harbor Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information

This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation contains forward-looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, directly and indirectly relating to earnings, growth opportunities, acquisitions and divestitures, product sales, capital expenditures, pension matters, stock option compensation expense, the credit facility, interest expense, severance and relocation costs, environmental remediation cost, stock repurchases, taxes, exchange rate fluctuations and strategic plans.  All statements made in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation that are not historical in nature should be considered forward-looking. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements.

Many factors could change the anticipated results, including: disruptions in the global economy; changes in demand for products sold to the defense electronics, instrumentation, digital imaging, energy exploration and production, commercial aviation, semiconductor and communications markets; funding, continuation and award of government programs; changes in the estimated impact of the Tax Act; and cuts to defense spending resulting from existing and future deficit reduction measures; impacts from the United Kingdom’s planned exit from the European Union; uncertainties related to the policies of the U.S. Presidential administration; and threats to the security of our confidential and proprietary information, including cyber security threats.  Lower oil and natural gas prices, as well as instability in the Middle East or other oil producing regions, and new regulations or restrictions relating to energy production, including with respect to hydraulic fracturing could further

negatively affect our businesses that supply the oil and gas industry. Increasing fuel costs could negatively affect the markets of our commercial aviation businesses.  In addition, financial market fluctuations affect the value of our pension assets.

Information regarding the impact of the Tax Act consists of preliminary estimates which are forward-looking statements and are subject to change, possibly materially, as the company completes its financial statements.  Information regarding the impact of the Tax Act is based on our current calculations, as well as our current interpretations, assumptions and expectations relating to the Tax Act, which are subject to change.

Changes in the policies of U.S. and foreign governments could result, over time, in reductions or realignment in defense or other government spending and further changes in programs in which the Company participates.



While Teledyne’s growth strategy includes possible acquisitions, we cannot provide any assurance as to when, if or on what terms any acquisitions will be made.  Acquisitions involve various inherent risks, such as, among others, our ability to integrate acquired businesses, retain customers and achieve identified financial and operating synergies.  There are additional risks associated with acquiring, owning and operating businesses outside of the United States, including those arising from U.S. and foreign government policy changes or actions and exchange rate fluctuations.

We continue to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls, disclosure controls and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  While we believe our control systems are effective, there are inherent limitations in all control systems, and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.

Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements is contained beginning on page 13 of this Form 10-K under the caption “Risk Factors; Cautionary Statement as to Forward-Looking Statements.” Forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by words such as “estimate”, “project”, “predict”, “believes” or “expect”, that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes.  We assume no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or otherwise.

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION



MANAGEMENT STATEMENT

RESPONSIBILITY FOR PREPARATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

We are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements included in this Annual Report. The financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include amounts that are based on the best estimates and judgments of management.  The other financial information contained in this Annual Report is consistent with the financial statements.

Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance concerning the reliability of the financial data used in the preparation of Teledyne financial statements, as well as to safeguard the Company’s assets from unauthorized use or disposition.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.  Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement presentation.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON TELEDYNE TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

We are also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.  We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017.  In making this evaluation, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) (the COSO criteria) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework. Our evaluation included reviewing the documentation of our controls, evaluating the design effectiveness of our controls and testing their operating effectiveness.  Our evaluation did not include assessing the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for the e2v acquisition and the SSI asset acquisition in 2017.  These acquisitions, which are included in the 2017 consolidated financial statements of the Company, constituted approximately 26% of total assets, 11% of total revenues and 12% of net income of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017.  We did not assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting at these newly acquired entities due to the insufficient time between the date acquired and year-end and the complexity associated with assessing internal controls during integration efforts making the process impractical.  Based on this evaluation we believe that, as of December 31, 2017, the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting were effective.

Deloitte and Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has issued its report on the effectiveness of Teledyne’s internal control over financial reporting. Their report appears on page 60 of this Annual Report.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Teledyne Technologies Incorporated

Thousand Oaks, California

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Teledyne Technologies Incorporated and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017, of the Company and our report dated February 27, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule.

As described in Report of Management on Teledyne Technologies Incorporated’s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting for e2v technologies plc acquisition and the Scientific Systems, Inc. asset acquisition (“the 2017 acquisitions”), which were acquired in March and July, respectively, and whose financial statements constitute approximately 26% of total assets, 11% of total revenues and 12% of net income of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017.  Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting for the 2017 acquisitions.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Teledyne Technologies Incorporated’s Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Teledyne Technologies Incorporated

Thousand Oaks, California

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Teledyne Technologies Incorporated and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows, for the three years ended December 31, 2017, January 1, 2017, and January 3, 2016, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements").  In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for years ended December 31, 2017, January 1, 2017, and January 3, 2016, in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27, 2018, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.  Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Note 1. Description of Business

Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (“Teledyne” or the “Company”) became an independent, public company effective November 29, 1999.  Teledyne provides enabling technologies for industrial growth markets that require advanced technology and high reliability.

Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities.  On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to sales returns and allowances, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventories, goodwill, intangible assets, asset valuations, income taxes, warranty obligations, pension and other postretirement benefits, long-term contracts, environmental, workers

’

compensation and general liability, employee benefits and other contingencies and litigation.  The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time, the results of which form the basis for making its judgments.  Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes that the estimates are reasonable.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized when the earnings process is substantially complete and all of the following criteria are met: 1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; 2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; 3) our price to our customer is fixed or determinable; and 4) collectability is reasonably assured.

We determine the appropriate method by which we recognize revenue by analyzing the terms and conditions of our contracts or arrangements entered into with our customers.  The majority of our revenue relates to product sales and is recognized upon shipment to the customer, at fixed or determinable prices and with a reasonable assurance of collection, passage of title to the customer and fulfillment of all significant obligations.  Revenue is recognized net of estimated sales returns and other allowances.  The Company does not offer substantial sales incentives and credits to customers.  The remaining revenue is generally associated with long-term contracts to design, develop and manufacture highly engineered products used in commercial or defense applications.  Such contracts are generally accounted for using contract accounting, percentage-of-completion (“POC”) method.

The Company’s standard terms of sale are FOB shipping point.  For a small percentage of sales where title and risk of loss passes at destination point, and assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met, the Company recognizes revenue upon delivery to the customer.  If any significant obligation to the customer with respect to a sales transaction remains following shipment, revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations have been fulfilled.  In general, our revenue arrangements do not involve acceptance provisions based on customer specified acceptance criteria.  In those



circumstances when customer specified acceptance criteria exist, and if we cannot demonstrate that the product meets those specifications prior to the shipment, then revenue is deferred until customer acceptance is obtained.

We have a few contracts that require the Company to warehouse certain goods, for which revenue is recognized when all risks of loss are borne by the customer and all other criteria for revenue recognition are met.

We also have a small number of multiple elements arrangements (i.e., free product, training, installation, additional parts, etc.).  If contract accounting does not apply, we allocate the contract price among the deliverables based on vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value to each element in the arrangement.  If objective and reliable evidence of fair value of any element is not available, we use our best estimate of selling price for purposes of allocating the total arrangement consideration among the elements.  Also, extended or non-customary warranties do not represent a significant portion of our revenue; however when our revenue arrangements include an extended or non-customary warranty provision, the revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the extended warranty period.

For contracts that require substantial performance over a long time period (generally one or more years), revenue is recorded under the POC method.  We record net revenue and an estimated profit as work on our contracts progresses.  The POC method for these contracts is dependent on the nature of the contract or products provided.  Depending on the contract, we may measure the extent of progress toward completion using the units-of-delivery method, cost-to-cost method or upon attainment of scheduled performance contract milestones which could be time, event or expense driven.  For example, for cost-reimbursable contracts we use the cost-to-cost method to measure progress toward completion.  Under the cost-to-cost method of accounting, we recognize revenue and an estimated profit as allowable costs are incurred based on the proportion that the incurred costs bear to total estimated costs.  Another example, for contracts that require us to provide a substantial number of similar items, we record revenue and an estimated profit on a POC basis using units-of-delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract.  Occasionally, it is appropriate to combine individual customer orders and treat them as one arrangement when the underlying agreement was reached with the customer for a single large project.

Accounting for contracts using the POC method requires management judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenue and cost, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues.  Contract revenue may include estimated amounts not contractually agreed to by the customer, including price redetermination, cost or performance incentives (such as award and incentives fees), un-priced change orders, claims and requests for equitable adjustment.  The POC method requires management’s judgment to make reasonably dependable cost estimates generally over a long time period.  Since certain contracts extend over a long period of time, the impact of revisions in cost and revenue estimates during the progress of work may adjust the current period earnings on a cumulative catch-up basis.  This method recognizes, in the current period, the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior quarters.  Additionally, if the current contract estimate indicates a loss, a provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the period that it becomes evident.  Contract cost and revenue estimates for significant contracts are generally reviewed and reassessed quarterly.  The percentage of Teledyne revenue recognized using any POC method was

28.6%

in 2017,

30.5%

in 2016, and

31.2%

in 2015.  The net aggregate effects of these changes in estimates on contracts accounted for under the POC accounting method for 2017 and 2016, were

$7.5 million

and

$1.9 million

of unfavorable operating income, respectively, and

$3.1 million

of favorable operating income for 2015.

We do not believe that any discrete event or adjustment to an individual contract within the aggregate changes in contract estimates for


,


or


was material to the consolidated statements of income for such annual periods.

Shipping and Handling

Shipping and handling fees reimbursed by customers are classified as revenue while shipping and handling costs incurred by Teledyne are classified as cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

Product Warranty Costs

Some of the Company

’

s products are subject to standard warranties and the Company reserves for the estimated cost of product warranties on a product-specific basis.  Facts and circumstances related to a product warranty matter and cost estimates to return, repair and/or replace the product are considered when establishing a product warranty reserve.  The adequacy of the preexisting warranty liabilities is assessed regularly and the reserve is adjusted as necessary based on a review of historic warranty experience with respect to the applicable business or products, as well as the length and actual terms of the warranties, which are typically

one year

.  The product warranty reserve is included in current accrued liabilities and long-term liabilities on the balance sheet.



Research and Development

Selling, general and administrative expenses include Company-funded research and development and bid and proposal costs which are expensed as incurred and were

$177.7 million

in


,

$167.7 million

in


and

$163.7 million

in


.

Income Taxes

We compute the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amount in the financial statements, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future.  In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations.  In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences.  The assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.  In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider

three

years of cumulative operating income.  A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition in order to be recognized in the financial statements.  We recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within operations as income tax expense.  As new information becomes available, the assessment of the recognition threshold and the measurement of the associated tax benefit of uncertain tax positions may result in financial statement recognition or derecognition.

Net Income Per Common Share

Basic and diluted earnings per share were computed based on net income attributable to Teledyne.  The weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period was used in the calculation of basic earnings per share.  This number of shares was increased by contingent shares that could be issued under various compensation plans as well as by the dilutive effect of stock options based on the treasury stock method in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.

The following table sets forth the computations of basic and diluted earnings per share (amounts in millions, except per share data):

For


, 2016 and 2015

no

stock options were excluded in the computation of diluted earnings per share.

For


,


and


, stock options to purchase

2.3 million

,

2.2 million

and

2.4 million

shares of common stock, respectively, had exercise prices that were less than the average market price of the Company’s common stock during the respective periods and are included in the computation of diluted earnings per share.



In addition,

no

contingent shares of the Company’s common stock under the restricted stock or performance share compensation plans were excluded from fully diluted shares outstanding for


or 2016.  In 2015,

3,997

contingent shares of the Company’s common stock under the restricted stock or performance share compensation plans were excluded from fully diluted shares outstanding.

Accounts Receivable

Receivables are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of

$10.3 million

at

December 31, 2017

, and

$5.2 million

at

January 1, 2017

.  Expense recorded for the allowance for doubtful accounts was

$4.2 million

,

$0.7 million

and

$0.9 million

for


,


and


, respectively.  An allowance for doubtful accounts is established for losses expected to be incurred on accounts receivable balances.  Judgment is required in the estimation of the allowance and is based upon specific identification, collection history and creditworthiness of the debtor.  Trade credit is extended based upon evaluations of each customer’s ability to perform its obligations, which are updated periodically.

Cash

Cash totaled

$70.9 million

at

December 31, 2017

, of which

$67.5 million

was held by foreign subsidiaries of Teledyne.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, less progress payments.  The majority of inventory values are valued on an average cost or first-in, first-out method, while the remainder are stated at cost based on the last-in, first-out method.  Costs include direct material, direct labor, applicable manufacturing and engineering overhead, and other direct costs.  Additionally, certain inventory costs are also reflective of the estimates used in applying the percentage-of-completion revenue recognition method.  Judgment is required when establishing reserves to reduce the carrying amount of inventory to market or net realizable value.  Inventory reserves are recorded when inventory is considered to be excess or obsolete based upon an analysis of actual on-hand quantities on a part-level basis to forecasted product demand and historical usage.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment is capitalized at cost. Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.  Depreciation and amortization are determined using a combination of accelerated and straight-line methods over the estimated useful lives of the various asset classes.  Buildings and building improvements are depreciated over periods not exceeding

45 years

, equipment over


to

18 years

, computer hardware and software over


to

7 years

and leasehold improvements over the shorter of the estimated remaining lives or lease terms.  Significant improvements are capitalized while maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.  Depreciation expense on property, plant and equipment, including assets under capital leases, was

$65.9 million

in


,

$57.6 million

in


and

$58.3 million

in


.  Other income for 2016 included a gain of

$17.9 million

on the sale of a former operating facility in California.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Business acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method by assigning the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is recorded as goodwill.

Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but tested at least annually for impairment.   The Company performs an annual impairment test for goodwill and other acquired intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each year, or more often as circumstances require.  The two-step impairment test is used to first identify potential goodwill impairment and then measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss, if any.  When it is determined that an impairment has occurred, an appropriate charge to operations is recorded.

No

impairment of goodwill was indicated in 2017, 2016 or 2015, based on the annual impairment test completed in the fourth quarter of each year.  Acquired intangible assets with finite lives are amortized and reflected in the segments operating income over their estimated useful lives.

We review intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable.  We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of assets held for use based on a review of projected undiscounted cash flows.  Impairment losses, where identified, are determined as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the long-lived asset.  In 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded

$0.2 million

,

$1.0 million

and

0.5 million

impairment to acquired intangible assets, respectively.



Deferred Compensation Plan

The Company has a non-qualified executive deferred compensation plan that provides supplemental retirement income benefits for a select group of management.  This plan permits eligible employees to make salary and bonus deferrals that are

100%

vested.  We have an unsecured obligation to pay in the future the value of the deferred compensation adjusted to reflect the performance, whether positive or negative, of selected investment measurement options chosen by each participant during the deferral period.  As of December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017, $

55.3 million

and $

47.4 million

, respectively, is included in other long-term liabilities related to these deferred compensation liabilities.  Additionally, the Company purchased life insurance policies on certain participants to potentially offset these unsecured obligations.  These policies are recorded at their cash surrender value as determined by the insurance carrier.     The cash surrender value of these policies was $

57.2 million

and $

48.5 million

, as of December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017, respectively, and are recorded in other non-current assets.

Environmental

Costs that mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination or extend the life, increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of property utilized in current operations are capitalized.  Other costs that relate to current operations or an existing condition caused by past operations are expensed in the period incurred.  Environmental liabilities are recorded when the Company

’

s liability is probable and the costs are reasonably estimable, which is generally not later than the completion of the feasibility study or the Company

’

s recommendation of a remedy or commitment to an appropriate plan of action.  The accruals are reviewed periodically and, as investigations and remediations proceed, adjustments are made as necessary.  Accruals for losses from environmental remediation obligations do not consider the effects of inflation, and anticipated expenditures are not discounted to their present value.  The accruals are not reduced by possible recoveries from insurance carriers or other third parties, but do reflect anticipated allocations among potentially responsible parties at federal Superfund sites or similar state-managed sites and an assessment of the likelihood that such parties will fulfill their obligations at such sites.  The measurement of environmental liabilities by the Company is based on currently available facts, present laws and regulations, and current technology.  Such estimates take into consideration the Company’s prior experience in site investigation and remediation, the data concerning cleanup costs available from other companies and regulatory authorities, and the professional judgment of the Company’s environmental personnel in consultation with outside environmental specialists, when necessary.  The Company’s reserves for environmental remediation obligations totaled

$5.1 million

and

$7.0 million

at December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017, respectively.

Foreign Currency Translation

The Company

’

s foreign entities

’

accounts are generally measured using local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these entities are translated at the exchange rate in effect at year-end.  Revenues and expenses are translated at average month end rates of exchange prevailing during the year.  Unrealized translation gains and losses arising from differences in exchange rates from period to period are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity.

Hedging Activities/Derivative Instruments

Teledyne transacts business in various foreign currencies and has international sales and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, subjecting the Company to foreign currency risk.  The Company

’

s primary foreign currency risk objective is to protect the United States dollar value of future cash flows and minimize the volatility of reported earnings.  The Company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily related to forecasted revenue and expenses denominated in Canadian dollars for our Canadian companies, including DALSA and in British pounds for our UK companies, including e2v.  These contracts are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges.  The Company has also converted a US dollar denominated, variable rate debt obligation into a euro fixed rate obligation using a receive-float, pay fixed cross currency swap.  This cross currency swap is designated as a cash flow hedge.

The effectiveness of the cash flow hedge forward contracts, excluding time value, is assessed prospectively and retrospectively on a monthly basis using regression analysis, as well as using other timing and probability criteria.  To receive hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedges and must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions.  The effective portion of the cash flow hedge contracts

’

gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these hedges is initially reported, net of tax, as a component of AOCI in stockholders’ equity until the underlying hedged item is reflected in our consolidated statements of income, at which time the effective amount in AOCI is reclassified to cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income.  Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI, net of tax, for forward contracts that will mature in the next 12 months total

$3.2 million

.  These gains are expected to be offset by anticipated losses in the value of the forecasted underlying hedged item.  Amounts related to the cross currency swap expected to be reclassified from AOCI into income in the coming 12 months total

$2.2 million

.



In the event that the gains or losses in AOCI are deemed to be ineffective, the ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value, if any, is reclassified to other income and expense.  In the event that the underlying forecasted transactions do not occur, or it becomes remote that they will occur, within the defined hedge period, the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges will be reclassified from AOCI to other income and expense.  During the current reporting period, all forecasted transactions occurred and, therefore, there were no such gains or losses reclassified to other income and expense.  As of

December 31, 2017

, Teledyne had foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to buy Canadian dollars and to sell U.S. dollars totaling

$80.6 million

.  These foreign currency forward contracts have maturities ranging from March 2018 to February 2019.  Teledyne had foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to buy British pounds and to sell U.S. dollars totaling

$0.6 million

.  These foreign currency forward contracts have maturities ranging from March 2018 to April 2018.  Together these contracts has a fair value of

$3.8 million

.  The cross currency swap have notional amounts of

93.0 million

euros equivalent to

$100.0 million

, matures in October 2019.

In addition, the Company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes to mitigate foreign exchange rate risk associated with foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, including intercompany receivables and payables.  As of

December 31, 2017

, Teledyne had foreign currency contracts of this type in the following pairs (in millions):

The above table includes non-designated hedges derived from terms contained in triggered or previously designated cash flow hedges.  The gains and losses on these derivatives which are not designated as hedging instruments, are intended to, at a minimum, partially offset the transaction gains and losses recognized in earnings.

All derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.  As discussed below, the accounting for gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value depends on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting.  Teledyne does not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes.

The effect of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges for

was a loss of

$2.9 million

and

$9.6 million

, respectively.



The Company has elected to use the income approach to value the derivatives, using observable Level 2 market expectations at measurement date and standard valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount.  Level 2 inputs for the valuations are limited to quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets (specifically futures contracts on LIBOR and EURIBOR) and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (specifically LIBOR and EURIBOR cash and swap rates, foreign currency forward rates and cross currency basis spreads).  Mid-market pricing is used as a practical expedient for fair value measurements.  The fair value measurement of an asset or liability must reflect the nonperformance risk of the entity and the counterparty.  Therefore, the impact of the counterparty’s creditworthiness when in an asset position and the Company’s creditworthiness when in a liability position has also been factored into the fair value measurement of the derivative instruments and did not have a material impact on the fair value of these derivative instruments.  Both the counterparty and the Company are expected to continue to perform under the contractual terms of the instruments.

The fair values of the Company’s derivative financial instruments are presented below.  All fair values for these derivatives were measured using Level 2 information as defined by the accounting standard hierarchy (in millions):

Fair Value Measurements

When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of nonperformance.  The Company uses the following three levels of inputs in determining the fair value of the Company’s assets and liabilities, focusing on the most observable inputs when available:

•

Level 1-Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

•

Level 2-Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

•

Level 3-Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities.

To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment.  In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.  In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy



within which the fair value measurement is disclosed is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

Related Party Transactions

The Company had

related party transactions  that are required to be disclosed for all periods presented.

Recent Accounting Standards

In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  The ASU is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period.  Teledyne elected to adopt early this ASU in the third quarter of 2016, therefore Teledyne is required to report the material impacts of this standard as though the ASU had been adopted at the beginning of the fiscal year.  Accordingly, Teledyne recognized additional income tax benefits as an increase to net income of

$8.5 million

for 2016.  Teledyne has elected to record forfeitures as they occur, which did not have a material impact on the condensed consolidated financial results.  The new guidance did not impact any periods prior to our 2016 fiscal year, as the changes were applied on a prospective basis.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09 (Topic 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which provides a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance under Topic 605, Revenue Recognition.  The Company adopted the new standard as of January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective transition method which requires a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption.  Under the new standard, an entity recognizes revenue when or as it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a good or service to the customer, either at a point in time or over time.  The new standard requires expanded disclosures, including how and when we satisfy performance obligations as well as additional disaggregated revenue information to be provided more frequently in the reporting process.  We have expanded our reporting process to consider these additional disclosure requirements.

During the implementation process, the Company performed detailed contract analysis to determine the impact of the new standard to its revenue arrangements, updated its accounting policies and internal controls, continuously updated the impact of the standard and reported the findings and progress to the Audit Committee on a frequent basis over the last two years.  Under the new standard, we will continue to recognize revenue over time on most of our contracts that are covered by contract accounting standards using cost inputs to measure progress toward completion of our performance obligations, which is similar to the POC cost-to-cost method currently used on certain of these contracts.  Therefore, adoption of the new standard primarily impacts our contracts for which revenue is currently recognized using the POC units-of-delivery and milestone methods as we will recognize revenue for these contracts over time under the new standard using the POC cost-to-cost method.  These contracts represent approximately half of the revenue currently recognized under the POC method.  The percentage of Teledyne revenue recognized using any POC method was

28.6%

in 2017,

30.5%

in 2016, and

31.2%

in 2015.  Also impacted but to a much lesser extent, certain ship and bill contracts for custom products and products sold primarily to the U.S. Government, as well as repair contracts, will be recognized over time.  Accordingly, revenue will be recognized earlier in the performance period as costs are incurred, as opposed to recognizing revenue when units are delivered, milestones achieved or services completed.  The new standard will also impact our backlog and balance sheet presentation with an expected decrease in inventories, an increase in accounts receivable (i.e., unbilled receivables) and a net increase to retained earnings to primarily reflect the impact of converting certain ship and bill contracts and contracts currently applying the units-of-delivery and milestone methods to the cost-to-cost method for recognizing revenue and profits.

Under the modified retrospective transition method, the Company completed an analysis of its backlog as of January 1, 2018 and calculated and recorded the cumulative-effect of adopting the new standard as of January 1, 2018.  The cumulative effect of adopting the new standard resulted in an immaterial increase to retained earnings as of January 1, 2018 primarily because we continue to recognize revenue over time on the majority of impacted contracts.  The adoption of this standard is not expected to be material on our consolidated financial statements and financial condition.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).  The new guidance will require lessees to recognize almost all leases on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, other than leases that meet the definition of a short-term lease.  For income statement purposes, the FASB retained a dual model, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance.  The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted.  The new guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition, requiring application at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented.  The



Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, “Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment”, which eliminates the computation of the implied fair value of goodwill to measure a goodwill impairment charge. Instead, entities will record a goodwill impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value.  The new standard, will be effective for the Company prospectively for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.  We expect the adoption of this standard will reduce the complexity surrounding the evaluation of goodwill for impairment.  The impact of this new standard for the Company will depend on the outcomes of future goodwill impairment tests.

In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, “Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost.”  This ASU requires the service cost component of net benefit costs to be disaggregated from all other components and be reported in the same line item or items as other compensation costs and allow only the service cost component to be eligible for capitalization when applicable.  The other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and before income from operations.  This ASU is effective for the Company for interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2018.  Upon adoption, the amendments in this update will be applied retrospectively for the presentation of the components of net benefit cost, and prospectively for the capitalization of the service cost component of net benefit cost.  The adoption of this standard will not impact pre-tax income or earnings per share reported for the years ended December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017 and is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.  If this standard was adopted in prior periods, reported operating income would have been

$13.9

million and

$13.3

million lower and other income would have been

$13.9

million and

$13.3

million higher than reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017, respectively.  We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities.”  This ASU better aligns an entity’s risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships.  This ASU expands and refines hedge accounting for both nonfinancial and financial risk components, and this ASU simplifies and aligns the recognition and presentation of the effects of the hedging instrument and the hedged item in the financial statements.  This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and for interim periods therein, with early adoption permitted.  Teledyne is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.

In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02,  “Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income”, to address a specific consequence of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) by allowing a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Act reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate.  The guidance is effective for all entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the Tax Act is recognized.  Teledyne has not yet completed its assessment of the impact of the guidance on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

and


, respectively, net of any cash acquired.

2017 Acquisitions

On March 28, 2017, Teledyne completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding common stock of e2v technologies plc (“e2v”) for

$770.7 million

, including stock options and assumed debt, net of

$24.4 million

of cash acquired.  e2v provides high performance image sensors and custom camera solutions and application specific standard products for the machine vision market.  In addition, e2v provides high performance space qualified imaging sensors and arrays for space science and astronomy.  e2v also produces components and subsystems that deliver high reliability radio frequency power generation for healthcare, industrial and defense applications.  Finally, the company provides high reliability semiconductors and board-level solutions for use in aerospace, space and communications applications.  Teledyne funded the acquisition of e2v with borrowings under its credit facility and cash on hand as well as

$100.0 million

in a newly issued term loan.

Most of e2v’s operations are included in the Digital Imaging and Aerospace and Defense Electronics segments.  The Instrumentation segment includes a small portion of e2v’s operations.  Principally located in Chelmsford, United Kingdom and Grenoble, France, e2v had sales of approximately

£236 million

for its fiscal year ended March 31, 2016.  e2v’s results have



been included since the date of the acquisition and include

$274.2 million

in net sales and operating income of $

37.3 million

, which included

$8.3 million

in acquisition-related costs and

$11.2 million

in additional intangible asset amortization expense.

Fiscal year 2017 includes pretax charges of

$27.0 million

related to the acquisition of e2v, which included

$13.0 million

in transaction costs, including stamp duty, advisory, legal and other consulting fees and other costs recorded to selling, general and administrative expenses,

$5.7 million

in inventory fair value step-up amortization expense  recorded to cost of sales,

$2.3 million

in bank bridge facility commitment expense recorded to interest expense and

$6.0 million

related to a foreign currency option contract expense to hedge the e2v purchase price recorded as other expense.  Of these amounts,

$8.0 million

impacted the Digital Imaging segment and

$0.3 million

impacted the Aerospace and Defense segment operating results.  Fiscal year 2016 includes pretax charges of

$7.9 million

related to the acquisition of e2v, of which,

$1.9 million

was recorded to selling, general and administrative expenses,

$0.5 million

was recorded to interest expense and

$5.5 million

was recorded as other expense.

On July 20, 2017, a subsidiary of Teledyne acquired assets of Scientific Systems, Inc. (“SSI”) for an initial cash payment of

$31.0 million

.  A subsequent cash payment of

$0.3 million

related to a purchase price adjustment was made in 2017.  Headquartered in State College, PA, SSI manufactures precision components and specialized subassemblies used primarily in analytical and diagnostic instrumentation, such as High Performance Liquid Chromatography systems and specific medical devices and is part of the Instrumentation segment.

2016 Acquisitions

On December 6, 2016, Teledyne Instruments, Inc. acquired Hanson Research Corporation (“Hanson Research”) for

$25.0 million

in cash.  Hanson Research, headquartered in Chatsworth, California, specializes in analytical instrumentation for the pharmaceutical industry.

On November 2, 2016, Teledyne Instruments, Inc. acquired assets of IN USA, Inc. (“IN USA”) for

IN USA, headquartered in Norwood, Massachusetts, manufactures a range of ozone generators, ozone analyzers and other gas monitoring instruments utilizing ultraviolet and infrared based technologies.  Teledyne intends to relocate and consolidate manufacturing into the new, owned facility of Teledyne Advanced Pollution Instrumentation in San Diego, California.

On May 3, 2016, Teledyne DALSA, Inc., a Canadian-based subsidiary, acquired the assets and business of CARIS, Inc. (“CARIS”) for an initial cash payment of

$26.2 million

, net of cash acquired.  Based in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada, CARIS is a leading developer of geospatial software designed for the hydrographic and marine community.

On April 15, 2016, Teledyne LeCroy, Inc., a U.S.-based subsidiary, acquired assets of Quantum Data, Inc. (“Quantum Data”) for

$17.3 million

in cash.  Based in Elgin, Illinois, Quantum Data provides electronic test and measurement instrumentation and is a market leader in video protocol analysis test tools.  On April 6, 2016, Teledyne LeCroy, Inc. also acquired Frontline Test Equipment, Inc. (“Frontline”) for

$13.7 million

in cash.  Based in Charlottesville, Virginia, Frontline provides electronic test and measurement instrumentation and is a market leader in wireless protocol analysis test tools.  Each of the 2016 acquisitions are part of the Instrumentation segment except for CARIS which is part of the Digital Imaging segment.

2015 Acquisitions

On June 5, 2015, Teledyne DALSA BV, a Netherlands-based subsidiary, acquired ICM for $

21.8 million

, net of cash acquired.  In December 2016, an additional $

2.5 million

was paid by Teledyne related to an indemnification holdback.  Based in Liège, Belgium, ICM is a supplier of portable X-ray generators for non-destructive testing applications, as well as complete X-ray imaging systems for on-site security screening and is part of the Digital Imaging segment.

On April 29, 2015, Teledyne DALSA, Inc. acquired the remaining

49%

noncontrolling interest in the parent company of Optech for $

22.0 million

in cash.  As a result of the purchase, the difference between the cash paid and the balance of noncontrolling interest was recorded to additional paid in capital.  The balance of the noncontrolling interest of $

41.2 million

at December 28, 2014 decreased by $

0.3 million

for the net loss and $

1.3 million

in translation adjustments prior to the purchase which eliminated the remaining balance.  The balance of the noncontrolling interest of $

47.0 million

at December 29, 2013 decreased by $

2.1 million

for the net loss and $

3.7 million

in translation adjustments, resulting in a balance of $

41.2 million

at December 28, 2014. Teledyne no longer has any noncontrolling interests.  Optech is part of the Digital Imaging segment.

On February 2, 2015, Teledyne acquired Bowtech through a U.K.-based subsidiary for $

18.9 million

in cash, net of cash acquired and including an estimated working capital adjustment.  Based in Aberdeen, Scotland, Bowtech designs and manufactures harsh underwater environment vision systems and is part of the Instrumentation segment.  Also in 2015, Teledyne made an additional investment in Ocean Aero.

Teledyne funded the purchases from borrowings under its credit facility and cash on hand.  The ICM, Bowtech and Optech acquisitions were funded with cash held by foreign subsidiaries.  The results of the acquisitions have been included in Teledyne’s results since the dates of the respective acquisition.

The results of these acquisitions have been included in Teledyne’s results since the dates of their respective acquisition.



Other

The primary reasons for the above acquisitions were to strengthen and expand our core businesses through adding complementary product and service offerings, allowing greater integrated products and services, enhancing our technical capabilities or increasing our addressable markets.  The significant factors that resulted in recognition of goodwill were: (a) the purchase price was based on cash flow and return on capital projections assuming integration with our businesses and (b) the calculation of the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired that qualified for recognition.  Teledyne funded the purchases primarily from borrowings under its credit facility and cash on hand.

Teledyne’s goodwill was

$1,776.7 million

at

December 31, 2017

, and

$1,193.5 million

at

January 1, 2017

.  The increase in the balance of goodwill in 2017 resulted from the goodwill from current year acquisitions, partially offset by the impact of exchange rate changes.  Teledyne’s net acquired intangible assets were

$398.9 million

at

December 31, 2017

, and

$234.6 million

at

January 1, 2017

.  The increase in the balance of acquired intangible assets in 2017 primarily resulted from the acquisition of e2v, partially offset by amortization of acquired intangible assets.  The Company’s cost to acquire the 2017 acquisitions has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values as of the date of the completion of the acquisition.  The differences between the fair value of the consideration paid and the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired has been recorded as goodwill.  The Company is still in the process of specifically identifying the amount to be assigned to certain assets, including acquired intangible assets, and liabilities and the related impact on taxes and goodwill for the e2v and SSI acquisitions.  The Company made preliminary estimates as of December 31, 2017, since there was insufficient time between the acquisition date and the end of the period to finalize the analysis.  The Company has completed the allocation of all other acquisitions.

The following table presents proforma net sales, net income and earnings per share data assuming e2v was acquired at the beginning of the 2016 fiscal year:

The following tables show the purchase price (net of cash acquired), goodwill acquired and intangible assets acquired for the acquisitions made in 2017 and 2016 (in millions):



The following table is a summary at the acquisition date of the acquired intangible assets and weighted average useful life in years for the acquisitions made in


and


(dollars in millions):

Goodwill resulting from the acquisitions of SSI,  Frontline, Quantum Data, IN USA and CARIS will be deductible for tax purposes.  Goodwill resulting from the acquisitions of e2v and Hanson Research will not be deductible for tax purposes.



Amortizable other intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from

one

to

15 years

.  Consistent with Teledyne’s growth strategy, we seek to acquire companies in markets characterized by high barriers to entry and that include specialized products not likely to be commoditized.  Given our markets and highly engineered nature of our products, the rates of new technology development and customer acquisition and/or attrition are often not volatile.  As such, we believe the value of acquired intangible assets decline in a linear, as opposed to an accelerated fashion, and we believe amortization on a straight-line basis is appropriate.

The Company recorded

$41.4 million

,

$28.3

million and

$30.6

million in amortization expense in


,


and 2015, respectively, for other acquired intangible assets.  The expected future amortization expense for the next five years is as follows (in millions):


-

$38.5

;


-

$30.6

;


-

$28.7

;


-

$27.8

;


-

$24.9

The estimated remaining useful lives by asset category as of

December 31, 2017

, are as follows:



Note 4. Financial  Instruments

The Company had

no

cash equivalents at

December 31, 2017

or

January 1, 2017

.  The Company has categorized its cash equivalents, if any, as a Level 1 financial asset, measured at fair value based on quoted prices in active markets of identical assets.  The fair value of the Company’s forward currency contracts as of

December 31, 2017

and

January 1, 2017

, are disclosed in Note 2, “Hedging Activities/Derivative Instruments,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements below and are based on Level 2 inputs.  The fair value of the Company’s senior unsecured notes as described in Note 9, “Long-Term Debt,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements approximated the carrying value based upon Level 2 inputs at

December 31, 2017

and

January 1, 2017

.   The fair value of the Company’s credit facility, term loans and other debt, also described in Note 9, at

December 31, 2017

and

January 1, 2017

, approximates the carrying value due to the variable market rate used to calculate interest payments.  The Company does not have any other significant financial assets or liabilities that are measured at fair value.  The carrying value of other on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximates fair value, and the cost, if any, to terminate off-balance sheet financial instruments (primarily letters of credit) is not significant.

Note 5. Accounts Receivable

The billed contract receivables from the U.S. Government and prime contractors contain

$26.2

million and

$10.6

million at

December 31, 2017

, and

January 1, 2017

, respectively, due to long-term contracts.  The unbilled contract receivables from the U.S. Government and prime contractors contain

$42.4

million and

$36.9

million at

December 31, 2017

, and

January 1, 2017

, respectively, due to long-term contracts, generally

one

to

two years

.

Unbilled contract receivables represent accumulated costs and profits earned but not yet billed to customers.  The Company believes that substantially all such amounts will be billed and collected within one year.

Note 6. Inventories

Inventories at cost determined on the LIFO method were

$63.6 million

at

December 31, 2017

, and

$68.4 million

at

January 1, 2017

.  The remainder of the inventories using average cost or the FIFO methods, were

$348.6 million

at

December 31, 2017

, and

$268.4 million

at

January 1, 2017

.  Certain inventory costs are also reflective of the estimates used in applying the percentage-of-completion revenue recognition method.

The Company recorded

$2.9 million

in LIFO income in


,

$0.7

million in LIFO income in


and

$1.2

million of LIFO income in

Equity

Shares issued include stock options exercised as well as shares issued under certain compensation plans.

Treasury Stock

On January 27, 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to

2,500,000

shares of its common stock.  In February 2015, the Company entered into a $

142.0 million

accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreement with a financial institution (“ASR Counterparty”) in a privately negotiated transaction for

1,500,000

shares of the Company's common stock.  Pursuant to the ASR agreement, in February 2015, the Company advanced $

142.0 million

to the ASR counterparty and received

1,425,000

shares of common stock, which used $

134.9 million

of the $

142.0 million

advanced, representing

95%

of the estimated shares to be repurchased under the ASR agreement.  In November 2015, the February 2015 ASR was settled with the Company making a payment of $

1.2 million

.  In November 2015, the Company entered into a $

100.5 million

ASR agreement with a financial institution in a privately negotiated transaction for

1,100,000

shares of the Company's common stock.  Pursuant to the ASR agreement, the Company advanced $

100.5 million

to the ASR counterparty and received

1,045,000

shares of common stock, which used $

95.5 million

of the $

100.5 million

advanced, representing

95%

of the estimated shares to be repurchased under the ASR agreement.  In February 2016, the November 2015 ASR was settled and Teledyne received

135,374

shares of common stock.

The up-front payments were accounted for as a reduction to stockholders’ equity in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet in the period the payments were made.  The total number of shares of common stock repurchased under each ASR is based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of the common stock during the term of the respective ASR, less a discount.  At settlement, the ASR Counterparty may be required to deliver additional shares of the Company’s common stock to the Company or, under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to deliver shares of its common stock or make a cash payment to the ASR Counterparty.  The Company has treated the ASRs as a treasury share repurchase of common stock in the period the shares were delivered for purposes of calculating earnings per share and as a forward contract indexed to its own common stock.  The ASRs meet all of the applicable criteria for equity classification, and, therefore, is not accounted for as a derivative instrument.



In 2015, the Company spent $

243.8 million

to repurchase a total of

2,561,815

shares of its common stock.  Teledyne has

2,157,632

shares of treasury stock at December 31, 2017.

On January 26, 2016, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized an additional stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to an additional

3,000,000

shares of its common stock.  The 2015 and 2016 stock repurchase authorizations are expected to remain open continuously, with respect to the shares remaining thereunder, and the number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, such as share price, levels of cash and borrowing capacity available, alternative investment opportunities available immediately or longer-term, and other regulatory, market or economic conditions.  Future repurchases are expected to be funded with cash on hand and borrowings under the Company’s credit facility.

No

repurchases were made in 2017 or in 2016.

Preferred Stock

Authorized preferred stock may be issued with designations, powers and preferences designated by the Board of Directors.  There were

no

shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding in


,


or


.

Stock Incentive Plan

Teledyne has long-term incentive plans which provide its Board of Directors the flexibility to grant restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options and stock appreciation rights to officers and employees of Teledyne.  Employee stock options become exercisable in one-third increments on the first, second and third anniversary of the grant and have a maximum


-year life.

Until January 1, 2015, Teledyne also sponsored a stock plan for non-employee directors pursuant to which non-employee directors received annual stock options and received stock or stock options in lieu of their respective retainer and meeting fees. The stock options became exercisable

one year

after issuance and have a maximum


-year life.

No

stock options were granted in 2015.  Stock option compensation expense is recorded on a straight line basis over the appropriate vesting period, generally

three years

.  The Company recorded

$14.2 million

,

$11.6 million

, and

$12.2 million

for stock option expense, for


,


and


, respectively.  The Company issues shares of common stock upon the exercise of stock options.  On January 23, 2018, the Company granted

373,468

stock options to its employees at an exercise price of

$192.00

per share.

The total pretax intrinsic value of options exercised during


and


(which is the amount by which the stock price exceeded the exercise price of the options on the date of exercise) was

$33.1 million

and

$36.6 million

, respectively.  At

December 31, 2017

, the intrinsic value of stock options outstanding was

$224.9 million

and the intrinsic value of stock options exercisable was

$161.3 million

.  During


and


, the amount of cash received from the exercise of stock options was

$24.9 million

and

$36.1 million

, respectively.

At

December 31, 2017

, there was

$22.7 million

of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock option awards which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of

1.4 years

.

The fair value of stock options is determined by using a lattice-based option pricing model.  The Company uses a combination of its historical stock price volatility and the volatility of exchange traded options, if any, on the Company stock to compute the expected volatility for purposes of valuing stock options granted.  The period used for the historical stock price corresponded to the expected term of the options.  The period used for the exchange traded options, if any, included the longest-dated options publicly available, generally

three months

.  The expected dividend yield is based on Teledyne’s practice of not paying dividends.  The risk-free rate of return is based on the yield of U.S. Treasury Strips with terms equal to the expected life of the options as of the grant date.  The expected life in years is based on historical actual stock option exercise experience.

Based on the assumptions used in the valuation of stock options, the grant date weighted average fair value of stock options granted in


and


was

$48.45

and

$29.95

, respectively.



Stock option transactions for Teledyne

’

s stock option plans are summarized as follows:

The following table provides certain information with respect to stock options outstanding and stock options exercisable at

December 31, 2017

, under the stock option plans:

Performance Shares

Teledyne’s Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) provides grants of performance share units, which key officers and executives may earn if Teledyne meets specified performance objectives over a

three

-year period. Awards are payable in cash and to the extent available, shares of Teledyne common stock.  Awards are generally paid to the participants in

three

annual installments after the end of the performance cycle so long as they remain employed by Teledyne (with an exception for retirement).  Participants in the performance share program may elect to pay taxes due with respect to an installment payment with awarded cash, by reducing the number of awarded shares, or a combination thereof.

In February 2012, the performance cycle for the three-year period ending December 31, 2014, was set.  Under the plan, and based on actual performance, the company issued

1,944

shares in 2015,


shares in 2016 and

1,883

shares in 2017.

In February 2015, the performance cycle for the three-year period ending December 31, 2017, was set.  Under the plan, and based on actual performance, the number of shares that could be issued in

three

equal installments in 2018, 2019 and 2020, is

48,156

.

The calculated expense for each plan year was based on the expected cash payout and the expected shares to be issued, valued at the share price at the inception of the performance cycle, except for the shares that can be issued based on a market comparison.  The expected expense for these shares was calculated using a Monte-Carlo type simulation which takes into consideration several factors including volatility, risk free interest rates and correlation of Teledyne’s stock price with the comparator, the Russell 2000 Index (for 2018 the comparator is the Russell 1000).  No adjustment to the calculated expense for the shares issued based on a market based comparison will be made regardless of the actual performance.  The Company recorded

$4.6 million

,

$2.1 million

and

$2.3 million

in compensation expense related to the PSP program for fiscal years


,


and


, respectively.

Restricted Stock

Under Teledyne’s restricted stock award program selected officers and key executives receive a grant of stock equal to a specified percentage of the participant’s annual base salary at the date of grant.  The restricted stock is subject to transfer and forfeiture restrictions during an applicable “restricted period”.  The restrictions have both time-based and performance-based components.  The restricted period expires (and the restrictions lapse) on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to the achievement of stated performance objectives over a specified three-year performance period.  If employment is terminated (other than by death, retirement or disability) during the restricted period, stock is forfeited.



The calculated expense for restricted stock awards to employees is based on a Monte-Carlo type simulation which takes into consideration several factors including volatility, risk free interest rates and the correlation of Teledyne’s stock price with the comparator, the Russell 2000 Index (for 2018 the comparator is the Russell 1000).  No adjustment to the calculated expense will be made regardless of actual performance.  The Company recorded

$2.7 million

,

$2.7 million

and

$2.6 million

in compensation expense related to restricted stock awards to employees, for fiscal years


,


and


, respectively.  At

December 31, 2017

, there was

$2.6 million

of total estimated unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested awards which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately

1.3 years

.

The following table shows restricted stock award activity for grants made to both domestic and foreign based employees:

Beginning with the 2015 Annual Meeting, non-employee directors each receive restricted stock units valued at

$110,000

(or valued at

$55,000

for a person who becomes a director for the first time after the date of the Annual Meeting).  The restricted stock units generally vest

one year

following the date of grant and are settled in shares of common stock on the date of vesting unless a director has elected to defer settlement of the award until his or her separation from Board service.  The annual expense related to non-employee directors restricted stock grants was approximately

$1.0 million

for each of 2017, 2016 and 2015.  The following table shows restricted stock award activity for grants made to non-employee directors:

In December 2016, Teledyne granted

16,045

restricted stock units with a grant date fair value of

$2.0 million

to Teledyne’s Chief Executive Officer, which vest in equal annual installments over

three years

.  The calculated expense for restricted stock units is based on the market price of a share of Teledyne common stock at the grant date, which is recognized over the vesting period and was

$0.7 million

in 2017 and less than

$0.1 million

in 2016.  In December 2017, we issued

2,389

shares under the plan and

2,960

shares were withheld to pay income taxes.

€93.0 million

denominated instrument with a fixed euro interest rate of

0.7055%

.  The proceeds from the term loan were used in connection with the acquisition of e2v.  On April 18, 2017, Teledyne entered into a note purchase agreement for a private placement of

€250.0 million

of senior unsecured notes due through April 2024.  Teledyne used the proceeds of the private placement, among other things, to repay indebtedness and for general corporate purposes.

In December 2016, the Company entered into an amendment relating to term loans of

$182.5 million

in aggregate principal amount (the “Term Loans”) to extend the maturity date of the Term Loans from March 1, 2019  to January 31, 2022 and extending the date on which amortization of principal begins; and generally lowering the applicable rate for base rate and Eurocurrency loans.  The other material terms of the Term Loans, including covenants, remain unchanged.  In November 2015, the Company issued

$125.0 million

in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes.  The notes consisted of

$25.0 million

of

2.81%

senior unsecured notes due in November 2020, and

$100.0 million

of

3.28%

senior unsecured notes due in November 2022.  In December 2015, the Company amended the $

750.0 million

credit facility (“credit facility”) to extend the maturity from March 2018 to December 2020.  The other material terms of the credit facility, including covenants, remain unchanged.  Excluding interest and fees, no payments are due under the credit facility until it matures.  The credit agreements require the Company to comply with various financial and operating covenants, including maintaining certain consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios.  Borrowings under our credit facility and term loans are at variable rates which are, at our option, tied to a Eurocurrency rate equal to LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) plus an applicable rate or a base rate as defined in our credit agreements.  Eurocurrency rate loans may be denominated in U.S. dollars or an alternative currency as defined in the agreement.  Eurocurrency or LIBOR-based loans under the facility typically have terms of one, two, three or six months and the interest rate for each such loan is subject to change if the loan is continued or converted following the applicable maturity date.  The Company has not drawn any loans with a term longer than three months under the credit facility.  Base rate loans have interest rates that primarily fluctuate with changes in the prime rate. Interest rates are also subject to change based on our consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement.  The credit agreement also provides for facility fees that vary between

0.12%

and

0.25%

of the credit line, depending on our consolidated leverage ratio as calculated from time to time.

Teledyne also has a

$5.0 million

uncommitted credit line which permits credit extensions up to

$5.0 million

plus an incremental

$2.0 million

solely for standby letters of credit.  This credit line is utilized, as needed, for periodic cash needs.  There were

no

in outstanding funding advances under the uncommitted credit line at

December 31, 2017

and

$3.5 million

outstanding at

January 1, 2017

.  The Company also has

$6.7

million outstanding under capital leases, of which

$1.3

million is current.  At year-end


, Teledyne had

$29.6

million in outstanding letters of credit.

Available borrowing capacity under the

$750.0 million

credit facility, which is reduced by borrowings and certain outstanding letters of credit, was

$558.7 million

at

December 31, 2017

.  The credit agreement and term loans requires the Company to comply with various financial and operating covenants and at

December 31, 2017

, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.

Total interest expense including credit facility fees and other bank charges was

$35.5 million

in


,

$23.6 million

in


and

$24.0 million

in


.

Teledyne estimates the fair value of its long-term debt based on debt of similar type, rating and maturity and at comparable interest rates.  The Company

’

s long-term debt was considered a level 2 fair value hierarchy and is valued based on observable market data.  The estimated fair value of Teledyne

’

s long-term debt at

December 31, 2017

, and

January 1, 2017

, approximated the carrying value.



No minimum principal payments on the

$750.0 million

revolving credit facility are required until December 2020.  The Company began making quarterly minimum principal payments on the term loans in 2015.  Future minimum principal payments on long-term debt are as follows:


-

$2.3 million

;


-

$136.0 million

;


-

$105.1 million

;


-

$102.4 million

;


-

$482.0 million

; 2023 and beyond -

$240.4 million

.  The Company has no sinking fund requirements.

Note 10. Income Taxes

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted.  The Tax Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, implementing the territorial tax system and imposing a tax on deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings.  As a result of the Tax Act, Teledyne incurred provisional charges of

$4.7 million

in the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily due to the repatriation tax and the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities.  In accordance with the Tax Act, the Company will elect to pay the repatriation tax liability over a period of eight years, with the first installment of

$3.1 million

due in 2018.  The remainder of the tax liability is recorded in non-current income tax payable.  The repatriation tax resulted in a net tax expense of

$26.2 million

and the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities resulted in a net tax benefit of

$21.5 million

.  The impacts of the Tax Act may differ from this estimate, possibly materially (and the amount of the provisional charge may accordingly be adjusted over the course of 2018), due to changes in interpretations and assumptions Teledyne has made, guidance that may be issued, and actions Teledyne may take as a result of the Tax Act.  These adjustments to the provisional charge related to the Tax Act will be recorded quarterly until the computations are complete which is expected no later than the fourth quarter of 2018.

Income before income taxes included income from domestic operations of

$187.2 million

for


,

$195.2 million

for


and

$213.8 million

for


.  Income before taxes included income from foreign operations of

$99.8 million

for


,

$46.1 million

for


and

$44.4 million

for


.



The following is a reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the actual effective income tax rate:

Deferred income taxes result from temporary differences in the recognition of income and expense for financial and income tax reporting purposes, and differences between the fair value of assets acquired in business combinations accounted for as purchases for financial reporting purposes and their corresponding tax bases.  Deferred income taxes represent future tax benefits or costs to be recognized when those temporary differences reverse.

The categories of assets and liabilities that have resulted in differences in the timing of the recognition of income and expense were as follows (in millions):

On a provisional basis, we intend to reinvest indefinitely the earnings of our material foreign subsidiaries in our operations outside of the United States.  The cash that the Company's foreign subsidiaries hold for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance foreign operations and investments, including acquisitions.  We estimate that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash requirements.  Due to the Tax Act, U.S. federal and applicable state income taxes have been accrued for the deemed repatriation.  At December 31, 2017, the amount of undistributed foreign earnings was

$324.3 million

, for which we have not recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately

$1.4 million

for state corporate income taxes which would be due if reinvested foreign earnings were repatriated.  Should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings, we would need to adjust our income tax provision in the period we determined that we would no longer indefinitely reinvest the earnings outside the United States.

In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all positive and negative evidence, including recent financial performance, scheduled reversals of temporary differences, projected future taxable income, availability of taxable income in carryback periods and tax planning strategies.  Based on a review of such information, management believes that it is possible that some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized as a future benefit and therefore has recorded a valuation allowance.  The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets decreased by

$8.1 million

in 2017, primarily related to the



utilization of net operating loss carryforward and evidence for future utilization of the remaining investment tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards.

At

December 31, 2017

, the Company had approximately

$60.6 million

of net operating loss carryforward from foreign entities primarily from the Company’s Danish entity, which has

no

expiration date.  The Company had foreign capital loss carryforward in the amount of

$2.2 million

which has no expiration date.  Also the Company had aggregate Canadian federal and provincial investment tax credits of

$19.9 million

, which have expiration dates of 2029 to 2037.  In addition, the Company had domestic federal and state net operating loss carryforward of

$3.8 million

and

$131.1 million

, respectively.  Generally, federal net operating loss carryforward amounts are limited in their use by earnings of certain acquired subsidiaries, and have expiration dates ranging from 2030 to 2037 and the state net operating loss carryforward amounts have expiration dates ranging from 2020 to 2037.  Finally, the Company had federal research and development credit carryforward in the amount of

$1.2 million

which will expire between 2032 and 2035 and state tax credits of

$13.8 million

, of which

$11.6 million

have no expiration date and

$2.2 million

have expiration dates ranging from 2019 to 2033.

The Company anticipates the total unrecognized tax benefit for various federal, state and foreign tax items may be reduced by

$4.9 million

due to the expiration of statutes of limitation for various federal, state and foreign tax issues in the next 12 months.

We recognized net tax benefits for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes in our statements of operations of

$0.5 million

,

$0.2 million

and $

0.2 million

, for


,


and 2015, respectively.  Interest and penalties in the amount of

$1.4 million

,

$1.9 million

and $

2.1 million

were recognized in the


,


and 2015 statement of financial position, respectively.  Substantially all of the unrecognized tax benefits as of

December 31, 2017

, if recognized would affect our effective tax rate.

We file income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction and in various states and foreign jurisdictions.  The Company has substantially concluded on all U.S. federal income tax matters for all years through 2013, United Kingdom and France tax matters for all years through 2014 and Canadian income tax matters for all years through 2009.

Note 11. Pension Plans and Postretirement Benefits

Pension Plans

Teledyne has a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all U.S. employees hired before January 1, 2004, or approximately

13%

of Teledyne’s active employees.   As of January 1, 2004, new hires participate in a defined contribution plan only.  The Company also has several smaller domestic qualified and foreign-based defined benefit pension plans.

Teledyne’s domestic pension income was

$2.9 million

in


, compared with pension income of

$3.0 million

in


and pension expense of

$2.0 million

in


.  In the first quarter of 2015, Teledyne froze its non-qualified pension plan for top executives which resulted in a one-time gain of $

1.2 million

.  In accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (“CAS”),

$13.8 million

was recoverable from certain government contracts, for each of


,


and


.  Teledyne did not make any cash contributions to its domestic qualified pension plan since 2013.  In 2018, we are not required, and are not planning, to make any cash contributions to the domestic qualified pension plan.

In December 2017, the Company’s U.S. domestic qualified pension plan purchased group annuity contracts from an insurance company and paid a total annuity premium of

$19.0 million

.  This annuity contract transfers the obligation to this insurance company to guarantee the full payment of all annuity payments to approximately


existing retired pension plan participants or their surviving beneficiaries.  In June and December 2016, the Company’s U.S. domestic qualified pension plan purchased group annuity contracts from

two

insurance companies and paid a total annuity premium of

$27.2 million

.  These annuity contracts transfer the obligation to these insurance companies to guarantee the full payment of all annuity payments to approximately

1,193

existing retired pension plan participants or their surviving beneficiaries.  These annuity contracts assume all investment risk associated with the assets that were delivered as the annuity contract premiums.



The domestic qualified pension plan was amended in 2015 to allow participants at retirement to elect a lump-sum payment.  In 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company made lump sum payments of approximately

$21.7 million

,

$14.6 million

and

$10.5 million

, respectively, from the domestic qualified pension plan assets to certain participants in the plan as a result of these lump sum offers.  Each year beginning with 2014, the Society of Actuaries released revised mortality tables, which updated life expectancy assumptions.  In consideration of these tables, each year the Company reviews the mortality assumptions used in determining our pension and post-retirement obligations.

The Company’s contributions associated with its 401(k) plans were

$9.8 million

,

$9.3 million

and

$10.1 million

, for


,


and


, respectively.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually, taking into consideration the Company’s asset allocation, historical returns on the types of assets held, the current economic environment, and prospective expectations.  We determined the discount rate based on a model which matches the timing and amount of expected benefit payments to maturities of high-quality corporate bonds priced as of the pension plan measurement date.  The yields on the bonds are used to derive a discount rate for the obligation.

The following assumptions were used to measure the net benefit income/cost within each respective year:

For its domestic pension plans the Company is projecting a long-term rate of return on plan assets of

8.00%

in 2018.  For its foreign based pension plans the Company is projecting a long-term rate of return on plan assets will range from

1.00%

to

4.50%

in 2018.

(a)

The 2017, 2016 and 2015 amounts include lump sum payments to certain participants of

$21.7 million

,

$14.6 million

and

$10.5 million

, respectively.  In addition, in 2016, the Company’s U.S. domestic qualified pension plan purchased group annuity contracts from

two

insurance companies and paid a total annuity premium of

$27.2 million

.



The key assumptions used to measure the benefit obligation at each respective year-end were:

The measurement date for the Company’s pension plans is December 31.

The following table sets forth the funded status and amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets at year-end


and


for the domestic qualified and nonqualified pension plans and the foreign-based pension plans for benefits provided to certain employees (in millions):

Amounts for pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of fair value of plan assets are as follows (in millions):

At year-end


and


the Company had an accumulated non-cash reduction to stockholders

’

equity of

$227.8 million

and

$249.6 million

, respectively, related to its pension and postretirement plans.  The accumulated non-cash reductions to stockholders’ equity did not affect net income and were recorded net of accumulated deferred taxes of

$135.8 million

at year end


and

$147.3 million

at year end


.

At

December 31, 2017

, the estimated amounts of the minimum liability adjustment that are expected to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost during 2018 for the pension plans are: net loss

$31.5 million

and net prior service credit

$6.1 million

.



The following table sets forth the percentage of year-end market value by asset class for the pension plans:

The Company has an active management policy for a portion of the pension assets in the domestic pension plan.  The long term asset allocation target for the domestic plan consists of

70%

in equity instruments including a portion in alternatives and

30%

in fixed income instruments.  The balance in equity instruments for the domestic plan can range from

45%

to

75%

before rebalancing is required under the Company’s policy.

The pension plan’s investments are stated at fair value.  Plan investments that are considered a level 1 fair value hierarchy and are valued at quoted market prices in active markets.  Plan investments that are considered a level 2 fair value hierarchy and are valued based on observable market data.  Plan investments that would be considered a level 3 fair value hierarchy are valued based on management’s own assumption about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability (including assumptions about risk).

Certain investments measured at fair value using net asset values as a practical expedient are not required to be categorized in the fair value hierarchy table listed below.  As such, the total fair value of these net asset values based investments has been included in the table below to permit reconciliation to the plan asset amounts previously disclosed.

The fair values of the Company’s net pension assets, by fair value hierarchy, for both the U.S. and foreign pension plans as of

December 31, 2017

, by asset category are as follows (in millions):

a) There were

no

transfers of plan assets between the three levels of the fair value hierarchy during the year.

b) Reflects cash and cash equivalents held in overnight cash investments.

c)

29%

of mutual funds invest in fixed income types of securities;

71%

invest in equity securities.



The fair values of the Company’s net pension assets, by fair value hierarchy, for both the U.S. and foreign pension plans as of

January 1, 2017

, by asset category are as follows (in millions):

(a) There were

no

of transfers of plan assets between the three levels of the fair value hierarchy during the year.

(b) Reflects cash and cash equivalents held in overnight cash investments.

(c)

29%

of mutual funds invest in fixed income types of securities;

71%

invest in equity securities.

U.S. equities are valued at the closing price reported in an active market on which the individual securities are traded.  U.S. equities and non-U.S. equities are also valued at the net asset value provided by the independent administrator or custodian of the commingled fund.  The net asset value is based on the value of the underlying equities, which are traded on an active market.  Corporate bonds are valued using inputs such as the closing price reported, if traded on an active market, values derived from comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings, or under a discounted cash flow approach that utilizes observable inputs, such as current yields of similar instruments.  Fixed income investments are also valued at the net asset value provided by the independent administrator or custodian of the fund.  The net asset value is based on the underlying assets, which are valued using inputs such as the closing price reported, if traded on an active market, values derived from comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings, or under a discounted cash flow approach that utilizes observable inputs, such as current yields of similar instruments.  Alternative investments are primarily valued at the net asset value as determined by the independent administrator or custodian of the fund.  The net asset value is based on the underlying investments, which are valued using inputs such as quoted market prices of identical instruments or values derived from comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings, or under a discounted cash flow approach that utilizes observable inputs, such as current yields of similar instruments.

Postretirement Plans

The Company sponsors several postretirement defined benefit plans covering certain salaried and hourly employees.  The plans provide health care and life insurance benefits for certain eligible retirees.



The measurement date for the Company’s postretirement plans is December 31.

The following table sets forth the funded status and amounts recognized in Teledyne’s consolidated balance sheets for the postretirement plans at year-end


and


(in millions):

At

December 31, 2017

, the amounts in the AOCI that have not yet been recognized as components of net periodic benefit income for the retiree medical plans are: net gain

$2.7 million

and net prior service credit of less than

$0.1 million

.  At

December 31, 2017

, the estimated amortization from AOCI expected to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit income during 2018 for the retiree medical plans are: net gain

$0.3 million

and net prior service cost of less than

$0.1 million

.

The annual assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits (the health care cost trend rate) for health care plans is

6.5%

in 2018 and was assumed to decrease to

5.0%

by the year 2024 and remain at that level thereafter.  Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans.  A one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates would result in an increase in the annual service and interest costs by less than

$0.1 million

for 2017 and would result in an increase in the postretirement benefit obligation by

$0.3 million

at

December 31, 2017

.  A one percentage point decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rates would result in a decrease in the annual service and interest costs by less than

$0.1 million

for 2017 and would result in a decrease in the postretirement benefit obligation by

$0.2 million

at

December 31, 2017

.



Note 12. Business Segments

The Company has

four

reportable segments: Instrumentation; Digital Imaging; Aerospace and Defense Electronics; and Engineered Systems.  The Company manages, evaluates and aggregates its operating segments for segment reporting purposes primarily on the basis of product and service type, production process, distribution methods, type of customer, management organization, sales growth potential and long-term profitability.  The Instrumentation segment provides monitoring and control instruments for marine, environmental, industrial and other applications, electronic test and measurement equipment and harsh environment interconnect products.  The Digital Imaging segment includes high-performance sensors, cameras and systems, within the visible, infrared and X-ray spectra, for use in industrial, government and medical applications, as well as micro electro-mechanical systems (“MEMS”) and high-performance, high-reliability semiconductors including analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters.  It also includes our sponsored and centralized research laboratories benefiting government programs and businesses.  The Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment provides sophisticated electronic components and subsystems and communications products, including defense electronics, harsh environment interconnects, data acquisition and communications equipment for aircraft and components and subsystems for wireless and satellite communications, as well as general aviation batteries.  In the third quarter of 2016, Teledyne completed the disposition of the net assets of its PCT business for

$9.3 million

in cash resulting in

no

gain or loss.  PCT, which was part of the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, had sales of

$10.1 million

and

$16.6 million

for 2016 and 2015, respectively.  For 2016, PCT reported a pretax loss of

$3.1 million

and

$3.9 million

for 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The Engineered Systems segment provides innovative systems engineering and integration, advanced technology application, software development and manufacturing solutions for defense, space, environmental and energy applications.  The Engineered Systems segment also designs and manufactures electrochemical energy systems and small turbine engines.

Segment results include net sales and operating income by segment but excludes noncontrolling interest, equity income or loss, unusual non-recurring legal matter settlements, interest income and expense, gains and losses on the disposition of assets, sublease rental income and non-revenue licensing and royalty income, domestic and foreign income taxes and corporate office expenses.  Corporate expense includes various administrative expenses relating to the corporate office and certain nonoperating expenses not allocated to our segments.

As part of a continuing effort to reduce costs and improve operating performance the Company may take actions to consolidate and relocate certain facilities and reduce headcount across various businesses, reducing our exposure to weak end markets and high cost locations.

The following pre-tax charges were incurred related to severance and facility consolidations (in millions):

At December 31, 2017,

$1.5 million

remains to be paid related to these actions.

Information on the Company’s business segments was as follows (in millions):



Identifiable assets are those assets used in the operations of the segments.  Corporate assets primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, deferred taxes, net pension assets/liabilities and other assets.

Information on the Company’s sales by country of origin and long-lived assets by major geographic area was as follows (in millions):

Long-lived assets consist of property, plant and equipment, goodwill, acquired intangible assets, prepaid pension assets and other long-term assets including deferred compensation assets but excluding any deferred tax assets.  The all other countries category primarily consists of Teledyne’s operations in Europe.



Product Lines

The Instrumentation segment includes

three

product lines: Environmental Instrumentation, Marine Instrumentation and Test and Measurement Instrumentation.  All other segments each contain

one

product line.

The tables below provide a summary of the sales by product line for the Instrumentation segment (in millions):

Sales to the U.S. Government included sales to the U.S. Department of Defense of

$479.7 million

in


,

$449.4 million

in


, and

$447.2 million

in


.  Total sales to international customers were

$1,208.5 million

in


,

$919.4 million

in


, and

$1,020.4 million

in


.  Of these amounts, sales by operations in the United States to customers in other countries were

$555.5 million

in


,

$539.4 million

in


, and

$628.2 million

in


.  There were

no

sales to individual countries outside of the United States in excess of 10 percent of the Company’s sales.  Sales between business segments generally were priced at prevailing market prices and were $

22.8 million

, $

20.2 million

and $

19.4 million

for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Note 13. Lease Commitments

Operating lease agreements, which include leases for manufacturing facilities and office space frequently include renewal options and require the Company to pay for utilities, taxes, insurance and maintenance expense.  No lease agreement imposes a restriction on the Company’s ability to engage in financing transactions or enter into further lease agreements.

At

December 31, 2017

, future minimum lease payments for capital leases and for operating leases with non-cancelable terms of more than one year were as follows (in millions):

The


property, plant and equipment accounts included

$11.0 million

of property leased under capital leases and

$6.4 million

of related accumulated depreciation.  The


property, plant and equipment accounts included

$10.1 million

of property leased under capital leases and

$5.2 million

of related accumulated depreciation.  Rental expense under operating leases, net of immaterial sublease income, was

$26.9 million

in


,

$28.1 million

in


and

$24.5 million

in


.



Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies

The Company is subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations which require that it investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations, including sites at which the Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party under the federal Superfund laws and comparable state laws.

In accordance with the Company’s accounting policy disclosed in Note 2, environmental liabilities are recorded when the Company’s liability is probable and the costs are reasonably estimable.  In many cases, however, investigations are not yet at a stage where the Company has been able to determine whether it is liable or, if liability is probable, to reasonably estimate the loss or range of loss, or certain components thereof.  Estimates of the Company’s liability are further subject to uncertainties regarding the nature and extent of site contamination, the range of remediation alternatives available, evolving remediation standards, imprecise engineering evaluations and estimates of appropriate cleanup technology, methodology and cost, the extent of corrective actions that may be required, and the number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties, as well as the extent of their responsibility for the remediation.  Accordingly, as investigation and remediation of these sites proceeds, it is likely that adjustments in the Company’s accruals will be necessary to reflect new information.  The amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations in a given period, but the amounts, and the possible range of loss in excess of the amounts accrued, are not reasonably estimable.  Based on currently available information, however, management does not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those accrued with respect to sites with which the Company has been identified are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or liquidity.

At

December 31, 2017

, the Company’s reserves for environmental remediation obligations totaled

$5.1 million

, of which

$1.0 million

is included in current accrued liabilities.  The Company periodically evaluates whether it may be able to recover a portion of future costs for environmental liabilities from its insurance carriers and from third parties.  The timing of expenditures depends on a number of factors that vary by site, including the nature and extent of contamination, the number of potentially responsible parties, the timing of regulatory approvals, the complexity of the investigation and remediation, and the standards for remediation.  The Company expects that it will expend present accruals over many years, and will complete remediation of all sites with which it has been identified in up to

thirty years

.

Various claims (whether based on U.S. Government or Company audits and investigations or otherwise) may be asserted against the Company related to its U.S. Government contract work, including claims based on business practices and cost classifications and actions under the False Claims Act.  Although such claims are generally resolved by detailed fact-finding and negotiation, on those occasions when they are not so resolved, civil or criminal legal or administrative proceedings may ensue.  Depending on the circumstances and the outcome, such proceedings could result in fines, penalties, compensatory and treble damages or the cancellation or suspension of payments under one or more U.S. Government contracts.  Under government regulations, a company, or one or more of its operating divisions or units, can also be suspended or debarred from government contracts based on the results of investigations.  However, although the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not believe there is any audit, review or investigation currently pending against the Company of which management is aware that is likely to result in suspension or debarment of the Company, or that is otherwise likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or liquidity, although the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations for that period.

A number of other lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be asserted against the Company, including those pertaining to product liability, acquisitions, patent infringement, commercial contracts, employment and employee benefits.  While the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and some of these lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be determined adversely to the Company, management does not believe that the disposition of any such pending matters is likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition.



Note 15. Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)

a)

The first quarter of 2017 includes pretax charges of
