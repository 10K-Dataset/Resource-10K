This combined Form 10-K is separately
filed by Entergy Corporation and its seven "Registrant Subsidiaries": Entergy
Arkansas, Inc., Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C., Entergy Louisiana, LLC,
Entergy Mississippi, Inc., Entergy New Orleans, Inc., Entergy Texas, Inc., and
System Energy Resources, Inc.  Information contained herein relating
to any individual company is filed by such company on its own
behalf.  Each company makes representations only as to itself and
makes no other representations whatsoever as to any other company.

The report should be read in its
entirety as it pertains to each respective reporting company.  No one
section of the report deals with all aspects of the subject
matter.  Separate Item 6, 7, and 8 sections are provided for each
reporting company, except for the Notes to the financial
statements.  The Notes to the financial statements for all of the
reporting companies are combined.  All Items other than 6, 7, and 8
are combined for the reporting companies.

FORWARD-LOOKING
INFORMATION

In this
combined report and from time to time, Entergy Corporation and the Registrant
Subsidiaries each makes statements as a registrant concerning its expectations,
beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, strategies, and future events or
performance.  Such statements are "forward-looking statements" within
the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995.  Words such as "may," "will," "could," "project," "believe,"
"anticipate," "intend," "expect," "estimate," "continue," "potential," "plan,"
"predict," "forecast," and other similar words or expressions are intended to
identify forward-looking statements but are not the only means to identify these
statements.  Although each of these registrants believes that these
forward-looking statements and the underlying assumptions are reasonable, it
cannot provide assurance that they will prove correct.  Any
forward-looking statement is based on information current as of the date of this
combined report and speaks only as of the date on which such statement is
made.  Except to the extent required by the federal securities laws,
these registrants undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events, or otherwise.

Forward-looking
statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties.  There are
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, including those factors
discussed or incorporated by reference in (a) Item 1A. Risk Factors, (b)
Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis, and (c) the following factors
(in addition to others described elsewhere in this combined report and in
subsequent securities filings):

·

resolution
      of pending and future rate cases and negotiations, including various
      performance-based rate discussions and implementation of legislation
      ending the Texas transition to competition, and other regulatory
      proceedings, including those related to Entergy's System Agreement,
      Entergy's utility supply plan, recovery of storm costs, and recovery of
      fuel and purchased power costs

·

changes
      in utility regulation, including the beginning or end of retail and
      wholesale competition, the ability to recover net utility assets and other
      potential stranded costs, the operations of the independent coordinator of
      transmission for Entergy's utility service territory, and the application
      of more stringent transmission reliability requirements or market power
      criteria by the FERC

·

changes
      in regulation of nuclear generating facilities and nuclear materials and
      fuel, including possible shutdown of nuclear generating facilities,
      particularly those owned or operated by the Non-Utility Nuclear
      business

·

resolution
      of pending or future applications for license renewals or modifications of
      nuclear generating facilities

·

the
      performance of and deliverability of power from Entergy's generating
      plants, including the capacity factors at its nuclear generating
      facilities

·

Entergy's
      ability to develop and execute on a point of view regarding future prices
      of electricity, natural gas, and other energy-related
      commodities

·

prices
      for power generated by Entergy's merchant generating facilities, the
      ability to hedge, sell power forward or otherwise reduce the market price
      risk associated with those facilities, including the Non-Utility Nuclear
      plants, and the prices and availability of fuel and power Entergy must
      purchase for its Utility customers, and Entergy's ability to meet credit
      support requirements for fuel and power supply
  contracts

·

volatility
      and changes in markets for electricity, natural gas, uranium, and other
      energy-related commodities

·

changes
      in law resulting from federal or state energy
  legislation

·

changes
      in environmental, tax, and other laws, including requirements for reduced

ENTERGY'S
BUSINESS

Entergy is an integrated energy company
engaged primarily in electric power production and retail electric distribution
operations.  Entergy owns and operates power plants with approximately
30,000 MW of aggregate electric generating capacity, and Entergy is the
second-largest nuclear power generator in the United States.  Entergy
delivers electricity to 2.7 million utility customers in Arkansas, Louisiana,
Mississippi, and Texas.  Entergy generated annual revenues of $10.7
billion in 2009 and had approximately 15,000 employees as of December 31,
2009.

Entergy operates primarily through two
business segments: Utility and Non-Utility Nuclear.

·

Utility

generates,
      transmits, distributes, and sells electric power in a four-state service
      territory that includes portions of Arkansas, Mississippi, Texas, and
      Louisiana, including the City of New Orleans; and operates a small natural
      gas distribution business.

·

Non-Utility Nuclear

owns
      and operates six nuclear power plants located in the northern United
      States and sells the electric power produced by those plants primarily to
      wholesale customers.  This business also provides services to
      other nuclear power plant owners.  As discussed further in
      "

Management's Financial
      Discussion and Analysis

," in November 2007, the Board approved a
      plan to pursue a separation of the Non-Utility Nuclear business from
      Entergy through a tax-free spin-off of Non-Utility Nuclear to Entergy
      shareholders.

In
addition to its two primary, reportable, operating segments, Entergy also
operates the non-nuclear wholesale assets business.  The non-nuclear
wholesale assets business sells to wholesale customers the electric power
produced by power plants that it owns while it focuses on improving performance
and exploring sales or restructuring opportunities for its power
plants.  Such opportunities are evaluated consistent with Entergy's
market-based point-of-view.



The
following shows the principal subsidiaries and affiliates within Entergy's
business segments. Companies that file reports and other information with the
SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are identified in bold-faced
type.

Strategy

Entergy aspires to achieve
industry-leading total shareholder returns in an environmentally responsible
fashion by leveraging the scale and expertise inherent in its core nuclear and
utility operations.  Entergy's scope includes electricity generation,
transmission and distribution as well as natural gas transportation and
distribution.  Entergy focuses on operational excellence with an emphasis
on safety, reliability, customer service, sustainability, cost efficiency, and
risk management.  Entergy also focuses on portfolio management to make
periodic buy, build, hold, or sell decisions based upon its analytically-derived
points of view, which are updated as market conditions evolve.

ENTERGY
CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

REPORT
OF MANAGEMENT

Management of Entergy Corporation and
its subsidiaries has prepared and is responsible for the financial statements
and related financial information included in this document.  To meet
this responsibility, management establishes and maintains a system of internal
controls designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and
fair presentation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.  This system includes communication through
written policies and procedures, an employee Code of Entegrity, and an
organizational structure that provides for appropriate division of
responsibility and training of personnel.  This system is also tested
by a comprehensive internal audit program.

Entergy management assesses the
effectiveness of Entergy's internal control over financial reporting on an
annual basis.  In making this assessment, management uses the criteria
set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework.  Management acknowledges, however, that all internal
control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and can
provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation and presentation.

Entergy Corporation and the Registrant
Subsidiaries' independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte &
Touche LLP, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of Entergy's
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, which is
included herein on pages 402 through 409.

In addition, the Audit Committee of the
Board of Directors, composed solely of independent Directors, meets with the
independent auditors, internal auditors, management, and internal accountants
periodically to discuss internal controls, and auditing and financial reporting
matters.  The Audit Committee appoints the independent auditors
annually, seeks shareholder ratification of the appointment, and reviews with
the independent auditors the scope and results of the audit
effort.  The Audit Committee also meets periodically with the
independent auditors and the chief internal auditor without management present,
providing free access to the Audit Committee.

Based on management's assessment of
internal controls using the COSO criteria, management believes that Entergy and
each of the Registrant Subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2009.  Management further
believes that this assessment, combined with the policies and procedures noted
above, provides reasonable assurance that Entergy's and each of the Registrant
Subsidiaries' financial statements are fairly and accurately presented in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.


ENTERGY
CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENT'S
FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Entergy operates primarily through two
business segments: Utility and Non-Utility Nuclear.

·

Utility

generates,
      transmits, distributes, and sells electric power in service territories in
      four states that include portions of Arkansas, Mississippi, Texas, and
      Louisiana, including the City of New Orleans; and operates a small natural
      gas distribution business.

·

Non-Utility Nuclear

owns
      and operates six nuclear power plants located in the northern United
      States and sells the electric power produced by those plants primarily to
      wholesale customers.  This business also provides services to
      other nuclear power plant owners.

In
addition to its two primary, reportable, operating segments, Entergy also
operates the non-nuclear wholesale assets business.  The non-nuclear

Plan to Pursue Separation of
Non-Utility Nuclear

In November 2007, the Board approved a
plan to pursue a separation of the Non-Utility Nuclear business from Entergy
through a tax-free spin-off of the Non-Utility Nuclear business to Entergy
shareholders.  Upon completion of the Board-approved spin-off plan,
Enexus Energy Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy, would be a new,
separate, and publicly-traded company.  In addition, under the plan,
Enexus and Entergy are expected to enter into a nuclear services business joint
venture, EquaGen LLC, with 50% ownership by Enexus and 50% ownership by
Entergy.  The EquaGen board of managers would be comprised of equal
membership from both Entergy and Enexus.

Once the spin-off transaction is
complete, Entergy Corporation's shareholders will own all Entergy common stock
and will receive a distribution of 80.1 percent of the Enexus common
shares.  Entergy will transfer the remaining Enexus common shares to a
trust.  While held by the trust, the Enexus common shares will be
voted by the trustee in the same proportion as the other Enexus common shares on
any matter submitted to a vote of the Enexus shareholders.  Within a
period of up to 18 months after the spin-off, Entergy is expected to exchange
the Enexus common shares retained in the trust for Entergy common
shares.  Enexus common shares not ultimately exchanged, if any, will
be distributed to Entergy shareholders.

Enexus' business would be substantially
comprised of Non-Utility Nuclear's assets, including its six nuclear power
plants, and Non-Utility Nuclear's power marketing operation.  Entergy
Corporation's remaining business would primarily be comprised of the Utility
business.  EquaGen would operate the nuclear assets owned by Enexus
under the Board-approved plan, and provide certain services to the Utility's
nuclear operations.  EquaGen would also be expected to offer nuclear
services to third parties, including decommissioning, plant relicensing, plant
operations, and ancillary services.


Entergy
Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

In connection with the spin-off, Enexus
is currently expected to incur up to $4.0 billion of debt prior to completion of
the spin-off.  Currently, the debt is expected to be incurred in the
following transactions:

·

Enexus
      is expected to issue up to $2.0 billion of debt securities in partial
      consideration of Entergy's transfer to it of the Non-Utility Nuclear
      business.

·

These
      debt securities are expected to be exchanged for up to $2.0 billion of
      debt securities that Entergy plans to issue prior to the
      spin-off.  If the exchange occurs, the holders of the debt
      securities that Entergy plans to issue prior to the spin-off would become
      holders of up to $2.0 billion of Enexus debt
  securities.

·

Enexus
      is expected to issue up to $2.0 billion of debt securities directly to
      third party investors.

Out of
existing cash on hand and the proceeds Enexus would receive from the issuance of
debt securities directly to third party investors, it expects to retain
approximately $750 million, which it intends to use for working capital and
other general corporate purposes.  In addition, Enexus is expected to
apply up to $500 million of the proceeds from the issuance of these debt
securities to provide cash collateral as credit support for reimbursement
obligations in respect of letters of credit.  All of the remaining
proceeds, plus any remaining cash on hand, are expected to be transferred to
Entergy to settle Enexus' intercompany indebtedness owed to Entergy, including
indebtedness that Entergy will transfer to Enexus in the spin-off, and to
purchase certain assets from Entergy.  Enexus will not receive any
proceeds from either the issuance of the up to $2.0 billion of its debt
securities or the exchange of its debt securities for Entergy debt
securities.  Entergy expects to use the proceeds that it receives from
the issuance of its debt securities to reduce outstanding Entergy
debt.  The amount to be paid to Entergy, the amount and term of the
debt Enexus would incur, and the type of debt and entity that would incur the
debt have not been finally determined, but would be determined prior to the
spin-off.  A number of factors could affect this final determination,
and the amount of debt ultimately incurred could be different from the amount
disclosed.

Enexus executed a $1.175 billion credit
facility in December 2008.  In October 2009, Enexus executed Amendment
No. 1 to its credit facility, increasing the total credit facility amount to
$1.2 billion from $1.175 billion.  Enexus is not permitted to draw
down the facility until certain customary and transactional conditions related
to the spin-off are met on or prior to July 1, 2010.  Enexus may enter
into other financing arrangements meant to support Enexus' working capital and
general corporate needs and credit support obligations arising from hedging and
normal course of business requirements.

Entergy and Enexus intend to launch the
financing relating to the spin-off after requisite regulatory approvals are
received and when market conditions are favorable for such an
issuance.  Entergy expects the transaction to qualify for tax-free
treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes for both Entergy and its
shareholders.  Entergy received a private letter ruling from the IRS
regarding certain requirements for tax-free treatment.  In addition, a
supplemental ruling request has been filed with the IRS to reflect changes to
the initial spin-off plan.  Final terms of the transaction and
spin-off completion are subject to several conditions, including the final
approval of the Board.

Regulatory
Proceedings Regarding the Spin-Off

NRC

Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc., the
current NRC-licensed operator of the Non-Utility Nuclear plants, filed an
application in July 2007 with the NRC seeking indirect transfer of control of
the operating licenses for the six Non-Utility Nuclear power plants, and
supplemented that application in December 2007 to incorporate the planned
business separation.  Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc., which is
expected to be wholly-owned by EquaGen, would remain the operator of the plants
after the spin-off.  Entergy Operations, Inc., the current NRC-licensed
operator of Entergy's five Utility nuclear plants, would remain a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Entergy and would continue to be the operator of the Utility
nuclear plants.  In the December 2007 supplement to the NRC
application, Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc. provided additional information
regarding the spin-off transaction, organizational structure, technical and
financial qualifications, and general corporate information.  On July
28, 2008, the NRC staff approved the license transfers associated with the
proposed new ownership structure of EquaGen, the proposed licensed operator, as
well as the transfers to Enexus of the ownership of Big Rock Point, FitzPatrick,
Indian Point Units 1, 2

and 3,
Palisades, Pilgrim, and Vermont Yankee.  The approval for the proposed
new ownership structure is now effective until
August 1, 2010.  The review conducted by the NRC staff prior
to approval of the license and ownership transfers included matters such as the
financial and technical qualifications of the new organizations, as well as
decommissioning funding assurance.  In connection with the NRC
approvals, Enexus agreed to enter into a financial support agreement with the
entities that own the nuclear power plants in the total amount of $700 million
to provide financial support, if needed, for the operating costs of the six
operating Non-Utility Nuclear power plants.

FERC

Pursuant to Federal Power Act section
203, in February 2008 an application was filed with the FERC requesting approval
for the indirect disposition and transfer of control of jurisdictional
facilities of a public utility.  The FERC issued an order in June 2008
authorizing the requested indirect disposition and transfer of
control.  In August 2009 an amended application was filed with
the FERC to reflect the transfer to the exchange trust by Entergy of the 19.9
percent of Enexus' common stock shares.  In September 2009 the FERC
approved the amended application.

Vermont

On January 28, 2008, Entergy Nuclear
Vermont Yankee, LLC and Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc. requested approval from
the Vermont Public Service Board (VPSB) for the indirect transfer of control,
consent to pledge assets, issue guarantees and assign material contracts,
amendment to certificate of public good, and replacement of guaranty and
substitution of a credit support agreement for Vermont
Yankee.  Several parties intervened in the
proceeding.  Discovery has been completed in this proceeding, in which
parties could ask questions about or request the production of documents related
to the transaction.

In addition, the Vermont Department of
Public Service (VDPS), which is the public advocate in proceedings before the
VPSB, prefiled its initial and rebuttal testimony in the case in which the VDPS
took the position that Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee and Entergy Nuclear
Operations, Inc. have not demonstrated that the restructuring promotes the
public good because its benefits do not outweigh the risks, raising concerns
that the target rating for Enexus' debt is below investment grade and that the
company may not have the financial capability to withstand adverse financial
developments, such as an extended outage.  The VDPS testimony also
expressed concern about the EquaGen joint venture structure and Enexus' ability,
under the operating agreement between Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee and Entergy
Nuclear Operations, Inc., to ensure that Vermont Yankee is
well-operated.  Two distribution utilities that buy Vermont Yankee
power prefiled testimony that also expressed concerns about the structure but
found that there was a small net benefit to the restructuring.  The
VPSB conducted hearings on July 28-30, 2008, during which it considered the
testimony prefiled by Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee, Entergy Nuclear
Operations, Inc., the VDPS, and the two distribution
utilities.  Subsequently, Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc. supplied
supplemental data to the VPSB outlining the enhanced transaction structure
detailed in the amended petition filed in New York (discussed
below).  On October 8, 2009, a memorandum of understanding was filed
with the VPSB outlining an agreement reached with the VDPS, which, if approved
by the VPSB, would result in approval of the spin-off transaction in
Vermont.

In connection with this memorandum of
understanding, Enexus agreed to provide a $100 million working capital facility
to Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee and to obtain a $60 million letter of credit
to fund operating expenses after operations cease at Vermont
Yankee.  In addition, Enexus agreed that if it has not obtained a
credit rating of one notch below investment grade (e.g., a rating of BB+ by
S&P) or higher by January 1, 2014, then Enexus will furnish to Entergy
Nuclear Vermont Yankee a second letter of credit in the amount of $50 million to
support Vermont Yankee's operations, which must be from a financial institution
with a rating of A or higher from S&P, or in the alternative, a financial
institution with a similar rating from a nationally respected credit rating
agency that is of similar and appropriate credit quality.  Entergy
Nuclear Vermont Yankee and Entergy Nuclear Operations have prefiled testimony
explaining this memorandum of understanding and updating the VPSB on the
financial structure of the transactions and moved to amend their petition to
include Enexus.  To assist the VPSB in making its determinations and
deciding what, if any, further proceedings are needed, the VPSB, on November 20,
2009, issued information requests to the three companies and to the
VDPS.  The companies filed their responses on December 9, 2009 and the
VDPS filed its responses on December 24, 2009.  A VPSB decision on the
memorandum of understanding is pending.

Financial Discussion and Analysis

On January 27, 2010, Vermont
Governor Jim Douglas issued a statement directing the Commissioner of the VDPS
to request a stay from the VPSB of the spin-off proceedings pending an ongoing
investigation relating to elevated levels of tritium found in Vermont Yankee
groundwater monitoring wells.  The Governor's statement further
indicated that he would not ask the Vermont General Assembly to consider Vermont
Yankee license renewal during its 2010 session.  The governor's
statement also expressed concerns about potential decommissioning costs and
about inconsistent information related to underground piping at Vermont Yankee
carrying radionuclides that was provided by Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee and
Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc. in a proceeding before the VPSB related to
extending operation of Vermont Yankee beyond its current operating
license.    On February 3, 2010, the VDPS staff filed its
motion for a stay of the spin-off proceedings.  Entergy Nuclear
Vermont Yankee and Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc. filed a memorandum in
opposition to the request for a stay with the VPSB on February 18,
2010.

New York

On January 28, 2008, Entergy Nuclear
FitzPatrick, LLC, Entergy Nuclear Indian Point 2, LLC, Entergy Nuclear Indian
Point 3, LLC, Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc., and Enexus filed a petition with
the New York Public Service Commission (NYPSC) requesting a declaratory ruling
regarding corporate reorganization or in the alternative an order approving the
transaction and an order approving debt financing.  Petitioners also
requested confirmation that the corporate reorganization will not have an effect
on Entergy Nuclear FitzPatrick's, Entergy Nuclear Indian Point 2's, Entergy
Nuclear Indian Point 3's, and Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc.'s status as
lightly regulated entities in New York, given that they will continue to be
competitive wholesale generators.  The New York State Attorney
General's Office, Westchester County, and other intervenors filed objections to
the business separation and to the transfer of the FitzPatrick and Indian Point
Energy Center nuclear power plants, arguing that the debt associated with the
spin-off could threaten access to adequate financial resources for those nuclear
power plants and because the New York State Attorney General's Office believes
Entergy must file an environmental impact statement assessing the proposed
corporate restructuring.  In addition to the New York State Attorney
General's Office, several other parties also requested to be added to the
service list for this proceeding.

On May 23, 2008, the NYPSC issued its
Order Establishing Further Procedures in this matter.  In the order,
the NYPSC determined that due to the nuclear power plants' unique role in
supporting the reliability of electric service in New York, and their large size
and unique operational concerns, a more searching inquiry of the transaction
will be conducted than if other types of lightly-regulated generation were at
issue.  Accordingly, the NYPSC assigned an ALJ to preside over this
proceeding and prescribed a sixty (60) day discovery period.  The
order provided that after at least sixty (60) days, the ALJ would establish when
the discovery period would conclude.  The NYPSC stated that the scope
of discovery will be tightly bounded by the public interest inquiry relevant to
this proceeding; namely, adequacy and security of support for the
decommissioning of the New York nuclear facilities; financial sufficiency of the
proposed capital structure in supporting continued operation of the facilities;
and, arrangements for managing, operating and maintaining the
facilities.  The NYPSC also stated that during the discovery period,
the NYPSC Staff may conduct technical conferences to assist in the development
of a full record in this proceeding.

On July 23, 2008, the ALJs issued a
ruling concerning discovery and seeking comments on a proposed process and
schedule.  In the ruling, the ALJs proposed a process for completing a
limited, prescribed discovery process, to be followed three weeks later by the
filing of initial comments addressing defined issues, with reply comments due
two weeks after the initial comment deadline.  Following receipt of
all comments, a ruling will be made on whether, and to what extent, an
evidentiary hearing is required.  The ALJs asked the parties to
address three specific topic areas: (1) the financial impacts related to the
specific issues previously outlined by the NYPSC; (2) other obligations
associated with the arrangement for managing, operating and maintaining the
facilities; and (3) the extent that New York Power Authority (NYPA) revenues
from value sharing payments under the value sharing

Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management's

agreements
between Entergy and NYPA would decrease.  The ALJs have indicated that
the potential financial effect of the termination of the value sharing payments
on NYPA and New York electric consumers are factors the ALJs believe should be
considered by the NYPSC in making its public interest
determination.

In August 2008, Non-Utility Nuclear
entered into a resolution of a dispute with NYPA over the applicability of the
value sharing agreements to the FitzPatrick and Indian Point 3 nuclear power
plants after the spin-off.  Under the resolution, Non-Utility Nuclear
agreed not to treat the separation as a "Cessation Event" that would terminate
its obligation to make the payments under the value sharing
agreements.  As a result, after the spin-off, Enexus would continue to
be obligated to make payments to NYPA due under the amended and restated value
sharing agreements described above.  For further discussion of the
value sharing agreements, see Note 15 to the financial statements
herein.

In August 2009, Enexus filed with the
NYPSC an amended petition for an order approving the reorganization and
associated debt financings.  The amended petition describes proposed
enhancements to the corporate reorganization.  These proposed
enhancements include a commitment to reserve at least $350 million of liquidity,
a $1.0 billion reduction in long-term bonds to $3.5 billion, an increase in the
initial cash balance left at Enexus to $750 million from the original $250
million, and obtaining an up to $500 million cash-collateralized letter of
credit facility that will provide letters of credit for commodity-related and
non-hedging-related commercial transactions.  The amended petition
requested that the NYPSC: issue an order approving the corporate reorganization
and associated financings; confirm the corporate reorganization will have no
impact on the Enexus companies' status as lightly regulated entities; and issue
a negative declaration and undertake no further review under the New York State
Environmental Quality Review Act.

On August 21, 2009, the ALJs issued a
Ruling Concerning Scope, Process, and Schedule that determined that additional
record development was warranted in light of the changes contained in the
amended petition.  The August 21, 2009 ruling limited the issues
requiring further record development to environmental significance under the New
York State Environmental Quality Review Act and whether Enexus will be at least
as capable as Entergy in meeting all financial and other obligations related to
the ownership and operation of the New York nuclear facilities.  In
early November 2009 the New York State Attorney General's Office, the New York
Department of Public Service's Staff, and Westchester County filed initial
comments on the amended petition stating their opposition to Enexus' request in
the amended petition.  Various filings continued to be made into
January 2010 in accordance with the procedures and schedule ordered by the ALJs,
and the New York State Attorney General's Office, the New York Department of
Public Service's Staff, and Westchester County continue to oppose the
transaction.

At a hearing on February 11, 2010, the
NYPSC discussed Entergy's petition and issued a press release later that same
day.  The press release states, in part, that the NYPSC "received a
report from senior Staff of the Department of Public Service (Staff) addressing
a petition submitted by Entergy Corporation....  In its report, Staff
concluded that the transaction, as proposed, was not in the public interest, and
Staff provided the [NYPSC] information regarding the implications of rejecting
the proposal versus making changes to the proposed transaction to improve the
long-term financial stability of the three nuclear power plants in New York and
to provide ratepayer benefits.  The [NYPSC] will consider these topics
in more detail at a later date.  Staff concluded that the proposed
transaction was problematic because the amount of debt leverage employed to
finance Enexus is excessive when the business risks of this new merchant nuclear
plant enterprise are considered.  The principles behind the conditions
proposed by Staff are to assure the immediate financial viability of Enexus by
mitigating near-term liquidity risk related to debt covenants through a
reduction of $550 million in the debt issued by Enexus, to assure the Enexus’s
[sic] long-term financial capabilities through the maintenance of a specified
bond rating or ratio of debt-to-equity market value, and to provide New York
ratepayers some of the potential hedging benefits of nuclear power in periods of
rising commodity prices.  If the [NYPSC] decides to impose these
conditions, or similar conditions addressing the previously stated principles,
it is expected that the [NYPSC] will consider the comments of interested
parties.  Comments would then be analyzed and the matter brought back
for final deliberations at the earliest possible [NYPSC] session."

The NYPSC currently has meetings
scheduled for March 4 and March 25, 2010 at which it may consider the proposed
transaction again.

The
volume/weather variance is primarily due to increased electricity usage
primarily during the unbilled sales period in addition to the negative effect of
Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike in 2008.  Electricity usage by
industrial customers decreased, however, by 6%.  The overall decline
of the economy led to lower usage affecting both the large customer industrial
segment as well as small and mid-sized industrial customers, who are also being
affected by overseas competition.  The effect of the industrial sales
volume decrease is mitigated, however, by the fixed charge basis of many
industrial customers' rates, which causes average price per KWh sold to increase
as the fixed charges are spread over lower volume.


Entergy
Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

The retail electric price increase is
primarily due to:

·

rate
      increases that were implemented at Entergy Texas in January
      2009;

·

an
      increase in the formula rate plan rider at Entergy Gulf States Louisiana
      and Entergy Louisiana effective September 2008 and November
      2009;

·

the
      recovery of 2008 extraordinary storm costs at Entergy Arkansas as approved
      by the APSC, effective January 2009.  The recovery of 2008
      extraordinary storm costs is discussed in Note 2 to the financial
      statements;

·

an
      increase in the capacity acquisition rider related to the Ouachita plant
      acquisition at Entergy Arkansas.  The net income effect of the
      Ouachita plant cost recovery is limited to a portion representing an
      allowed return on equity with the remainder offset by Ouachita plant costs
      in other operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation expenses and
      taxes other than income taxes;

·

an
      increase in the formula rate plan rider at Entergy Mississippi in July
      2009;

·

an
      Energy Efficiency rider at Entergy Texas, which was effective December 31,
      2008, that is substantially offset in other operation and maintenance
      expenses; and

·

an
      increase in the Attala power plant costs recovered through the power
      management rider by Entergy Mississippi.  The net income effect
      of this recovery is limited to a portion representing an allowed return on
      equity with the remainder offset by Attala power plant costs in other
      operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation expenses, and taxes other
      than income taxes.

The
retail electric price increase was partially offset by:

·

a
      credit passed on to Louisiana retail customers as a result of the Act 55
      storm cost financings that began in the third quarter of
    2008;

·

a
      formula rate plan refund of $16.6 million to customers in November 2009 in
      accordance with a settlement approved by the LPSC.  See Note 2
      to the financial statements for further discussion of the settlement;
      and

·

a
      net decrease in the formula rate plans effective August 2008 at Entergy
      Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana to remove interim storm cost
      recovery upon the Act 55 financing of storm costs as well as the storm
      damage accrual.  A portion of the decrease is offset in other
      operation and maintenance expenses.  See Note 2 to the financial
      statements for further discussion of the formula rate
    plans.

The fuel recovery variance resulted
primarily from an adjustment to deferred fuel costs in the fourth quarter 2009
relating to unrecovered nuclear fuel costs incurred since January 2008 that will
now be recovered after a revision to the fuel adjustment clause
methodology.

The provision for regulatory
proceedings variance is primarily due to provisions recorded in 2009 at Entergy
Arkansas.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of
regulatory proceedings affecting Entergy Arkansas.

As shown in the table above, net
revenue for Non-Utility Nuclear decreased slightly by $11 million, or 0.5%, in
2009 compared to 2008.   Higher pricing in its contracts to sell
power was partially offset by lower volume resulting from more refueling outage
days in 2009 compared to 2008.  Included in net revenue is $53 million
and $76 million of amortization of the Palisades purchased power agreement in
2009 and 2008, respectively, which is non-cash revenue and is discussed in Note
15 to the financial statements.  Following are key performance

When Non-Utility Nuclear acquired its
six nuclear power plants it also entered into purchased power agreements with
each of the sellers.  For four of the plants, the 688 MW Pilgrim, 838
MW FitzPatrick, 1,028 MW Indian Point 2, and 1,041 MW Indian Point 3 plants, the
original purchased power agreements with the sellers expired in
2004.  The purchased power agreement with the seller of the 605 MW
Vermont Yankee plant extends into 2012, and the purchased power agreement with
the seller of the 798 MW Palisades plant extends into 2022.  Market
prices in the New York and New England power markets, where the four plants with
original purchased power agreements that expired in 2004 are located, increased
since the purchase of these plants, and the contracts that Non-Utility Nuclear
entered into after the original contracts expired, as well as realized day ahead
and spot market sales, have generally been at higher prices than the original
contracts.  Non-Utility Nuclear's annual average realized price per
MWh increased from $39.40 for 2003 to $61.07 for 2009.  Power prices
increased in the period from 2003 through 2008 primarily because of increases in
the price of natural gas.  Natural gas prices increased in the period
from 2003 through 2008 primarily


Entergy
Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

because
of rising production costs and limited imports of liquefied natural gas, both
caused by global demand and increases in the price of crude oil.  In
addition, increases in the price of power during this period were caused
secondarily by rising heat rates, which in turn were caused primarily by load
growth outpacing new unit additions.  The majority of the existing
long-term contracts for power from these four plants expire by the end of
2012.  The recent economic downturn and negative trends in the energy
commodity markets have resulted in lower natural gas prices and therefore
current prevailing market prices for electricity in the New York and New England
power regions are generally below the prices in Non-Utility Nuclear's existing
contracts in those regions.  Therefore, it is uncertain whether
Non-Utility Nuclear will continue to experience increases in its annual realized
price per MWh or what contract prices for power Non-Utility Nuclear will be able
to obtain as its existing long-term contracts expire.  As shown in the
contracted sale of energy table in "Market and Credit Risk Sensitive
Instruments," Non-Utility Nuclear has sold forward 88% of its planned energy
output in 2010 for an average contracted energy price of $57 per
MWh.

Other Income Statement
Items

Utility

Other
operation and maintenance expenses decreased from $1,867 million for 2008 to
$1,837 million for 2009.  The variance includes the
following:

·

a
      decrease due to the write-off in the fourth quarter 2008 of $52 million of
      costs previously accumulated in Entergy Arkansas's storm reserve and $16
      million of removal costs associated with the termination of a lease, both
      in connection with the December 2008 Arkansas Court of Appeals
      decision in Entergy Arkansas's base rate case.  The base rate case is
      discussed in more detail in Note 2 to the financial
      statements;

·

a
      decrease due to the capitalization of Ouachita plant service charges of
      $12.5 million previously expensed;

·

a
      decrease of $22 million in loss reserves in 2009, including a decrease in
      storm damage reserves as a result of the completion of the Act 55 storm
      cost financing at Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy
      Louisiana;

·

a
      decrease of $16 million in payroll-related and benefits
    costs;

·

prior
      year storm damage charges as a result of several storms hitting Entergy
      Arkansas' service territory in 2008, including Hurricane Gustav and
      Hurricane Ike in the third quarter 2008.  Entergy Arkansas
      discontinued regulatory storm reserve accounting beginning July 2007 as a
      result of the APSC order issued in Entergy Arkansas' rate
      case.  As a result, non-capital storm expenses of $41 million
      were charged to other operation and maintenance expenses.  In
      December 2008, $19.4 million of these storm expenses were deferred per an
      APSC order and were recovered through revenues in
  2009;

·

an
      increase of $35 million in fossil expenses primarily due to higher plant
      maintenance costs and plant
outages;

·

an
      increase of $22 million in nuclear expenses primarily due to increased
      nuclear labor and contract costs;

·

an
      increase of $14 million due to the reinstatement of storm reserve
      accounting at Entergy Arkansas effective January
  2009;

·

an
      increase of $14 million due to the Hurricane Ike and Hurricane Gustav
      storm cost recovery settlement agreement, as discussed below under "

Liquidity
      and Capital Resources

- Sources of
      Capital

-

Hurricane Gustav and
      Hurricane Ike

";

·

an
      increase of $8 million in customer service costs primarily as a result of
      write-offs of uncollectible customer accounts;
  and

·

a
      reimbursement of $7 million of costs in 2008 in connection with a
      litigation settlement.

Depreciation and
amortization expenses increased primarily due to an increase in plant in
service.

Other income increased primarily due
to:

·

an
      increase in distributions of $25 million earned by Entergy Louisiana and
      $9 million earned by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana on investments in
      preferred membership interests of Entergy Holdings Company.  The
      distributions on preferred membership interests are eliminated in
      consolidation and have no effect on Entergy's net income because the
      investment is in another Entergy subsidiary.  See Note 2 to the
      financial statements for a discussion of these investments in preferred
      membership interests;

carrying
      charges of $35 million on Hurricane Ike storm restoration costs as
      authorized by Texas legislation in the second quarter
  2009;

·

an
      increase of $15 million in allowance for equity funds used during
      construction due to more construction work in progress primarily as a
      result of Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike;
  and

·

a
      gain of $16 million recorded on the sale of undeveloped real estate by
      Entergy Louisiana Properties, LLC.

These
increases in other income were partially offset by a decrease of $14 million in
taxes collected on advances for transmission projects and a decrease of $18
million resulting from lower interest earned on the decommissioning trust funds
and short-term investments.

Interest charges increased primarily
due to an increase in long-term debt outstanding resulting from debt issuances
by certain of the Utility operating companies in the second half of 2008 and in
2009.

Non-Utility
Nuclear

Other operation and maintenance
expenses increased from $773 million in 2008 to $849 million in 2009 primarily
due to $46 million in outside service costs and incremental labor costs related
to the planned spin-off of the Non-Utility Nuclear business.  Also
contributing to the increase were higher nuclear labor and regulatory
costs.

Other income increased primarily due to
increases in interest income and realized earnings from the decommissioning
trust funds and interest income from loans to Entergy
subsidiaries.  These increases were partially offset by $86 million in
charges in 2009 compared to $50 million in charges in 2008 resulting from the
recognition of impairments of certain equity securities held in Non-Utility
Nuclear's decommissioning trust funds that are not considered
temporary.

Parent
& Other

Other operation and maintenance
expenses decreased for the parent company, Entergy Corporation, primarily due to
a decrease in outside services costs of $38 million related to the planned
spin-off of the Non-Utility Nuclear business.

Other income decreased primarily due
to:

·

an
      increase in the elimination for consolidation purposes of interest income
      from Entergy subsidiaries; and

·

increases
      in the elimination for consolidation purposes of distributions earned of
      $25 million by Entergy Louisiana and $9 million by Entergy Gulf
      States Louisiana on investments in preferred membership interests of
      Entergy Holdings Company, as discussed
above.

Interest charges decreased primarily
due to lower interest rates on borrowings under Entergy Corporation's revolving
credit facility.

Income
Taxes

The
effective income tax rate for 2009 was 33.6%.  The reduction in the
effective income tax rate versus the federal statutory rate of 35% in 2009 is
primarily due to:

·

a
      tax benefit of approximately $28 million recognized on a capital loss
      resulting from the sale of preferred stock of Entergy Asset Management,
      Inc., a non-nuclear wholesale subsidiary, to a third
  party;

·

the
      recognition of state loss carryovers in the amount of $24.3 million that
      had been subject to a valuation
allowance;

·

the
      recognition of a federal capital loss carryover of $16.2 million that had
      been subject to a valuation
allowance;

      to reflect the effect of a change in the methodology of computing
      Massachusetts state income taxes as required by that state's taxing
      authority; and

·

an
      additional deferred tax benefit of approximately $8 million associated
      with writedowns on nuclear decommissioning qualified trust
      securities.

These
reductions were partially offset by increases related to book and tax
differences for utility plant items and state income taxes at the Utility
operating companies.

The effective income tax rate for 2008
was 32.7%.  The reduction in the effective income tax rate versus the
federal statutory rate of 35% in 2008 is primarily due to:

·

a
      capital loss recognized for income tax purposes on the liquidation of
      Entergy Power Generation, LLC in the third quarter 2008, which resulted in
      an income tax benefit of approximately $79.5 million.  Entergy
      Power Generation, LLC was a holding company in Entergy's non-nuclear
      wholesale assets business;

·

recognition
      of tax benefits of $44.3 million associated with the loss on sale of stock
      of Entergy Asset Management, Inc., a non-nuclear wholesale subsidiary, as
      a result of a settlement with the IRS;
and

·

an
      adjustment to state income taxes for Non-Utility Nuclear to reflect the
      effect of a change in the methodology of computing Massachusetts state
      income taxes resulting from legislation passed in the third quarter 2008,
      which resulted in an income tax benefit of approximately $18.8
      million.

These
factors were partially offset by:

·

income
      taxes recorded by Entergy Power Generation, LLC, prior to its liquidation,
      resulting from the redemption payments it received in connection with its
      investment in Entergy Nuclear Power Marketing, LLC during the third
      quarter 2008, which resulted in an income tax expense of approximately
      $16.1 million; and

·

book
      and tax differences for utility plant items and state income taxes at the
      Utility operating companies, including the flow-through treatment of the
      Entergy Arkansas write-offs discussed
above.

income tax rates, and for additional discussion regarding income

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA -
FIVE-YEAR COMPARISON OF ENTERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

" which
accompanies Entergy Corporation's financial statements in this report for
further information with respect to operating statistics.

Earnings
were negatively affected in the fourth quarter 2007 by expenses of $52 million
($32 million net-of-tax) recorded in connection with a nuclear operations fleet
alignment.  This process was undertaken with the goals of eliminating
redundancies, capturing economies of scale, and clearly establishing
organizational governance.  Most of the expenses related to the
voluntary severance program offered to employees.  Approximately 200
employees from the Non-Utility Nuclear business and 150 employees in the Utility
business accepted the voluntary severance program offers.

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

The purchased power capacity variance
is primarily due to higher capacity charges.  A portion of the
variance is due to the amortization of deferred capacity costs and is offset in
base revenues due to base rate increases implemented to recover incremental
deferred and ongoing purchased power capacity charges.

The
volume/weather variance is primarily due to the effect of less favorable weather
compared to the same period in 2007 and decreased electricity usage primarily
during the unbilled sales period.  Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike,
which hit the Utility's service territories in September 2008, contributed an
estimated $46 million to the decrease in electricity
usage.  Industrial sales were also depressed by the continuing effects
of the hurricanes and, especially in the latter part of the year, because of the
overall decline of the economy, leading to lower usage in the latter part of the
year affecting both the large customer industrial segment as well as small and
mid-sized industrial customers.  The decreases in electricity usage
were partially offset by an increase in residential and commercial customer
electricity usage that occurred during the periods of the year not affected by
the hurricanes.

The retail electric price variance is
primarily due to:

·

an
      increase in the Attala power plant costs recovered through the power
      management rider by Entergy Mississippi.  The net income effect
      of this recovery is limited to a portion representing an allowed return on
      equity with the remainder offset by Attala power plant costs in other
      operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation expenses, and taxes other
      than income taxes;

·

a
      storm damage rider that became effective in October 2007 at Entergy
      Mississippi; and

·

an
      Energy Efficiency rider that became effective in November 2007 at Entergy
      Arkansas.

The
establishment of the storm damage rider and the Energy Efficiency rider results
in an increase in rider revenue and a corresponding increase in other operation
and maintenance expense with no impact on net income.  The retail
electric price variance was partially offset by:

·

the
      absence of interim storm recoveries through the formula rate plans at
      Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana which ceased upon the
      Act 55 financing of storm costs in the third quarter 2008;
    and

·

a
      credit passed on to customers as a result of the Act 55 storm cost
      financings.

compared to 2007 primarily due to higher pricing in its contracts to sell power,
additional production available from the acquisition of Palisades in April 2007,
and fewer outage days.  In addition to the refueling outages shown in
the table below, 2007

Other
operation and maintenance expenses increased from $1,856 million for 2007 to
$1,867 million for 2008.  The variance includes:

·

the
      write-off in the fourth quarter 2008 of $52 million of costs previously
      accumulated in Entergy Arkansas's storm reserve and $16 million of removal
      costs associated with the termination of a lease, both in connection with
      the December 2008 Arkansas Court of Appeals decision in Entergy
      Arkansas's base rate case.  The base rate case is discussed in more
      detail in Note 2 to the financial
statements;

·

a
      decrease of $39 million in payroll-related and benefits
    costs;

·

a
      decrease of $21 million related to expenses recorded in 2007 in connection
      with the nuclear operations fleet alignment, as discussed
      above;

·

a
      decrease of approximately $23 million as a result of the deferral or
      capitalization of storm restoration costs for Hurricane Gustav and
      Hurricane Ike, which hit the Utility's service territories in September
      2008;

·

an
      increase of $18 million in storm damage charges as a result of several
      storms hitting Entergy Arkansas' service territory in 2008, including
      Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike in the third quarter
      2008.  Entergy Arkansas discontinued regulatory storm reserve
      accounting beginning July 2007 as a result of the APSC order issued in
      Entergy Arkansas' base rate case.  As a result, non-capital
      storm expenses of $41 million were charged in 2008 to other operation and
      maintenance expenses.  In December 2008, $19 million of these
      storm expenses were deferred per an APSC order and will be recovered
      through revenues in 2009.  See Note 2 to the financial
      statements for discussion of the APSC order;
and

·

an
      increase of $17 million in fossil plant expenses due to the Ouachita plant
      acquisition in 2008.

Depreciation and amortization expenses
increased primarily due to:

·

a
      revision in the third quarter 2007 related to depreciation on storm
      cost-related assets.  Recoveries of the costs of those assets
      are now through the Act 55 financing of storm costs, as approved by the
      LPSC in the third quarter 2007.  See "Liquidity and Capital
      Resources - Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita" below and Note 2 to the
      financial statements for a discussion of the Act 55 storm cost
      financing;


Entergy
Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

·

a
      revision in the fourth quarter 2008 of estimated depreciable lives
      involving certain intangible assets in accordance with formula rate plan
      treatment; and

·

an
      increase in plant in service.

Other income decreased primarily due to
the cessation of carrying charges on storm restoration costs as a result of the
Louisiana Act 55 storm cost financing approved in 2007 and lower interest earned
on the decommissioning trust funds.  This decrease was substantially
offset by dividends earned of $29.5 million by Entergy Louisiana and
$10.3 million by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana on investments in preferred
membership interests of Entergy Holdings Company.  The dividends on
preferred stock are eliminated in consolidation and have no effect on net income
since the investment is in another Entergy subsidiary.

Non-Utility
Nuclear

Other operation and maintenance
expenses increased from $760 million in 2007 to $773 million in
2008.  This increase was primarily due to deferring costs for
amortization from three refueling outages in 2008 compared to four refueling
outages in 2007 and to a $34 million increase associated with owning the
Palisades plant, which was acquired in April 2007, for the entire
period.  The increase was partially offset by a decrease of $29
million related to expenses recorded in 2007 in connection with the nuclear
operations fleet alignment, as discussed above.

Depreciation and amortization expenses
increased from $99 million in 2007 to $126 million in 2008 as a result of the
acquisition of Palisades in April 2007, which contributed $12 million to the
increase, as well as other increases in plant in service.

Other income decreased primarily due to
$50 million in charges to interest income in 2008 resulting from the recognition
of impairments of certain equity securities held in Non-Utility Nuclear's
decommissioning trust funds that are not considered temporary.

Other expenses increased due to
increases of $23 million in nuclear refueling outage expenses and $15 million in
decommissioning expenses that primarily resulted from the acquisition of
Palisades in April 2007.

Parent
& Other

Other operation and maintenance
expenses increased for the parent company, Entergy Corporation, primarily due to
outside services costs of $69 million related to the planned spin-off of the
Non-Utility Nuclear business.

Other income decreased primarily due to
the elimination for consolidation purposes of dividends earned of
$29.5 million by Entergy Louisiana and $10.3 million by Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana on investments in preferred membership interests of Entergy Holdings
Company, as discussed above.

Interest
charges decreased primarily due to lower interest rates on borrowings under
Entergy Corporation's revolving credit facility.

Income
Taxes

The effective income tax rate for 2008
was 32.7%.  The reduction in the effective income tax rate versus the
federal statutory rate of 35% in 2008 is primarily due to:

·

a
      capital loss recognized for income tax purposes on the liquidation of
      Entergy Power Generation, LLC in the third quarter 2008, which resulted in
      an income tax benefit of approximately $79.5 million.  Entergy
      Power Generation, LLC was a holding company in Entergy's non-nuclear
      wholesale assets business;

·

recognition
      of tax benefits of $44.3 million associated with the loss on sale of stock
      of Entergy Asset Management, Inc., a non-nuclear wholesale subsidiary, as

      million.

These
factors were partially offset by:

·

income
      taxes recorded by Entergy Power Generation, LLC, prior to its liquidation,
      resulting from the redemption payments it received in connection with its

The effective income tax rate for 2007
was 30.7%.  The reduction in the effective income tax rate versus the
federal statutory rate of 35% in 2007 is primarily due to:

·

a
      reduction in income tax expense due to a step-up in the tax basis on the
      Indian Point 2 non-qualified decommissioning trust fund resulting from
      restructuring of the trusts, which reduced deferred taxes on the trust
      fund and reduced current tax
expense;

·

the
      resolution of tax audit issues involving the 2002-2003 audit
      cycle;

·

an
      adjustment to state income taxes for Non-Utility Nuclear to reflect the

      taxes as required by that state's taxing
  authority;

·

book
      and tax differences related to the allowance for equity funds used during
      construction; and

credits.

These
factors were partially offset by book and tax differences for utility plant
items and state income taxes at the Utility operating companies.

income tax rates, and for additional discussion regarding income
taxes.

Liquidity and Capital
Resources

This section discusses Entergy's
capital structure, capital spending plans and other uses of capital, sources of
capital, and the cash flow activity presented in the cash flow
statement.

Capital
Structure

Entergy's capitalization is balanced
between equity and debt, as shown in the following table.  The
decrease in the debt to capital percentage from 2008 to 2009 is primarily the
result of an increase in shareholders' equity primarily due to an increase in
retained earnings, partially offset by repurchases of common stock, along with a
decrease in borrowings under Entergy Corporation's revolving credit
facility.  The increase in the debt to capital percentage from 2007 to
2008 is primarily the result of additional borrowings under Entergy
Corporation's revolving credit facility.

Financial Discussion and Analysis

Net debt
consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents.  Debt consists of
notes payable, capital lease obligations, preferred stock with sinking fund, and
long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion.  Capital
consists of debt, shareholders' equity, and preferred stock without sinking
fund.  Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash
equivalents.  Entergy uses the net debt to net capital ratio in
analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to
its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy's financial
condition.

Long-term debt, including the currently
maturing portion, makes up substantially all of Entergy's total debt
outstanding.  Following are Entergy's long-term debt principal
maturities and estimated interest payments as of December 31,
2009.  To estimate future interest payments for variable rate debt,
Entergy used the rate as of December 31, 2009.  The figures below
include payments on the Entergy Louisiana and System Energy sale-leaseback
transactions, which are included in long-term debt on the balance
sheet.

Note 5 to
the financial statements provides more detail concerning long-term
debt.

Entergy Corporation has a revolving
credit facility that expires in August 2012 and has a borrowing capacity of $3.5
billion.  Entergy Corporation also has the ability to issue letters of
credit against the total borrowing capacity of the credit
facility.  The facility fee is currently 0.09% of the commitment
amount.  Facility fees and interest rates on loans under the credit
facility can fluctuate depending on the senior unsecured debt ratings of Entergy
Corporation.  The weighted average interest rate for the year ended
December 31, 2009 was 1.377% on the drawn portion of the facility.

As of
December 31, 2009, amounts outstanding and capacity available under the $3.5
billion credit facility are:

Under
covenants contained in Entergy Corporation's credit facility and in the
indenture governing Entergy Corporation's senior notes, Entergy is required
to maintain a consolidated debt ratio of 65% or less of its total
capitalization.  The calculation of this debt ratio under Entergy
Corporation's credit facility and in the indenture governing the Entergy
Corporation senior notes is different than the calculation of the debt to
capital ratio above.  Entergy is currently in compliance
with this covenant.  If Entergy fails to meet this ratio, or if
Entergy or one of the Utility operating companies (except Entergy New Orleans)
defaults on other indebtedness or is in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, an
acceleration of the Entergy Corporation credit facility's maturity date may
occur and there may be an acceleration of amounts due under Entergy
Corporation's senior notes.

Operating Lease Obligations
and Guarantees of Unconsolidated Obligations

Entergy has a minimal amount of
operating lease obligations and guarantees in support of unconsolidated
obligations.  Entergy's guarantees in support of unconsolidated
obligations are not likely to have a material effect on Entergy's financial
condition or results of operations.  Following are Entergy's payment
obligations as of December 31, 2009 on non-cancelable operating leases with a
term over one year:

The
operating leases are discussed in Note 10 to the financial

Purchase
      obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation
      charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or
      services.  Almost all of the total are fuel and purchased power
      obligations.

In addition to the
contractual obligations, Entergy expects to make payments of approximately $61
million for the years 2010-2012 primarily related to Hurricane Katrina
restoration work, including approximately $55 million of continued gas rebuild
work at Entergy New Orleans.

Also, Entergy currently expects
to contribute approximately $270 million to its pension plans and approximately
$76.4 million to other postretirement plans in 2010; although the required
pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1,
2010 valuations are completed by April 1, 2010.  Also, guidance
pursuant to the Pension Protection Act of 2006 rules, effective for the 2008
plan year and beyond, continues to evolve, be interpreted through technical
corrections bills, and discussed within the industry and congressional
lawmakers.  Any changes to the Pension Protection Act as a result of
these discussions and efforts may affect the level of Entergy's pension
contributions in the future.

Also in
addition to the contractual obligations, Entergy has $328 million of
unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes for which
the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to
uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax
positions.  See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional
information regarding unrecognized tax benefits.

Capital Funds
Agreement

Pursuant to an agreement with certain
creditors, Entergy Corporation has agreed to supply System Energy with
sufficient capital to:

·

maintain
      System Energy's equity capital at a minimum of 35% of its total
      capitalization (excluding short-term
debt);

·

Capital refers to amounts Entergy plans to spend on routine capital projects
that are necessary to support reliability of its service, equipment, or systems
and to support normal customer growth.

Capital Commitments refers to
non-routine capital investments for which Entergy is either contractually
obligated, has Board approval, or otherwise expects to make to satisfy
regulatory or legal requirements.  Amounts reflected in this category
include the following:

·

The
      currently planned construction or purchase of additional generation supply
      sources within the Utility's service territory through the Utility's
      portfolio transformation strategy, including Entergy Louisiana's planned
      purchase of Acadia Unit 2, which is discussed
  below.

·

Entergy
      Louisiana's Waterford 3 steam generators replacement project, which is
      discussed below.

·

System
      Energy's planned approximate 178 MW uprate of the Grand Gulf nuclear
      plant.  The project is currently expected to cost $575 million,
      including transmission upgrades.  On November 30, 2009, the MPSC
      issued a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for
      implementation of the uprate.

·

Transmission
      improvements and upgrades designed to provide greater transmission
      flexibility in the Entergy System.

·

Initial
      development costs for potential new nuclear development at the Grand Gulf
      and River Bend sites, including licensing and design
      activities.  This project is in the early stages, and several
      issues remain to be addressed over time before significant additional
      capital would be committed to this project.  In addition,
      Entergy temporarily suspended reviews of the two license applications for
      the sites and will explore alternative nuclear technologies for this
      project.

Environmental
      compliance spending, including approximately $420 million for the
      2010-2012 period for installation of scrubbers and low NOx burners at
      Entergy Arkansas' White Bluff coal plant, which under current
      environmental regulations must be operational by September
      2013.  Entergy Arkansas has requested a variance from that date,
      however, because the EPA has recently expressed concerns about Arkansas'
      Regional Haze State Implementation Plan and questioned the appropriateness
      of issuing an air permit prior to its approval of that
      plan.  The White Bluff project is currently suspended, but the
      latest conceptual cost estimate indicates Entergy Arkansas' share of the
      project could cost approximately $465 million.  Entergy
      continues to review potential environmental spending needs and financing
      alternatives for any such spending, and future spending estimates could
      change based on the results of this continuing
  analysis.

The
Utility's generating capacity remains short of customer demand, and its supply
plan initiative will continue to seek to transform its generation portfolio with
new or repowered generation resources.  Opportunities resulting from
the supply plan initiative, including new projects or the exploration of
alternative financing sources, could result in increases or decreases in the
capital expenditure estimates given above.  Estimated capital
expenditures are also subject to periodic review and modification and may vary
based on the ongoing effects of business restructuring, regulatory constraints
and requirements, environmental regulations, business opportunities, market
volatility, economic trends, and the ability to access capital.

Acadia Unit 2 Purchase
Agreement

In October 2009, Entergy Louisiana
announced that it has signed an agreement to acquire Unit 2 of the Acadia Energy
Center, a 580 MW generating unit located near Eunice, La., from Acadia Power
Partners, LLC, an independent power producer.  The Acadia Energy
Center, which entered commercial service in 2002, consists of two combined-cycle
gas-fired generating units, each nominally rated at 580 MW.  Entergy
Louisiana proposes to acquire 100 percent of Acadia Unit 2 and a 50 percent
ownership interest in the facility’s common assets for approximately $300
million.  In a separate transaction entered into earlier this year,
Cleco Power is acquiring Acadia Unit 1 and the other 50 percent interest in the
facility’s common assets.  Upon closing the transaction, Cleco Power
will serve as operator for the entire facility.  Entergy Louisiana has
committed to sell one third of the output of Unit 2 to Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana in accordance with terms and conditions detailed under the existing
Entergy System Agreement.

Entergy
Louisiana's purchase is contingent upon, among other things, obtaining necessary
approvals, including full cost recovery, from various federal and state
regulatory and permitting agencies.  Closing is expected to occur in
late 2010 or early 2011.  Entergy Louisiana and Acadia Power Partners
also have entered into a purchase power agreement for 100 percent of the output
of Acadia Unit 2 that is expected to commence on May 1, 2010 and is set to
expire at the closing of the acquisition transaction.  Entergy
Louisiana has filed with the LPSC for approval of the transaction, and no party
filed an opposition to the purchase power agreement and it has been forwarded to
the LPSC for its review.  The parties have agreed to a procedural
schedule for the acquisition that would lead to LPSC consideration of the matter
at its January 2011 meeting and includes a hearing before the ALJ in September
2010.

Waterford 3 Steam Generator
Replacement Project

Entergy
Louisiana plans to replace the Waterford 3 steam generators, along with the
reactor vessel closure head and control element drive mechanisms, in
2011.  Replacement of these components is common to pressurized water
reactors throughout the nuclear industry.  The nuclear industry continues
to address susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking of certain materials
associated with these components within the reactor coolant system.  The
issue is applicable to Waterford 3 and is managed in accordance with standard
industry practices and guidelines.  Routine inspections of the steam
generators during Waterford 3's Fall 2006 refueling outage identified additional
degradation of certain tube spacer supports in the steam generators that
required repair beyond that anticipated prior to the outage.  Corrective
measures were successfully implemented to permit continued operation of the
steam generators.  While potential future replacement of these
components had been contemplated, additional steam generator tube and component
degradation necessitates replacement of the steam generators as soon as
reasonably achievable.  The earliest the new steam generators can be
manufactured and delivered for installation is 2011.  A mid-cycle
outage performed in 2007 supports Entergy Louisiana's 2011 replacement
strategy.  The reactor vessel head and control element drive
mechanisms will be replaced at the same time, utilizing the same reactor
building construction opening that is necessary for the steam generator
replacement.

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

In June
2008, Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC for approval of the project,
including full cost recovery.  Following discovery and the filing of
testimony by the LPSC staff and an intervenor, the parties entered into a
stipulated settlement of the proceeding.  The LPSC unanimously
approved the settlement in November 2008.  The settlement resolved the
following issues: 1) the accelerated degradation of the steam generators is not
the result of any imprudence on the part of Entergy Louisiana; 2) the decision
to undertake the replacement project at the current estimated cost of $511
million is in the public interest, is prudent, and would serve the public
convenience and necessity; 3) the scope of the replacement project is in the
public interest; 4) undertaking the replacement project at the target
installation date during the 2011 refueling outage is in the public interest;
and 5) the jurisdictional costs determined to be prudent in a future prudence
review are eligible for cost recovery, either in an extension or renewal of the
formula rate plan or in a full base rate case including necessary pro forma
adjustments.  Upon completion of the replacement project, the LPSC
will undertake a prudence review with regard to the following aspects of the
replacement project: 1) project management; 2) cost controls; 3) success in
achieving stated objectives; 4) the costs of the replacement project; and 5) the
outage length and replacement power costs.

In July 2009, the LPSC granted Entergy
Louisiana's motion to dismiss, without prejudice, its application seeking
recovery of cash earnings on construction work in progress (CWIP) for the steam
generator replacement project, acknowledging Entergy Louisiana's right, at any
time, to seek cash earnings on CWIP if Entergy Louisiana believes that
circumstances or projected circumstances are such that a request for cash
earnings on CWIP is merited.  The cash earnings on CWIP application
had been consolidated with a similar request for the Little Gypsy repowering
project, which was also dismissed in response to the same motion.

Entergy
Louisiana estimates that it will spend approximately $511 million on this
project, including $299 million over the 2010-2011 period.

Little Gypsy Repowering
Project

In April 2007, Entergy Louisiana
announced that it intended to pursue the solid fuel repowering of a 538 MW unit
at its Little Gypsy plant, and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed subsequently
with the LPSC seeking certification to participate in one-third of the
project.  Petroleum coke and coal would be the unit's primary fuel
sources.  In July 2007, Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC for approval
of the repowering project.  In addition to seeking a finding that the
project is in the public interest, the filing with the LPSC asked that Entergy
Louisiana be allowed to recover a portion of the project's financing costs
during the construction period.

On March 11, 2009, the LPSC voted in
favor of a motion directing Entergy Louisiana to temporarily suspend the
repowering project and, based upon an analysis of the project's economic
viability, to make a recommendation regarding whether to proceed with the
project.  This action was based upon a number of factors including the
recent decline in natural gas prices, as well as environmental concerns, the
unknown costs of carbon legislation and changes in the capital/financial
markets.  On April 1, 2009, Entergy Louisiana complied with the LPSC's
directive and recommended that the project be suspended for an extended period
of time of three years or more.  Entergy Louisiana estimated that its
total costs for the project, if suspended, including actual spending to date and
estimated contract cancellation costs, would be approximately $300
million.  Entergy Louisiana had obtained all major environmental
permits required to begin construction.  A longer-term suspension
places these permits at risk and may adversely affect the project's economics
and technological feasibility.  On May 22, 2009, the LPSC issued an
order declaring that Entergy Louisiana's decision to place the Little Gypsy
project into a longer-term suspension of three years or more is in the public
interest and prudent.  In October 2009, Entergy Louisiana made a
filing with the LPSC seeking permission to cancel the project and seeking
recovery over a five-year period of the project costs.  The parties to
the proceeding agreed to a procedural schedule that results in a hearing in
October 2010.  Entergy Louisiana currently estimates that its total
costs for the project, if canceled, will be approximately $215 million, of which
approximately $193 million was incurred through December 31, 2009.


Entergy
Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

Dividends and Stock
Repurchases

Declarations of dividends on Entergy's
common stock are made at the discretion of the Board.  Among other
things, the Board evaluates the level of Entergy's common stock dividends based
upon Entergy's earnings, financial strength, and future investment
opportunities.  At its January 2010 meeting, the Board declared a
dividend of $0.75 per share, which is the same quarterly dividend per share that
Entergy has paid since third quarter 2007.  Entergy paid $577 million
in 2009, $573 million in 2008, and $507 million in 2007 in cash dividends on its
common stock.

In accordance with Entergy's
stock-based compensation plan, Entergy periodically grants stock options to its
key employees, which may be exercised to obtain shares of Entergy's common
stock.  According to the plan, these shares can be newly issued
shares, treasury stock, or shares purchased on the open
market.  Entergy's management has been authorized by the Board to
repurchase on the open market shares up to an amount sufficient to fund the
exercise of grants under the plan.

In
addition to the authority to fund grant exercises, in January 2007 the Board
approved a program under which Entergy is authorized to repurchase up to $1.5
billion of its common stock.  In January 2008, the Board authorized an
incremental $500 million share repurchase program to enable Entergy to consider
opportunistic purchases in response to equity market
conditions.  Entergy completed both the $1.5 billion and $500 million
programs in the third quarter 2009.  In October 2009 the Board granted
authority for an additional $750 million share repurchase program.

The
amount of repurchases may vary as a result of material changes in business
results or capital spending or new investment opportunities, or if limitations
in the credit markets continue for a prolonged period.

Sources
of Capital

Entergy's sources to meet its capital
requirements and to fund potential investments include:

·

internally
      generated funds;

·

cash
      on hand ($1.71 billion as of December 31,
2009);

·

securities
      issuances;

·

bank
      financing under new or existing facilities;
and

·

sales
      of assets.

Circumstances such as weather patterns,
fuel and purchased power price fluctuations, and unanticipated expenses,
including unscheduled plant outages and storms, could affect the timing and
level of internally generated funds in the future.

Provisions
within the Articles of Incorporation or pertinent indentures and various other
agreements relating to the long-term debt and preferred stock of certain of
Entergy Corporation's subsidiaries restrict the payment of cash dividends or
other distributions on their common and preferred stock.  As of
December 31, 2009, Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi had restricted
retained earnings unavailable for distribution to Entergy Corporation of $461.6
million and $236 million, respectively.  All debt and common and
preferred equity issuances by the Registrant Subsidiaries require prior
regulatory approval and their preferred equity and debt issuances are also
subject to issuance tests set forth in corporate charters, bond indentures, and
other agreements.  Entergy believes that the Registrant Subsidiaries
have sufficient capacity under these tests to meet foreseeable capital
needs.

The FERC
has jurisdiction over securities issuances by the Utility operating companies
and System Energy (except securities with maturities longer than one year issued
by Entergy Arkansas and Entergy New Orleans, which are subject to the
jurisdiction of the APSC and the City Council, respectively).  No
approvals are necessary for Entergy Corporation to issue
securities.  The current FERC-authorized short-term borrowing limits
are effective through October 2011, as established by a FERC order issued
October 14, 2009.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana,
Entergy Mississippi, Entergy Texas, and System Energy have obtained long-term
financing authorization from the FERC, and Entergy Arkansas


Entergy
Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

has
obtained long-term financing authorization from the APSC.  The
long-term securities issuances of Entergy New Orleans are limited to amounts
authorized by the City Council, and the current authorization extends through
August 2010.  In addition to borrowings from commercial banks, the
FERC short-term borrowing orders authorized the Registrant Subsidiaries to
continue as participants in the Entergy System money pool.  The money
pool is an intercompany borrowing arrangement designed to reduce Entergy's
subsidiaries' dependence on external short-term
borrowings.  Borrowings from the money pool and external short-term
borrowings combined may not exceed authorized limits.  As of December
31, 2009, Entergy's subsidiaries had no outstanding short-term borrowings from
external sources.  See Notes 4 and 5 to the financial statements for
further discussion of Entergy's borrowing limits and
authorizations.

Hurricane Gustav and
Hurricane Ike

In
September 2008, Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike caused catastrophic damage to
portions of Entergy's service territories in Louisiana and Texas, and to a
lesser extent in Arkansas and Mississippi.  The storms resulted in
widespread power outages, significant damage to distribution, transmission, and
generation infrastructure, and the loss of sales during the power
outages.  In October 2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy
Louisiana, and Entergy New Orleans drew a total of $229 million from their
funded storm reserves.

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and
Entergy Louisiana filed their Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike storm cost
recovery case with the LPSC in May 2009.  In September 2009, Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana made a supplemental filing to, among
other things, recommend recovery of the costs and replenishment of the storm
reserves by Louisiana Act 55 (passed in 2007) financing.  Entergy Gulf
States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana recovered their costs from Hurricane
Katrina and Hurricane Rita primarily by Act 55 financing, as discussed
below.  On December 30, 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and
Entergy Louisiana entered into a stipulation agreement with the LPSC Staff that,
if approved, provides for total recoverable costs of approximately $234 million
for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and $394 million for Entergy
Louisiana.  Under this stipulation, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana
agrees not to recover $4.4 million and Entergy Louisiana agrees not to recover
$7.2 million of their storm restoration spending.  The stipulation
also permits replenishing Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's storm reserve in the
amount of $90 million and Entergy Louisiana's storm reserve in the amount of
$200 million when Act 55 financing is accomplished.  The parties to
the proceeding have agreed to a procedural schedule that includes March/April
2010 hearing dates for both the recoverability and the method of recovery
proceedings.

Entergy Texas filed an application in
April 2009 seeking a determination that $577.5 million of Hurricane Ike and
Hurricane Gustav restoration costs are recoverable, including estimated costs
for work to be completed.  On August 5, 2009, Entergy Texas submitted
to the ALJ an unopposed settlement agreement intended to resolve all issues in
the storm cost recovery case.  Under the terms of the agreement $566.4
million, plus carrying costs, are eligible for recovery.  Insurance
proceeds will be credited as an offset to the securitized amount.  Of
the $11.1 million difference between Entergy Texas' request and the amount
agreed to, which is part of the black box agreement and not directly
attributable to any specific individual issues raised, $6.8 million is
operation and maintenance expense for which Entergy Texas recorded a charge in
the second quarter 2009.  The remaining $4.3 million was recorded as
utility plant.  The PUCT approved the settlement in August 2009, and
in September 2009 the PUCT approved recovery of the costs, plus carrying costs,
by securitization.  In November 2009, Entergy Texas Restoration
Funding, LLC (Entergy Texas Restoration Funding), a company wholly-owned and
consolidated by Entergy Texas, issued $545.9 million of senior secured
transition bonds (securitization bonds).  See Note 5 to the financial
statements for a discussion of the November 2009 issuance of the securitization
bonds.

In the third quarter 2009, Entergy
settled with its insurer on its Hurricane Ike claim and Entergy Texas received
$75.5 million in proceeds (Entergy received a total of $76.5
million).

Entergy Arkansas January
2009 Ice Storm

In January 2009 a severe ice storm
caused significant damage to Entergy Arkansas' transmission and distribution
lines, equipment, poles, and other facilities.  On January 30, 2009,
the APSC issued an order inviting and encouraging electric public utilities to
file specific proposals for the recovery of extraordinary storm restoration
expenses associated with the ice storm.  On February 16, 2009, Entergy
Arkansas filed a request with the APSC for an accounting order authorizing
deferral of the operating and maintenance cost portion of Entergy Arkansas' ice
storm restoration costs pending their recovery.  The APSC issued such
an order in March 2009 subject to certain conditions, including that if Entergy
Arkansas seeks to recover the deferred costs, those costs will be subject to
investigation for whether they are incremental, prudent, and
reasonable.  A law was enacted in April 2009 in Arkansas that
authorizes securitization of storm damage restoration costs.  On
February 1, 2010, Entergy Arkansas requested a financing order to issue
approximately $127.5 million in storm recovery bonds, which included carrying
costs of $11.7 million and $4.6 million of up-front financing costs to pay for
ice storm restoration because Entergy Arkansas' analysis demonstrates retail
customers will benefit from lower costs using securitization.  The
APSC has established a procedural schedule that includes a hearing in April 2010
and states that the APSC will issue its final order by June 15,
2010.  Entergy Arkansas' September 2009 general rate filing also
requested recovery of the January 2009 ice storm costs over 10 years if it was
expected that securitization would not produce lower costs for customers, and
Entergy Arkansas will remove this request if the APSC approves
securitization.

Hurricane Katrina and
Hurricane Rita

In August and September 2005,
Hurricanes Katrina and Rita caused catastrophic damage to large portions of the
Utility's service territories in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, including
the effect of extensive flooding that resulted from levee breaks in and around
the greater New Orleans area.  The storms and flooding resulted in
widespread power outages, significant damage to electric distribution,
transmission, and generation and gas infrastructure, and the loss of sales and
customers due to mandatory evacuations and the destruction of homes and
businesses.  Entergy pursued a broad range of initiatives to recover
storm restoration and business continuity costs, including obtaining
reimbursement of certain costs covered by insurance and pursuing recovery
through existing or new rate mechanisms regulated by the FERC and local
regulatory bodies, including the issuance of securitization bonds.

Insurance
Claims

Entergy has received a total of $317
million as of December 31, 2009 on its Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita
insurance claims, including the settlements of its Hurricane Katrina claims with
each of its two excess insurers.  Entergy has substantially completed
its insurance recoveries related to Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane
Rita.

Storm
Cost Financings

Louisiana

In March 2008, Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and the Louisiana Utilities Restoration
Corporation (LURC), an instrumentality of the State of Louisiana, filed at the
LPSC an application requesting that the LPSC grant financing orders authorizing
the financing of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana storm
costs, storm reserves, and issuance costs pursuant to Act 55 of the Louisiana
Legislature (Act 55 financings).  The Act 55 financings are expected
to produce additional customer benefits as compared to Act 64 traditional
securitization.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana also
filed an application requesting LPSC approval for ancillary issues including the
mechanism to flow charges and savings to customers via a Storm Cost Offset
rider.  On April 3, 2008, the Louisiana State Bond Commission granted
preliminary approval for the Act 55 financings.  On April 8, 2008, the
Louisiana Public Facilities Authority (LPFA), which is the issuer of the bonds
pursuant to the Act 55 financings, approved requests for the Act 55

financings. 
On April 10, 2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana and the
LPSC Staff filed with the LPSC an uncontested stipulated settlement that
includes Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana's proposals under
the Act 55 financings, which includes a commitment to pass on to customers a
minimum of $10 million and $30 million of customer benefits, respectively,
through prospective annual rate reductions of $2 million and $6 million for five
years.  On April 16, 2008, the LPSC approved the settlement and issued
two financing orders and one ratemaking order intended to facilitate
implementation of the Act 55 financings.  In May 2008, the Louisiana State
Bond Commission granted final approval of the Act 55 financings.

On July 29, 2008, the LPFA issued
$687.7 million in bonds under the aforementioned Act 55.  From the
$679 million of bond proceeds loaned by the LPFA to the LURC, the LURC deposited
$152 million in a restricted escrow account as a storm damage reserve for
Entergy Louisiana and transferred $527 million directly to Entergy
Louisiana.  From the bond proceeds received by Entergy Louisiana from
the LURC, Entergy Louisiana invested $545 million, including $17.8 million that
was withdrawn from the restricted escrow account as approved by the April 16,
2008 LPSC orders, in exchange for 5,449,861.85 Class A preferred, non-voting,
membership interest units of Entergy Holdings Company LLC, a company
wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy, that carry a 10% annual distribution
rate.  Distributions are payable quarterly commencing on September 15,
2008 and have a liquidation price of $100 per unit.  The preferred
membership interests are callable at the option of Entergy Holdings Company LLC
after ten years under the terms of the LLC agreement.  The terms of
the membership interests include certain financial covenants to which Entergy
Holdings Company LLC is subject, including the requirement to maintain a net
worth of at least $1 billion.

On August 26, 2008, the LPFA issued
$278.4 million in bonds under the aforementioned Act 55.  From the
$274.7 million of bond proceeds loaned by the LPFA to the LURC, the LURC
deposited $87 million in a restricted escrow account as a storm damage reserve
for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and transferred $187.7 million directly to
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana.  From the bond proceeds received by
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana from the LURC, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana
invested $189.4 million, including $1.7 million that was withdrawn from the
restricted escrow account as approved by the April 16, 2008 LPSC orders, in
exchange for 1,893,918.39 Class A preferred, non-voting, membership interest
units of Entergy Holdings Company LLC, a company wholly-owned and consolidated
by Entergy, that carry a 10% annual distribution rate.  Distributions
are payable quarterly commencing on September 15, 2008 and have a liquidation
price of $100 per unit.  The preferred membership interests are
callable at the option of Entergy Holdings Company LLC after ten years under the
terms of the LLC agreement.  The terms of the membership interests
include certain financial covenants to which Entergy Holdings Company LLC is
subject, including the requirement to maintain a net worth of at least $1
billion.

Texas

In July 2006, Entergy Texas filed an
application with the PUCT with respect to its Hurricane Rita reconstruction
costs incurred through March 2006.  The filing asked the PUCT to
determine the amount of reasonable and necessary hurricane reconstruction costs
eligible for securitization and recovery, approve the recovery of carrying
costs, and approve the manner in which Entergy Texas allocates those costs among
its retail customer classes.  In December 2006, the PUCT approved $381
million of reasonable and necessary hurricane reconstruction costs incurred
through March 31, 2006, plus carrying costs, as eligible for
recovery.  After netting expected insurance proceeds, the amount is
$353 million.

In April 2007, the PUCT issued its
financing order authorizing the issuance of securitization bonds to recover the
$353 million of hurricane reconstruction costs and up to $6 million of
transaction costs, offset by $32 million of related deferred income tax
benefits.  See Note 5 to the financial statements for a discussion of
the June 2007 issuance of the securitization bonds.

Community
Development Block Grants

In December 2005, the U.S. Congress
passed the Katrina Relief Bill, a hurricane aid package that includes $11.5
billion in Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) (for the states affected by
Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma) that allows state and local leaders to fund
individual recovery priorities.  The bill includes language that
permits funding to be provided for infrastructure restoration.

New
Orleans

In March 2006, Entergy New Orleans
provided a justification statement to state and local officials in connection
with its pursuit of CDBG funds to mitigate Hurricane Katrina restoration costs
that otherwise would be borne by customers.  The statement included
all the estimated costs of Hurricane Katrina damage, as well as a lost customer
base component intended to help offset the need for storm-related rate
increases.  In October 2006, the Louisiana Recovery Authority Board
endorsed a resolution proposing to allocate $200 million in CDBG funds to
Entergy New Orleans to defray gas and electric utility system repair costs in an
effort to provide rate relief for Entergy New Orleans customers.  The
proposal was developed as an action plan amendment and published for public
comment.  State lawmakers approved the action plan in December 2006,
and the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development approved it in
February 2007.  Entergy New Orleans filed applications seeking City
Council certification of its storm-related costs incurred through December
2006.  Entergy New Orleans supplemented this request to include the
estimated future cost of the gas system rebuild.

In March 2007, the City Council
certified that Entergy New Orleans incurred $205 million in storm-related costs
through December 2006 that are eligible for CDBG funding under the state action
plan, and certified Entergy New Orleans' estimated costs of $465 million for its
gas system rebuild.  In April 2007, Entergy New Orleans executed an
agreement with the Louisiana Office of Community Development (OCD) under which
$200 million of CDBG funds will be made available to Entergy New
Orleans.  Entergy New Orleans submitted the agreement to the
bankruptcy court, which approved it on April 25, 2007.  Entergy New
Orleans received $180.8 million of CDBG funds in 2007.

Mississippi

In March 2006, the Governor of
Mississippi signed a law that established a mechanism by which the MPSC could
authorize and certify an electric utility financing order and the state could
issue bonds to finance the costs of repairing damage caused by Hurricane Katrina
to the systems of investor-owned electric utilities.  Because of the
passage of this law and the possibility of Entergy Mississippi obtaining CDBG
funds for Hurricane Katrina storm restoration costs, in March 2006, the MPSC
issued an order approving a Joint Stipulation between Entergy Mississippi and
the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff that provided for a review of Entergy
Mississippi's total storm restoration costs in an Application for an Accounting
Order proceeding.  In June 2006, the MPSC issued an order certifying
Entergy Mississippi's Hurricane Katrina restoration costs incurred through March
31, 2006 of $89 million, net of estimated insurance proceeds.  Two
days later, Entergy Mississippi filed a request with the Mississippi Development
Authority for $89 million of CDBG funding for reimbursement of its Hurricane
Katrina infrastructure restoration costs.  Entergy Mississippi also
filed a Petition for Financing Order with the MPSC for authorization of state
bond financing of $169 million for Hurricane Katrina restoration costs and
future storm costs.  The $169 million amount included the $89 million
of Hurricane Katrina restoration costs plus $80 million to build Entergy
Mississippi's storm damage reserve for the future.  Entergy
Mississippi's filing stated that the amount actually financed through the state
bonds would be net of any CDBG funds that Entergy Mississippi
received.

In October 2006, the Mississippi
Development Authority approved for payment and Entergy Mississippi received $81
million in CDBG funding for Hurricane Katrina costs.  The MPSC then
issued a financing order authorizing the issuance of state bonds to finance
$8 million of Entergy Mississippi's certified Hurricane Katrina restoration
costs and $40 million for an increase in Entergy Mississippi's storm damage
reserve.  $30 million of the storm damage reserve was set aside in a
restricted account.  A Mississippi state entity issued the bonds in
May 2007, and Entergy Mississippi received proceeds of $48
million.  Entergy Mississippi does not report the bonds on its balance
sheet because the bonds are the obligation of the state entity, and there is no
recourse against Entergy Mississippi in the event of a bond
default.

Operating Cash Flow
Activity

Compared to 2008

Entergy's cash flow provided by
operating activities decreased by $391 million in 2009 compared to 2008
primarily due to the receipt in 2008 of $954 million from the Louisiana
Utilities Restoration Corporation as a result of the Louisiana Act 55 storm cost
financings, Arkansas ice storm restoration spending, and increases in nuclear
refueling outage spending and spin-off costs at Non-Utility
Nuclear.  These factors were partially offset by a decrease of $94
million in income tax payments, a decrease of $155 million in pension
contributions at Utility and Non-Utility Nuclear, increased collection of fuel
costs, and higher spending in 2008 on Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike storm
restoration.

Compared to 2007

Entergy's cash flow provided by
operating activities increased by $765 million in 2008 compared to
2007.  Following are cash flows from operating activities by
segment:

·

Utility
      provided $2,379 million in cash from operating activities in 2008 compared
      to providing $1,809 million in 2007 primarily due to proceeds of $954
      million received from the Louisiana Utilities Restoration Corporation as a
      result of the Louisiana Act 55 storm cost financings.  The Act
      55 storm cost financings are discussed in more detail in Note 2 to the
      financial statements.  A decrease in income tax payments of $290
      million also contributed to the increase.  Offsetting these
      factors were the net effect of Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike which
      reduced operating cash flow by $444 million in 2008 as a result of costs
      associated with system repairs and lower revenues due to customer outages,
      the receipt of $181 million of Community Development Block Grant funds by
      Entergy New Orleans in 2007, and a $100 million increase in pension
      contributions in 2008.

·

Non-Utility
      Nuclear provided $1,255 million in cash from operating activities in 2008
      compared to providing $880 million in 2007, primarily due to an increase
      in net revenue, partially offset by an increase in operation and
      maintenance costs, both of which are discussed in "Results of
      Operations."

·

Parent
      & Other used $310 million in cash in operating activities in 2008
      compared to using $129 million in 2007 primarily due to an increase in
      income taxes paid of $69 million and outside services costs of $69 million
      related to the planned spin-off of the Non-Utility Nuclear
      business.

Cost Equalization Proceeding Commenced by the LPSC


Entergy
Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

The
Utility operating companies historically have engaged in the coordinated
planning, construction, and operation of generating and bulk transmission
facilities under the terms of the System Agreement, which is a rate schedule
that has been approved by the FERC.  Certain of the Utility operating
companies' retail regulators and other parties are pursuing litigation involving
the System Agreement at the FERC.  The proceedings include challenges
to the allocation of costs as defined by the System Agreement and allegations of
imprudence by the Utility operating companies in their execution of their
obligations under the System Agreement.

In June 2005, the FERC issued a
decision in the System Agreement litigation that had been commenced by the LPSC,
and essentially affirmed its decision in a December 2005 order on
rehearing.  The FERC decision concluded, among other things,
that:

·

The
      System Agreement no longer roughly equalizes total production costs among
      the Utility operating companies.

·

In
      order to reach rough production cost equalization, the FERC will impose a
      bandwidth remedy by which each company's total annual production costs
      will have to be within +/- 11% of Entergy System average total annual
      production costs.

·

In
      calculating the production costs for this purpose under the FERC's order,
      output from the Vidalia hydroelectric power plant will not reflect the
      actual Vidalia price for the year but is priced at that year's average
      price paid by Entergy Louisiana for the exchange of electric energy under
      Service Schedule MSS-3 of the System Agreement, thereby reducing the
      amount of Vidalia costs reflected in the comparison of the Utility
      operating companies' total production
costs.

·

The
      remedy ordered by FERC in 2005 required no refunds and became effective
      based on calendar year 2006 production costs and the first reallocation
      payments were made in 2007.

The
FERC's decision reallocates total production costs of the Utility operating
companies whose relative total production costs expressed as a percentage of
Entergy System average production costs are outside an upper or lower
bandwidth.  Under the current circumstances, this will be accomplished
by payments from Utility operating companies whose production costs are more
than 11% below Entergy System average production costs to Utility operating
companies whose production costs are more than the Entergy System average
production cost, with payments going first to those Utility operating companies
whose total production costs are farthest above the Entergy System
average.

Assessing the potential effects of the
FERC's decision requires assumptions regarding the future total production cost
of each Utility operating company, which assumptions include the mix of solid
fuel and gas-fired generation available to each company and the costs of natural
gas and purchased power.  Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana,
Entergy Texas, and Entergy Mississippi are more dependent upon gas-fired
generation sources than Entergy Arkansas or Entergy New Orleans.  Of
these, Entergy Arkansas is the least dependent upon gas-fired generation
sources.  Therefore, increases in natural gas prices likely will increase
the amount by which Entergy Arkansas' total production costs are below the
Entergy System average production costs.

The LPSC, APSC, MPSC, and the AEEC
appealed the FERC's decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C.
Circuit.  Entergy and the City of New Orleans intervened in the
various appeals.  The D.C. Circuit issued its decision in April
2008.  The D.C. Circuit affirmed the FERC's decision in most respects,
but remanded the case to the FERC for further proceedings and reconsideration of
its conclusion that it was prohibited from ordering refunds and its
determination to implement the bandwidth remedy commencing with calendar year
2006 production costs (with the first payments/receipts commencing in June
2007), rather than commencing the remedy on June 1, 2005.  The D.C.
Circuit concluded the FERC had failed so far in the proceeding to offer a
reasoned explanation regarding these issues.  In December 2009 the
FERC established a paper hearing to determine whether the FERC had the authority
and, if so, whether it would be appropriate to order refunds resulting from
changes in the treatment of interruptible load in the allocation of capacity
costs by the Utility operating companies.  The FERC also deferred
further action on the question of whether it provided sufficient rationale for
not ordering refunds, and whether it impermissibly delayed implementation of the
bandwidth remedy, until resolution of this paper hearing.

Entergy's
Utility Operating Companies' Compliance Filing

In April 2006, the Utility operating
companies filed with the FERC their compliance filing to implement the
provisions of the FERC's decision.  The filing amended the System
Agreement to provide for the calculation of production costs, average production
costs, and payments/receipts among the Utility operating companies to the extent
required to maintain rough production cost equalization pursuant to the FERC's
decision.  The FERC accepted the compliance filing in November 2006,
with limited modifications. Provisions of the compliance filing as approved by
the FERC include: the first payments commenced in June 2007, rather than
earlier; interest is not required on the unpaid balance; and any payments will
be made over seven months, rather than 12.  In April 2007, the FERC
denied various requests for rehearing, with one exception regarding the issue of
retrospective refunds.  That issue will be addressed subsequent to the
remanded proceeding involving the interruptible load decision discussed further
below in this section under "Interruptible Load Proceeding."

believes that any changes in the allocation of production costs resulting from

allocated to Entergy Arkansas.  See "

," in
Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of a PUCT decision that
Entergy Texas is currently challenging regarding the rough production cost
equalization payments that could result in $18.6 million of trapped costs
between Entergy's Texas and Louisiana jurisdictions.

Based on
the FERC's April 27, 2007 order on rehearing that is discussed above, in the
second quarter 2007 Entergy Arkansas recorded accounts payable and Entergy Gulf
States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy Texas
recorded accounts receivable to reflect the rough production cost equalization
payments and receipts required to implement the FERC's remedy based on calendar
year 2006 production costs.  Entergy Arkansas recorded a corresponding
regulatory asset for its right to collect the payments from its customers, and
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and
Entergy Texas recorded corresponding regulatory liabilities for their
obligations to pass the receipts on to their customers.  The companies
have followed this same accounting practice each year since then.  The
regulatory asset and liabilities are shown as "System Agreement cost
equalization" on the respective balance sheets.

Rate Filing Based on Calendar Year 2006 Production Costs

Several parties intervened in the 2007
rate proceeding at the FERC, including the APSC, the MPSC, the Council, and the
LPSC, which have also filed protests.  The PUCT also
intervened.  Intervenor testimony was filed in which the intervenors
and also the FERC Staff advocated a number of positions on issues that affect
the level of production costs the individual Utility operating companies are
permitted to reflect in the bandwidth calculation, including the level of
depreciation and decommissioning expense for nuclear facilities.  The
effect of the various positions would be to reallocate costs among the Utility
operating companies.  The Utility operating companies filed rebuttal
testimony explaining why the bandwidth payments are properly recoverable under
the AmerenUE contract, and explaining why the positions of FERC Staff and
intervenors on the other issues should be rejected.  A hearing in this
proceeding concluded in July 2008, and the ALJ issued an initial decision in
September 2008.  The ALJ's initial decision concludes, among other
things, that: (1) the decisions to not exercise Entergy Arkansas' option to
purchase the Independence plant in 1996 and 1997 were prudent; (2) Entergy
Arkansas properly flowed a portion of the bandwidth payments through to AmerenUE
in accordance with the wholesale power contract; and (3) the level of nuclear
depreciation and decommissioning expense reflected in the bandwidth calculation
should be calculated based on NRC-authorized license life, rather than the
nuclear depreciation and decommissioning expense authorized by the retail
regulators for purposes of retail ratemaking.  Following briefing by
the parties, the matter was submitted to the FERC for decision.

January 11, 2010, the FERC issued its decision both affirming and overturning
certain of the ALJ's rulings, including overturning the decision on nuclear
depreciation and decommissioning expense.  The FERC’s conclusion
related to the AmerenUE contract does not permit Entergy Arkansas to recover a
portion of its bandwidth payment from AmerenUE.  The Utility operating
companies requested rehearing of that portion of the decision and requested
clarification on certain other portions of the decision.

AmerenUE argued that its current
wholesale power contract with Entergy Arkansas, pursuant to which Entergy
Arkansas sells power to AmerenUE, does not permit Entergy Arkansas to flow
through to AmerenUE any portion of Entergy Arkansas' bandwidth payment. 
According to AmerenUE, Entergy Arkansas has sought to collect from AmerenUE
approximately $14.5 million of the 2007 Entergy Arkansas bandwidth
payment.  The AmerenUE contract expired in August 2009.  In April
2008, AmerenUE filed a complaint with the FERC seeking refunds of this amount,
plus interest, in the event the FERC ultimately determines that bandwidth
payments are not properly recovered under the AmerenUE contract.  In
response to the FERC's decision discussed in the previous paragraph, Entergy
Arkansas recorded a regulatory provision in the fourth quarter 2009 for a
potential refund to AmerenUE.

The Utility operating companies also
filed with the FERC during 2007 certain proposed modifications to the rough
production cost equalization calculation.  The FERC rejected certain
of the proposed modifications, accepted certain of the proposed modifications
without further proceedings, and set two of the proposed modifications for
hearing and settlement procedures.  With respect to the proceeding
involving changes to the functionalization of costs to the production function,
a hearing was held in March 2008 and the ALJ issued an Initial Decision in June
2008 finding the modifications proposed by the Utility operating companies to be
just and reasonable.  In January 2010 the FERC affirmed the ALJ's
decision.

Rate Filing Based on Calendar Year 2007 Production Costs

Several parties intervened in the 2008
rate proceeding at the FERC, including the APSC, the LPSC, and AmerenUE, which
have also filed protests.  Several other parties, including the MPSC
and the City Council, have intervened in the proceeding without filing a
protest.  In direct testimony filed on January 9, 2009, certain
intervenors and also the FERC staff advocated a number of positions on issues
that affect the level of production costs the individual Utility operating
companies are permitted to reflect in the bandwidth calculation, including the
level of depreciation and decommissioning expense for the nuclear and
fossil-fueled generating facilities.  The effect of these various
positions would be to reallocate costs among the Utility operating
companies.  In addition, three issues were raised alleging imprudence
by the Utility operating companies, including whether the Utility operating
companies had properly reflected generating units' minimum operating levels for
purposes of making unit commitment and dispatch decisions, whether Entergy
Arkansas' sales to third parties from its retained share of the Grand Gulf
nuclear facility were reasonable, prudent, and non-discriminatory, and whether
Entergy Louisiana's long-term Evangeline gas purchase contract was prudent and
reasonable.

Financial Discussion and Analysis

The parties reached a partial
settlement agreement of certain of the issues initially raised in this
proceeding.  The partial settlement agreement was conditioned on the
FERC accepting the agreement without modification or condition, which the FERC
did on August 24, 2009.  A hearing on the remaining issues in the
proceeding was completed in June 2009, and in September 2009 the ALJ issued an
initial decision.  The initial decision affirms Entergy's position in
the filing, except for two issues that may result in a reallocation of costs
among the Utility operating companies.  Entergy, the APSC, the LPSC,
and the MPSC have submitted briefs on exceptions in the proceeding, and the
matter has been submitted to the FERC for decision.

Rate Filing Based on Calendar Year 2008 Production Costs

Several parties intervened in the 2009
rate proceeding at the FERC, including the LPSC and Ameren, which have also
filed protests.  On July 27, 2009, the FERC accepted Entergy's
proposed rates for filing, effective June 1, 2009, subject to
refund, and set the proceeding for hearing and settlement
procedures.  Settlement procedures have been terminated, and the ALJ
scheduled hearings to begin in April 2010, with an initial decision scheduled
for August 2010.

Calendar
Year 2009 Production Costs

The
liabilities and assets for the preliminary estimate of the payments and receipts
required to implement the FERC's remedy based on calendar year 2009 production
costs were recorded in December 2009, based on certain year-to-date
information.  The preliminary estimate was recorded based on the following
estimate of the payments/receipts among the Utility operating companies for
2010:

Payments
      or

(Receipts)

(In
      Millions)

Entergy

The
actual payments/receipts for 2010, based on calendar year 2009 production costs,
will not be calculated until the Utility operating companies' FERC Form 1s have
been filed.  Once the calculation is completed, it will be filed at
the FERC.  The level of any payments and receipts is significantly
affected by a number of factors, including, among others, weather, the price of
alternative fuels, the operating characteristics of the Entergy System
generating fleet, and multiple factors affecting the calculation of the non-fuel
related revenue requirement components of the total production costs, such as
plant investment.

Interruptible
Load Proceeding

In April 2007 the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the D.C. Circuit issued its opinion in the LPSC's appeal of the FERC's March
2004 and April 2005 orders related to the treatment under the System Agreement
of the Utility operating companies' interruptible loads.  In its opinion,
the D.C. Circuit concluded that the FERC (1) acted arbitrarily and capriciously
by allowing the Utility operating companies to phase-in the effects of the
elimination of the interruptible load over a 12-month period of time; (2) failed
to adequately explain why refunds could not be ordered under Section 206(c) of
the Federal Power Act; and (3) exercised appropriately its discretion to defer
addressing the cost of sulfur dioxide allowances until a later time.  The
D.C. Circuit remanded the matter to the FERC for a more considered determination
on the issue of refunds.  The FERC issued its order on remand in
September 2007, in which


Entergy
Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

it
directs Entergy to make a compliance filing removing all interruptible load from
the computation of peak load responsibility commencing April 1, 2004 and to
issue any necessary refunds to reflect this change.  In addition, the
order directs the Utility operating companies to make refunds for the period May
1995 through July 1996.  Entergy, the APSC, the MPSC, and the City
Council requested rehearing of the FERC's order on remand.  The FERC
granted the Utility operating companies' request to delay the payment of refunds
for the period May 1995 through July 1996 until 30 days following a FERC order
on rehearing.  The FERC issued in September 2008 an order denying
rehearing.  The refunds were made by the Utility operating companies
that owed refunds to the Utility operating companies that were due a refund on
October 15, 2008.  The APSC and the Utility operating companies
appealed the FERC decisions to the D.C. Circuit.  Because of its
refund obligation to customers as a result of this proceeding and a related LPSC
proceeding, Entergy Louisiana recorded provisions during 2008 of approximately
$16 million, including interest, for rate refunds.  The refunds were
made in the fourth quarter of 2009.

Following the filing of petitioners'
initial briefs, the FERC filed a motion requesting the D.C. Circuit hold the
appeal of the FERC's decisions ordering refunds in the interruptible load
proceeding in abeyance and remand the record to the FERC.  The D.C.
Circuit granted the FERC's unopposed motion on June 24, 2009, and directed the
FERC to file status reports at 60-day intervals beginning August 24,
2009.  The D.C. Circuit also directed the parties to file motions to
govern future proceedings in the case within 30 days of the completion of the
FERC proceedings.  In December 2009 the FERC established a paper
hearing to determine whether the FERC had the authority and, if so, whether it
would be appropriate to order refunds resulting from changes in the treatment of
interruptible load in the allocation of capacity costs by the Utility operating
companies.  Pursuant to the paper hearing schedule, initial briefs
were filed on January 19, 2010 and reply briefs were filed on February 9,
2010.

Entergy
Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi Notices of Termination of System Agreement
Participation and Related APSC Investigation

Citing
its concerns that the benefits of its continued participation in the current
form of the System Agreement have been seriously eroded, in December 2005,
Entergy Arkansas submitted its notice that it will terminate its participation
in the current System Agreement effective

ninety-six (

96)
months from the date of the notice or such earlier date as authorized by the
FERC.  Entergy Arkansas indicated, however, that a properly structured
replacement agreement could be a viable alternative.

In October 2007 the MPSC issued a
letter confirming its belief that Entergy Mississippi should exit the System
Agreement in light of the recent developments involving the System
Agreement.  The MPSC letter also requested that Entergy Mississippi
advise the MPSC regarding the status of the Utility operating companies' effort
to develop successor arrangements to the System Agreement and advise the MPSC
regarding Entergy Mississippi's position with respect to withdrawal from the
System Agreement.  In November 2007, pursuant to the provisions of the
System Agreement, Entergy Mississippi provided its written notice to terminate
its participation in the System Agreement effective ninety-six (96) months from
the date of the notice or such earlier date as authorized by the
FERC.

On February 2, 2009, Entergy Arkansas
and Entergy Mississippi filed with the FERC their notices of cancellation to
effectuate the termination of their participation in the Entergy System
Agreement, effective December 18, 2013 and November 7, 2015,
respectively.  While the FERC had indicated previously that the
notices should be filed 18 months prior to Entergy Arkansas' termination
(approximately mid-2012), the filing explains that resolving this issue now,
rather than later, is important to ensure that informed long-term resource
planning decisions can be made during the years leading up to Entergy Arkansas'
withdrawal and that all of the Utility operating companies are properly
positioned to continue to operate reliably following Entergy Arkansas' and,
eventually, Entergy Mississippi's, departure from the System
Agreement.  Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi requested that
the FERC accept the proposed notices of cancellation without further
proceedings.  Various parties intervened or filed protests in the
proceeding, including the APSC, the LPSC, the MPSC, and the City
Council.


Entergy
Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

In November 2009 the FERC accepted the
notices of cancellation and determined that Entergy Arkansas and Entergy
Mississippi are permitted to withdraw from the System Agreement following the 96
month notice period without payment of a fee or the requirement to otherwise
compensate the remaining Utility operating companies as a result of
withdrawal.  The FERC stated that it expected Entergy and all
interested parties to move forward and develop details of all needed successor
arrangements and encouraged Entergy to file its Section 205 filing for post 2013
arrangements as soon as possible.  The LPSC and the City Council have
requested rehearing of the FERC's decision.

The APSC had previously commenced an
investigation, in 2004, into whether Entergy Arkansas' continued participation
in the System Agreement is in the best interests of its
customers.  More than once in the investigation proceeding Entergy
Arkansas and its president, Hugh McDonald, filed testimony with the APSC in
response to requests by the APSC.  In addition, Mr. McDonald has
appeared before the APSC on more than one occasion at public hearings for
questioning.  In December 2007, the APSC ordered Mr. McDonald to file
testimony each month with the APSC detailing progress toward development of
successor arrangements, beginning in March 2008, and Mr. McDonald has done
so.  In his September 2009 testimony Mr. McDonald reported to the APSC
the results of a related study.  According to the study total
estimated cost to establish the systems and staff the organizations to perform
the necessary planning and operating functions for a stand-alone Entergy
Arkansas operation are estimated at approximately $23 million, including $18
million to establish generation-related functions and $5 million to modify
transmission-related information systems.  Incremental costs for
ongoing staffing and systems costs are estimated at approximately $8
million.  Cost and implementation schedule estimates will continue to
be re-evaluated and refined as additional, more detailed analysis is
completed.  The study did not assess the effect of stand-alone
operation on Entergy Arkansas’ generation resource
requirements.  Entergy Arkansas expects it would take approximately
two years to implement stand-alone operations for Entergy Arkansas.

In February 2010 the APSC issued an
order announcing a refocus of its ongoing investigation of Entergy Arkansas'
post-System Agreement operation.  The order describes the APSC's
"stated purpose in opening this inquiry to conduct an investigation regarding
the prudence of [Entergy Arkansas] entering into a successor ESA [Entergy System
Agreement] as opposed to becoming a stand-alone utility upon its exit from the
ESA, and whether [Entergy Arkansas], as a standalone utility, should join the
SPP RTO.  It is the [APSC's] intention to render a decision regarding
the prudence of [Entergy Arkansas] entering into a successor ESA as opposed to
becoming a stand-alone utility upon its exit from the ESA, as well as [Entergy
Arkansas'] RTO participation by the end of calendar year 2010.  In
parallel with this Docket, the [APSC] will be actively involved and will be
closely watching to see if any meaningful enhancement will be made to a new
Enhanced Independent Coordinator of Transmission (“E-ICT") Agreement through the
efforts of the ETS [Entergy Transmission System] stakeholders, Entergy, and the
newly formed and federally-recognized E-RSC in 2010."  The schedule
set by the order includes evidentiary hearings in March and May
2010.  The order directed that the existing docket investigating
Entergy Arkansas' participation in the System Agreement be
closed.  For a discussion of Entergy's Independent Coordinator of
Transmission and the E-RSC see "Independent Coordinator of Transmission"
below.

LPSC and
City Council Action Related to the Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi
Notices of Termination

In light of the notices of Entergy
Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi to terminate participation in the current
System Agreement, in January 2008 the LPSC unanimously voted to direct the LPSC
Staff to begin evaluating the potential for a new
agreement.  Likewise, the New Orleans City Council opened a docket to
gather information on progress towards a successor agreement.

June 2009
LPSC Complaint Proceeding

In June 2009, the LPSC filed a
complaint requesting that the FERC determine that certain of Entergy Arkansas'
sales of electric energy to third parties: (a) violated the provisions of the
System Agreement that allocate the energy generated by Entergy System resources,
(b) imprudently denied the Entergy System and its ultimate consumers the
benefits of low-cost Entergy System generating capacity, and (c) violated the
provision of the System Agreement that prohibits sales to third parties by
individual companies absent an offer of a right-of-first-refusal to other
Utility operating companies.   The LPSC's complaint challenges
sales made beginning in 2002 and requests refunds.  On July 20, 2009,
the Utility operating companies filed a response to the complaint requesting
that the FERC dismiss the complaint on the merits without hearing because the
LPSC has failed to meet its burden of showing any violation of the System
Agreement and failed to produce any evidence of imprudent action by the Entergy
System.  In their response, the Utility operating
companies


Entergy
Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

explained
that the System Agreement clearly contemplates that the Utility operating
companies may make sales to third parties for their own account, subject to the
requirement that those sales be included in the load (or load shape) for the
applicable Utility operating company.  The response further explains
that the FERC already has determined that Entergy Arkansas' short-term wholesale
sales did not trigger the "right-of-first-refusal" provision of the System
Agreement.  While the D.C. Circuit recently determined that the
"right-of-first-refusal" issue was not properly before the FERC at the time of
its earlier decision on the issue, the LPSC has raised no additional claims or
facts that would warrant the FERC reaching a different conclusion.  On
December 7, 2009, the FERC issued an order setting the matter for hearing and
settlement procedures.  Settlement procedures were unsuccessful and a
hearing in the matter is scheduled to begin in August 2010.

Independent Coordinator of
Transmission

In 2000,
the FERC issued an order encouraging utilities to voluntarily place their
transmission facilities under the control of independent RTOs (regional
transmission organizations).  Delays in implementing the FERC RTO
order occurred due to a variety of reasons, including the fact that utility
companies, other stakeholders, and federal and state regulators have had to work
to resolve various issues related to the establishment of such
RTOs.

In
November 2006, after nearly a decade of effort, including filings, orders,
technical conferences, and proceedings at the FERC, the Utility operating
companies installed the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) as their Independent
Coordinator of Transmission (ICT).  The installation does not transfer
control of Entergy's transmission system to the ICT, but rather vests with the
ICT responsibility for:

·

granting
      or denying transmission service on the Utility operating companies'
      transmission system.

·

administering
      the Utility operating companies' OASIS node for purposes of processing and
      evaluating transmission service requests and ensuring compliance with the
      Utility operating companies' obligation to post transmission-related
      information.

·

developing
      a base plan for the Utility operating companies' transmission system that
      will result in the ICT making the determination on whether costs of
      transmission upgrades should be rolled into the Utility operating
      companies' transmission rates or directly assigned to the customer
      requesting or causing an upgrade to be constructed.  This should
      result in a transmission pricing structure that ensures that the Utility
      operating companies' retail native load customers are required to pay for
      only those upgrades necessary to reliably serve their
    needs.

·

serving
      as the reliability coordinator for the Entergy transmission
      system.

·

overseeing
      the operation of the weekly procurement process
  (WPP).

·

evaluating
      interconnection-related investments already made on the Entergy System for
      purposes of determining the future allocation of the uncredited portion of
      these investments, pursuant to a detailed methodology.  The ICT
      agreement also clarifies the rights that customers receive when they fund
      a supplemental upgrade.

The
initial term of the ICT is four years, and Entergy is precluded from terminating
the ICT prior to the end of the four-year period.

After the FERC issued its April 2006
order approving the ICT proposal, the Utility operating companies made a series
of compliance filings with the FERC that were protested by various
parties.  The FERC accepted the compliance filings and denied various
requests for rehearing.  As stated above, SPP was installed as the ICT
in November 2006.


Entergy
Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

In October 2006 the Utility operating
companies filed revisions to their Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) with
the FERC to establish a mechanism to recover from their wholesale transmission
customers the (1) costs incurred to develop or join an RTO and to develop the
ICT; and (2) on-going costs that will be incurred under the ICT
agreement.  Several parties intervened opposing the proposed tariff
revisions.  In December 2006 the FERC accepted for filing Entergy's
proposed tariff revisions, and set them for hearing and settlement
procedures.  In its Order, the FERC concluded that each of the Utility
operating companies "should be allowed the opportunity to recover its start up
costs associated with its formation of the ICT and its participation in prior
failed attempts to form an RTO," and also that the proposed tariffs raised
issues of fact that are more properly addressed through hearing and settlement
procedures.  In June 2007 the Utility operating companies reached a
settlement-in-principle with the parties to the proceeding and the FERC approved
the settlement in November 2007.

In the FERC's April 2006 order that
approved Entergy's ICT proposal, the FERC stated that the WPP must be
operational within approximately 14 months of the FERC order, or June 24, 2007,
or the FERC may reevaluate all approvals to proceed with the ICT.  The
Utility operating companies filed status reports with the FERC notifying the
FERC that, due to unexpected issues with the development of the WPP software and
testing, the WPP was still not operational.  The Utility operating
companies also filed various tariff revisions with the FERC in 2007 and 2008 to
address issues identified during the testing of the WPP and changes to the
effective date of the WPP.  On October 10, 2008, the FERC issued an
order accepting a tariff amendment establishing that the WPP shall take effect
at a date to be determined, after completion of successful simulation trials and
the ICT's endorsement of the WPP's implementation.  On January 16,
2009, the Utility operating companies filed a compliance filing with the FERC
that included the ICT's endorsement of the WPP implementation, subject to the
FERC's acceptance of certain additional tariff amendments and the completion of
simulation testing and certain other items.  The Utility operating
companies filed the tariff amendments supported by the ICT on the same
day.  The amendments proposed to further amend the WPP to (a) limit
supplier offers in the WPP to on-peak periods and (b) eliminate the granting of
certain transmission service through the WPP.

On March 17, 2009, the FERC issued an
order conditionally approving the proposed modification to the WPP to allow the
process to be implemented the week of March 23, 2009.  In its order
approving the requested modifications, the FERC imposed additional conditions
related to the ICT arrangement and indicated it was going to evaluate the
success of the ICT arrangement, including the cost and benefits of implementing
the WPP and whether the WPP goes far enough to address the transmission access
issues that the ICT and WPP were intended to address.  The FERC, in
conjunction with the APSC, the LPSC, the MPSC, the PUCT, and the City Council,
hosted a conference on June 24, 2009, to discuss the ICT arrangement and
transmission access on the Entergy transmission system.  In compliance
with the FERC's March 2009 order, in November 2009 the Utility operating
companies filed with the FERC a process for evaluating the modification or
replacement of the current ICT and WPP arrangements.

During the conference, several issues
were raised by regulators and market participants, including the adequacy of the
Utility operating companies' capital investment in the transmission system, the
Utility operating companies' compliance with the existing North American
Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) reliability planning standards, the
availability of transmission service across the system, and whether the Utility
operating companies could have purchased lower cost power from merchant
generators located on the transmission system rather than running their older
generating facilities.  On July 20, 2009, the Utility operating
companies filed comments with the FERC responding to the issues raised during
the conference.  The comments explain that: 1) the Utility operating
companies believe that the ICT arrangement has fulfilled its objectives; 2) the
Utility operating companies' transmission planning practices comply with laws
and regulations regarding the planning and operation of the transmission system;
and 3) these planning practices have resulted in a system that meets applicable
reliability standards and is sufficiently robust to allow the Utility operating
companies both to substantially increase the amount of transmission service
available to third parties and to make significant amounts of economic purchases
from the wholesale market for the benefit of the Utility operating companies'
retail customers.   The Utility operating companies also explain
that, as with other transmission systems, there are certain times during which
congestion occurs on the Utility operating companies’ transmission system
that


Entergy
Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

limits
the ability of the Utility operating companies as well as other parties to fully
utilize the generating resources that have been granted transmission service.
 Additionally, the Utility operating companies commit in their response to
exploring and working on potential reforms or alternatives for the ICT
arrangement that could take effect following the initial term.  The
Utility operating companies' comments also recognize that NERC is in the process
of amending certain of its transmission reliability planning standards and that
the amended standards, if approved by the FERC, will result in more stringent
transmission planning criteria being applicable in the future.  The
FERC may also make other changes to transmission reliability
standards.  These changes to the reliability standards would result in
increased capital expenditures by the Utility operating companies.

The Entergy Regional State Committee
(E-RSC), which is comprised of representatives from all of the Utility operating
companies' retail regulators, has been formed to consider several of these
issues related to Entergy's transmission system.  Among other things,
the E-RSC in concert with the FERC plan to conduct a cost/benefits analysis
comparing the ICT arrangement and a proposal under which Entergy would join the
SPP RTO.

FERC
Audits

The Division of Audits in the Office of
Enforcement and the Division of Compliance in the Office of Reliability of the
FERC jointly commenced an audit of Entergy Services, Inc. on October 1,
2009.  The audit will evaluate Entergy Services':  (1)
practices related to Bulk Electric System planning and operations; (2)
compliance with the requirements contained within its Open Access Transmission
Tariff; and (3) other obligations and responsibilities as approved by the
FERC.  The audit will cover the period from April 1, 2006 to the
present.  The Energy Policy Act of 2005 provides the FERC with
authority to impose civil penalties for violations of the Federal Power Act and
FERC regulations.

SERC Reliability Corporation
Reliability Standards

Entergy has notified the SERC Reliability Corporation (SERC) of potential
violations of certain FERC reliability standards, including certain Critical
Infrastructure Protection standards.  Entergy is working with the SERC to
provide information concerning these potential violations.  The Energy
Policy Act of 2005 provides authority to impose civil penalties for violations
of the Federal Power Act and FERC regulations.

Market and Credit Risk
Sensitive Instruments

Market risk is the risk of changes in
the value of commodity and financial instruments, or in future operating results
or cash flows, in response to changing market conditions.  Entergy
holds commodity and financial instruments that are exposed to the following
significant market risks:

·

The
      commodity price risk associated with the sale of electricity by Entergy's
      Non-Utility Nuclear business and with the purchase of gas by the
      Utility.

·

The
      interest rate and equity price risk associated with Entergy's investments
      in pension and other postretirement benefit trust funds.  See
      Note 11 to the financial statements for details regarding Entergy's
      pension and other postretirement benefit trust
  funds.

·

The
      interest rate and equity price risk associated with Entergy's investments
      in decommissioning trust funds, particularly in the Non-Utility Nuclear
      business.  See Note 17 to the financial statements for details
      regarding Entergy's decommissioning trust
funds.

·

The
      interest rate risk associated with changes in interest rates as a result
      of Entergy's issuances of debt.  Entergy manages its interest
      rate exposure by monitoring current interest rates and its debt
      outstanding in relation to total capitalization.  See Notes 4
      and 5 to the financial statements for the details of Entergy's debt
      outstanding.

Entergy's
commodity and financial instruments are also exposed to credit
risk.  Credit risk is the risk of loss from nonperformance by
suppliers, customers, or financial counterparties to a contract or
agreement.  Credit risk also includes potential demand on liquidity
due to credit support requirements within supply or sales
agreements.

Power
Generation

As a wholesale generator, Entergy's
Non-Utility Nuclear business's core business is selling energy, measured in MWh,
to its customers.  Non-Utility Nuclear enters into forward contracts
with its customers and sells energy in the day ahead or spot
markets.  In addition to selling the energy produced by its plants,
Non-Utility Nuclear sells unforced capacity to load-serving entities, which
allows those companies to meet specified reserve and related requirements placed
on them by the ISOs in their respective areas. Non-Utility Nuclear's forward
fixed price power contracts consist of contracts to sell energy only, contracts
to sell capacity only, and bundled contracts in which it sells both capacity and
energy.  While the terminology and payment mechanics vary in these
contracts, each of these types of contracts requires Non-Utility Nuclear to
deliver MWh of energy to its counterparties, make capacity available to them, or
both.  The following is a summary as of December 31, 2009 of the
amount of Non-Utility Nuclear's nuclear power plants' planned energy output that

A

      availability provides for the payment to the power purchaser of contract
      damages, if incurred, in the event the seller fails to deliver power as a
      result of the failure of the specified generation unit to generate power
      at or above a specified availability threshold.  All of
      Entergy's outstanding guarantees of availability provide for dollar limits
      on Entergy's maximum liability under such guarantees.

The
      Vermont Yankee acquisition included a 10-year PPA under which the former
      owners will buy most of the power produced by the plant, which is through
      the expiration in 2012 of the current operating license for the
      plant.  The PPA includes an adjustment clause under which the
      prices specified in the PPA will be adjusted downward monthly, beginning
      in November 2005, if power market prices drop below PPA prices, which has
      not happened thus far.

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear business'
purchase of the FitzPatrick and Indian Point 3 plants from NYPA included value
sharing agreements with NYPA.  In October 2007, NYPA and the
subsidiaries that own the FitzPatrick and Indian Point 3 plants amended and
restated the value sharing agreements to clarify and amend certain provisions of
the original terms.  Under the amended value sharing agreements,
Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear business agreed to make annual payments to NYPA
based on the generation output of the Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick plants from
January 2007 through December 2014.  Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear
business will pay NYPA $6.59 per MWh for power sold from Indian Point 3, up to
an annual cap of $48 million, and $3.91 per MWh for power sold from FitzPatrick,
up to an annual cap of $24 million.  The annual payment for each
year's output is due by January 15 of the following year.  In August
2008, Non-Utility Nuclear entered into a resolution of a dispute with NYPA over
the applicability of the value sharing agreements to its FitzPatrick and Indian
Point 3 nuclear power plants after the planned spin-off of the Non-Utility
Nuclear business.  Under the resolution, Non-Utility Nuclear agreed
not to treat the separation as a "Cessation Event" that would terminate its
obligation to make the payments under the value sharing
agreements.  As a result, after the spin-off transaction, Non-Utility
Nuclear will continue to be obligated to make payments to NYPA under the amended
and restated value sharing agreements.

Non-Utility Nuclear will record its liability for payments to NYPA as power is
generated and sold by Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick.  In 2009, 2008,
and 2007, Non-Utility Nuclear recorded a $72 million liability for generation
during each of those years.  An amount equal to the liability was
recorded each year to the plant asset account as contingent purchase price
consideration for the plants.  This amount will be depreciated over
the expected remaining useful life of the plants.

Some of the agreements to sell the
power produced by Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear power plants contain provisions
that require an Entergy subsidiary to provide collateral to secure its
obligations under the agreements.  The Entergy subsidiary is required
to provide collateral based upon the difference between the current market and
contracted power prices in the regions where Non-Utility Nuclear sells
power.  The primary form of collateral to satisfy these requirements
is an Entergy Corporation guaranty.  Cash and letters of credit are also
acceptable forms of collateral.  At December 31, 2009, based on power
prices at that time, Entergy had $369 million of collateral in place to
support Entergy Nuclear Power Marketing transactional activity, consisting
primarily of Entergy Corporation guarantees, but also including $20 million of
guarantees that support letters of credit and $2 million of cash collateral. As
of December 31, 2009, the credit exposure associated with Non-Utility Nuclear
assurance requirements could increase by an estimated amount of up to $308
million for each $1 per MMBtu increase in gas prices in both the short- and
long-term markets, but because market prices have fallen below most contract
prices, the credit exposure would increase by only $8 million.  In the
event of a decrease in Entergy Corporation's credit rating to below investment
grade, based on power prices as of December 31, 2009, Entergy would have been
required to provide approximately $73 million of additional cash or letters of
credit under some of the agreements.

As of December 31, 2009, for the
planned energy output under contract for Non-Utility Nuclear through 2014, 99.7%
of the planned energy output is under contract with counterparties with public
investment grade credit ratings and 0.3% is with load-serving entities without
public credit ratings.

Critical Accounting
Estimates

The
preparation of Entergy's financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate
accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a
significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and
cash flows.  Management has identified the following accounting
policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and
measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for
future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates
that would have a material effect on the presentation of Entergy's financial
position or results of operations.

Nuclear
Decommissioning Costs

Entergy
owns nuclear generation facilities in both its Utility and Non-Utility Nuclear
business units.  Regulations require Entergy to decommission its
nuclear power plants after each facility is taken out of service, and money is
collected and deposited in trust funds during the facilities' operating lives in
order to provide for this obligation.  Entergy conducts periodic
decommissioning cost studies to estimate the costs that will be incurred to
decommission the facilities.  The following key assumptions have a
significant effect on these estimates:

·

Cost Escalation
      Factors

- Entergy's current decommissioning cost studies include an
      assumption that decommissioning costs will escalate over present cost
      levels by annual factors ranging from approximately 3% to
      3.5%.  A 50 basis point change in this assumption could change
      the ultimate cost of decommissioning a facility by as much as an
      approximate average of 20% to 25%.  To the extent that a high
      probability of license renewal is assumed, a change in the estimated
      inflation or cost escalation rate has a larger effect on the undiscounted
      cash flows because the rate of inflation is factored into the calculation
      for a longer period of time.

·

Timing

- In
      projecting decommissioning costs, two assumptions must be made to estimate
      the timing of plant decommissioning.  First, the date of the
      plant's retirement must be estimated.  A high probability that
      the plant's license will be renewed and operate for some time beyond the
      original license term has currently been assumed for purposes of
      calculating the decommissioning liability for a number of Entergy's
      nuclear units.   Second, an assumption must be made whether
      decommissioning will begin immediately upon plant retirement, or whether
      the plant will be held in "safestore" status for later decommissioning, as
      permitted by applicable regulations.  While the effect of these
      assumptions cannot be determined with precision, a change of assumption of
      either renewal or use of a "safestore" status can possibly change the
      present value of these obligations.  Future revisions to
      appropriately reflect changes needed to the estimate of decommissioning
      costs will affect net income, only to the extent that the estimate of any
      reduction in the liability exceeds the amount of the undepreciated asset
      retirement cost at the date of the revision, for unregulated portions of
      Entergy's business.  Any increases in the liability recorded due
      to such changes are capitalized and depreciated over the asset's remaining
      economic life.

Spent Fuel
      Disposal

- Federal law requires the DOE to provide for the
      permanent storage of spent nuclear fuel, and legislation has been passed
      by Congress to develop this repository at Yucca Mountain,
      Nevada.  However the DOE has not yet begun accepting spent
      nuclear fuel and is in non-compliance with federal law.  The DOE
      continues to delay meeting its obligation and Entergy is continuing to
      pursue damages claims against the DOE for its failure to provide timely
      spent fuel storage.  Until a federal site is available, however,
      nuclear plant operators must provide for interim spent fuel storage on the
      nuclear plant site, which can require the construction and maintenance of
      dry cask storage sites or other facilities.  The costs of
      developing and maintaining these facilities can have a significant effect
      (as much as an average of 20% to 30% of estimated decommissioning
      costs).  Entergy's decommissioning studies may include cost
      estimates for spent fuel storage.  However, these estimates
      could change in the future based on the timing of the opening of an
      appropriate facility designated by the federal government to receive spent
      nuclear fuel.

·

Technology and
      Regulation

– Over the past several years, more practical experience
      with the actual decommissioning of facilities has been gained and that
      experience has been incorporated in to Entergy's current decommissioning
      cost estimates.  However, given the long duration of
      decommissioning projects, additional experience, including technological
      advancements in decommissioning, could occur and affect current cost
      estimates.  If regulations regarding nuclear decommissioning
      were to change, this could have a potentially significant effect on cost
      estimates.  The effect of these potential changes is not
      presently determinable.

·

Interest Rates
      -

The estimated decommissioning costs that form the basis for the
      decommissioning liability recorded on the balance sheet are
      discounted to present values using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate.
      When the decommissioning cost estimate is significantly changed requiring
      a revision to the decommissioning liability and the change results in an
      increase in cash flows, that increase is discounted using a current
      credit-adjusted risk-free rate.  Under accounting rules, if the
      revision in estimate results in a decrease in estimated cash flows, that
      decrease is discounted using the previous credit-adjusted risk-free
      rate.  Therefore, to the extent that one of the factors noted
      above changes resulting in a significant increase in estimated cash flows,
      current interest rates will affect the calculation of the present value of
      the additional decommissioning
liability.

In the first quarter 2009, Entergy
Arkansas recorded a revision to its estimated decommissioning cost liabilities
for ANO 1 and 2 as a result of a revised decommissioning cost
study.  The revised estimates resulted in an $8.9 million reduction in
its decommissioning liability, along with a corresponding reduction in the
related regulatory asset.

In the second quarter 2009, System
Energy recorded a revision to its estimated decommissioning cost liability for
Grand Gulf as a result of a revised decommissioning cost study.  The
revised estimate resulted in a $4.2 million reduction in its decommissioning
liability, along with a corresponding reduction in the related regulatory
asset.

In
the fourth quarter 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana recorded a revision to
its estimated decommissioning cost liability for River Bend as a result of a
revised decommissioning cost study.  The revised estimate resulted in
a $78.7 million increase in its decommissioning liability, along with a
corresponding increase in the related asset retirement obligation asset that
will be depreciated over the remaining life of the unit.

In the third quarter 2008, Entergy's
Non-Utility Nuclear business recorded an increase of $13.7 million in
decommissioning liabilities for certain of its plants as a result of revised
decommissioning cost studies.  The revised estimates resulted in the
recognition of a $13.7 million asset retirement obligation asset that will be
depreciated over the remaining life of the units.

Unbilled
Revenue

As
discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Entergy records an estimate of
the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer
billing.  Each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are
recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month's estimate is
reversed.  The difference between the estimate of the unbilled
receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the
amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period.  The estimate
recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the
unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that
month.  Therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated
price and usage at the beginning and end of each period, in addition to changes
in certain components of the calculation.

Impairment
of Long-lived Assets and Trust Fund Investments

Entergy
has significant investments in long-lived assets in all of its segments, and
Entergy evaluates these assets against the market economics and under the
accounting rules for impairment whenever there are indications that impairments
may exist.  This evaluation involves a significant degree of
estimation and uncertainty.  In the Utility business, portions of
River Bend are not included in rate base, which could reduce the revenue that
would otherwise be recovered for the applicable portions of its
generation.  In the Non-Utility Nuclear business, Entergy's
investments in merchant generation assets are subject to impairment if adverse
market conditions arise, if a unit ceases operation, or for certain units if
their operating licenses are not renewed.  In the non-nuclear
wholesale assets business, Entergy's investments in merchant generation assets
are subject to impairment if adverse market conditions arise.

In order
to determine if Entergy should recognize an impairment of a long-lived asset
that is to be held and used, accounting standards require that the sum of the
expected undiscounted future cash flows from the asset be compared to the
asset's carrying value.  The carrying value of the asset includes any
capitalized asset retirement cost associated with the recording of an additional
decommissioning liability, therefore changes in assumptions that affect the
decommissioning liability can increase or decrease the carrying value of the
asset subject to impairment.  If the expected undiscounted future cash
flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is recorded; if such cash flows
are less than the carrying value, Entergy is required to record an impairment
charge to write the asset down to its fair value.  If an asset is held
for sale, an impairment is required to be recognized if the fair value (less
costs to sell) of the asset is less than its carrying value.

These
estimates are based on a number of key assumptions, including:

·

Future power and fuel
      prices

- Electricity and gas prices have been very volatile in
      recent years, and this volatility is expected to continue.  This
      volatility necessarily increases the imprecision inherent in the long-term
      forecasts of commodity prices that are a key determinant of estimated
      future cash flows.

·

Market value of
      generation assets

- Valuing assets held for sale requires
      estimating the current market value of generation assets.  While
      market transactions provide evidence for this valuation, the market for
      such assets is volatile and the value of individual assets is impacted by
      factors unique to those assets.

·

Future operating
      costs

- Entergy assumes relatively minor annual increases in
      operating costs.  Technological or regulatory changes that have
      a significant impact on operations could cause a significant change in
      these assumptions.

·

Timing

-

Entergy
      currently assumes, for a number of its nuclear units, that the plant's
      license will be renewed.  A change in that assumption could have a
      significant effect on the expected future cash flows and result in a
      significant effect on operations.

Entergy's
Non-Utility Nuclear business currently has pending applications for license
renewals for the Vermont Yankee, Pilgrim, Indian Point 2, and Indian Point 3
power plants.  In addition, for Vermont Yankee the state certificates
of public good to operate the plant and store spent nuclear fuel also expire in
2012.  Non-Utility Nuclear filed an application with the Vermont
Public Service Board on March 3, 2008 for approval of continued operations and
storage of spent nuclear fuel generated after March 21, 2012.  Under
Vermont law the Vermont General Assembly approval of Non-Utility Nuclear's
request is required for the request to be granted.  On February 24,
2010, a bill to approve the continued operation of

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

Vermont
Yankee was advanced to a vote by the Vermont Senate leadership and defeated by a
margin of 26 to 4.  This vote does not preclude the Vermont Senate
from voting again on a similar bill in the future.  At the current
time, Entergy management believes that it will ultimately receive all necessary
approvals to operate Vermont Yankee beyond its current license expiration. 
If those approvals are ultimately not received, it could result in an impairment
of part or all of the carrying value of the plant, including any capitalized
asset retirement cost associated with the recording of the decommissioning
liability as further described in Note 9 to the financial
statements.

Effective
January 1, 2009, Entergy adopted an accounting pronouncement providing guidance
regarding recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairments
related to investments in debt securities.  The assessment of whether an
investment in a debt security has suffered an other-than-temporary impairment is
based on whether Entergy has the intent to sell or more likely than not will be
required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized costs. 
Further, if Entergy does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis
of the debt security, an other-than-temporary-impairment is considered to have
occurred and it is measured by the present value of cash flows expected to be
collected less the amortized cost basis (credit loss).  For debt securities
held as of January 1, 2009 for which an other-than-temporary impairment had
previously been recognized but for which assessment under the new guidance
indicates this impairment is temporary, Entergy recorded an adjustment to its
opening balance of retained earnings of $11.3 million ($6.4 million
net-of-tax).  Entergy did not have any material other than temporary
impairments relating to credit losses on debt securities in 2009.  The
assessment of whether an investment in an equity security has suffered an other
than temporary impairment continues to be based on a number of factors
including, first, whether Entergy has the ability and intent to hold the
investment to recover its value, the duration and severity of any losses, and,
then, whether it is expected that the investment will recover its value within a
reasonable period of time.  Entergy's trusts are managed by third
parties who operate in accordance with agreements that define investment
guidelines and place restrictions on the purchases and sales of investments. As
disclosed in Note 1 to the financial statements, unrealized losses that are not
considered temporarily impaired are recorded in earnings for Non-Utility
Nuclear.  Non-Utility Nuclear recorded charges to other income of
$86 million in 2009, $50 million in 2008, and $5 million in 2007
resulting from the recognition of impairments of certain securities held in its
decommissioning trust funds that are not considered
temporary.  Additional impairments could be recorded in 2010 to the
extent that then current  market conditions change the evaluation of
recoverability of unrealized losses.

Qualified
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Entergy
sponsors qualified, defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all
employees.  Additionally, Entergy currently provides postretirement
health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees who
reach retirement age while still working for Entergy.  Entergy's
reported costs of providing these benefits, as described in Note 11 to the
financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions
of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial
calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms.  Because of the
complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and
the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy's estimate of these costs is
a critical accounting estimate for the Utility and Non-Utility Nuclear
segments.

Assumptions

Key
actuarial assumptions utilized in determining these costs include:

·

Discount
      rates used in determining the future benefit
  obligations;

·

Projected
      health care cost trend rates;

·

Expected
      long-term rate of return on plan assets;
and

·

Rate
      of increase in future compensation
levels.

Entergy
reviews these assumptions on an annual basis and adjusts them as
necessary.  The falling interest rate environment and
worse-than-expected performance of the financial equity markets in recent years
have impacted Entergy's funding and reported costs for these
benefits.  In addition, these trends have caused Entergy to make a
number of adjustments to its assumptions.


Entergy
Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

In
selecting an assumed discount rate to calculate benefit obligations, Entergy
reviews market yields on high-quality corporate debt and matches these rates
with Entergy's projected stream of benefit payments.  Based on recent
market trends, Entergy decreased the discount rate used to calculate its
qualified pension benefit obligation from an average rate of 6.75% in 2008 to
specific rates by plan ranging from 6.10% to 6.30% in 2009.  The
discount rate used to calculate its other postretirement benefit obligation was
also decreased from 6.7% in 2008 to 6.10% in 2009.  Entergy's assumed
discount rate used to calculate the 2007 pension and other postretirement
benefit obligations was 6.50%.

Entergy
reviews actual recent cost trends and projected future trends in establishing
health care cost trend rates.  Based on this review, Entergy's health
care cost trend rate assumption used in calculating the December 31, 2009
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was a 7.5% increase in health care
costs in 2010 gradually decreasing each successive year, until it reaches a
4.75% annual increase in health care costs in 2016 and beyond.

In
determining its expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, Entergy
reviews past long-term performance, asset allocations, and long-term inflation
assumptions.  Entergy targets an asset allocation for its qualified
pension plan assets of roughly 65% equity securities and 35% fixed-income
securities.  The target allocations for Entergy's non-taxable
postretirement benefit assets are 55% equity securities and 45% fixed-income
securities and, for its taxable other postretirement benefit assets, 35% equity
securities and 65% fixed-income securities.  Entergy's expected
long-term rate of return on qualified pension assets and non-taxable other
postretirement assets used to calculate 2009, 2008, and 2007 qualified pension
and other postretirement benefits costs was 8.5%.   Entergy's
expected long-term rate of return on taxable other postretirement assets was 6%
in 2009 and 5.5% in 2008 and 2007.

The
assumed rate of increase in future compensation levels used to calculate benefit
obligations was 4.23% in 2009, 2008, and 2007.

Accounting
Mechanisms

Effective December 31, 2006, accounting
standards required an employer to recognize in its balance sheet the funded
status of its benefit plans.  Refer to Note 11 to the financial
statements for a further discussion of Entergy's funded status.

In
accordance with pension accounting standards, Entergy utilizes a number of
accounting mechanisms that reduce the volatility of reported pension
costs.  Differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan
results are deferred and are amortized into expense only when the accumulated
differences exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the
market-related value of plan assets.  If necessary, the excess is
amortized over the average remaining service period of active
employees.

Entergy
calculates the expected return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan
assets by multiplying the long-term expected rate of return on assets by the
market-related value (MRV) of plan assets.  Entergy determines the MRV of
pension plan assets by calculating a value that uses a 20-quarter phase-in of
the difference between actual and expected returns.  For other
postretirement benefit plan assets Entergy uses fair value when determining
MRV.

Costs and
Funding

In 2009, Entergy's total qualified
pension cost was $86 million.  Entergy anticipates 2010 qualified
pension cost to be $147.1 million.  Pension funding was $132 million
for 2009.  Entergy's contributions to the pension trust are currently
estimated to be approximately $270 million in 2010, although the required
pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1,
2010 valuations are completed by April 1, 2010.

Minimum required funding calculations
as determined under Pension Protection Act guidance are performed annually as of
January 1 of each year and are based on measurements of the  assets
and funding liabilities as measured at that date.  Any excess of the
funding liability over the calculated fair market value of assets results in a
funding shortfall which, under the Pension Protection Act, must be funded
over a seven-year rolling period.  The Pension Protection Act also imposes
certain plan limitations if the funded percentage, which is based on a
calculated fair market values of assets divided by funding liabilities, does not
meet certain thresholds. For funding purposes, asset gains and losses are
smoothed in to the calculated fair market value of assets and the funding
liability is based upon a weighted average 24-month corporate bond rate
published by the U.S. Treasury; therefore, periodic changes in asset returns and
interest rates can affect funding shortfalls and future cash
contributions.

Entergy's minimum required
contributions for the 2010 plan year are generally payable in installments
throughout 2010 and 2011 and will be based on the funding calculations as of
January 1, 2010.  The final date at which 2010 plan year contributions
may be made is September 15, 2011. Given the decline in the capital markets in
2008, the minimum required contributions for the 2010 plan year, payable in 2010
and 2011, will increase although recoveries in the capital market in 2009 will
help to mitigate the expected increase.  The actual increase or timing
of that increase cannot be determined with certainty until the January 1,
2010 valuation is completed by April 1, 2010; however Entergy’s preliminary
estimates of 2010 funding requirements indicate that the contributions will not
increase materially over and above historical levels of pension contributions.
In addition to the minimum required contribution required under the Pension
Protection Act to fund a shortfall based on the seven year rolling amortization,
additional contributions could be needed in 2010 to avoid the plan limitations
noted above.

Total
postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for Entergy in 2009
were $105.2 million, including $24 million in savings due to the estimated
effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy expects 2010 postretirement
health care and life insurance benefit costs to be $111 million.  This
includes a projected $26.6 million in savings due to the estimated effect of
future Medicare Part D subsidies.  Entergy contributed $79 million to
its postretirement plans in 2009.  Entergy’s current estimate of
contributions to its other postretirement plans is approximately $76.4 million
in 2010.


Entergy
Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

Other
Contingencies

As a
company with multi-state domestic utility operations and a history of
international investments, Entergy is subject to a number of federal, state, and
international laws and regulations and other factors and conditions in the areas
in which it operates, which potentially subject it to environmental, litigation,
and other risks.  Entergy periodically evaluates its exposure for such
risks and records a reserve for those matters which are considered probable and
estimable in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.

Environmental

Entergy
must comply with environmental laws and regulations applicable to the handling
and disposal of hazardous waste.  Under these various laws and
regulations, Entergy could incur substantial costs to restore properties
consistent with the various standards.  Entergy conducts studies to
determine the extent of any required remediation and has recorded reserves based
upon its evaluation of the likelihood of loss and expected dollar amount for
each issue.  Additional sites could be identified which require
environmental remediation for which Entergy could be liable.  The
amounts of environmental reserves recorded can be significantly affected by the
following external events or conditions:

·

Changes
      to existing state or federal regulation by governmental authorities having
      jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances
      and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental
      matters.

·

The
      identification of additional sites or the filing of other complaints in
      which Entergy may be asserted to be a potentially responsible
      party.

·

The
      resolution or progression of existing matters through the court system or
      resolution by the EPA.

Litigation

Entergy
has been named as defendant in a number of lawsuits involving employment,
ratepayer, and injuries and damages issues, among other
matters.  Entergy periodically reviews the cases in which it has been
named as defendant and assesses the likelihood of loss in each case as probable,
reasonably estimable, or remote and records reserves for cases which have a
probable likelihood of loss and can be estimated.  Notes 2 and 8 to
the financial statements include more detail on ratepayer and other lawsuits and
management's assessment of the adequacy of reserves recorded for these
matters.  Given the environment in which Entergy operates, and the
unpredictable nature of many of the cases in which Entergy is named as a
defendant, however, the ultimate outcome of the litigation Entergy is exposed to
has the potential to materially affect the results of operations of Entergy, or
its operating company subsidiaries.

Uncertain Tax
Positions

Entergy's operations, including
acquisitions and divestitures, require Entergy to evaluate risks such as the
potential tax effects of a transaction, or warranties made in connection with
such a transaction.  Entergy believes that it has adequately assessed
and provided for these types of risks, where applicable.  Any reserves
recorded for these types of issues, however, could be significantly affected by
events such as claims made by third parties under warranties, additional
transactions contemplated by Entergy, or completion of reviews of the tax
treatment of certain transactions or issues by taxing
authorities.  Entergy does not expect a material adverse effect on
earnings from these matters.

Corporation and Subsidiaries

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

New Accounting
Pronouncements

In June 2009 the FASB issued SFAS 167,
"Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46R".  SFAS 167 replaces the
current quantitative-based risks and rewards calculation for determining which
enterprise, if any, has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest
entity with an approach focused on identifying which enterprise has the power to
direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly
affect the entity's economic performance and (1) the obligation to absorb losses
of the entity or (2) the right to receive benefits from the
entity.  SFAS 167 also requires additional disclosures on an interim
and annual basis about an enterprise's involvement in variable interest
entities.  The standard will be effective for Entergy in the first
quarter 2010.  Upon adoption, Entergy expects its subsidiaries that finance
their nuclear fuel purchases through nuclear fuel leases to consolidate the
special purpose nuclear fuel companies acting as lessors.  The adoption of
this statement will result in the reclassification of amounts between certain
line items in the financial statements.



REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the
Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Entergy
Corporation and Subsidiaries

New
Orleans, Louisiana

We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Entergy Corporation and
Subsidiaries (the “Corporation”) as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the
related consolidated statements of income, retained earnings, comprehensive
income, and paid-in capital, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2009. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Corporation’s management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our
opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2009, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.

As
discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation
adopted a new accounting standard for non-controlling interests for all periods
presented.

We have
also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the Corporation’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the criteria
established in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 24,
2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Corporation’s internal control over
financial reporting.

ENTERGY
CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES
TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE
1.                      SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas,
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy
New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy)

The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of Entergy Corporation and its
subsidiaries.  As required by generally accepted accounting
principles, all significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in
the consolidated financial statements.  Entergy's Registrant
Subsidiaries (Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy
Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System
Energy) also include their separate financial statements in this Form
10-K.  The Registrant Subsidiaries and many other Entergy subsidiaries
maintain accounts in accordance with FERC and other regulatory
guidelines.  Certain previously reported amounts have been
reclassified to conform to current classifications, with no effect on net income
or shareholders' (or members') equity.

Use of Estimates in the
Preparation of Financial Statements

In conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles, the preparation of Entergy Corporation's consolidated
financial statements and the separate financial statements of the Registrant
Subsidiaries requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  Adjustments to the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities may be necessary in the future to the
extent that future estimates or actual results are different from the estimates
used.

Revenues and Fuel
Costs

Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy Texas generate,
transmit, and distribute electric power primarily to retail customers in
Arkansas, Louisiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas,
respectively.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana also distributes natural
gas to retail customers in and around Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  Entergy
New Orleans sells both electric power and natural gas to retail customers in the
City of New Orleans, except for Algiers, where Entergy Louisiana is the electric
power supplier.  Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear segment derives almost
all of its revenue from sales of electric power generated by plants owned by the
Non-Utility Nuclear segment.

Entergy recognizes revenue from
electric power and natural gas sales when power or gas is delivered to
customers.  To the extent that deliveries have occurred but a bill has
not been issued, Entergy's Utility operating companies accrue an estimate of the
revenues for energy delivered since the latest billings.  The Utility
operating companies calculate the estimate based upon several factors including
billings through the last billing cycle in a month, actual generation in the
month, historical line loss factors, and prices in effect in Entergy's Utility
operating companies' various jurisdictions.  Changes are made to the
inputs in the estimate as needed to reflect changes in billing
practices.  Each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are
recorded as revenue and unbilled accounts receivable, and the prior month's
estimate is reversed.  Therefore, changes in price and volume
differences resulting from factors such as weather affect the calculation of
unbilled revenues from one period to the next, and may result in variability in
reported revenues from one period to the next as prior estimates are reversed
and new estimates recorded.

Entergy's Utility operating companies'
rate schedules include either fuel adjustment clauses or fixed fuel factors,
which allow either current recovery in billings to customers or deferral of fuel
costs until the costs are billed to customers.  Where the fuel
component of revenues is billed based on a pre-determined fuel cost (fixed fuel
factor), the fuel factor remains in effect until changed as part of a general
rate case, fuel reconciliation, or fixed fuel factor filing.


Entergy
Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to
Financial Statements

System Energy's operating revenues are
intended to recover from Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy
Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans operating expenses and capital costs
attributable to Grand Gulf.  The capital costs are computed by
allowing a return on System Energy's common equity funds allocable to its net
investment in Grand Gulf, plus System Energy's effective interest cost for its
debt allocable to its investment in Grand Gulf.

Property, Plant, and
Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is
stated at original cost.  Depreciation is computed on the
straight-line basis at rates based on the applicable estimated service lives of
the various classes of property.

For the Registrant
Subsidiaries, the original cost of plant retired or removed, less salvage, is
charged to accumulated depreciation.  Normal maintenance, repairs, and
minor replacement costs are charged to operating
expenses.  Substantially all of the Registrant Subsidiaries' plant is
subject to mortgage liens.

Electric plant includes the portions of
Grand Gulf and Waterford 3 that have been sold and leased back.  For
financial reporting purposes, these sale and leaseback arrangements are
reflected as financing transactions.

Net property, plant, and equipment for
Entergy (including property under capital lease and associated accumulated
amortization) by business segment and functional category, as of December 31,
2009 and 2008, is shown below:

Ouachita
      Units 1 and 2 are owned 100% by Entergy Arkansas and Ouachita Unit 3 is
      owned 100% by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana.  The investment and
      accumulated depreciation numbers above are only for the common
      facilities.

Nuclear Refueling Outage
Costs

Nuclear refueling outage costs are
deferred during the outage and amortized over the estimated period to the next
outage because these refueling outage expenses are incurred to prepare the units
to operate for the next operating cycle without having to be taken off
line.

Allowance for Funds Used
During Construction (AFUDC)

AFUDC represents the approximate net
composite interest cost of borrowed funds and a reasonable return on the equity
funds used for construction by the Registrant Subsidiaries.  AFUDC
increases both the plant balance and earnings and is realized in cash through
depreciation provisions included in rates.

Income
Taxes

Entergy Corporation and the majority of
its subsidiaries file a United States consolidated federal income tax
return.  Each tax paying entity records income taxes as if it were a
separate taxpayer and consolidating adjustments are allocated to the tax filing
entities in accordance with Entergy's intercompany income tax allocation
agreement.  Deferred income taxes are recorded for all temporary
differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and for
certain credits available for carryforward.  Entergy Louisiana, formed
December 31, 2005, was not a member of the consolidated group in 2006 and 2007
and filed a separate federal income tax return.  Beginning January 1,
2008, Entergy Louisiana joined the Entergy consolidated federal income tax
return.

Deferred tax assets are reduced by a
valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than
not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the
effects of changes in tax laws and rates in the period in which the tax or rate
was enacted.

Investment tax credits are deferred and
amortized based upon the average useful life of the related property, in
accordance with ratemaking treatment.

Earnings per
Share

The following table presents Entergy's
basic and diluted earnings per share calculation included on the consolidated
statements of income:

The calculation of diluted earnings per
share excluded 4,368,614 options outstanding at December 31, 2009 that could
potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future.  Those
options were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share
because the exercise price of those options exceeded the average market price
for the year.  As of December 31, 2008, the calculation of diluted
earnings per share excluded 3,326,835 options because the exercise price of
those options exceeded the average market price for the year.  All
options to purchase common stock shares in 2007 were included in the computation
of diluted earnings per share because the common share average market price at
the end of 2007 was greater than the exercise prices of all of the options
outstanding.

Entergy had 10,000,000 equity units
outstanding as of December 31, 2008, that obligated the holders to purchase a
certain number of shares of Entergy common stock for a stated price no later
than February 17, 2009.  In February 2009, Entergy Corporation was
unable to remarket successfully $500 million of notes associated with its equity
units.  The note holders therefore put the notes to Entergy, Entergy
retired the notes, and Entergy issued 6,598,000 shares of common stock to the
note holders.

Stock-based Compensation
Plans

Entergy grants stock options to key
employees of the Entergy subsidiaries, which is described more fully in Note 12
to the financial statements.  Effective January 1, 2003, Entergy
prospectively adopted the fair value based method of accounting for stock
options.  Awards under Entergy's plans generally vest over three
years.  Stock-based compensation expense included in consolidated net
income, net of related tax effects, for 2009 is $10.4 million, for 2008 is $10.7
million, and for 2007 is $8.9 million for Entergy's stock options
granted.

Accounting for the Effects
of Regulation

Entergy's Utility operating companies
and System Energy are rate-regulated enterprises whose rates meet three criteria
specified in accounting standards.  The Utility operating companies
and System Energy have rates that (i) are approved by a body empowered to set
rates that bind customers (its regulator); (ii) are cost-based; and (iii) can be
charged to and collected from customers.  These criteria may also be
applied to separable portions of a utility's business, such as the generation or
transmission functions, or to specific classes of customers.  Because
the Utility operating companies and System Energy meet these criteria, each of
them capitalizes costs that would otherwise be charged to expense if the rate
actions


Entergy

Financial Statements

of its
regulator make it probable that those costs will be recovered in future
revenue.  Such capitalized costs are reflected as regulatory assets in
the accompanying financial statements.  When an enterprise concludes
that recovery of a regulatory asset is no longer probable, the regulatory asset
must be removed from the entity's balance sheet.

An enterprise that ceases to meet the
three criteria for all or part of its operations should report that event in its
financial statements.  In general, the enterprise no longer meeting
the criteria should eliminate from its balance sheet all regulatory assets and
liabilities related to the applicable operations.  Additionally, if it
is determined that a regulated enterprise is no longer recovering all of its
costs, it is possible that an impairment may exist that could require further
write-offs of plant assets.

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana does not
apply regulatory accounting standards to the Louisiana retail deregulated
portion of River Bend, the 30% interest in River Bend formerly owned by Cajun,
and its steam business.  The Louisiana retail deregulated portion of
River Bend is operated under a deregulated asset plan representing a portion
(approximately 15%) of River Bend plant costs, generation, revenues, and
expenses established under a 1992 LPSC order.  The plan allows Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana to sell the electricity from the deregulated assets to
Louisiana retail customers at 4.6 cents per kWh or off-system at higher prices,
with certain provisions for sharing incremental revenue above 4.6 cents per kWh
between ratepayers and shareholders.

Cash and Cash
Equivalents

Entergy considers all unrestricted
highly liquid debt instruments with an original or remaining maturity of three
months or less at date of purchase to be cash equivalents.

Investments

Entergy records decommissioning trust
funds on the balance sheet at their fair value.  Because of the
ability of the Registrant Subsidiaries to recover decommissioning costs in rates
and in accordance with the regulatory treatment for decommissioning trust funds,
the Registrant Subsidiaries have recorded an offsetting amount of unrealized
gains/(losses) on investment securities in other regulatory
liabilities/assets.  For the nonregulated portion of River Bend,
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana has recorded an offsetting amount of unrealized
gains/(losses) in other deferred credits.  Decommissioning trust funds
for Pilgrim, Indian Point 2, Vermont Yankee, and Palisades do not meet the
criteria for regulatory accounting treatment.  Accordingly, unrealized
gains recorded on the assets in these trust funds are recognized in the
accumulated other comprehensive income component of shareholders' equity because
these assets are classified as available for sale.  Unrealized losses
(where cost exceeds fair market value) on the assets in these trust funds are
also recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of
shareholders' equity unless the unrealized loss is other than temporary and
therefore recorded in earnings.  Effective January 1, 2009, Entergy
adopted an accounting pronouncement providing guidance regarding recognition and
presentation of other-than-temporary impairments related to investments in debt
securities.  The assessment of whether an investment in a debt security has
suffered an other-than-temporary impairment is based on whether Entergy has the
intent to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt
security before recovery of its amortized costs.  Further, if Entergy does
not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the debt security, an
other-than-temporary impairment is considered to have occurred and it is
measured by the present value of cash flows expected to be collected less the
amortized cost basis (credit loss).  The assessment of whether an
investment in an equity security has suffered an other-than-temporary impairment
continues to be based on a number of factors including, first, whether Entergy
has the ability and intent to hold the investment to recover its value, the
duration and severity of any losses, and, then, whether it is expected that the
investment will recover its value within a reasonable period of
time.  Entergy's trusts are managed by third parties who operate in
accordance with agreements that define investment guidelines and place
restrictions on the purchases and sales of investments.  See Note 17 to the
financial statements for details on the decommissioning trust funds and the
other than temporary impairments recorded in 2009 and 2008.

Notes to

Equity Method
Investees

Entergy owns investments that are
accounted for under the equity method of accounting because Entergy's ownership
level results in significant influence, but not control, over the investee and
its operations.  Entergy records its share of earnings or losses of
the investee based on the change during the period in the estimated liquidation
value of the investment, assuming that the investee's assets were to be
liquidated at book value.  In accordance with this method, earnings
are allocated to owners or members based on what each partner would receive from
its capital account if, hypothetically, liquidation were to occur at the balance
sheet date and amounts distributed were based on recorded book
values.  Entergy discontinues the recognition of losses on equity
investments when its share of losses equals or exceeds its carrying amount for
an investee plus any advances made or commitments to provide additional
financial support.  See Note 14 to the financial statements for
additional information regarding Entergy's equity method
investments.

Derivative Financial
Instruments and Commodity Derivatives

The
accounting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities require
that all derivatives be recognized at fair value on the balance sheet, either as
assets or liabilities, unless they meet the normal purchase, normal sales
criteria.  The changes in the fair value of recognized derivatives are
recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income,
depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction
and the type of hedge transaction.

Contracts
for commodities that will be delivered in quantities expected to be used or sold
in the ordinary course of business, including certain purchases and sales of
power and fuel, meet the normal purchase, normal sales criteria and are not
recognized on the balance sheet.  Revenues and expenses from these
contracts are reported on a gross basis in the appropriate revenue and expense
categories as the commodities are received or delivered.

For other
contracts for commodities in which Entergy is hedging the variability of cash
flows related to a variable-rate asset, liability, or forecasted transactions
that qualify as cash flow hedges, the changes in the fair value of such
derivative instruments are reported in other comprehensive income.  To
qualify for hedge accounting, the relationship between the hedging instrument
and the hedged item must be documented to include the risk management objective
and strategy and, at inception and on an ongoing basis, the effectiveness of the
hedge in offsetting the changes in the cash flows of the item being
hedged.  Gains or losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are
reclassified as earnings in the periods in which earnings are affected by the
variability of the cash flows of the hedged item.  The ineffective
portions of all hedges are recognized in current-period earnings.

Entergy
has determined that contracts to purchase uranium do not meet the definition of
a derivative under the accounting standards for derivative instruments because
they do not provide for net settlement and the uranium markets are not
sufficiently liquid to conclude that forward contracts are readily convertible
to cash.  If the uranium markets do become sufficiently liquid in the
future and Entergy begins to account for uranium purchase contracts as
derivative instruments, the fair value of these contracts would be accounted for
consistent with Entergy's other derivative instruments.

Fair
Values

The
estimated fair values of Entergy's financial instruments and derivatives are
determined using bid prices and market quotes.  Considerable judgment
is required in developing the estimates of fair value.  Therefore,
estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that Entergy could
realize in a current market exchange.  Gains or losses realized on
financial instruments held by regulated businesses may be reflected in future
rates and therefore do not accrue to the benefit or detriment of
stockholders.  Entergy considers the carrying amounts of most
financial instruments classified as current assets and liabilities to be a
reasonable estimate of their fair value because of the short maturity of these
instruments.  See Note 16 to the financial statements for further
discussion of fair value.

Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets

Entergy periodically reviews long-lived
assets held in all of its business segments whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that recoverability of these assets is
uncertain.  Generally, the determination of recoverability is based on
the undiscounted net cash flows expected to result from such operations and
assets.  Projected net cash flows depend on the future operating costs
associated with the assets, the efficiency and availability of the assets and
generating units, and the future market and price for energy over the remaining
life of the assets.

River Bend
AFUDC

The River
Bend AFUDC gross-up is a regulatory asset that represents the incremental
difference imputed by the LPSC between the AFUDC actually recorded by Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana on a net-of-tax basis during the construction of River
Bend and what the AFUDC would have been on a pre-tax basis.  The
imputed amount was only calculated on that portion of River Bend that the LPSC
allowed in rate base and is being amortized through August 2025.

Reacquired
Debt

The premiums and costs associated with
reacquired debt of Entergy's Utility operating companies and System Energy
(except that portion allocable to the deregulated operations of Entergy Gulf
States Louisiana) are included in regulatory assets and are being amortized over
the life of the related new issuances, in accordance with ratemaking
treatment.

Taxes Imposed on
Revenue-Producing Transactions

Governmental authorities assess taxes
that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing
transaction between a seller and a customer, including, but not limited to,
sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes.  Entergy presents
these taxes on a net basis, excluding them from revenues, unless required to
report them differently by a regulatory authority.

Presentation of
Non-Controlling Interests

In 2007, a new accounting pronouncement
was issued regarding non-controlling interests that requires generally that
ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the reporting
company (non-controlling interests) be clearly identified, labeled, and
presented in the consolidated balance sheet within equity, but separate from the
controlling shareholders' equity, and that the amount of consolidated net income
attributable to the reporting company and to the non-controlling interests be
clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated income
statement.  This new accounting pronouncement became effective for
Entergy in the first quarter 2009 and applies to preferred securities issued by
Entergy subsidiaries to third parties.

Presentation of Preferred
Stock without Sinking Fund

In connection with the adoption of the
new accounting pronouncement regarding non-controlling interests Entergy
evaluated the accounting standards regarding the classification and measurement
of redeemable securities.  These standards require the classification
of securities between liabilities and shareholders' equity on the balance sheet
if the holders of those securities have protective rights that allow them to
gain control of the board of directors in certain
circumstances.  These rights would have the effect of giving the
holders the ability to potentially redeem their securities, even if the
likelihood of occurrence of these circumstances is considered
remote.  The Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New
Orleans articles of incorporation provide, generally, that the holders of each
company's preferred securities may elect a majority of the respective company's
board of directors if dividends are not paid for a year, until such time as the
dividends in arrears are paid.  Therefore, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy
Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans present their preferred securities
outstanding between liabilities and shareholders' equity on the balance
sheet.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana, both
organized as limited liability companies, have outstanding preferred securities
with similar protective rights with respect to unpaid dividends, but provide for
the election of board members that would not constitute a majority of the board;
and their preferred securities are therefore classified for all periods
presented as a component of members' equity.


Entergy
Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to
Financial Statements

The outstanding preferred securities of
Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Asset
Management, whose preferred holders also have protective rights as described in
Note 6 to the financial statements, are similarly presented between liabilities
and shareholders' equity on Entergy's consolidated balance sheets and the
outstanding preferred securities of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy
Louisiana are presented within total equity in Entergy's consolidated balance
sheets.  The preferred dividends or distributions paid by all
subsidiaries are reflected for all periods presented outside of consolidated net
income.

Subsequent
Events

Entergy evaluated events of which its management was aware subsequent to
December 31, 2009, through the date that this annual report was issued.

New Accounting
Pronouncements

In June 2009 the FASB issued SFAS 167,
"Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46R".  SFAS 167 replaces the
current quantitative-based risks and rewards calculation for determining which
enterprise, if any, has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest
entity with an approach focused on identifying which enterprise has the power to
direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly
affect the entity's economic performance and (1) the obligation to absorb losses
of the entity or (2) the right to receive benefits from the
entity.  SFAS 167 also requires additional disclosures on an interim
and annual basis about an enterprise's involvement in variable interest
entities.  The standard will be effective for Entergy in the first
quarter 2010.  Upon adoption, Entergy expects its subsidiaries that finance
their nuclear fuel purchases through nuclear fuel leases to consolidate the
special purpose nuclear fuel companies acting as lessors.  The adoption
of  this statement will result in the reclassification of amounts between
certain line items in the financial statements.

Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana and Entergy Texas Basis of Presentation

Effective
December 31, 2007, Entergy Gulf States, Inc. completed a jurisdictional
separation into two vertically integrated utility companies, one operating under
the sole retail jurisdiction of the PUCT, Entergy Texas, and the other operating
under the sole retail jurisdiction of the LPSC, Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana.  Entergy Texas now owns all Entergy Gulf States, Inc.
distribution and transmission assets located in Texas, the gas-fired generating
plants located in Texas, undivided 42.5% ownership shares of Entergy Gulf
States, Inc.'s 70% ownership interest in Nelson 6 and 42% ownership interest in
Big Cajun 2, Unit 3, which are coal-fired generating plants located in
Louisiana, and other assets and contract rights to the extent related to utility
operations in Texas.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana now owns all of
the remaining assets that were owned by Entergy Gulf States, Inc.  On a
book value basis, approximately 58.1% of the Entergy Gulf States, Inc. assets
were allocated to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and approximately 41.9% were
allocated to Entergy Texas.

Because
the jurisdictional separation was a transaction involving entities under common
control, Entergy Texas recognized the assets and liabilities allocated to it at
their carrying amounts in the accounts of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. at the time
of the jurisdictional separation.  Entergy Texas' financial statements
report results of operations for 2007 as though the jurisdictional separation
had occurred at the beginning of 2007, and presented its 2007 balance sheet as
though the assets and liabilities had been allocated at December 31, 2007. 
Financial information presented for prior periods has also been presented on
that basis to furnish comparative information.

As the
successor to Entergy Gulf States, Inc. for financial reporting purposes, Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana's income statement and cash flow statement for the year
ended December 31, 2007 include the operations of Entergy
Texas.

Fuel
and purchased power cost recovery

Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and
Entergy Texas are allowed to recover certain fuel and purchased power costs
through fuel mechanisms included in electric and gas rates that are recorded as
fuel cost recovery revenues.  The difference between revenues
collected and the current fuel and purchased power costs is recorded as
"Deferred fuel costs" on the Utility operating companies' financial
statements.  The table below shows the amount of deferred fuel costs
as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, that Entergy expects to recover (or return to
customers) through fuel mechanisms, subject to subsequent regulatory
review.

Production
Cost Allocation Rider

In its June 2007 decision on Entergy
Arkansas' August 2006 rate filing, the APSC approved a production cost
allocation rider for recovery from customers of the retail portion of the costs
allocated to Entergy Arkansas as a result of the System Agreement
proceedings.  These costs cause an increase in Entergy Arkansas'
deferred fuel cost balance, because Entergy Arkansas pays the costs over seven
months but collects them from customers over twelve months.  In
December 2007, the APSC issued a subsequent order stating that termination of
the rider would be subject to eighteen months advance notice by the APSC, which
would occur following notice and hearing.

Subsidiaries' "

proceedings.

Energy
Cost Recovery Rider

Entergy Arkansas' retail rates include
an energy cost recovery rider.  In December 2007, the APSC issued an
order stating that termination of the energy cost recovery rider would be
subject to eighteen months advance notice by the APSC, which would occur
following notice and hearing.

In March 2009, Entergy Arkansas filed
with the APSC its annual energy cost rate for the period April 2009 through
March 2010.  The filed energy cost rate decreased from $0.02456/kWh to
$0.01552/kWh.  The decrease was caused by the following: 1) all three
of the nuclear power plants from which Entergy Arkansas obtains power, ANO 1 and
2 and Grand Gulf, had refueling outages in 2008, and the previous energy cost
rate had been adjusted to account for the replacement power costs that would be
incurred while these units were down; 2) Entergy Arkansas had a deferred fuel
cost liability from over-recovered fuel costs at December 31, 2008, as compared
to a deferred fuel cost asset from under-recovered fuel costs at December 31,
2007; offset by 3) an increase in the fuel and purchased power prices included
in the calculation.

In August 2009, as provided for by its
energy cost recovery rider, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC an interim
revision to its energy cost rate.  The revised energy cost rate is a
decrease from $0.01552/kWh to $0.01206/kWh.  The decrease was caused
by a decrease in natural gas and purchased power prices from the levels used in
setting the rate in March 2009.  The interim revised energy cost rate
went into effect for the first billing cycle of September 2009.  In
its order approving the new rate, the APSC ordered Entergy Arkansas to show
cause why the rate should not be further reduced.  In its September
14, 2009 response, Entergy Arkansas explained that it used the same methodology
it had used in previous interim revisions, which is based on estimating what the
rate would be in the next annual update based on the information known at the
time.  There has been no further activity in this
proceeding.

APSC
Investigations

In September 2005, Entergy Arkansas
filed with the APSC an interim energy cost rate per the energy cost recovery
rider, which provides for an interim adjustment should the cumulative over- or
under-recovery for the energy period exceed 10 percent of the energy costs for
that period.  In early October 2005, the APSC initiated an
investigation into Entergy Arkansas' interim energy cost rate.  The
investigation is focused on Entergy Arkansas' 1) gas contracting, portfolio, and
hedging practices; 2) wholesale purchases during the period; 3) management of
the coal inventory at its coal generation plants; and 4) response to the
contractual failure of the railroads to provide coal deliveries.  In
March 2006, the APSC extended its investigation to cover the costs included in
Entergy Arkansas' March 2006 annual energy cost rate filing, and a hearing was
held in the APSC energy cost recovery investigation in October
2006.


Entergy
Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to
Financial Statements

In January 2007, the APSC issued an
order in its review of the energy cost rate.  The APSC found that
Entergy Arkansas failed to maintain an adequate coal inventory level going into
the summer of 2005 and that Entergy Arkansas should be responsible for any
incremental energy costs resulting from two outages caused by employee and
contractor error.  The coal plant generation curtailments were caused
by railroad delivery problems and Entergy Arkansas has since resolved litigation
with the railroad regarding the delivery problems.  The APSC staff was
directed to perform an analysis with Entergy Arkansas' assistance to determine
the additional fuel and purchased energy costs associated with these findings
and file the analysis within 60 days of the order.  After a final
determination of the costs is made by the APSC, Entergy Arkansas would be
directed to refund that amount with interest to its customers as a credit on the
energy cost recovery rider.  Entergy Arkansas requested rehearing of
the order.  In March 2007, in order to allow further consideration by
the APSC, the APSC granted Entergy Arkansas' petition for rehearing and for stay
of the APSC order.

In October 2008, Entergy Arkansas filed
a motion to lift the stay and to rescind the APSC's January 2007 order in light
of the arguments advanced in Entergy Arkansas' rehearing petition and because
the value for Entergy Arkansas' customers obtained through the resolved railroad
litigation is significantly greater than the incremental cost of actions
identified by the APSC as imprudent.  The APSC staff, the AEEC, and
the Arkansas attorney general support the lifting of the stay but request
additional proceedings.  In December 2008, the APSC denied the motion
to lift the stay pending resolution of Entergy Arkansas' rehearing request and
of the unresolved issues in the proceeding.  The APSC ordered the
parties to submit their unresolved issues list in the pending proceeding, which
the parties have done.  In February 2010 the APSC denied Entergy
Arkansas' request for rehearing, and scheduled a hearing for September 2010 to
determine the amount of damages, if any, that should be assessed against Entergy
Arkansas.

The APSC also established a separate
docket to consider the resolved railroad litigation, and in February 2010 it
established a procedural schedule that concludes with testimony through
September 2010.  The APSC may set a hearing in a future order, if
necessary.

Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana

In
Louisiana, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana recover electric
fuel and purchased power costs for the upcoming month based upon the level of
such costs from the prior month.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's
purchased gas adjustments include estimates for the billing month adjusted by a
surcharge or credit that arises from an annual reconciliation of fuel costs
incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying
charges.

In August 2000, the LPSC authorized its
staff to initiate a proceeding to audit the fuel adjustment clause filings of
Entergy Louisiana pursuant to a November 1997 LPSC general order.  The
time period that is the subject of the audit is January 1, 2000 through December
31, 2001.  In September 2003, the LPSC staff issued its audit report
and recommended a disallowance with regard to an alleged failure to uprate
Waterford 3 in a timely manner.  This issue was resolved with a March
2005 global settlement.  Subsequent to the issuance of the audit
report, the scope of this docket was expanded to include a review of annual
reports on fuel and purchased power transactions with affiliates and a prudence
review of transmission planning issues and to include the years 2002 through
2004.  Hearings were held in November 2006.  In May 2008 the
ALJ issued a final recommendation that found in Entergy Louisiana's favor on the
issues, except for the disallowance of hypothetical SO


allowance
costs included in affiliate purchases.  The ALJ recommended a refund
of the SO


allowance
costs collected to date and a realignment of these costs into base rates
prospectively with an amortization of the refunded amount through base rates
over a five-year period.  The LPSC issued an order in December 2008
affirming the ALJ's recommendation.  Entergy Louisiana recorded a
provision for the disallowance, including interest, and refunded approximately
$7 million to customers in 2009.

In
January 2003, the LPSC authorized its staff to initiate a proceeding to audit
the fuel adjustment clause filings of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and its
affiliates pursuant to a November 1997 LPSC general order.  The audit
will include a review of the reasonableness of charges flowed by Entergy Gulf
States Louisiana through its fuel adjustment clause in

for the period January 1, 1995 through December 31, 2002.  Discovery
is underway, but a detailed procedural schedule extending beyond the discovery
stage has not yet been established, and the LPSC staff has not yet issued its
audit report.  In June 2005, the LPSC expanded the audit period to
include the years through 2004.

Entergy
Mississippi

Entergy Mississippi's rate schedules
include an energy cost recovery rider that is adjusted quarterly to reflect
accumulated over- or under-recoveries from the second prior
quarter.

In July 2008 the MPSC began a
proceeding to investigate the fuel procurement practices and fuel adjustment
schedules of the Mississippi utility companies, including Entergy
Mississippi.  A two-day public hearing was held in July 2008, and
after a recess during which the MPSC reviewed information, the hearing resumed
on August 5, 2008, for additional testimony by an expert witness retained by the
MPSC.  The MPSC's witness presented testimony regarding a review of
the utilities' fuel adjustment clauses.  The MPSC stated that the goal
of the proceeding is fact-finding so that the MPSC may decide whether to amend
the current fuel cost recovery process.  In February 2009 the MPSC
published a final report of its expert witness, which discussed Entergy
Mississippi's fuel procurement activities and made recommendations regarding
fuel recovery practices in Mississippi.

In addition, in October 2008 the MPSC
issued an order directing Entergy Mississippi and Entergy Services to provide
documents associated with fuel adjustment clause litigation in Louisiana
involving Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans, and in January 2009 issued
an order requiring Entergy Mississippi to provide additional information related
to the long-term Evangeline gas contract that had been an issue in the fuel
adjustment clause litigation in Louisiana.  Entergy Mississippi and
Entergy Services filed a response to the MPSC order stating that gas from the
Evangeline gas contract had been sold into the Entergy System exchange and had
an effect on the costs paid by Entergy Mississippi's customers.  The
MPSC's investigation is ongoing.

In August 2009 the MPSC retained an
independent audit firm to audit Entergy Mississippi's fuel adjustment clause
submittals for the period October 2007 through September 2009.  The
independent audit firm submitted its report to the MPSC in December
2009.  The report does not recommend that any costs be disallowed for
recovery.  The report did suggest that some costs, less than one
percent of the fuel and purchased power costs recovered during the period, may
have been more reasonably charged to customers through base rates rather than
through fuel charges, but the report did not suggest that customers should not
have paid for those costs.  In November 2009 the MPSC also retained
another firm to review processes and practices related to fuel and purchased
energy.  The results of that review are due to the MPSC in March
2010.

In January 2010 the MPSC issued an
order certifying to the Mississippi Legislature the independent audit report and
the Public Utilities Staff's annual fuel audit report for the years ended
September 30, 2008 and 2009, which did not find any imprudent
costs.  The order stated that the MPSC will open a rulemaking docket
to address certain policy issues regarding allowable fuel adjustment costs, fuel
adjustment mechanisms, and related matters.

Mississippi
Attorney General Complaint

The Mississippi attorney general filed
a complaint in state court in December 2008 against Entergy Corporation, Entergy
Mississippi, Entergy Services, and Entergy Power alleging, among other things,
violations of Mississippi statutes, fraud, and breach of good faith and fair
dealing, and requesting an accounting and restitution.  The litigation
is wide ranging and relates to tariffs and procedures under which Entergy
Mississippi purchases power not generated in Mississippi to meet electricity
demand.  Entergy believes the complaint is unfounded.  On
December 29, 2008, the defendant Entergy companies filed to remove the attorney
general's suit to U.S. District Court (the forum that Entergy believes is
appropriate to resolve the types of federal issues raised in the suit), where it
is currently pending, and additionally answered the complaint and filed a
counter-claim for relief based upon the Mississippi Public Utilities Act and the
Federal Power Act.  The Mississippi attorney general has filed a
pleading seeking to remand the matter to state court.  In May 2009,
the


Entergy
Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to

defendant
Entergy companies filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings asserting grounds
of federal preemption, the exclusive jurisdiction of the MPSC, and factual
errors in the attorney general's complaint.

Entergy New
Orleans

Entergy New Orleans' electric rate
schedules include a fuel adjustment tariff designed to reflect no more than
targeted fuel and purchased power costs, adjusted by a surcharge or credit for
deferred fuel expense arising from the monthly reconciliation of actual fuel and
purchased power costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers,
including carrying charges.  In June 2006 the City Council authorized
the recovery of all Grand Gulf costs through Entergy New Orleans' fuel
adjustment clause (a significant portion of Grand Gulf costs was previously
recovered through base rates), and continued that authorization in approving the
October 2006 formula rate plan filing settlement.  Effective June
2009, the majority of Grand Gulf costs were realigned to base rates and are no
longer flowed through the fuel adjustment clause.

Entergy New Orleans' gas rate schedules
include a purchased gas adjustment to reflect estimated gas costs for the
billing month, adjusted by a surcharge or credit similar to that included in the
electric fuel adjustment clause, including carrying charges.  In
October 2005, the City Council approved modification of the gas cost collection
mechanism effective November 2005 in order to address concerns regarding its
fluctuations, particularly during the winter heating season.  The
modifications are intended to minimize fluctuations in gas rates during the
winter months.

Entergy
Texas

Entergy
Texas' rate schedules include a fixed fuel factor to recover fuel and purchased
power costs, including carrying charges, not recovered in base
rates.  The fixed fuel factor formula was revised and approved by a
PUCT order in August 2006.  The new formula was implemented in
September 2006.  Under the new methodology, semi-annual revisions of
the fixed fuel factor will continue to be made in March and September based on
the market price of natural gas and changes in fuel mix.  The amounts
collected under Entergy Texas' fixed fuel factor and any interim surcharge or
refund are subject to fuel reconciliation proceedings before the
PUCT.

In July
2005, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request for implementation of an
incremental purchased capacity recovery rider.  Through this rider
Entergy Texas sought to recover incremental revenues that represent the
incremental purchased capacity costs, including Entergy Texas' obligation to
purchase power from Entergy Louisiana's Perryville plant, over what is already
in Entergy Texas' base rates.  The PUCT approved an initial rider to
collect $18 million annually, which was increased to $21 million in subsequent
years.  Under the settlement of the 2007 rate case discussed below,
this rider ceased on January 28, 2009, with the implementation of stipulated
base rates.  The amounts collected through the rider are subject to
reconciliation.

In May
2006, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a fuel and purchased power
reconciliation case covering the period September 2003 through December 2005 for
costs recoverable through the fixed fuel factor rate and the incremental
purchased capacity recovery rider.  Entergy Texas sought
reconciliation of $1.6 billion of fuel and purchased power costs on a Texas
retail basis.  A hearing was conducted before the ALJs in April
2007.  In July 2007, the ALJs issued a proposal for decision
recommending that Entergy Texas be authorized to reconcile all of its requested
fixed fuel factor expenses and recommending a minor exception to the incremental
purchased capacity recovery calculation.  The ALJs also recommended
granting an exception to the PUCT rules to allow for recovery of an additional
$11.4 million in purchased power capacity costs.  In September 2007,
the PUCT issued an order, which affirmed the ultimate result of the ALJs'
proposal for decision.  Upon motions for rehearing, the PUCT added
additional language in its order on rehearing to further clarify its position
that 30% of River Bend should not be regulated by the PUCT.  Two
parties filed a second motion for rehearing, but the PUCT declined to address
them.  The PUCT's decision has been appealed to the Travis County
District Court.


Entergy
Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to
Financial Statements

In March 2007, Entergy Texas filed a
request with the PUCT to refund $78.5 million, including interest, of fuel cost
recovery over-collections through January 2007.  In June 2007 the PUCT
approved a unanimous stipulation and settlement agreement that updated the
over-collection balance through April 2007 and established a refund amount,
including interest, of $109.4 million.  The refund was made over a
two-month period beginning with the first billing cycle in July
2007.

In October 2007, Entergy Texas filed a
request with the PUCT to refund $45.6 million, including interest, of fuel cost
recovery over-collections through September 2007.  In January 2008,
Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a stipulation and settlement agreement among
the parties that updated the over-collection balance through November 2007 and
established a refund amount, including interest, of $71 million.  The
PUCT approved the agreement in February 2008.  The refund was made
over a two-month period beginning February 2008, but was reduced by
$10.3 million of under-recovered incremental purchased capacity
costs.

In
January 2008, Entergy Texas made a compliance filing with the PUCT describing
how its 2007 Rough Production Cost Equalization receipts under the System
Agreement were allocated between Entergy Gulf States, Inc.'s Texas and Louisiana
jurisdictions.  A hearing was held at the end of July 2008, and in
October 2008 the ALJ issued a proposal for decision recommending an additional
$18.6 million allocation to Texas retail customers.  The PUCT adopted
the ALJ's proposal for decision in December 2008.  Because the PUCT
allocation to Texas retail customers is inconsistent with the LPSC allocation to
Louisiana retail customers, the PUCT's decision would result in trapped costs
between the Texas and Louisiana jurisdictions with no mechanism for
recovery.  The PUCT denied Entergy Texas' motion for rehearing and
Entergy Texas commenced proceedings in both state and federal district courts
seeking to reverse the PUCT's decision.  The federal proceeding has
been abated pending further action by the FERC in the proceeding discussed
below.  No procedural schedule has been set for the state
proceeding.

Entergy
Texas also filed with the FERC a proposed amendment to the System Agreement
bandwidth formula to specifically calculate the payments to Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana and Entergy Texas of Entergy Gulf States, Inc.'s rough production cost
equalization receipts for 2007.  On May 8, 2009, the FERC issued an
order rejecting the proposed amendment, stating, among other things, that the
FERC does not have jurisdiction over the allocation of an individual utility's
receipts/payments among or between its retail jurisdictions and that this was a
matter for the courts to review in the pending proceedings noted
above.  Because of the FERC's order, Entergy Texas recorded the
effects of the PUCT's allocation of the additional $18.6 million to retail
customers in the second quarter 2009.  On an after-tax basis, the
charge to earnings was approximately $13.0 million (including
interest).  Entergy requested rehearing of the FERC's order, and on
July 8, 2009, the FERC granted the request for rehearing for the limited purpose
of affording more time for consideration of Entergy's request.

In May
2009, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to refund $46.1 million,
including interest, of fuel cost recovery over-collections through February
2009.  Entergy Texas requested that the proposed refund be made over a
four-month period beginning June 2009.  Pursuant to a stipulation
among the various parties, in June 2009 the PUCT issued an order approving a
refund of $59.2 million, including interest, of fuel cost recovery
overcollections through March 2009.  The refund was made over a
three-month period beginning July 2009, with the exception of certain industrial
and seasonal/agricultural customers who received a one-month
refund.

In
October 2009, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to refund
approximately $71 million, including interest, of fuel cost recovery
over-collections through September 2009.  Entergy Texas requested that
the proposed refund be made over a six-month period beginning January
2010.  Pursuant to a stipulation among the various parties, the PUCT
issued an order approving a refund of $87.8 million, including interest, of fuel
cost recovery overcollections through October 2009.  The refund will
be made over a three-month period beginning January 2010, with the exception of
certain industrial and seasonal/agricultural customers who received a one-month
refund.

Entergy
Texas' December 2009 rate case filing, which is discussed below, also includes a

Entergy Arkansas Storm
Reserve Accounting

The APSC's June 2007 order in Entergy
Arkansas' base rate proceeding eliminated storm reserve accounting for Entergy
Arkansas.  In March 2009 a law was enacted in Arkansas that requires
the APSC to permit storm reserve accounting for utilities that request
it.  Entergy Arkansas filed its request with the APSC, and has
reinstated storm reserve accounting effective January 1, 2009.  A
hearing on Entergy Arkansas' request is scheduled for March 2010.

Entergy Arkansas January
2009 Ice Storm

In
January 2009 a severe ice storm caused significant damage to Entergy Arkansas'
transmission and distribution lines, equipment, poles, and other
facilities.  On January 30, 2009, the APSC issued an order inviting
and encouraging electric public utilities to file specific proposals for the
recovery of extraordinary storm restoration expenses associated with the ice
storm.  On February 16, 2009, Entergy Arkansas filed a request with
the APSC for an accounting order authorizing deferral of the operating and
maintenance cost portion of Entergy Arkansas' ice storm restoration costs
pending their recovery.  The APSC issued such an order in March 2009
subject to certain conditions, including that if Entergy Arkansas seeks to
recover the deferred costs, those costs will be subject to investigation for
whether they are incremental, prudent, and reasonable.  A law was
enacted in April 2009 in Arkansas that authorizes securitization of storm damage
restoration costs.  On February 1, 2010, Entergy Arkansas requested a
financing order to issue approximately $127.5 million in storm recovery bonds,
which included carrying costs of $11.7 million and $4.6 million of up-front
financing costs to pay for ice storm restoration because Entergy Arkansas'
analysis demonstrates retail customers will benefit from lower costs using
securitization.  The APSC has established a procedural schedule that
includes a hearing in April 2010 and states that the APSC will issue its final
order by June 15, 2010.  Entergy Arkansas' September 2009 general rate
filing also requested recovery of the January 2009 ice storm costs over 10 years
if it was expected that securitization would not produce lower costs for
customers, and Entergy Arkansas will remove this request if the APSC approves
securitization.

Entergy
Texas

Hurricane
Rita

In July 2006, Entergy Texas filed an
application with the PUCT with respect to its Hurricane Rita reconstruction
costs incurred through March 2006.  The filing asked the PUCT to
determine the amount of reasonable and necessary hurricane reconstruction costs
eligible for securitization and recovery, approve the recovery of carrying
costs, and approve the manner in which Entergy Texas allocates those costs among
its retail customer classes.  In December 2006, the PUCT approved $381
million of reasonable and necessary hurricane reconstruction costs incurred
through March 31, 2006, plus carrying costs, as eligible for
recovery.  After netting expected insurance proceeds, the amount is
$353 million.

In April 2007, the PUCT issued its
financing order authorizing the issuance of securitization bonds to recover the
$353 million of hurricane reconstruction costs and up to $6 million of
transaction costs, offset by $32 million of related deferred income tax
benefits.  See Note 5 to the financial statements for a discussion of
the June 2007 issuance of the securitization bonds.

Hurricane Ike and Hurricane

Entergy Texas filed an application in
April 2009 seeking a determination that $577.5 million of Hurricane Ike and
Hurricane Gustav restoration costs are recoverable, including estimated costs
for work to be completed.  On August 5, 2009, Entergy Texas submitted
to the ALJ an unopposed settlement agreement intended to resolve all issues in
the storm cost recovery case.  Under the terms of the agreement $566.4
million, plus carrying costs, are eligible for recovery.  Insurance
proceeds will be credited as an offset to the securitized amount.  Of
the $11.1 million difference between Entergy Texas' request and the amount
agreed to, which is part of the black box agreement and not directly
attributable to any specific individual issues raised, $6.8 million is
operation and maintenance expense for which Entergy Texas recorded a charge in
the second quarter 2009.  The remaining $4.3 million was recorded as
utility plant.  The PUCT approved the settlement in August 2009, and
in September 2009 the PUCT approved recovery of the costs, plus carrying costs,
by securitization.  See Note 5 to the financial statements for a
discussion of the November 2009 issuance of the securitization
bonds.

Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana

Hurricane Gustav and
Hurricane Ike

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and
Entergy Louisiana filed their Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike storm cost
recovery case with the LPSC in May 2009.  In September 2009, Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana made a supplemental filing to, among
other things, recommend recovery of the costs and replenishment of the storm
reserves by Louisiana Act 55 (passed in 2007) financing.  Entergy Gulf
States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana recovered their costs from Hurricane
Katrina and Hurricane Rita primarily by Act 55 financing, as discussed
below.  On December 30, 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and
Entergy Louisiana entered into a stipulation agreement with the LPSC Staff that,
if approved, provides for total recoverable costs of approximately $234 million
for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and $394 million for Entergy
Louisiana.  Under this stipulation, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana
agrees not to recover $4.4 million and Entergy Louisiana agrees not to recover
$7.2 million of their storm restoration spending.  The stipulation
also permits replenishing Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's storm reserve in the
amount of $90 million and Entergy Louisiana's storm reserve in the amount of
$200 million when Act 55 financing is accomplished.  The parties to
the proceeding have agreed to a procedural schedule that includes March/April
2010 hearing dates for both the recoverability and the method of recovery
proceedings.

Hurricane Katrina and
Hurricane Rita

In February 2007, Entergy Louisiana and
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed a supplemental and amending application by
which they sought authority from the LPSC to securitize their Hurricane Katrina
and Hurricane Rita storm cost recovery and storm reserve amounts, together with
certain debt retirement costs and upfront and ongoing costs of the securitized
debt issued.  Securitization is authorized by a law signed by the
Governor of Louisiana in May 2006.  Hearings on the quantification of
the amounts eligible for securitization began in late-April 2007.  At
the start of the hearing, a stipulation among Entergy Gulf States Louisiana,
Entergy Louisiana, the LPSC staff, and most other parties in the proceeding was
read into the record.  The stipulation quantified the balance of storm
restoration costs for recovery as $545 million for Entergy Louisiana and $187
million for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, and set the storm reserve amounts at
$152 million for Entergy Louisiana and $87 million for Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana.  The stipulation also called for securitization of the
storm restoration costs and storm reserves in those same amounts.  In
August 2007, the LPSC issued orders approving recovery of the stipulated storm
cost recovery and storm reserve amounts plus certain debt retirement and upfront
and ongoing costs through securitization financing.

In March 2008, Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and the Louisiana Utilities Restoration
Corporation (LURC), an instrumentality of the State of Louisiana, filed at the
LPSC an application requesting that the LPSC grant financing orders authorizing
the financing of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana storm
costs, storm reserves, and issuance costs pursuant to Act 55 of the Louisiana
Legislature (Act 55 financings).  The Act 55 financings are expected
to produce additional customer benefits as compared to Act 64 traditional
securitization.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana also
filed an application requesting LPSC approval for ancillary issues including the
mechanism to flow charges and savings to customers via a Storm Cost Offset
rider.  On April 3, 2008, the Louisiana State Bond Commission granted
preliminary approval for the Act 55 financings.  On April 8, 2008, the
Louisiana Public Facilities Authority (LPFA), which is the issuer of the bonds
pursuant to the Act 55 financings, approved requests for the Act 55
financings.  On April 10, 2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy
Louisiana and the LPSC Staff filed with the LPSC an uncontested stipulated
settlement that includes Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana's
proposals under the Act 55 financings, which includes a commitment to pass on to
customers a minimum of $10 million and $30 million of customer benefits,
respectively, through prospective annual rate reductions of $2 million and $6
million for five years.  On April 16, 2008, the LPSC approved the
settlement and issued two financing orders and one ratemaking order intended to
facilitate implementation of the Act 55 financings.  In May 2008, the
Louisiana State Bond Commission granted final approval of the Act 55
financings.

On July 29, 2008, the LPFA issued
$687.7 million in bonds under the aforementioned Act 55.  From the
$679 million of bond proceeds loaned by the LPFA to the LURC, the LURC deposited
$152 million in a restricted escrow account as a storm damage reserve for
Entergy Louisiana and transferred $527 million directly to Entergy
Louisiana.  From the bond proceeds received by Entergy Louisiana from
the LURC, Entergy Louisiana invested $545 million, including $17.8 million that
was withdrawn from the restricted escrow account as approved by the April 16,
2008 LPSC orders, in exchange for 5,449,861.85 Class A preferred, non-voting,
membership interest units of Entergy Holdings Company LLC, a company
wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy, that carry a 10% annual distribution
rate.  Distributions are payable quarterly commencing on September 15,
2008 and have a liquidation price of $100 per unit.  The preferred
membership interests are callable at the option of Entergy Holdings Company LLC
after ten years under the terms of the LLC agreement.  The terms of
the membership interests include certain financial covenants to which Entergy
Holdings Company LLC is subject, including the requirement to maintain a net
worth of at least $1 billion.

On August
26, 2008, the LPFA issued $278.4 million in bonds under the aforementioned Act
55.  From the $274.7 million of bond proceeds loaned by the LPFA to
the LURC, the LURC deposited $87 million in a restricted escrow account as a
storm damage reserve for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and transferred $187.7
million directly to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana.  From the bond
proceeds received by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana from the LURC, Entergy Gulf
States Louisiana invested $189.4 million, including $1.7 million that was
withdrawn from the restricted escrow account as approved by the April 16, 2008
LPSC orders, in exchange for 1,893,918.39 Class A preferred, non-voting,
membership interest units of Entergy Holdings Company LLC that carry a 10%
annual distribution rate.  Distributions are payable quarterly
commencing on September 15, 2008 and have a liquidation price of $100 per
unit.  The preferred membership interests are callable at the option
of Entergy Holdings Company LLC after ten years under the terms of the LLC
agreement.  The terms of the membership interests include certain
financial covenants to which Entergy Holdings Company LLC is subject, including
the requirement to maintain a net worth of at least $1 billion.

Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana do not report the bonds on their
balance sheets because the bonds are the obligation of the LPFA, and there is no
recourse against Entergy, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana or Entergy Louisiana in
the event of a bond default.  To service the bonds, Entergy Gulf
States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana collect a system restoration charge on
behalf of the LPFA, and remit the collections to the LPFA.  By analogy
to and in accordance with Entergy's accounting policy for collection of sales
taxes, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana do not report the
collections as revenue because they are merely acting as the billing and
collection agent for the state.

Entergy
Mississippi

In
March 2006, the Governor of Mississippi signed a law that established a
mechanism by which the MPSC could authorize and certify an electric utility
financing order and the state could issue bonds to finance the costs of
repairing damage caused by Hurricane Katrina to the systems of investor-owned
electric utilities.  In June 2006, the MPSC issued an order certifying
Entergy Mississippi's Hurricane Katrina restoration costs incurred through March
31, 2006 of $89 million, net of estimated insurance proceeds.  Two
days later, Entergy Mississippi filed a request with the Mississippi Development
Authority for $89 million of Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funding
for reimbursement of its Hurricane Katrina infrastructure restoration
costs.  Entergy Mississippi also filed a Petition for Financing Order
with the MPSC for authorization of state bond financing of $169 million for
Hurricane Katrina restoration costs and future storm costs.  The $169
million amount included the $89 million of Hurricane Katrina restoration costs
plus $80 million to build Entergy Mississippi's storm damage reserve for the
future.  Entergy Mississippi's filing stated that the amount actually
financed through the state bonds would be net of any CDBG funds that Entergy
Mississippi received.

In October 2006, the Mississippi
Development Authority approved for payment and Entergy Mississippi received $81
million in CDBG funding for Hurricane Katrina costs.  The MPSC then
issued a financing order authorizing the issuance of state bonds to finance
$8 million of Entergy Mississippi's certified Hurricane Katrina restoration
costs and $40 million for an increase in Entergy Mississippi's storm damage
reserve.  $30 million of the storm damage reserve was set aside in a
restricted account.  A Mississippi state entity issued the bonds in
May 2007, and Entergy Mississippi received proceeds of $48
million.  Entergy Mississippi does not report the bonds on its balance
sheet because the bonds are the obligation of the state entity, and there is no
recourse against Entergy Mississippi in the event of a bond
default.  To service the bonds, Entergy Mississippi collects a system
restoration charge on behalf of the issuer, and remits the collections to the
issuer.  By analogy to and in accordance with Entergy's accounting
policy for collection of sales taxes, Entergy Mississippi does not report the
collections as revenue because it is merely acting as the billing and collection
agent for the state.

In December 2005, the U.S. Congress
passed the Katrina Relief Bill, a hurricane aid package that included CDBG
funding (for the states affected by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma) that
allowed state and local leaders to fund individual recovery
priorities.  In March 2007, the City Council certified that Entergy
New Orleans incurred $205 million in storm-related costs through December 2006
that are eligible for CDBG funding under the state action plan, and certified
Entergy New Orleans' estimated costs of $465 million for its gas system rebuild
(which is discussed below).  Entergy New Orleans received $180.8
million of CDBG funds in 2007.

In August 2006, Entergy Arkansas filed
with the APSC a request for a change in base rates.  Entergy Arkansas
requested a general base rate increase (using an ROE of 11.25%), which it
subsequently adjusted to a request for a $106.5 million annual
increase.  In June 2007, after hearings on the filing, the APSC
ordered Entergy Arkansas to reduce its annual rates by $5 million, and set a
return on common equity of 9.9% with a hypothetical common equity level lower
than Entergy Arkansas' actual capital structure.  For the purpose of
setting rates, the APSC disallowed a portion of costs associated with incentive
compensation based on financial measures and all costs associated with Entergy's
stock-based compensation plans.  In addition, under the terms of the
APSC's decision, the order eliminated storm reserve accounting and set an amount
of $14.4 million in base rates to address

storm
restoration costs, regardless of the actual annual amount of future restoration
costs.  The APSC's June 2007 decision left Entergy Arkansas with no
mechanism to recover $52 million of costs previously accumulated in Entergy
Arkansas' storm reserve and $18 million of removal costs associated with the
termination of a lease.

The APSC
denied Entergy Arkansas' request for rehearing of its June 2007 decision, and
the base rate change was implemented August 29, 2007, effective for bills
rendered after June 15, 2007.  In December 2008 the Arkansas Court of
Appeals upheld almost all aspects of the APSC decision.  After
considering the progress of the proceeding in light of the decision of the Court
of Appeals, Entergy Arkansas recorded in the fourth quarter 2008 an
approximately $70 million charge to earnings, on both a pre- and after-tax basis
because these are primarily flow-through items, to recognize that the regulatory
assets associated with the storm reserve costs, lease termination removal costs,
and stock-based compensation are no longer probable of recovery.  In
April 2009 the Arkansas Supreme Court denied Entergy Arkansas' petition for
review of the Court of Appeals decision.

2009 Base
Rate Filing

On
September 4, 2009, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC for a general change in
rates, charges, and tariffs.  Entergy Arkansas requested a $223.2
million base rate increase that would become effective in July
2010.  The filing reflects an 11.5% return on common equity using a
projected capital structure, and proposes a formula rate plan
mechanism.  Proposed formula rate plan provisions include a +/- 25
basis point bandwidth, with earnings outside the bandwidth reset to the 11.5%
return on common equity midpoint and rates changing on a prospective basis
depending on whether Entergy Arkansas is over or under-earning.  The
proposed formula rate plan also includes a recovery mechanism for APSC-approved
costs for additional capacity purchases or construction/acquisition of new
transmission or generating facilities.  Entergy Arkansas is also
seeking an increase in its annual storm damage accrual from $14.4 million to
$22.3 million.  The APSC scheduled hearings in the proceeding
beginning in May 2010.

2009 Rate
Case

In
December 2009, Entergy Texas filed a rate case requesting a $198.7 million
increase reflecting an 11.5% return on common equity based on an adjusted June
2009 test year.  The filing includes a proposed cost of service
adjustment rider with a three-year term beginning with the 2010 calendar year as
the initial evaluation period.  Key provisions include a plus or minus
15 basis point bandwidth, with earnings outside the bandwidth reset to the
bottom or top of the band and rates changing prospectively depending upon
whether Entergy Texas is under or over-earning.  The annual change in
revenue requirement is limited to a percentage change in the Consumer Price
Index for urban areas, and the filing includes a provision for extraordinary
events greater than $10 million per year that would be considered
separately.  The filing also proposes a purchased power recovery rider
and a competitive generation service tariff and will establish test year
baseline values to be used in the transmission cost recovery factor rider
authorized for use by Entergy Texas in the 2009 legislative
session.  The rate case also includes a $2.8 million revenue
requirement to provide supplemental funding for the decommissioning trust
maintained for the 70% share of River Bend for which Entergy Texas retail
customers are responsible, in response to an NRC notification of a projected
shortfall of decommissioning funding assurance.  Hearings in the
proceeding are scheduled for July 2010, and the PUCT is required to issue a
final order by November 1, 2010.  Beginning in May 2010, Entergy Texas
will be allowed to implement a $17.5 million interim rate increase, subject to
refund.  The rates set by a final order will be effective back to

2007 Rate
Case

Entergy
Texas made a rate filing in September 2007 with the PUCT requesting an annual
rate increase totaling $107.5 million, including a base rate increase of $64.3
million and riders totaling $43.2 million.  On December 16, 2008,
Entergy Texas filed a term sheet that reflected a settlement agreement that
included the PUCT Staff and the other active participants in the rate
case.  On December 19, 2008, the ALJs approved Entergy Texas' request
to implement interim rates reflecting the agreement.  The agreement
includes a $46.7 million base rate increase, among other
provisions.  Under the ALJs' interim order, Entergy Texas implemented
interim rates, subject to refund and surcharge, reflecting the rates established
through the settlement.  These rates became effective with bills
rendered on and after January 28, 2009, for usage on and after December 19,
2008.  In addition, the existing recovery mechanism for incremental
purchased power capacity costs ceased as of January 28, 2009, with purchased
power capacity costs then subsumed within the base rates set in this
proceeding.  The agreement adopted by the PUCT also reconciles fuel
and purchased power costs for the period January 1, 2006 through March 31,
2007.  Certain Texas municipalities exercised their original
jurisdiction and took final action to approve rates consistent with the interim
rates approved by the ALJs.  In March 2009, the PUCT approved the
settlement, which made the interim rates final.

Transition
to Competition Costs

In August
2005, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT an application for recovery of its
transition to competition costs.  Entergy Texas requested recovery of
$189 million in transition to competition costs through implementation of a
15-year rider.  The $189 million represents transition to competition
costs Entergy Texas incurred from June 1, 1999 through June 17, 2005 in
preparing for the potential of competition in its Texas service area, including
attendant AFUDC, and all carrying costs projected to be incurred on the
transition to competition costs through February 28, 2006.  The $189
million is before any gross-up for taxes or carrying costs over the 15-year
recovery period.  Entergy Texas reached a unanimous settlement
agreement, which the PUCT approved in June 2006, on all issues with the active
parties in the transition to competition cost recovery case.  The
agreement allows Entergy Texas to recover $14.5 million per year in transition
to competition costs over a 15-year period.  Entergy Texas implemented
rates based on this revenue level on March 1, 2006.

Formula Rate Plans

(Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana)

In March 2005, the LPSC approved a
settlement proposal to resolve various dockets covering a range of issues for
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana.  The settlement
included the establishment of a three-year formula rate plan for Entergy Gulf
States Louisiana that, among other provisions, establishes a return on common
equity mid-point of 10.65% for the initial three-year term of the plan and
permits Entergy Gulf States Louisiana to recover incremental capacity costs
outside of a traditional base rate proceeding.  Under the formula rate
plan, over- and under-earnings outside an allowed range of 9.9% to 11.4% are
allocated 60% to customers and 40% to Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana made its initial formula
rate plan filing in June 2005.  The formula rate plan was subsequently
extended one year.

Entergy Louisiana made a rate filing
with the LPSC requesting a base rate increase in January 2004.  In May
2005 the LPSC approved a settlement that included the adoption of a three-year
formula rate plan, the terms of which included an ROE mid-point of 10.25% for
the initial three-year term of the plan and permit Entergy Louisiana to recover
incremental capacity costs outside of a traditional base rate
proceeding.  Under the formula rate plan, over- and under-earnings
outside an allowed regulatory range of 9.45% to 11.05% will be allocated 60% to
customers and 40% to Entergy Louisiana.  The initial formula rate plan
filing was made in May 2006.

In October 2009 the LPSC approved a
settlement that resolves Entergy Louisiana's 2006 and 2007 test year
filings.  The settlement provides for a new formula rate plan for the
2008, 2009, and 2010 test years.  Entergy Louisiana is permitted,
effective with the November 2009 billing cycle, to reset its rates to achieve a
10.25% return on equity for the 2008 test year.  10.25% is the target
midpoint return on equity for the new formula rate plan, with an earnings
bandwidth of +/- 80 basis points (9.45% - 11.05%).  The rate reset, a
$2.5 million increase that includes a $16.3 million cost of service adjustment
less a $13.8 million net reduction for decreased capacity costs and a base rate
reclassification, was implemented for the November 2009 billing cycle, and the
rate reset will be subject to refund pending review of the 2008 test year filing
that was made on October 21, 2009.  The settlement does not allow
recovery through the formula rate plan of most of Entergy Louisiana's costs
associated with Entergy's stock option plan.  Pursuant to the
settlement Entergy Louisiana refunded to its customers $12.9 million, which
includes interest, in the November 2009 billing cycle.  The LPSC Staff
and one intervenor filed comments on the 2008 test year filing in January
2010.  Entergy Louisiana has until March 2010 to provide an initial
response to the proposed adjustments and discovery is
ongoing.  Entergy Louisiana will implement any agreed changes by March
15, 2010.  A procedural schedule to address any contested issues would
be set after March 15, 2010.

In
December 2009, Entergy Louisiana filed an application seeking LPSC approval for
a $10.3 million revenue requirement to provide supplemental funding for the
decommissioning trust maintained for Waterford 3, in response to an NRC
notification of a projected shortfall of decommissioning funding
assurance.  Currently, Entergy Louisiana has $2.2 million in annual
retail rates for decommissioning funding.

In May 2008, Entergy Louisiana made its
formula rate plan filing with the LPSC for the 2007 test year, seeking an $18.4
million rate increase, comprised of $12.6 million of recovery of incremental and
deferred capacity costs and $5.8 million based on a cost of service revenue
deficiency related to continued lost contribution to fixed costs associated with
the loss of customers due to Hurricane Katrina.  In August 2008,
Entergy Louisiana implemented a $43.9 million formula rate plan decrease to
remove interim storm cost recovery and to reduce the storm damage
accrual.  Entergy Louisiana then implemented a $16.9 million formula
rate plan increase, subject to refund, effective the first billing cycle in
September 2008, comprised of $12.6 million of recovery of incremental and
deferred capacity costs and $4.3 million based on a cost of service
deficiency.

In May 2007, Entergy Louisiana made its
formula rate plan filing with the LPSC for the 2006 test year, indicating a 7.6%
earned return on common equity.  In September 2007, Entergy Louisiana
modified its formula rate plan filing to reflect its implementation of certain
adjustments proposed by the LPSC Staff in its review of Entergy Louisiana's
original filing with which Entergy Louisiana agreed, and to reflect its
implementation of an $18.4 million annual formula rate plan increase comprised
of (1) a $23.8 million increase representing 60% of Entergy Louisiana's revenue
deficiency, and (2) a $5.4 million decrease for reduced incremental and deferred
capacity costs.  In October 2007, Entergy Louisiana implemented a $7.1
million formula rate plan decrease that was due primarily to the
reclassification of certain franchise fees from base rates to collection via a
line item on customer bills pursuant to an LPSC Order.

In May
2006, Entergy Louisiana made its formula rate plan filing with the LPSC for the
2005 test year.  Entergy Louisiana modified the filing in August 2006
to reflect a 9.45% return on equity which is within the allowed
bandwidth.  The modified filing includes an increase of $24.2 million
for interim recovery of storm costs from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and a
$119.2 million rate increase to recover LPSC-approved incremental deferred and
ongoing capacity costs.  The filing requested recovery of
approximately $50 million for the amortization of capacity deferrals over a
three-year period, including carrying charges, and approximately $70 million for
ongoing capacity costs.  The increase was implemented, subject to
refund, with the first billing cycle of September 2006.  Entergy
Louisiana subsequently updated its formula rate plan rider to reflect
adjustments proposed by the LPSC Staff with which it agrees.  The
adjusted return on equity of 9.56% remains within the allowed
bandwidth.  Ongoing and deferred incremental capacity costs were
reduced to $118.7 million.  The

updated
formula rate plan rider was implemented, subject to refund, with the first
billing cycle of October 2006.  An uncontested stipulated settlement
was filed in February 2008 that left the current base rates in place, and the
LPSC approved the settlement in March 2008.  In the settlement Entergy
Louisiana agreed to credit customers $7.2 million, plus $0.7 million of
interest, for customer contributions to the Central States Compact in Nebraska
that was never completed and agreed to a one-time $2.6 million deduction from
the deferred capacity cost balance.  The credit, for which Entergy
Louisiana had previously recorded a provision, was made in May
2008.

(Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana)

In
October 2009 the LPSC approved a settlement that resolves Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana's 2007 test year filing.  The settlement provides for a new
formula rate plan for the 2008, 2009, and 2010 test years.  Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana is permitted, effective with the November 2009 billing
cycle, to reset its rates to achieve a 10.65% return on equity for the 2008 test
year.  10.65% is the target midpoint return on equity for the new
formula rate plan, with an earnings bandwidth of +/- 75 basis points (9.90% -
11.40%).  The rate reset, a $44.3 million increase that includes a
$36.9 million cost of service adjustment, plus $7.4 million net for increased
capacity costs and a base rate reclassification, was implemented for the
November 2009 billing cycle, and the rate reset will be subject to refund
pending review of the 2008 test year filing that was made on October 21,
2009.  The settlement does not allow recovery through the formula rate
plan of most of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's costs associated with Entergy's
stock option plan.  Pursuant to the settlement Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana refunded to its customers $3.7 million, which includes interest, in
the November 2009 billing cycle.  In January 2010, Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana implemented an additional $23.9 million rate increase pursuant to a
special rate implementation filing made in December 2009, primarily for
incremental capacity costs approved by the LPSC.  The discovery and
comment period for the 2008 test year filing is currently open, and Entergy Gulf
States Louisiana will implement any agreed changes by March 15,
2010.  A procedural schedule to address any contested issues would be
set after March 15, 2010.

In
December 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed an application seeking LPSC
approval for a $9.7 million revenue requirement to provide supplemental
funding for the decommissioning trust maintained for the LPSC-regulated 70%
share of River Bend, in response to an NRC notification of a projected shortfall
of decommissioning funding assurance.  Currently, Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana's annual retail rates contain no amount for decommissioning
funding.

In May
2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana made its formula rate plan filing with the
LPSC for the 2007 test year.  The filing reflected a 9.26% return on
common equity, which was below the allowed earnings bandwidth, and indicated a
$5.4 million revenue deficiency, offset by a $4.1 million decrease in required
additional capacity costs.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana implemented
a $20.7 million formula rate plan decrease, subject to refund, effective the
first billing cycle in September 2008.  The decrease included removal
of interim storm cost recovery and a reduction in the storm damage
accrual.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana then implemented a $16.0
million formula rate plan increase, subject to refund, effective the first
billing cycle in October 2008 to collect previously deferred and ongoing costs
associated with LPSC approved additional capacity, including the Ouachita power
plant.  In November 2008 Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed to
implement an additional increase of $9.3 million to recover the costs of a new
purchased power agreement.


Entergy
Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to
Financial Statements

In May
2007, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana made its formula rate plan filing with the
LPSC for the 2006 test year.  The filing reflected a 10.0% return on
common equity, which was within the allowed earnings bandwidth, and an
anticipated formula rate plan decrease of $23 million annually attributable to
adjustments outside of the formula rate plan sharing mechanism related to
capacity costs and the anticipated securitization of storm costs related to
Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita and the securitization of a storm
reserve.  In September 2007, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana modified
the formula rate plan filing to reflect a 10.07% return on common equity, which
was still within the allowed bandwidth.  The modified filing also
reflected implementation of a $4.1 million rate increase, subject to refund,
attributable to recovery of additional LPSC-approved incremental deferred and
ongoing capacity costs.  The rate decrease anticipated in the original
filing did not occur because of the additional capacity costs approved by the
LPSC, and because securitization of storm costs associated with Hurricane
Katrina and Hurricane Rita and the establishment of a storm reserve had not yet
occurred.  In October 2007, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana implemented
a $16.4 million formula rate plan decrease that was due to the reclassification
of certain franchise fees from base rates to collection via a line item on
customer bills pursuant to an LPSC order.  In March 2008 the LPSC
approved an uncontested stipulated settlement that left the current base rates
in place and extended the formula rate plan for one year.

In May
2006, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana made its formula rate plan filing with the
LPSC for the 2005 test year.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana modified
the filing in August 2006 to reflect an 11.1% return on common equity which is
within the allowed bandwidth.  The modified filing includes a formula
rate plan increase of $17.2 million annually that provides for 1) interim
recovery of $10.5 million of storm costs from Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane
Rita and 2) recovery of $6.7 million of LPSC-approved incremental deferred and
ongoing capacity costs.  The increase was implemented with the first
billing cycle of September 2006.  In May 2007 the LPSC approved a
settlement between Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and the LPSC staff, affirming
the rates that were implemented in September 2006.

Retail Rates -
Gas

(Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana)

In January 2010, Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana filed with the LPSC its gas rate stabilization plan for the test year
ended September 30, 2009.  The filing showed an earned return on common
equity of 10.87%, which is within the earnings bandwidth of 10.5% plus or minus
fifty basis points.  The sixty day review and comment period for this
filing remains open.

In
January 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed with the LPSC its gas rate
stabilization plan for the test year ended September 30, 2008.  The filing
showed a revenue deficiency of $529 thousand based on a return on common equity
mid-point of 10.5%.  In April 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana
implemented a $255 thousand rate increase pursuant to an uncontested settlement
with the LPSC staff.

In
January 2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed with the LPSC its gas rate
stabilization plan for the test year ending September 30, 2007.  The filing
showed a revenue deficiency of $3.7 million based on a return on common equity
mid-point of 10.5%.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana implemented a $3.4
million rate increase in April 2008 pursuant to an uncontested agreement with
the LPSC staff.

In
January 2007, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed with the LPSC its gas rate
stabilization plan for the test year ending September 30, 2006.  The filing
showed a revenue deficiency of $3.5 million based on a return on common equity
mid-point of 10.5%.  In March 2007, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed a
set of rate and rider schedules that reflected all proposed LPSC staff
adjustments and implemented a $2.4 million base rate increase effective with the
first billing cycle of April 2007 pursuant to the rate stabilization
plan.

Filings
with the MPSC (Entergy Mississippi)

Formula Rate Plan
Filings

In
September 2009, Entergy Mississippi filed proposed modifications to its formula
rate plan rider.  The proposed modifications include: (1) resetting
Entergy Mississippi's return on common equity to the middle of the formula rate
plan bandwidth each year and eliminating the 50/50 sharing in the current plan,
(2) replacing the current rate change limit of two percent of revenues subject
to a $14.5 million revenue adjustment cap with a proposed limit of four percent
of revenues, (3) implementing a projected test year for the annual filing and
subsequent look-back for the prior year, and (4) modifying the performance
measurement process.

In March
2009, Entergy Mississippi made with the MPSC its annual scheduled formula rate
plan filing for the 2008 test year.  The filing reported a $27.0 million
revenue deficiency and an earned return on common equity of
7.41%.  Entergy Mississippi requested a $14.5 million increase in
annual electric revenues, which is the maximum increase allowed under the terms
of the formula rate plan.  The MPSC issued an order on June 30, 2009,
finding that Entergy Mississippi's earned return was sufficiently below the
lower bandwidth limit set by the formula rate plan to require a $14.5 million
increase in annual revenues, effective for bills rendered on or after June 30,
2009.

In March
2008, Entergy Mississippi made its annual scheduled formula rate plan filing for
the 2007 test year with the MPSC.  The filing showed that a $10.1
million increase in annual electric revenues is warranted.  In
June 2008, Entergy Mississippi reached a settlement with the Mississippi
Public Utilities Staff that would result in a $3.8 million rate
increase.  In January 2009 the MPSC rejected the settlement and left
the current rates in effect.  Entergy Mississippi appealed the MPSC's
decision to the Mississippi Supreme Court.  After the decision of the
MPSC regarding the formula rate plan filing for the 2008 test year, Entergy
Mississippi filed a motion to dismiss its appeal to the Mississippi Supreme
Court.

In March 2007, Entergy Mississippi made
its annual scheduled formula rate plan filing for the 2006 test year with the
MPSC.  The filing showed that an increase of $12.9 million in
annual electric revenues is warranted.  In June 2007 the MPSC approved
a joint stipulation between Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public
Utilities staff that provides for a $10.5 million rate increase, which was
effective beginning with July 2007 billings.

Filings
with the City Council (Entergy New Orleans)

Formula Rate Plans and
Storm-related Riders

On July 31, 2008, Entergy New Orleans
filed an electric and gas base rate case with the City Council.  On
April 2, 2009, the City Council approved a comprehensive
settlement.  The settlement provided for a net $35.3 million reduction
in combined fuel and non-fuel electric revenue requirement, including conversion
of the $10.6 million voluntary recovery credit to a permanent reduction and
substantial realignment of Grand Gulf cost recovery from fuel to electric base
rates, and a $4.95 million gas base rate increase, both effective June 1, 2009,
with adjustment of the customer charges for all rate classes.  A new
three-year formula rate plan was also adopted, with terms including an 11.1%
benchmark electric return on common equity (ROE) with a +/- 40 basis point
bandwidth and a 10.75% benchmark gas ROE with a +/- 50 basis point
bandwidth.  Earnings outside the bandwidth reset to the midpoint
benchmark ROE, with rates changing on a prospective basis depending on whether
Entergy New Orleans is over- or under-earning.  The formula rate plan
also includes a recovery mechanism for City Council-approved capacity additions,
plus provisions for extraordinary cost changes and force majeure
events.

The rate case settlement also included
$3.1 million per year in electric rates to fund the Energy Smart energy
efficiency programs.  In September 2009 the City Council approved the
energy efficiency programs filed by Entergy New Orleans.  The rate
settlement provides an incentive for Entergy New Orleans to meet or exceed
energy savings targets set by the City Council and provides a mechanism for
Entergy New Orleans to recover lost contribution to fixed costs associated with
the energy savings generated from the energy efficiency programs.  The
programs are expected to begin in 2010.


Entergy
Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to
Financial Statements

In June 2006, Entergy New Orleans made
its annual formula rate plan filings with the City Council.  The filings
presented various alternatives to reflect the effect of Entergy New Orleans'
lost customers and decreased revenue following Hurricane Katrina.  The
alternative that Entergy New Orleans recommended adjusts for lost customers and
assumes that the City Council's June 2006 decision to allow recovery of all
Grand Gulf costs through the fuel adjustment clause stays in place during the
rate-effective period (a significant portion of Grand Gulf costs was previously
recovered through base rates).

At the same time as it made its formula
rate plan filings, Entergy New Orleans also filed with the City Council a
request to implement two storm-related riders.  With the first rider,
Entergy New Orleans sought to recover the electric and gas restoration costs
that it had actually spent through March 31, 2006.  Entergy New
Orleans also proposed semiannual filings to update the rider for additional
restoration spending and also to consider the receipt of CDBG funds or insurance
proceeds that it may receive.  With the second rider, Entergy New
Orleans sought to establish a storm reserve to provide for the risk of another
storm.

In October 2006, the City Council
approved a settlement agreement that resolved Entergy New Orleans' rate and
storm-related rider filings by providing for phased-in rate increases, while
taking into account with respect to storm restoration costs the anticipated
receipt of CDBG funding as recommended by the Louisiana Recovery
Authority.  The settlement provided for a 0% increase in electric base
rates through December 2007, with a $3.9 million increase implemented in January
2008.  Recovery of all Grand Gulf costs through the fuel adjustment
clause was continued.  Gas base rates increased by $4.75 million in
November 2006 and increased by additional $1.5 million in March 2007 and an
additional $4.75 million in November 2007.  The settlement called for
Entergy New Orleans to file a base rate case by July 31, 2008, which it did as
discussed above.  The settlement agreement discontinued the formula
rate plan and the generation performance-based plan but permitted Entergy New
Orleans to file an application to seek authority to implement formula rate plan
mechanisms no sooner than six months following the effective date of the
implementation of the base rates resulting from the July 31, 2008 base rate
case.  The settlement also authorized a $75 million storm reserve for
damage from future storms, which will be created over a ten-year period through
a storm reserve rider beginning in March 2007.  These storm reserve
funds will be held in a restricted escrow account.

In January 2008, Entergy New Orleans
voluntarily implemented a 6.15% base rate credit (the recovery credit) for
electric customers, which returned approximately $11.3 million to electric
customers in 2008.  Entergy New Orleans was able to implement this
credit because during 2007 the recovery of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina
was occurring faster than expected in 2006 projections.  In addition,
Entergy New Orleans committed to set aside $2.5 million for an energy efficiency
program focused on community education and outreach and weatherization of
homes.

Fuel Adjustment Clause
Litigation

In April
1999, a group of ratepayers filed a complaint against Entergy New Orleans,
Entergy Corporation, Entergy Services, and Entergy Power in state court in
Orleans Parish purportedly on behalf of all Entergy New Orleans
ratepayers.  The plaintiffs seek treble damages for alleged injuries
arising from the defendants' alleged violations of Louisiana's antitrust laws in
connection with certain costs passed on to ratepayers in Entergy New Orleans'
fuel adjustment filings with the City Council.  In particular,
plaintiffs allege that Entergy New Orleans improperly included certain costs in
the calculation of fuel charges and that Entergy New Orleans imprudently
purchased high-cost fuel or energy from other Entergy
affiliates.  Plaintiffs allege that Entergy New Orleans and the other
defendant Entergy companies conspired to make these purchases to the detriment
of Entergy New Orleans' ratepayers and to the benefit of Entergy's shareholders,
in violation of Louisiana's antitrust laws.  Plaintiffs also seek to
recover interest and attorneys' fees.  Entergy filed exceptions to the
plaintiffs' allegations, asserting, among other things, that jurisdiction over
these issues rests with the City Council and the FERC.  In March 2004,
the plaintiffs supplemented and amended their petition.  If necessary,
at the appropriate time, Entergy will also raise its defenses to the antitrust
claims.  The suit in state court was stayed by stipulation of the
parties and order of the court pending review of the decision by the City
Council in the proceeding discussed in the next paragraph.


Entergy
Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to
Financial Statements

Plaintiffs
also filed a corresponding complaint with the City Council in order to initiate
a review by the City Council of the plaintiffs' allegations and to force
restitution to ratepayers of all costs they allege were improperly and
imprudently included in the fuel adjustment filings.  Testimony was
filed on behalf of the plaintiffs in this proceeding asserting, among other
things, that Entergy New Orleans and other defendants have engaged in fuel
procurement and power purchasing practices and included costs in Entergy New
Orleans' fuel adjustment that could have resulted in Entergy New Orleans
customers being overcharged by more than $100 million over a period of years.
Hearings were held in February and March 2002.  In February 2004, the
City Council approved a resolution that resulted in a refund to customers of
$11.3 million, including interest, during the months of June through September
2004.  In May 2005 the Civil District Court for the Parish of
Orleans affirmed the City Council resolution, finding no support for the
plaintiffs' claim that the refund amount should be higher.  In
June 2005, the plaintiffs appealed the Civil District Court decision to the
Louisiana Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal.  On February 25, 2008, the
Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal issued a decision affirming in part, and
reversing in part, the Civil District Court's decision.  Although the
Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal did not reverse any of the substantive findings
and conclusions of the City Council or the Civil District Court, the Fourth
Circuit found that the amount of the refund was arbitrary and capricious and
increased the amount of the refund to $34.3 million.  Entergy New Orleans
and the City Council filed with the Louisiana Supreme Court seeking, among other
things, review and reversal of the Fourth Circuit decision.  In April
2009 the Louisiana Supreme Court reversed the decision of the Louisiana Fourth
Circuit Court of Appeal and reinstated the decision of the Civil District
Court.  In May 2009 the Louisiana Supreme Court denied the plaintiffs'
request for rehearing.  In January 2010 the plaintiffs filed a motion
to lift the stay and to supplement and amend their state court
petition.

In the
Entergy New Orleans bankruptcy proceeding, the named plaintiffs in the Entergy
New Orleans fuel clause lawsuit, together with the named plaintiffs in the
Entergy New Orleans rate of return lawsuit, filed a Complaint for Declaratory
Judgment asking the court to declare that Entergy New Orleans, Entergy
Corporation, and Entergy Services are a single business enterprise, and, as
such, are liable in solido with Entergy New Orleans for any claims asserted in
the Entergy New Orleans fuel adjustment clause lawsuit and the Entergy New
Orleans rate of return lawsuit, and, alternatively, that the automatic stay be
lifted to permit the movants to pursue the same relief in state court.  The
bankruptcy court dismissed the action on April 26, 2006.  The matter
was appealed to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana,
and the district court affirmed the dismissal in October 2006, but on different
grounds, concluding that the lawsuit was premature.  In Entergy New
Orleans' plan of reorganization that was confirmed by the bankruptcy court in
May 2007, the plaintiffs' claims are treated as unimpaired "Litigation Claims,"
which will "ride through" the bankruptcy proceeding, with any legal, equitable
and contractual rights to which the plaintiffs' Litigation Claim entitles the
plaintiffs unaltered by the plan of reorganization.

Electric Industry
Restructuring

(Entergy Texas)

In June
2009, a law was enacted in Texas that requires Entergy Texas to cease all
activities relating to Entergy Texas' transition to competition.  The
law allows Entergy Texas to remain a part of the SERC Region, although it does
not prevent Entergy Texas from joining the Southwest Power Pool.  The
law provides that proceedings to certify a power region that Entergy Texas
belongs to as a qualified power region can be initiated by the PUCT, or on
motion by another party, when the conditions supporting such a proceeding
exist.  Under the new law, the PUCT may not approve a transition to
competition plan for Entergy Texas until the expiration of four years from the
PUCT's certification of Entergy Texas' power region.  In response to
the new law, Entergy Texas in June 2009 gave notice to the PUCT of the
withdrawal of its previously filed transition to competition plan, and requested
that its transition to competition proceeding be dismissed.  In July
2009 the ALJ dismissed the proceeding.

The new
law also contains provisions that allow Entergy Texas to be included in a cost
recovery mechanism that permits annual filings for the recovery of reasonable
and necessary expenditures for transmission infrastructure improvement and
changes in wholesale transmission charges.  This mechanism was
previously available to other non-ERCOT Texas utility companies, but not to
Entergy Texas.

Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to
Financial Statements

The new
law further amends already existing law that had required Entergy Texas to
propose for PUCT approval a tariff to allow eligible customers the ability to
contract for competitive generation.  The amending language in the new
law provides, among other things, that:  1) the tariff shall not be
implemented in a manner that harms the sustainability or competitiveness of
manufacturers who choose not to participate in the tariff; 2) Entergy Texas
shall "purchase competitive generation service, selected by the customer, and
provide the generation at retail to the customer"; and 3)  Entergy
Texas shall provide and price transmission service and ancillary services under
that tariff at a rate that is unbundled from its cost of
service.    The new law directs that the PUCT may not issue
an order on the tariff that is contrary to an applicable decision, rule, or
policy statement of a federal regulatory agency having
jurisdiction.  The new law provides that the PUCT shall approve,
reject, or modify the proposed tariff not later than September 1,
2010.

Interruptible
Load Proceeding

(Entergy
Louisiana)

The FERC issued orders in
September 2005 and 2007 in which it directed Entergy to remove all interruptible
load from certain computations of peak load responsibility commencing April 1,
2004 and to issue any necessary refunds to reflect this change.  In
addition, in September 2008 the FERC directed the Utility operating companies to
make refunds for the period May 1995 through July 1996.  In October
2009, the LPSC issued an order approving the flow through to retail rates of the
LPSC-jurisdictional portion of the payments and credits resulting from the
FERC's orders that had not yet been flowed through to retail rates, which
required a net refund to Entergy Louisiana retail customers of $17.6 million,
including interest.  Of this amount, $5.4 million was refunded subject
to adjustment in the event that future action by the FERC or the D.C. Circuit
Court of Appeals results in a reversal or change in the amount of the refunds
ordered by the FERC in September 2008.

Co-Owner-Initiated
Proceeding at the FERC

(Entergy Arkansas)

In October 2004, Arkansas Electric
Cooperative Corporation (AECC) filed a complaint at the FERC against Entergy
Arkansas relating to a contract dispute over the pricing of substitute energy at
the co-owned Independence and White Bluff coal plants.  The main issue
in the case related to the consequences under the governing contracts when the
dispatch of the coal units is constrained due to system operating
conditions.  A hearing was held on the AECC complaint and an ALJ Initial
Decision was issued in January 2006 in which the ALJ found AECC's claims to be
without merit.  On October 25, 2006, the FERC issued its order in the
proceeding.  In the order, the FERC reversed the ALJ's
findings.  Specifically, the FERC found that the governing contracts
do not recognize the effects of dispatch constraints on the co-owned
units.  The FERC explained that for over twenty-three years the course
of conduct of the parties was such that AECC received its full entitlement to
the two coal units, regardless of any reduced output caused by system operating
constraints.  Based on the order, Entergy Arkansas is required to
refund to AECC all excess amounts billed to AECC as a result of the system
operating constraints.  The FERC denied Entergy Arkansas' request for
rehearing and Entergy Arkansas refunded $22.1 million (including interest) to
AECC in September 2007.  Entergy Arkansas had previously recorded a
provision for the estimated effect of this refund.  In January 2010
the FERC issued an order conditionally accepting the refund report and ordering
further refunds, noting that the refund period should have included the period
July 1, 2004 through December 23, 2004.  Entergy Arkansas had
previously recorded a provision for the estimated effect of this
refund.

In
December 2009 an Entergy subsidiary sold Class B preferred shares to a third
party for $2.1 million.  The sale resulted in a capital loss for tax
purposes of $73.1 million, providing a federal and state net tax benefit of
approximately $28 million that Entergy recorded in the fourth quarter
2009.  This amount is included in capital losses in the table
above.

Total
income taxes for the Registrant Subsidiaries differ from the amounts computed by
applying the statutory income tax rate to income before taxes.  The
reasons for the differences for the years 2009, 2008, and 2007 are:

The flow-through/permanent difference
for Entergy Louisiana relates to the exclusion of dividend income from its
preferred membership interest in Entergy Holdings Company, LLC as well as the
flow-through of the equity component of AFUDC.

The
flow-through/permanent differences for Entergy Arkansas in 2008 result from the
write-off of regulatory assets associated with storm reserve costs, lease
termination removal costs, and stock-based compensation which are no longer
probable of recovery.  The flow-through/permanent differences for
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana in 2008 result mainly from regulatory and tax
accounting applied to its pension payments.

Notes to
Financial Statements

As a result of the accounting for
uncertain tax positions, the amount of the deferred tax assets reflected in the
financial statements is less than the amount of the tax effect of the federal
and state net operating loss carryovers, tax credit carryovers, and other tax
attributes reflected on income tax returns.  The deferred tax assets
recorded on the operating and capital loss carryovers are approximately $149.6
million and $45.8 million, respectively.

Because it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain state net
operating loss carryovers will not be utilized, a valuation allowance of $47
million on the deferred tax assets relating to these state net operating loss
carryovers has been provided.

Significant
components of accumulated deferred income taxes and taxes accrued for the

Unrecognized tax
benefits

Accounting standards establish a
"more-likely-than-not" recognition threshold that must be met before a tax
benefit can be recognized in the financial statements.  If a tax
deduction is taken on a tax return, but does not meet the more-likely-than-not
recognition threshold, an increase in income tax liability, above what is
payable on the tax return, is required to be recorded.  A
reconciliation of Entergy's beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax
benefits is as follows:

The
balances of unrecognized tax benefits include $522 million, $543 million, and
$242 million as of December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, which, if
recognized, would lower the effective income tax rates.  Because of
the effect of deferred tax accounting, the remaining balances of unrecognized
tax benefits of $3.53 billion, $1.28 billion, and $1.88 billion as of December
31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 respectively, if disallowed, would not affect the annual
effective income tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing
authority to an earlier period.  Entergy accrues interest and
penalties expenses related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax
expense.  Entergy's December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 balance of
unrecognized tax benefits includes approximately $48 million, $55 million, and
$50 million, respectively, accrued for the possible payment of interest and
penalties.

Entergy
has deposits of $373 million on account with the IRS to cover its uncertain tax
positions.

Notes to
Financial Statements

Entergy
and the Registrant Subsidiaries do not expect that total unrecognized tax
benefits will significantly change within the next twelve months; however, the
results of pending litigations and audit issues, discussed below, could result
in significant changes.

Income Tax
Litigation

For tax
years 1997 and 1998, a U.S. Tax Court trial was held in April
2008.  The issues before the Court are as follows:

·

The
      ability to credit the U.K. Windfall Tax against U.S. tax as a foreign tax
      credit.  The U.K. Windfall Tax relates to Entergy's former
      investment in London Electricity.

·

The
      validity of Entergy's change in method of tax accounting for street
      lighting assets and the related increase in depreciation
      deductions.

On November 20,
2009, Entergy was directed by the Tax Court to submit a supplement to previously
filed supplemental briefs addressing the issues in dispute.  A
decision is anticipated by the first or second quarter 2010.

On
February 21, 2008, the IRS issued a Statutory Notice of Deficiency for the year
2000.  A Tax Court Petition was filed on May 5, 2008.  Trial
is set for April 17, 2010.  The Petition challenges the IRS assessment
on the same two issues described above as well as the following
issue:

·

The
      allowance of depreciation deductions that resulted from Entergy's purchase
      price allocations on its acquisitions of its Non-Utility Nuclear
      plants.

With
respect to the U.K. Windfall Tax issue, the total tax included in IRS Notices of
Deficiency is $82 million.  The total tax and interest associated with
this issue for all years is $209 million before consideration of cash deposits
made with the IRS to offset the potential exposure.

With
respect to the street lighting issue, the total tax included in IRS Notices of
Deficiency is $22 million.  The federal and state tax and interest
associated with this issue total $61 million for all open tax
years.

With
respect to the depreciation deducted on Non-Utility Nuclear plant acquisitions,
the total tax included in IRS Notices of Deficiency is $7
million.  The federal and state tax and interest associated with this
issue total $270 million for all open tax years.

Income Tax
Audits

Entergy or one of its subsidiaries
files U.S. federal and various state and foreign income tax
returns.  Other than the matters discussed in the Income Tax
Litigation section above, the IRS's and substantially all state taxing
authorities' examinations are completed for years before 2004.

2002-2003
IRS Audit

In
September 2009, Entergy entered into a partial agreement with the IRS for the
years 2002 and 2003.  It is a partial agreement because Entergy did
not agree to the IRS's adjustments for the U.K. Windfall Tax foreign tax credit
and the street lighting issues.  Entergy expects to receive a Notice
of Deficiency from the IRS on these two issues in the first quarter
2010.  These issues will be governed by the outcome of a previous U.S.
Tax Court trial for the tax years 1997 and 1998 for which Entergy is awaiting a
decision.

2004-2005
IRS Audit

The IRS issued its 2004-2005 Revenue
Agent's Report on May 26, 2009.

On June 25, 2009 Entergy filed a formal
Protest with the IRS Appeals Office indicating disagreement with certain issues
contained in the Revenue Agent’s Report.  The major issues in dispute
are:

·

Depreciation
      of street lighting assets (issue before the Tax
  Court)

·

Depreciable
      basis of assets acquired in Non-Utility Nuclear plant purchases (issue
      before the Tax Court)

·

Qualified
      research expenditures for purposes of the research
  credit

·

Inclusion
      of nuclear decommissioning liabilities in cost of goods
    sold

It is
anticipated that IRS Appeals proceedings on these disputed issues will commence
in the second quarter of 2010.

2006-2007
IRS Audit

The IRS commenced an examination of
Entergy's 2006 and 2007 U.S. federal income tax returns in the third quarter
2009.  To date, the IRS has not proposed any adjustments in the audit
of these returns.

Other Tax
Matters

When Entergy Louisiana, Inc.
restructured effective December 31, 2005, Entergy Louisiana agreed, under the
terms of the merger plan, to indemnify its parent, Entergy Louisiana Holdings,
Inc. (formerly, Entergy Louisiana, Inc.) for certain tax obligations that arose
from the 2002-2003 IRS partial agreement.  Because the agreement with
the IRS was settled in the fourth quarter 2009, Entergy Louisiana paid Entergy
Louisiana Holdings approximately $289 million pursuant to these intercompany
obligations in the fourth quarter 2009.

On November 20, 2009, Entergy
Corporation and subsidiaries amended the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary
Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement such that Entergy
Corporation shall be treated, under all provisions of such Agreement, in a
manner that is identical to the treatment afforded all subsidiaries, direct or
indirect, of Entergy Corporation.

In the fourth quarter 2009, Entergy
filed Applications for Change in Method of Accounting for certain costs under
Section 263A of the Internal Revenue Code.  In the Application,
Entergy is requesting permission to treat the nuclear decommissioning liability
associated with the operation of its nuclear power plants as a production cost
properly includable in cost of goods sold.  The effect of this change
for Entergy is a $5.7 billion reduction in 2009 taxable income within
Non-Utility Nuclear.

CREDIT FACILITIES, LINES OF CREDIT AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS (Entergy
Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana,
Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System
Energy)

Entergy Corporation has a revolving
credit facility that expires in August 2012 and has a borrowing capacity of $3.5
billion.  Entergy Corporation also has the ability to issue letters of
credit against the total borrowing capacity of the credit
facility.  The facility fee is currently 0.09% of the commitment
amount.  Facility fees and interest rates on loans under the credit
facility can fluctuate depending on the senior unsecured debt ratings of Entergy
Corporation.  The weighted average interest rate for the year ended
December 31, 2009 was 1.377% on the drawn portion of the
facility.  Following is a summary of the borrowings outstanding and
capacity available under the facility as of December 31, 2009.

Entergy
Corporation's facility requires it to maintain a consolidated debt ratio of 65%
or less of its total capitalization.  Entergy is in compliance with
this covenant.  If Entergy fails to meet this ratio, or if Entergy
Corporation or one of the Utility operating companies (except Entergy New
Orleans) defaults on other indebtedness or is in bankruptcy or insolvency
proceedings, an acceleration of the facility maturity date may
occur.

Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy Texas each had
credit facilities available as of December 31, 2009 as follows:

(e)

Borrowings
      under the Entergy Mississippi credit facilities may be secured by a
      security interest in its accounts receivable.  Entergy
      Mississippi is required to maintain a consolidated debt ratio of 65% or
      less of its total capitalization.

(f)

The
      credit facility allows Entergy Texas to issue letters of credit against
      the borrowing capacity of the facility.  As of December 31,
      2009, no letters of credit were outstanding.  The credit
      facility requires Entergy Texas to maintain a consolidated debt ratio of
      65% or less of its total capitalization.  Pursuant to the terms
      of the credit agreement securitization bonds are excluded from debt and
      capitalization in calculating the debt
ratio.

The
facility fees on the credit facilities range from 0.09% to 0.15% of the
commitment amount.

The short-term borrowings of the
Registrant Subsidiaries are limited to amounts authorized by the
FERC.  The current FERC-authorized limits are effective through
October 31, 2011 under a FERC order dated October 14, 2009.  In
addition to borrowings from commercial banks, these companies are authorized
under a FERC order to borrow from the Entergy System money pool.  The
money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the
Utility subsidiaries' dependence on external short-term
borrowings.  Borrowings from the money pool and external borrowings
combined may not exceed the FERC-authorized limits.  The following are
the FERC-authorized limits for short-term borrowings and the outstanding
short-term borrowings as of December 31, 2009 (aggregating both money pool and
external short-term borrowings) for the Registrant Subsidiaries:

In
November 2000, Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear business purchased the FitzPatrick
and Indian Point 3 power plants in a seller-financed
transaction.  Entergy issued notes to NYPA with seven annual
installments of approximately $108 million commencing one year from the date of
the closing, and eight annual installments of $20 million commencing eight years
from the date of the closing.  These notes do not have a stated
interest rate, but have an implicit interest rate of 4.8%.  In
accordance with the purchase agreement with NYPA, the purchase of Indian Point 2
in 2001 resulted in Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear business becoming liable to
NYPA for an additional $10 million per year for 10 years, beginning in
September

Notes to
Financial Statements

2003.  This
liability was recorded upon the purchase of Indian Point 2 in September 2001,
and is included in the note payable to NYPA balance above.  In July
2003, a payment of $102 million was made prior to maturity on the note payable
to NYPA.  Under a provision in a letter of credit supporting these
notes, if certain of the Utility operating companies or System Energy were to
default on other indebtedness, Entergy could be required to post collateral to
support the letter of credit.

Covenants
in the Entergy Corporation notes require it to maintain a consolidated debt
ratio of 65% or less of its total capitalization.  If Entergy's debt
ratio exceeds this limit, or if Entergy Corporation or certain of the Utility
operating companies default on other indebtedness or are in bankruptcy or
insolvency proceedings, an acceleration of the notes' maturity dates may
occur.

Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy Texas,
and System Energy have received FERC long-term financing orders authorizing
long-term securities issuances.  Entergy Arkansas has received an APSC
long-term financing order authorizing long-term securities
issuances.  The long-term securities issuances of Entergy New Orleans
are limited to amounts authorized by the City Council, and the current
authorization extends through August 2010.

Capital Funds
Agreement

Pursuant to an agreement with certain
creditors, Entergy Corporation has agreed to supply System Energy with
sufficient capital to:

·

maintain
      System Energy's equity capital at a minimum of 35% of its total
      capitalization (excluding short-term
debt);

·

permit
      the continued commercial operation of Grand

·

pay
      in full all System Energy indebtedness for borrowed money when due;
      and

·

enable
      System Energy to make payments on specific System Energy debt, under
      supplements to the agreement assigning System Energy's rights in the
      agreement as security for the specific
debt.

Entergy
Texas

Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana remains primarily liable for all of the long-term debt
issued by Entergy Gulf States, Inc. that was outstanding on December 31, 2007
and has not been subsequently repaid.  Under a debt assumption
agreement with Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Texas assumed its pro rata
share of this long-term debt, which was $1.079 billion, or approximately 46%, of
which $168 million remains outstanding at December 31, 2009.  The pro
rata share of the long-term debt assumed by Entergy Texas was determined by
first determining the net assets for each company on a book value basis, and
then calculating a debt assumption ratio that resulted in the common equity
ratios for each company being approximately the same as the Entergy Gulf States,
Inc. common equity ratio immediately prior to the jurisdictional
separation.  Entergy Texas' debt assumption does not discharge Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana's liability for the long-term debt.  To secure
its debt assumption obligations, Entergy Texas granted to Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana a first lien on Entergy Texas' assets that were previously subject to
the Entergy Gulf States, Inc. mortgage.  Entergy Texas has until
December 31, 2010 to repay the assumed debt.  Following is the
long-term debt issued by Entergy Gulf States, Inc. that was outstanding on
December 31, 2009 and 2008 and Entergy Texas' pro rata share of that
debt.  Also included are the mortgage bonds issued by Entergy Texas
and the securitization bonds issued by Entergy Gulf States Reconstruction
Funding and by Entergy Texas Restoration Funding, LLC that are described in

      request that the preferred dividend rate be reset.  If Entergy
      Asset Management and the preferred shareholders are unable to agree on a
      dividend reset rate, a preferred shareholder can request that its shares
      be sold to a third party.  If Entergy Asset Management is unable
      to sell the preferred shares within 75 days, the Class A preferred

Entergy
Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to
Financial Statements

In connection with the adoption of the
new accounting pronouncement regarding non-controlling interests Entergy
evaluated the accounting standards regarding the classification and measurement
of redeemable securities.  These standards require the classification
of securities between liabilities and shareholders' equity on the balance sheet
if the holders of those securities have protective rights that allow them to
gain control of the board of directors in certain
circumstances.  These rights would have the effect of giving the
holders the ability to potentially redeem their securities, even if the
likelihood of occurrence of these circumstances is considered
remote.  The Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New
Orleans articles of incorporation provide, generally, that the holders of each
company's preferred securities may elect a majority of the respective company's
board of directors if dividends are not paid for a year, until such time as the
dividends in arrears are paid.  Therefore, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy
Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans present their preferred securities
outstanding between liabilities and shareholders' equity on the balance sheet as
of December 31, 2009, and are restating the December 31, 2008 amounts presented
in each affected company's financial statements to reflect this same
presentation, which reduces the previously reported total shareholders' equity
amount by $116 million, $50 million and $20 million for Entergy Arkansas,
Entergy Mississippi and Entergy New Orleans, respectively.  The 2007
shareholders' equity for each of the affected companies is restated by the same
respective amount.  This change has no net effect on those companies'
reported amount of total liabilities and equity or any other financial
statements presented or amounts included therein.

Entergy
Corporation reissues treasury shares to meet the requirements of the Stock Plan
for Outside Directors (Directors' Plan), two Equity Ownership Plans of Entergy
Corporation and Subsidiaries, the Equity Awards Plan of Entergy Corporation and
Subsidiaries, and certain other stock benefit plans.  The Directors'
Plan awards to non-employee directors a portion of their compensation in the
form of a fixed number of shares of Entergy Corporation common
stock.

In January 2007, the Board approved a
repurchase program under which Entergy is authorized to repurchase up to $1.5
billion of its common stock.  In January 2008, the Board authorized an
incremental $500 million share repurchase program to enable Entergy to consider
opportunistic purchases in response to equity market
conditions.  Entergy completed both the $1.5 billion and $500 million
programs in the third quarter 2009.  In October 2009, the Board
granted authority for an additional $750 million share repurchase
program.

Dividend Restrictions

Provisions within the articles of
incorporation or pertinent indentures and various other agreements relating to

payments under the contract of approximately $215.6 million in 2009, $167.7
million in 2008, and $130.8 million in 2007.  If the maximum
percentage (94%) of the energy is made available to Entergy Louisiana, current
production projections would require estimated payments of approximately $169.8
million in 2010, and a total of $2.81 billion for the years 2011 through
2031.  Entergy Louisiana currently recovers the costs of the purchased
energy through its fuel adjustment clause.  In an LPSC-approved
settlement related to tax benefits from the tax treatment of the Vidalia
contract, Entergy Louisiana agreed to credit rates by $11 million each year for
up to ten years, beginning in October 2002.  In addition, in
accordance with an LPSC settlement, Entergy Louisiana credited rates in August
2007 by $11.8 million (including interest) as a result of a settlement with
the IRS of the 2001 tax treatment of the Vidalia contract.  The
provisions of the settlement also provide that the LPSC shall not recognize or
use Entergy Louisiana's use of the cash benefits from the tax treatment in
setting any of Entergy Louisiana's rates.  Therefore, to the extent
Entergy Louisiana's use of the proceeds would ordinarily have reduced its rate
base, no change in rate base shall be reflected for ratemaking
purposes.

Nuclear
Insurance

Third
Party Liability Insurance

The
Price-Anderson Act requires that reactor licensees purchase insurance and
participate in a secondary insurance pool that provides insurance coverage for
the public in the event of a nuclear power plant accident.  The costs
of this insurance are borne by the nuclear power industry.  Congress
amended and renewed the Price-Anderson Act in 2005 for a term through
2025.  The Price-Anderson Act requires nuclear power plants to show
evidence of financial protection in the event of a nuclear
accident.  This protection must consist of two layers of
coverage:

1.

The
      primary level is private insurance underwritten by American Nuclear
      Insurers and provides public liability insurance coverage of $375
      million.  If this amount is not sufficient to cover claims
      arising from an accident, the second level, Secondary Financial
      Protection, applies.

2.

Within
      the Secondary Financial Protection level, each nuclear reactor has a
      contingent obligation to pay a retrospective premium, equal to its
      proportionate share of the loss in excess of the primary level, regardless
      of proximity to the incident or fault, up to a maximum of $117.5 million
      per reactor per incident (Entergy's maximum total contingent obligation
      per incident is $1.3 billion).  This consists of a $111.9
      million maximum retrospective premium plus a five percent surcharge, which
      equates to $117.5 million, that may be payable, if needed, at a rate that
      is currently set at $17.5 million per year per nuclear power
      reactor.  A $300 million industry-wide aggregate limit exists
      for domestically-sponsored terrorist acts.  There is no
      aggregate limitation for foreign-sponsored terrorist
  acts.

Currently,
104 nuclear reactors are participating in the Secondary Financial Protection
program.  The product of the maximum retrospective premium assessment
to the nuclear power industry and the number of nuclear power reactors provides
over $12.2 billion in secondary layer insurance coverage to compensate the
public in the event of a nuclear power reactor accident.  The
Price-Anderson Act provides that all potential liability for a nuclear accident
is limited to the amounts of insurance coverage available under the primary and
secondary layers.

Entergy
Arkansas has two licensed reactors and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy
Louisiana, and System Energy each have one licensed reactor (10% of Grand Gulf
is owned by a non-affiliated company (SMEPA) that would share on a pro-rata
basis in any retrospective premium assessment to System Energy under the
Price-Anderson Act).  Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear business owns and
operates six nuclear power reactors and owns the shutdown Indian Point 1 reactor
and Big Rock Point facility.

has its own primary policy with no excess coverage.

In
addition, Waterford 3, Grand Gulf, and the Non-Utility Nuclear plants are also
covered under NEIL's Accidental Outage Coverage program.  This
coverage provides certain fixed indemnities in the event of an unplanned outage
that results from a covered NEIL property damage loss, subject to a deductible
and a waiting period.  The following summarizes this coverage
effective April 1, 2009:

Effective
April 1, 2009, potential assessments for the Non-Utility Nuclear plants are
covered by insurance obtained through NEIL's reinsurers.

Entergy maintains property insurance
for its nuclear units in excess of the NRC's minimum requirement of $1.06
billion per site for nuclear power plant licensees.  NRC regulations
provide that the proceeds of this insurance must be used, first, to render the
reactor safe and stable, and second, to complete decontamination
operations.  Only after proceeds are dedicated for such use and
regulatory approval is secured would any remaining proceeds be made available
for the benefit of plant owners or their creditors.

In the event that one or more acts of
terrorism causes property damage under one or more or all nuclear insurance
policies issued by NEIL (including, but not limited to, those described above)
within 12 months from the date the first property damage occurs, the maximum
recovery under all such nuclear insurance policies shall be an aggregate of
$3.24 billion plus the additional amounts recovered for such losses from
reinsurance, indemnity, and any other sources applicable to such
losses.  The Terrorism Risk Insurance Reauthorization Act of 2007
created a government program that provides for up to $100 billion in coverage in
excess of existing coverage for a terrorist event.

Conventional Property
Insurance

Entergy's
conventional property insurance program provides coverage of up to $400 million
on an Entergy system-wide basis for all operational perils (direct physical loss
or damage due to machinery breakdown, electrical failure, fire, lightning, hail,
or explosion) on an "each and every loss" basis; up to $400 million in coverage
for certain natural perils (direct physical loss or damage due to earthquake,
tsunami, flood, ice storm, and tornado) on an annual aggregate basis; and up to
$125 million for certain other natural perils (direct physical loss or damage
due to a named windstorm or storm surge) on an annual aggregate
basis.  The conventional property insurance program only provides up
to $50 million in coverage for the Entergy New Orleans gas distribution system
on an annual aggregate basis.  The coverage is subject to a $20
million self-insured retention per occurrence for operational perils and a $35
million self-insured retention per occurrence for natural perils and for the
Entergy New Orleans gas distribution system.

Covered
property generally includes power plants, substations, facilities, inventories,
and gas distribution-related properties.  Excluded property generally
includes above-ground transmission and distribution lines, poles, and
towers.  The primary layer consists of a $125 million layer in excess
of the self-insured retention and the excess layer consists of a $275 million
layer in excess of the $125 million primary layer.  Both layers are
placed on a quota share basis through several insurers.  This coverage
is in place for Entergy Corporation, the Registrant Subsidiaries, and certain
other Entergy subsidiaries, including the owners of the Non-Utility Nuclear
power plants.

In addition to the conventional
property insurance program, Entergy has purchased additional coverage ($20
million per occurrence) for some of its non-regulated, non-generation
assets.  This policy serves to buy-down the $20 million
deductible and is placed on a scheduled location basis.  The
applicable deductibles are $100,000 to $250,000, except for properties that are
damaged by flooding and properties whose values are greater than $20 million;
these properties have a $500,000 deductible.

Gas
System Rebuild Insurance Proceeds (Entergy New Orleans)

Entergy New Orleans received insurance
proceeds for future construction expenditures associated with rebuilding its gas
system, and the October 2006 City Council resolution approving the settlement of
Entergy New Orleans' rate and storm-cost recovery filings requires Entergy New
Orleans to record those proceeds in a designated sub-account of other deferred
credits until the proceeds are spent on the rebuild project.  This
other deferred credit is shown as "Gas system rebuild insurance proceeds" on
Entergy New Orleans' balance sheet.

Waterford
3 Lease Obligations

(Entergy
Louisiana)

In 1989, in three separate but
substantially identical transactions, Entergy Louisiana sold and leased back
undivided interests in Waterford 3 for the aggregate sum of $353.6
million.  The interests represent approximately 9.3% of Waterford
3.  Upon the occurrence of certain events, Entergy Louisiana may be
obligated to pay amounts sufficient to permit the termination of the lease
transactions and may be required to assume the outstanding bonds issued to
finance, in part, the lessors' acquisition of the undivided interests in
Waterford 3.

Employment and Labor-related
Proceedings

The Registrant Subsidiaries and other
Entergy subsidiaries are responding to various lawsuits in both state and
federal courts and to other labor-related proceedings filed by current and
former employees and third parties not selected for open
positions.  These actions include, but are not limited to, allegations
of wrongful employment actions; wage disputes and other claims under the Fair
Labor Standards Act or its state counterparts; claims of race, gender and
disability discrimination; disputes arising under collective bargaining
agreements; unfair labor practice proceedings and other administrative
proceedings before the National Labor Relations Board; claims of retaliation;
and claims for or regarding benefits under various Entergy Corporation sponsored
plans. Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries are responding to these suits and
proceedings and deny liability to the claimants.

Asbestos Litigation

(Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy
Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas)

Numerous lawsuits have been filed in
federal and state courts primarily in Texas and Louisiana, primarily by
contractor employees who worked in the 1940-1980s timeframe, against Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas, and to a lesser extent the other
Utility operating companies, as premises owners of power plants, for damages
caused by alleged exposure to asbestos.  Many other defendants are
named in these lawsuits as well.  Currently, there are approximately
500 lawsuits involving approximately 5,000 claimants.  Management
believes that adequate provisions have been established to cover any
exposure.  Additionally, negotiations continue with insurers to
recover reimbursements.  Management believes that loss exposure has
been and will continue to be handled so that the ultimate resolution of these
matters will not be material, in the aggregate, to the financial position,
results of operation, or cash flows of the Utility operating
companies.

Grand Gulf - Related
Agreements

Capital
Funds Agreement (System Energy)

System Energy has entered into
agreements with Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and
Entergy New Orleans whereby they are obligated to purchase their respective
entitlements of capacity and energy from System Energy's current 90% interest in
Grand Gulf, and to make payments that, together with other available funds, are
adequate to cover System Energy's operating expenses.  System Energy
would have to secure funds from other sources, including Entergy Corporation's
obligations under the Capital Funds Agreement, to cover any shortfalls from
payments received from Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi,
and Entergy New Orleans under these agreements.

Unit
Power Sales Agreement (Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi,
Entergy New Orleans, and System Energy)

System Energy has agreed to sell all of
its current 90% share of capacity and energy from Grand Gulf to Entergy
Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans in
accordance with specified percentages (Entergy Arkansas-36%, Entergy
Louisiana-14%, Entergy Mississippi-33%, and Entergy New Orleans-17%) as ordered
by FERC.  Charges under this agreement are paid in consideration for
the purchasing companies' respective entitlement to receive capacity and energy
and are payable irrespective of the quantity of energy delivered so long as the
unit remains in commercial operation.  The agreement will remain in
effect until terminated by the parties and the termination is approved by FERC,
most likely upon Grand Gulf's retirement from service.  Monthly
obligations are based on actual capacity and energy costs.  The
average monthly payments for 2009 under the agreement are approximately $17
million for Entergy Arkansas, $6.8 million for Entergy Louisiana, $14 million
for Entergy Mississippi, and $8.3 million for Entergy New Orleans.

Availability
Agreement (Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New
Orleans, and System Energy)

Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana,
Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans are individually obligated to make
payments or subordinated advances to System Energy in accordance with stated
percentages (Entergy Arkansas-17.1%, Entergy Louisiana-26.9%, Entergy
Mississippi-31.3%, and Entergy New Orleans-24.7%) in amounts that, when added to
amounts received under the Unit Power Sales Agreement or otherwise, are adequate
to cover all of System Energy's operating expenses as defined, including an
amount sufficient to amortize the cost of Grand Gulf 2 over 27 years. (See
Reallocation Agreement terms below.)  System Energy has assigned its
rights to payments and advances to certain creditors as security for certain
obligations.  Since commercial operation of Grand Gulf began, payments
under the Unit Power Sales Agreement have exceeded the amounts payable under the
Availability Agreement.  Accordingly, no payments under the
Availability Agreement have ever been required.  If Entergy Arkansas
or Entergy Mississippi fails to make its Unit Power

Agreement payments, and System Energy is unable to obtain funds from other
sources, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans could become subject to
claims or demands by System Energy or its creditors for payments or advances
under the Availability Agreement (or the assignments thereof) equal to the
difference between their required Unit Power Sales Agreement payments and their
required Availability Agreement payments.

Reallocation
Agreement (Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New
Orleans, and System Energy)

System Energy, Entergy Arkansas,
Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans entered into the
Reallocation Agreement relating to the sale of capacity and energy from Grand
Gulf and the related costs, in which Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and
Entergy New Orleans agreed to assume all of Entergy Arkansas' responsibilities
and obligations with respect to Grand Gulf under the Availability
Agreement.  FERC's decision allocating a portion of Grand Gulf
capacity and energy to Entergy Arkansas supersedes the Reallocation Agreement as
it relates to Grand Gulf.  Responsibility for any Grand Gulf 2
amortization amounts has been individually allocated (Entergy Louisiana-26.23%,
Entergy Mississippi-43.97%, and Entergy New Orleans-29.80%) under the terms of
the Reallocation Agreement.  However, the Reallocation Agreement does
not affect Entergy Arkansas' obligation to System Energy's lenders under the
assignments referred to in the preceding paragraph.  Entergy Arkansas
would be liable for its share of such amounts if Entergy Louisiana, Entergy
Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans were unable to meet their contractual
obligations.  No payments of any amortization amounts will be required
so long as amounts paid to System Energy under the Unit Power Sales Agreement,
including other funds available to System Energy, exceed amounts required under
the Availability Agreement, which is expected to be the case for the foreseeable
future.

Reimbursement
Agreement (System Energy)

In
December 1988, in two separate but substantially identical transactions,
System Energy sold and leased back undivided ownership interests in Grand Gulf
for the aggregate sum of $500 million.  The interests represent
approximately 11.5% of Grand Gulf.  During the term of the leases,
System Energy is required to maintain letters of credit for the equity investors
to secure certain amounts payable to the equity investors under the
transactions.

Under the provisions of the
reimbursement agreement relating to the letters of credit, System Energy has
agreed to a number of covenants regarding the maintenance of certain
capitalization and fixed charge coverage ratios.  System Energy agreed,
during the term of the reimbursement agreement, to maintain a ratio of debt to
total liabilities and equity less than or equal to 70%.  In addition,
System Energy must maintain, with respect to each fiscal quarter during the term
of the reimbursement agreement, a ratio of adjusted net income to interest
expense of at least 1.50 times earnings.  As of December 31, 2009, System
Energy was in compliance with these covenants.

NOTE  9.                      ASSET
RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS  (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas,
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy
New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy)

Accounting standards require the
recording of liabilities for all legal obligations associated with the
retirement of long-lived assets that result from the normal operation of those
assets.  For Entergy, substantially all of its asset retirement
obligations consist of its liability for decommissioning its nuclear power
plants.  In addition, an insignificant amount of removal costs
associated with non-nuclear power plants is also included in the decommissioning
line item on the balance sheets.

These
liabilities are recorded at their fair values (which are the present values of
the estimated future cash outflows) in the period in which they are incurred,
with an accompanying addition to the recorded cost of the long-lived
asset.  The asset retirement obligation is accreted each year through
a charge to expense, to reflect the time value of money for this present value
obligation.  The accretion will continue through the completion of the
asset retirement activity.  The amounts added to the carrying amounts
of the long-lived assets will be depreciated over the useful lives of the
assets.  The application of accounting standards related to asset
retirement obligations is earnings neutral to the rate-regulated business of the
Registrant Subsidiaries.

periodically reviews and updates estimated decommissioning costs.  The
actual decommissioning costs may vary from the estimates because of regulatory
requirements, changes in technology, and increased costs of labor, materials,
and equipment.  As described below, during 2008 and 2009 Entergy
updated decommissioning cost estimates for certain nuclear power
plants.

In the
first quarter 2009, Entergy Arkansas recorded a revision to its estimated
decommissioning cost liabilities for ANO 1 and 2 as a result of a revised
decommissioning cost study.  The revised estimates resulted in an $8.9
million reduction in its decommissioning liability, along with a corresponding
reduction in the related regulatory asset.

In the second quarter 2009, System
Energy recorded a revision to its estimated decommissioning cost liabilities for
Grand Gulf as a result of a revised decommissioning cost study.  The
revised estimate resulted in a $4.2 million reduction in its decommissioning
liability, along with a corresponding reduction in the related regulatory
asset.

In the fourth quarter 2009, Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana recorded a revision to its estimated decommissioning cost
liabilities for River Bend as a result of a revised decommissioning cost
study.  The revised estimate resulted in a $78.7 million increase in
its decommissioning liability, along with a corresponding increase in the
related asset retirement obligation asset that will be depreciated over the
remaining life of the units.

In the third quarter 2008, Entergy's
Non-Utility Nuclear business recorded an increase of $13.7 million in
decommissioning liabilities for certain of its plants as a result of revised
decommissioning cost studies.  The revised estimates resulted in the
recognition of a $13.7 million asset retirement obligation asset that will be
depreciated over the remaining life of the units.

For the Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick
plants purchased in 2000, NYPA retained the decommissioning trusts and the
decommissioning liability.  NYPA and Entergy executed decommissioning
agreements, which specify their decommissioning obligations.  NYPA has
the right to require Entergy to assume the decommissioning liability provided
that it assigns the corresponding decommissioning trust, up to a specified
level, to Entergy.  If the decommissioning liability is retained by
NYPA, Entergy will perform the decommissioning of the plants at a price equal to
the lesser of a pre-specified level or the amount in the decommissioning
trusts.  Entergy recorded an asset representing its estimate of the
present value of the


Entergy
Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to

difference
between the stipulated contract amount for decommissioning the plants less the
decommissioning cost estimated in an independent decommissioning cost study. The
asset is increased by monthly accretion based on the applicable discount rate
necessary to ultimately provide for the estimated future value of the
decommissioning contract.  The monthly accretion is recorded as
interest income.

Entergy maintains decommissioning trust
funds that are committed to meeting the costs of decommissioning the nuclear
power plants.  The fair values of the decommissioning trust funds and
the related asset retirement obligation regulatory assets of Entergy as of
December 31, 2009 are as follows:

Nuclear Fuel
Leases

As of December 31, 2009, arrangements
to lease nuclear fuel existed in an aggregate amount up to $215 million for
Entergy Arkansas, $210 million for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, $160 million
for Entergy Louisiana, and $155 million for System Energy.  As of
December 31, 2009, the unrecovered cost base of nuclear fuel leases amounted to
approximately $173.1 million for Entergy Arkansas, $157.0 million for Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana, $122.0 million for Entergy Louisiana, and $75.4 million
for System Energy.  The lessors finance the acquisition and ownership
of nuclear fuel through loans made under revolving credit agreements, the
issuance of commercial paper, and the issuance of intermediate-term
notes.  The credit agreements for Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf
States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy each have a termination
date of August 12, 2010.  The termination dates may be extended from
time to time with the consent of the lenders.  The intermediate-term
notes issued pursuant to these fuel lease arrangements have varying maturities
through July 15, 2014.  It is expected that additional financing under
the leases will be arranged as needed to acquire additional fuel, to pay
interest, and to pay maturing debt.  However, if such additional
financing cannot be arranged, the lessee in each case must repurchase sufficient
nuclear fuel to allow the lessor to meet its obligations in accordance with the
fuel lease.

Lease payments are based on nuclear fuel
use.  The table below represents the total nuclear fuel lease payments
(principal and interest), as well as the separate interest component charged to
operations, in 2009, 2008, and 2007 for the four Registrant Subsidiaries that
own nuclear power plants:

Sale and Leaseback
Transactions

Waterford
3 Lease Obligations

In 1989, in three separate but
substantially identical transactions, Entergy Louisiana sold and leased back
undivided interests in Waterford 3 for the aggregate sum of $353.6
million.  The interests represent approximately 9.3% of Waterford
3.  The leases expire in 2017.  Under certain circumstances,
Entergy Louisiana may repurchase the leased interests prior to the end of the
term of the leases.  At the end of the lease terms, Entergy Louisiana has
the option to repurchase the leased interests in Waterford 3 at fair market
value or to renew the leases for either fair market value or, under certain
conditions, a fixed rate.

Entergy Louisiana issued $208.2 million
of non-interest bearing first mortgage bonds as collateral for the equity
portion of certain amounts payable under the leases.

Upon the occurrence of certain events,
Entergy Louisiana may be obligated to assume the outstanding bonds used to
finance the purchase of the interests in the unit and to pay an amount
sufficient to withdraw from the lease transaction.  Such events
include lease events of default, events of loss, deemed loss events, or certain
adverse "Financial Events."  "Financial Events" include, among other
things, failure by Entergy Louisiana, following the expiration of any applicable
grace or cure period, to maintain (i) total equity capital (including preferred
membership interests) at least equal to 30% of adjusted capitalization, or (ii)
a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.50 computed on a rolling 12 month
basis.  As of December 31, 2009, Entergy Louisiana was in compliance
with these provisions.

Grand
Gulf Lease Obligations

In December 1988, in two separate but
substantially identical transactions, System Energy sold and leased back
undivided ownership interests in Grand Gulf for the aggregate sum of $500
million.  The interests represent approximately 11.5% of Grand
Gulf.  The leases expire in 2015.  Under certain circumstances,
System Entergy may repurchase the leased interests prior to the end of the term
of the leases.  At the end of the lease terms, System Energy has the option
to repurchase the leased interests in Grand Gulf at fair market value or to
renew the leases for either fair market value or, under certain conditions, a
fixed rate.

In May 2004, System Energy caused the
Grand Gulf lessors to refinance the outstanding bonds that they had issued to
finance the purchase of their undivided interest in Grand Gulf.  The
refinancing is at a lower interest rate, and System Energy's lease payments have
been reduced to reflect the lower interest costs.

System Energy is required to report the
sale-leaseback as a financing transaction in its financial
statements.  For financial reporting purposes, System Energy expenses
the interest portion of the lease obligation and the plant
depreciation.  However, operating revenues include the recovery of the
lease payments because the transactions are accounted for as a sale and
leaseback for ratemaking purposes.  Consistent with a recommendation
contained in a FERC audit report, System Energy initially recorded as a net
regulatory asset the difference between the recovery of the lease payments and
the amounts expensed for interest and depreciation and continues to record this
difference as a regulatory asset or liability on an ongoing basis, resulting in
a zero net balance for the regulatory asset at the end of the lease
term.  The amount was a net regulatory liability of $2.5 million and a
net regulatory asset of $19.2 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.

As of December 31, 2009, System Energy
had future minimum lease payments (reflecting an implicit rate of 5.13%), which
are recorded as long-term debt as follows:

NOTE
11.   RETIREMENT, OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS, AND DEFINED
CONTRIBUTION PLANS  (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New
Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy)

Qualified Pension
Plans

Entergy has seven qualified pension
plans covering substantially all of its employees: "Entergy Corporation
Retirement Plan for Non-Bargaining Employees," "Entergy Corporation Retirement
Plan for Bargaining Employees," "Entergy Corporation Retirement Plan II for
Non-Bargaining Employees," "Entergy Corporation Retirement Plan II for
Bargaining Employees," "Entergy Corporation Retirement Plan III," "Entergy
Corporation Retirement Plan IV for Non-Bargaining Employees," and "Entergy
Corporation Retirement Plan IV for Bargaining Employees."  The
Registrant Subsidiaries participate in two of these plans: "Entergy Corporation
Retirement Plan for Non-Bargaining Employees" and "Entergy Corporation
Retirement Plan for Bargaining Employees."  Except for the Entergy
Corporation Retirement Plan III, the pension plans are noncontributory and
provide pension benefits that are based on employees' credited service and
compensation during the final years before retirement.  The Entergy
Corporation Retirement Plan III includes a mandatory employee contribution of 3%
of earnings during the first 10 years of plan participation, and allows
voluntary contributions from 1% to 10% of earnings for a limited group of
employees.

The  assets  of  the  seven  qualified  pension
plans are held in a
master  trust  established  by  Entergy.
Each pension plan maintains an undivided beneficial interest in each of the
investment accounts of the Master Trust maintained by J. P. Morgan Chase &
Co. (the Trustee.)  Use of the master trust permits the commingling of
the trust assets of the pension plans of Entergy Corporation and its Registrant
Subsidiaries for investment and administrative purposes.  Although
assets are commingled in the master
trust,  the  Trustee  maintains  supporting  records  for  the  purpose  of
allocating  the  equity  in  net  earnings  (loss)  and  the
administrative expenses  of  the  investment
accounts to the various participating pension
plans.  The  Trustee determines the fair value of the fund
and calculates a daily  earnings  factor, including realized
and unrealized gains or losses,
collected  and  accrued  income, and
administrative expenses, and allocates earnings to each plan in the master trust
on a pro rata basis.

Further, within each pension plan, the
record of each Registrant Subsidiary’s beneficial interest in the plan assets is
maintained by the plan's actuary and is updated quarterly.  Assets for
each Registrant Subsidiary are increased for investment income, contributions,
and benefit payments. A plan’s investment income (i.e. interest and dividends,
realized gains and losses and expense) is allocated to the Registrant
Subsidiaries participating in that plan based on the value of assets for each
Registrant Subsidiary at the beginning of the quarter adjusted for contributions
and benefit payments made during the quarter.

Entergy Corporation and its
subsidiaries fund pension costs in accordance with contribution guidelines
established by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended,
and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  The assets of the
plans include common and preferred stocks, fixed-income securities, interest in
a money market fund, and insurance contracts.  The Registrant
Subsidiaries' pension costs are recovered from customers as a component of cost
of service in each of their jurisdictions.  Entergy uses a December 31
measurement date for its pension plans.

Accounting standards require an
employer to recognize in its balance sheet the funded status of its benefit
plans.  This is measured as the difference between plan assets at fair
value and the benefit obligation.  Employers are to record previously
unrecognized gains and losses, prior service costs, and any remaining transition
asset or obligation (that resulted from adopting prior pension and other
postretirement benefits accounting standards) as comprehensive income and/or as
a regulatory asset reflective of the recovery mechanism for pension and other
postretirement benefit costs in the Utility's jurisdictions.  For the
portion of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana that is not regulated, the unrecognized
prior service cost, gains and losses, and transition asset/obligation for its
pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are recorded as other
comprehensive income.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy
Louisiana recover other postretirement benefit costs on a pay as you go basis
and record the unrecognized prior service cost, gains and losses,
and

obligation for its other postretirement benefit obligation as other

in the funded status be recorded as other comprehensive income and/or a
regulatory asset in the period in which the changes occur.

Other Postretirement
Benefits

Entergy also currently provides health
care and life insurance benefits for retired employees.  Substantially
all employees may become eligible for these benefits if they reach retirement
age while still working for Entergy.  Entergy uses a December 31
measurement date for its postretirement benefit plans.

Effective January 1, 1993, Entergy
adopted an accounting standard requiring a change from a cash method to an
accrual method of accounting for postretirement other than pensions. At
January 1, 1993, the actuarially determined accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation (APBO) earned by retirees and active employees was estimated
to be approximately $241.4 million for Entergy (other than the former
Entergy Gulf States) and $128 million for the former Entergy Gulf States (now
split into Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas.)  Such
obligations are being amortized over a 20-year period that began in
1993.  For the most part, the Registrant Subsidiaries recover other
postretirement benefit costs from customers and are required to contribute other
postretirement benefits collected in rates to an external trust.

Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Mississippi,
Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas have received regulatory approval to
recover other postretirement benefit costs through rates.  Entergy
Arkansas began recovery in 1998, pursuant to an APSC order.  This
order also allowed Entergy Arkansas to amortize a regulatory asset (representing
the difference between other postretirement benefit costs and cash expenditures
for other postretirement benefits incurred for a five-year period that began
January 1, 1993) over a 15-year period that began in January 1998.

The LPSC ordered Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana to continue the use of the pay-as-you-go method
for ratemaking purposes for postretirement benefits other than
pensions.  However, the LPSC retains the flexibility to examine
individual companies' accounting for other postretirement benefits to determine
if special exceptions to this order are warranted.

Pursuant to regulatory directives,
Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and
System Energy contribute the other postretirement benefit costs collected in
rates into trusts.  System Energy is funding, on behalf of Entergy
Operations, other postretirement benefits associated with Grand
Gulf.

Trust assets contributed by
participating Registrant Subsidiaries are in three bank-administered trusts,
established by Entergy Corporation and maintained by The Bank of New York Mellon
(the Trustee.)  Each participating Registrant Subsidiary holds a
beneficial interest in the trusts’ assets.  Use of these master trusts
permits the commingling of the trust assets for investment and administrative
purposes.  Although assets are commingled, the Trustee maintains
supporting records for the purpose of allocating the beneficial interest in net
earnings (losses) and the administrative expenses of the investment accounts to
the various participating plans and participating Registrant Subsidiaries.
Beneficial interest in an investment account’s net earnings (losses) is
comprised of interest and dividends and realized and unrealized gains and
losses.  Beneficial interest from these investments is allocated
monthly to the plans and participating Registrant Subsidiary based on its
portion of net assets in the pooled accounts.

The Plan
Administrator's trust asset investment strategy is to invest the assets in a
manner whereby long term earnings on the assets (plus cash contributions)
provide adequate funding for retiree benefit payments.  The mix of
assets is based on an optimization study that identifies asset allocation
targets in order to achieve the maximum return for an acceptable level of risk,
while minimizing the expected contributions and pension and postretirement
expense.

In the
optimization study, the Plan Administrator formulates assumptions about
characteristics, such as expected asset class investment returns, volatility
(risk), and correlation coefficients among the various asset
classes.  The future market assumptions used in the optimization study
are determined by examining historical market characteristics of the various
asset classes, and making adjustments to reflect future conditions expected to
prevail over the study period.

The
optimization analysis utilized in the Plan Administrator's latest study produced
the following approved asset class target allocations.

The expected long term rate of return
of 8.5% for 2010 and 2009 for the qualified retirement plans assets is based on
the expected long term return of each asset class, weighted by the target
allocation for each class as defined in the table above.  The source
for each asset class’ expected long term rate of return is the geometric mean of
the respective asset class’ historical total return.

The time period
reflected in the total returns is a long dated period spanning several
decades.

The expected long term rate of return
of 7.75% for 2010 (8.5% for 2009) for the non-taxable postretirement trust
assets is based on the expected long term return of each asset class, weighted
by the target allocation for each class as defined in the table
above.  The source for each asset class’ expected long term rate of
return is the geometric mean of the respective asset class’ historical total
return. The time period reflected in the total returns is a long dated period
spanning several decades.

For the taxable postretirement trust
assets the investment allocation includes a high percentage of tax-exempt fixed
income securities.  The tax-exempt fixed income long term total return
was estimated using historical total return data from the

2009 Economic Report of the
President

.  The time period reflected in the tax-exempt fixed
income total return is 1940 to 2008.  After reflecting the tax-exempt
fixed income percentage and unrelated business income tax, the long term rate of
return for taxable postretirement trust assets is expected to be
5.5%  for 2010 (6% for 2009) annually.

Concentrations of Credit
Risk

Entergy’s investment guidelines mandate
the avoidance of risk concentrations.   Types of concentrations
specified to be avoided include, but are not limited to, investment
concentrations in a single entity, type of industry, foreign country, geographic
area and individual security issuance. As of December 31, 2009 all
investment managers and assets were materially in compliance with the approved
investment guidelines, therefore there were no significant concentrations
(defined as greater than 10 percent of plan assets) of risk in Entergy’s pension
and other postretirement benefit plan assets.

Fair Value
Measurements

For
fiscal years ending after December 31, 2009, fair value measurements and
disclosures for plan assets are required.

Fair value of a financial instrument is
the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date.  Interest bearing cash, treasury notes and bonds,
and common stocks are stated at fair value determined by quoted market
prices.  Fixed income securities (corporate, government, and
securitized), are stated at fair value as determined by broker
quotes.  Common collective investment trust funds and registered
investment company trust funds are stated at estimated fair value based on the
fair market value of the underlying investments.  The unallocated
insurance contract investments are recorded at contract value, which
approximates fair value.  The contract value represents contributions
made under the contract, plus interest, less funds used to pay benefits and
contract expenses, and less distributions to the Master Trust.  The
other remaining assets are U.S. municipal and foreign government bonds stated at
fair value as determined by broker quotes.

The classification levels for fair
value are as follows:

·

Level
      1 - Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or
      liabilities in active markets that the Plan has the ability to access at
      the measurement date. Active markets are those in which transactions for
      the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide
      pricing information on an ongoing
basis.

·

Level
      2 - Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1
      that are, either directly or indirectly, observable for the asset or
      liability at the measurement date.  Assets are valued based on
      prices derived by an independent party that uses inputs such as benchmark
      yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, and issuer
      spreads.  Level 2 inputs include the
  following:


Entergy
Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to
Financial Statements

-     quoted
prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;

-     quoted
prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets;

-     inputs
other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability;
or

-

inputs
that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by
correlation or other means.

If an
asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, the Level 2 input must be
observable for substantially the full term of the asset or
liability.

·

Level
      3 - Level 3 refers to securities valued based on significant unobservable
      inputs.

Assets and liabilities are classified
in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the
fair value measurement.  The following tables set forth by level
within the fair value hierarchy a summary of the investments held for the
qualified pension and other postretirement plans measured at fair value on a
recurring basis at December 31, 2009.

Contributions

Entergy currently expects to contribute
approximately $270 million to its pension plans and approximately $76 million to
other postretirement plans in 2010.  The expected 2010 pension and
other postretirement plan contributions of the Registrant Subsidiaries are shown
below. The required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty
until the January 1, 2010 valuations are completed by April 1,
2010.  Also, guidance pursuant to the Pension Protection Act of 2006
rules, effective for the 2008 plan year and beyond, continues to evolve, be
interpreted through technical corrections bills, and discussed within the
industry and congressional lawmakers.  Any changes to the Pension
Protection Act as a result of these discussions and efforts may affect the level
of Entergy's and each of the Registrant Subsidiaries’ pension contributions in
the future.

The
Registrant Subsidiaries expect to contribute approximately the following to the
pension and other postretirement plans in 2010:

The assumed health care cost trend rate
used in measuring the APBO of Entergy was 7.5% for 2010, gradually decreasing
each successive year until it reaches 4.75% in 2016 and beyond. The assumed
health care cost trend rate used in measuring the Net Other Postretirement
Benefit Cost of Entergy was 8.5% for 2009, gradually decreasing each successive
year until it reaches 4.75% in 2016 and beyond.  A one percentage

Entergy's other postretirement benefit

Accounting
Mechanisms

With
regard to pension and other postretirement costs, Entergy calculates the
expected return on pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by
multiplying the long-term expected rate of return on assets by the
market-related value (MRV) of plan assets.  Entergy determines the MRV of
pension plan assets by calculating a value that uses a 20-quarter phase-in of
the difference between actual and expected returns.  For other
postretirement benefit plan assets Entergy uses fair value when determining
MRV.

Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003

In
December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act
of 2003 became law.  The Act introduces a prescription drug benefit
cost under Medicare (Part D), which started in 2006, as well as a federal
subsidy to employers who provide a retiree prescription drug benefit that is at
least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D.

Notes to

The
actuarially estimated effect of future Medicare subsidies reduced the December
31, 2009 and 2008 Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation by $215 million
and $187 million, respectively, and reduced the 2009, 2008, and 2007 other
postretirement benefit cost by $24.0 million, $24.7 million, and $26.5 million,
respectively.  In 2009, Entergy received $5.1 million in Medicare
subsidies for prescription drug claims.

Non-Qualified Pension
Plans

Entergy
also sponsors non-qualified, non-contributory defined benefit pension plans that
provide benefits to certain key employees.  Entergy recognized net
periodic pension cost related to these plans of $23.6 million in 2009, $17.2
million in 2008, and $20.6 million in 2007.  In 2009, Entergy
recognized a $6.7 million settlement charge related to the payment of lump sum
benefits out of the plan that is included in the non-qualified pension plan cost
above.  The projected benefit obligation was $147.9 million and $138.4
million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  There were
$0.2 million in plan assets for a pre-merger Entergy Gulf States Louisiana plan
at December 31, 2008 and none at December 31, 2009. The accumulated benefit
obligation was $134.1 million and $125.5 million as of December 31, 2009 and
2008, respectively.

Entergy's
non-qualified, non-current pension liability at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was
$124.1 million and $121.5 million, respectively; and its current liability was
$23.8 million and $16.7 million, respectively.  The unamortized
transition asset, prior service cost and net loss are recognized in regulatory
assets ($51.6 million at December 31, 2009 and $44.1 million at December 31,
2008) and accumulated other comprehensive income before taxes ($23 million at
December 31, 2009 and $18.2 million at December 31, 2008.)

The
Registrant Subsidiaries (except System Energy) participate in Entergy's
non-qualified, non-contributory defined benefit pension plans that provide
benefits to certain key employees.  The net periodic pension cost for

Defined Contribution
Plans

Entergy
sponsors the Savings Plan of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries (System
Savings Plan).  The System

Savings Plan is a defined
contribution plan covering eligible employees of Entergy and its subsidiaries.
The employing Entergy subsidiary makes matching contributions for

all non-bargaining and certain
bargaining employees

to the System Savings Plan in an amount equal to 70%
of the participants' basic contributions, up to 6% of their eligible earnings
per pay period.  The 70% match is allocated to investments as directed
by the employee.

Entergy
also sponsors the Savings Plan of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries II
(established in 2001), the Savings Plan of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries
IV (established in 2002), the Savings Plan of Entergy Corporation and
Subsidiaries VI (established in April 2007), and the Savings Plan of Entergy
Corporation and Subsidiaries VII (established in April 2007) to which matching
contributions are also made.  The plans are defined contribution plans
that cover eligible employees, as defined by each plan, of Entergy and its
subsidiaries.

Entergy's
subsidiaries' contributions to defined contribution plans collectively were
$41.9 million in 2009, $38.4 million in 2008, and $36.6 million in
2007.  The majority of the contributions were to the System Savings
Plan.

NOTE
12.                      STOCK-BASED
COMPENSATION (Entergy Corporation)

Entergy grants stock options and
long-term incentive and restricted liability awards to key employees of the
Entergy subsidiaries under its Equity Ownership Plans which are
shareholder-approved stock-based compensation plans.  The Equity
Ownership Plan, as restated in February 2003 (2003 Plan), had 706,950 authorized
shares remaining for long-term incentive and restricted liability awards as of
December 31, 2009.  Effective January 1, 2007, Entergy's shareholders
approved the 2007 Equity Ownership and Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan (2007
Plan).  The maximum aggregate number of common shares that can be
issued from the 2007 Plan for stock-based awards is 7,000,000 with no more than
2,000,000 available for non-option grants.  The 2007 Plan, which only
applies to awards made on or after January 1, 2007, will expire after 10
years.  As of December 31, 2009, there were 2,569,926 authorized
shares remaining for stock-based awards, including 2,000,000 for non-option
grants.

Stock
Options

Stock options are granted at exercise
prices that equal the closing market price of Entergy Corporation common stock
on the date of grant.  Generally, stock options granted will become
exercisable in equal amounts on each of the first three anniversaries of the
date of grant.  Unless they are forfeited previously under the terms
of the grant, options expire ten years after the date of the grant if they are
not exercised.

The following table includes financial

Entergy
determines the fair value of the stock option grants by considering factors such

determining the fair values are as follows:

Stock
price volatility is calculated based upon the weekly public stock price
volatility of Entergy Corporation common stock over the last four to five
years.  The expected term of the options is based upon historical option
exercises and the weighted average life of options when exercised and the
estimated weighted average life of all vested but unexercised options.  In
2008, Entergy implemented stock ownership guidelines for its senior executive
officers.  These guidelines require an executive officer to own shares
of Entergy common stock equal to a specified multiple of his or her
salary.  Until an executive officer achieves this ownership position
the executive officer is required to retain 75% of the after-tax net profit upon
exercise of the option to be held in Entergy Corporation common stock.  The
reduction in fair value of the stock options due to this restriction is based
upon an estimate of the call option value of the reinvested gain discounted to
present value over the applicable reinvestment period.

The

stock options exercised was $35.6 million during 2009, $63.7 million during
2008, and $116.7 million during 2007.  The intrinsic value, which has
no effect on net income, of the stock options exercised is calculated by the
difference in Entergy Corporation's common stock price on the date of exercise
and the exercise price of the stock options granted.  Entergy
recognizes compensation cost over the vesting period of the options based on
their grant-date fair value.   The total fair value of options
that vested was approximately $22 million during 2009, $18 million during 2008,
and $15 million during 2007.

Long-Term Incentive
Awards

Entergy grants long-term incentive
awards earned under its stock benefit plans in the form of performance units,
which are equal to the cash value of shares of Entergy Corporation common stock
at the end of the performance period, which is the last trading day of the
year.  Performance units will pay out to the extent that the
performance conditions are satisfied.  In addition to the potential
for equivalent share appreciation or depreciation, performance units will earn
the cash equivalent of the dividends paid during the three-year performance
period applicable to each plan.  The costs of incentive awards are
charged to income over the three-year period.

SEGMENT INFORMATION  (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy
Mississippi,  Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System
Energy)

Entergy's reportable segments as of
December 31, 2009 are Utility and Non-Utility Nuclear.  Utility
generates, transmits, distributes, and sells electric power in portions of
Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, and provides natural gas utility
service in portions of Louisiana.  Non-Utility Nuclear owns and
operates six nuclear power plants and is primarily focused on selling electric
power produced by those plants to wholesale customers.  "All Other"
includes the parent company, Entergy Corporation, and other business activity,
including the non-nuclear wholesale assets business and earnings on the proceeds
of sales of previously-owned businesses.  As a result of the Entergy
New Orleans bankruptcy filing, Entergy discontinued the consolidation of Entergy
New Orleans retroactive to January 1, 2005, and reported Entergy New Orleans
results under the equity method of accounting in the Utility segment in
2006.  On May 7, 2007, the bankruptcy judge entered an order
confirming Entergy New Orleans' plan of reorganization.  With
confirmation of the plan of reorganization, Entergy reconsolidated Entergy New
Orleans in the second quarter 2007, retroactive to January 1, 2007.

Businesses
marked with * are sometimes referred to as the "competitive businesses," with
the exception of the parent company, Entergy
Corporation.  Eliminations are primarily intersegment
activity.  Almost all of Entergy's goodwill is related to the Utility
segment.

Earnings
were negatively affected in the fourth quarter 2007 by expenses of $22.2 million
($13.6 million net-of-tax) for Utility and $29.9 million ($18.4 million
net-of-tax) for Non-Utility Nuclear recorded in connection with a nuclear
operations fleet alignment.  This process was undertaken with the
goals of eliminating redundancies, capturing economies of scale, and clearly
establishing organizational governance.  Most of the expenses related
to the voluntary severance program offered to
employees.  Approximately 200 employees from the Non-Utility Nuclear
business and 150 employees in the Utility business accepted the voluntary
severance program offers.

Geographic
Areas

For the
years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the amount of revenue Entergy derived
from outside of the United States was insignificant.  As of December
31, 2009 and 2008, Entergy had no long-lived assets located outside of the
United States.

Registrant
Subsidiaries

Each of the Registrant Subsidiaries has
one reportable segment, which is an integrated utility business, except for
System Energy, which is an electricity generation business.  Each of
the Registrant Subsidiaries' operations is managed on an integrated basis by
that company because of the substantial effect of cost-based rates and
regulatory oversight on the business process, cost structures, and operating
results.

      Entergy deconsolidated Entergy New Orleans and reflected Entergy New
      Orleans' financial results under the equity method of accounting
      retroactive to January 1, 2005.  In May 2007, with confirmation
      of the plan of reorganization, Entergy reconsolidated Entergy New Orleans
      retroactive to January 1, 2007 and no longer accounts for Entergy New
      Orleans under the equity method of accounting.  See Note 18 to

15.                      ACQUISITIONS
AND DISPOSITIONS (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana, and Entergy Mississippi)

Calcasieu

In March 2008, Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana purchased the Calcasieu Generating Facility, a 322 MW simple-cycle
gas-fired power plant located near the city of Sulphur in southwestern
Louisiana, for approximately $56 million from a subsidiary of Dynegy,
Inc.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana received the plant, materials and
supplies, SO


emission
allowances, and related real estate in the transaction.  The FERC and
the LPSC approved the acquisition.

Ouachita

In September 2008, Entergy Arkansas
purchased the Ouachita Plant, a 789 MW three-train gas-fired combined cycle
generating turbine (CCGT) electric power plant located 20 miles south of the
Arkansas state line near Sterlington, Louisiana, for approximately $210 million
from a subsidiary of Cogentrix Energy, Inc.  Entergy Arkansas received
the plant, materials and supplies, and related real estate in the
transaction.  The FERC and the APSC approved the
acquisition.  The APSC also approved the recovery of the acquisition
and ownership costs through a rate rider and the planned sale of one-third of
the capacity and energy to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana.

The LPSC also approved the purchase of
one-third of the capacity and energy by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, subject
to certain conditions, including a study to determine the costs and benefits of
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana exercising an option to purchase one-third of the
plant (Unit 3) from Entergy Arkansas.  In April 2009, Entergy Gulf
States Louisiana made a filing with the LPSC seeking approval of Entergy Gulf
States Louisiana exercising its option to convert its purchased power agreement
into the ownership interest in Unit 3 and a one-third interest in the Ouachita
common facilities.  In September 2009 the LPSC, pursuant to an
uncontested settlement, approved the acquisition and a cost recovery
mechanism.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana purchased Unit 3 and a
one-third interest in the Ouachita common facilities for $75 million in November
2009.

Palisades

In April 2007, Entergy's Non-Utility
Nuclear business purchased the 798 MW Palisades nuclear energy plant located
near South Haven, Michigan from Consumers Energy Company for a net cash payment
of $336 million.  Entergy received the plant, nuclear fuel,
inventories, and other assets.  The liability to decommission the
plant, as well as related decommissioning trust funds, was also transferred to
Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear business.  Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear
business executed a unit-contingent, 15-year purchased power agreement (PPA)
with Consumers Energy for 100% of the plant's output, excluding any future
uprates.  Prices under the PPA range from $43.50/MWh in 2007 to
$61.50/MWh in 2022, and the average price under the PPA is
$51/MWh.  In the first quarter 2007, the NRC renewed Palisades'
operating license until 2031.  As part of the transaction, Entergy's
Non-Utility Nuclear business assumed responsibility for spent fuel at the
decommissioned Big Rock Point nuclear plant, which is located near Charlevoix,
Michigan.  Palisades' financial results since April 2007 are included in
Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear business segment.  The following table
summarizes the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of
acquisition.

Subsequent
to the closing, Entergy received approximately $6 million from Consumers Energy
Company as part of the Post-Closing Adjustment defined in the Asset Sale
Agreement.  The Post-Closing Adjustment amount resulted in an
approximately $6 million reduction in plant and a corresponding reduction in
other liabilities.

For the
PPA, which was at below-market prices at the time of the acquisition,
Non-Utility Nuclear will amortize a liability to revenue over the life of the
agreement.  The amount that will be amortized each period is based
upon the difference between the present value calculated at the date of
acquisition of each year's difference between revenue under the agreement and
revenue based on estimated market prices.  Amounts amortized to
revenue were $53 million in 2009, $76 million in 2008, and $50 million in
2007.  The amounts to be amortized to revenue for the next five years
will be $46 million for 2010, $43 million for 2011, $17 million in 2012, $18
million for 2013, and $16 million for 2014.

NYPA
Value Sharing Agreements

Non-Utility Nuclear's purchase of the
FitzPatrick and Indian Point 3 plants from NYPA included value sharing
agreements with NYPA.  In October 2007, Non-Utility Nuclear and NYPA
amended and restated the value sharing agreements to clarify and amend certain
provisions of the original terms.  Under the amended value sharing
agreements, Non-Utility Nuclear will make annual payments to NYPA based on the
generation output of the Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick plants from January 2007
through December 2014.  Non-Utility Nuclear will pay NYPA $6.59 per
MWh for power sold from Indian Point 3, up to an annual cap of $48 million, and
$3.91 per MWh for power sold from FitzPatrick, up to an annual cap of $24
million.  The annual payment for each year's output is due by January
15 of the following year.  Non-Utility Nuclear will record its
liability for payments to NYPA as power is generated and sold by Indian Point 3
and FitzPatrick.  An amount equal to the liability will be recorded to
the plant asset account as contingent purchase price consideration for the
plants.  In 2009, 2008, and 2007, Non-Utility Nuclear recorded $72
million as plant for generation during each of those years.  This
amount will be depreciated over the expected remaining useful life of the
plants.

In August 2008, Non-Utility Nuclear
entered into a resolution of a dispute with NYPA over the applicability of the
value sharing agreements to its FitzPatrick and Indian Point 3 nuclear power
plants after the planned spin-off of the Non-Utility Nuclear
business.  Under the resolution, Non-Utility Nuclear agreed not to
treat the separation as a "Cessation Event" that would terminate its obligation
to make the payments under the value sharing agreements.  As a result,
after the spin-off transaction, Enexus will continue to be obligated to make
payments to NYPA under the amended and restated value sharing
agreements.

Asset
Dispositions

Entergy-Koch
Businesses

In the fourth quarter 2004,
Entergy-Koch sold its energy trading and pipeline businesses to third
parties.  The sales came after a review of strategic alternatives for
enhancing the value of Entergy-Koch.  Entergy received
$862 million of cash distributions in 2004 from Entergy-Koch after the
business sales.  Due to the November 2006 expiration of contingencies
on the sale of Entergy-Koch's trading business, and the corresponding release to
Entergy-Koch of sales proceeds held in escrow, Entergy recorded a gain related
to its Entergy-Koch investment of approximately $55 million, net-of-tax, in the
fourth quarter 2006 and received additional cash distributions of approximately
$163 million.  In December 2009, Entergy reorganized its investment in
Entergy-Koch, received a $25.6 million cash distribution, and received a
distribution of certain software owned by the joint venture.

Other

In the
second quarter 2008, Entergy sold its remaining interest in Warren Power and
realized a gain of $11.2 million ($6.9 million net-of-tax) on the
sale.

MANAGEMENT AND FAIR VALUES (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf
States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi,  Entergy New
Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy)

Market and Commodity
Risks

In the
normal course of business, Entergy is exposed to a number of market and
commodity risks.  Market risk is the potential loss that Entergy may
incur as a result of changes in the market or fair value of a particular
instrument or commodity.  All financial and commodity-related
instruments, including derivatives, are subject to market
risk.  Entergy is subject to a number of commodity and market risks,
including:

Type
      of Risk

Affected
      Businesses

Power
      price risk

Utility,
      Non-Utility Nuclear, Non-nuclear wholesale assets

Fuel

      currency exchange rate risk

Utility,
      Non-Utility Nuclear, Non-nuclear wholesale assets

Equity
      price and interest rate risk - investments

Utility,
      Non-Utility Nuclear

Entergy
manages a portion of these risks using derivative instruments, some of which are
classified as cash flow hedges due to their financial settlement provisions
while others are classified as normal purchase/normal sales transactions due to
their physical settlement provisions.  Normal purchase/normal sale
risk management tools include power purchase and sales agreements and fuel
purchase agreements, capacity contracts, and tolling
agreements.  Financially-settled cash flow hedges can include natural
gas and electricity futures, forwards, swaps, and options; foreign currency
forwards; and interest rate swaps.  Entergy enters into derivatives
only to manage natural risks inherent in its physical or financial assets or
liabilities.

Entergy
manages fuel price risk for its Louisiana jurisdictions (Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy New Orleans) and Entergy Mississippi
primarily through the purchase of short-term natural gas swaps.  These
swaps are marked-to-market with offsetting regulatory assets or
liabilities.  The notional volumes of these swaps are based on a
portion of projected annual exposure to gas for electric generation and
projected winter purchases for gas distribution at Entergy Gulf States Louisiana
and Entergy New Orleans.


Entergy
Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to
Financial Statements

Entergy's
exposure to market risk is determined by a number of factors, including the
size, term, composition, and diversification of positions held, as well as
market volatility and liquidity.  For instruments such as options, the
time period during which the option may be exercised and the relationship
between the current market price of the underlying instrument and the option's
contractual strike or exercise price also affects the level of market
risk.  A significant factor influencing the overall level of market
risk to which Entergy is exposed is its use of hedging techniques to mitigate
such risk.  Entergy manages market risk by actively monitoring
compliance with stated risk management policies as well as monitoring the
effectiveness of its hedging policies and strategies.  Entergy's risk
management policies limit the amount of total net exposure and rolling net
exposure during the stated periods.  These policies, including related
risk limits, are regularly assessed to ensure their appropriateness given
Entergy's objectives.

Notes to
Financial Statements

The effect of Entergy's derivative
instruments designated as cash flow hedges on the consolidated statements of
income for the year ended December 31, 2009 is as follows:

Electricity
over-the-counter swaps that financially settle against day-ahead power pool
prices are used to manage price exposure for Non-Utility Nuclear
generation.  Based on market prices as of December 31, 2009, cash flow
hedges relating to power sales totaled $200 million of net gains, of which
approximately $109 million are expected to be reclassified from accumulated
other comprehensive income (OCI) to operating revenues in the next twelve
months.  The actual amount reclassified from accumulated OCI, however,
could vary due to future changes in market prices.  Gains totaling
approximately $322 million were realized on the maturity of cash flow hedges for
2009.  Unrealized gains or losses recorded in OCI result from hedging
power output at the Non-Utility Nuclear power plants.  The related
gains or losses from hedging power are included in operating revenues when
realized.  The maximum length of time over which Entergy is currently
hedging the variability in future cash flows for forecasted power transactions
as of December 31, 2009 is approximately three years.  Planned
generation sold forward from Non-Utility Nuclear power plants as of December 31,
2009 is 88% for 2010 of which approximately 40% is sold under financial hedges
and the remainder under normal purchase/sale contracts.  The
ineffective portion of the change in the value of Entergy's cash flow hedges for
2009 was insignificant.  Certain of the agreements to sell the power
produced by Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear power plants contain provisions that
require an Entergy subsidiary to provide collateral to secure its obligations
when the current market prices exceed the contracted power
prices.   The primary form of collateral to satisfy these
requirements is an Entergy Corporation guaranty.  As of December 31, 2009,
hedge contracts with one counterparty were in a liability position
(approximately $2 million total), but were significantly below the amounts of
guarantees provided under their contracts and no cash collateral was
required.  If the Entergy Corporation credit rating falls below
investment grade, the impact of the corporate guarantee is ignored and Entergy
would have to post collateral equal to the estimated outstanding liability under
the contract at the applicable date.

Natural
gas over-the-counter swaps that financially settle against NYMEX futures are
used to manage fuel price risk for the Utility's Louisiana and Mississippi
customers.  All benefits or costs of the program are recorded in fuel
costs.  The total volume of natural gas swaps outstanding as of
December 31, 2009 is 36,710,000 MMBtu for Entergy, 9,530,000 MMBtu for Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana, 15,590,000 MMBtu for Entergy Louisiana, 10,480,000 MMBtu
for Entergy Mississippi, and 1,110,000 MMBtu for Entergy New
Orleans.  Credit support for these natural gas swaps are covered by
master agreements that do not require collateralization based on mark-to-market
value but do carry material adverse change clauses that may lead to
collateralization requests.  The effect of Entergy's derivative
instruments not designated as hedging instruments on the consolidated statements
of income for the year ended December 31, 2009 is as follows:

Due to
regulatory treatment, the natural gas swaps are marked to market through fuel,
fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale and then such amounts are
simultaneously reversed and recorded as offsetting regulatory assets or
liabilities.  The gains or losses recorded as fuel expenses when the
swaps are settled are recovered through each Registrant's fuel recovery

Fair
Values

The estimated fair values of Entergy's
financial instruments and derivatives are determined using bid prices and market
quotes.  Considerable judgment is required in developing the estimates
of fair value.  Therefore, estimates are not necessarily indicative of
the amounts that Entergy could realize in a current market
exchange.  Gains or losses realized on financial instruments held by
regulated businesses may be reflected in future rates and therefore do not
accrue to the benefit or detriment of shareholders.  Entergy considers
the carrying amounts of most financial instruments classified as current assets
and liabilities to be a reasonable estimate of their fair value because of the
short maturity of these instruments.

Accounting standards define fair value
as an exit price, or the price that would be received to sell an asset or the
amount that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between knowledgeable market participants at date of
measurement.  Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries use assumptions
or market input data that market participants would use in pricing assets or
liabilities at fair value.  The inputs can be readily observable,
corroborated by market data, or generally unobservable.  Entergy and
the Registrant Subsidiaries endeavor to use the best available information to
determine fair value.

Notes to
Financial Statements

Accounting standards establish a fair
value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair
value.  The hierarchy establishes the highest priority for unadjusted
market quotes in an active market for the identical asset or liability and the
lowest priority for unobservable inputs.  The three levels of the fair
value hierarchy are:

·

Level
      1 - Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for
      identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access
      at the measurement date. Active markets are those in which transactions
      for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to
      provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.  Level 1
      primarily consists of individually owned common stocks, cash equivalents,
      debt instruments, gas hedge contracts, the securitization trust recovery
      account, and storm reserve escrow
accounts.

·

Level
      2 - Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1
      that are, either directly or indirectly, observable for the asset or
      liability at the measurement date.  Level 2 inputs include the
      following:

-

quoted
      prices for similar assets or liabilities in active
  markets;

-

quoted
      prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive
      markets;

-

inputs
      other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability;
      or

-

inputs
      that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market
      data by correlation or other means.

Level 2
consists primarily of individually owned debt instruments or shares in common
trusts.

·

Level
      3 - Level 3 inputs are pricing inputs that are generally less observable
      or unobservable from objective sources.  These inputs are used
      with internally developed methodologies to produce management's best
      estimate of fair value for the asset or liability.  Level 3
      consists primarily of derivative power contracts used as cash flow hedges
      of power sales at merchant power
plants.

The
values for the cash flow hedges that are recorded as derivative contract assets
or liabilities are based on both observable inputs including public market
prices and unobservable inputs such as model-generated prices for longer-term
markets and are classified as Level 3 assets and liabilities.  The
amounts reflected as the fair value of derivative assets or liabilities are
based on the estimated amount that the contracts are in-the-money at the balance
sheet date (treated as an asset) or out-of-the-money at the balance sheet date
(treated as a liability) and would equal the estimated amount receivable or
payable by Entergy if the contracts were settled at that date.  These
derivative contracts include cash flow hedges that swap fixed for floating cash
flows for sales of the output from Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear
business.  The fair values are based on the mark-to-market comparison
between the fixed contract prices and the floating prices determined each period
from a combination of quoted forward power market prices for the period for
which such curves are available, and model-generated prices using quoted forward
gas market curves and estimates regarding heat rates to convert gas to power and
the costs associated with the transportation of the power from the plants' bus
bar to the contract's point of delivery, generally a power market hub, for the
period thereafter.   The difference between the fixed price in
the swap contract and these market-related prices multiplied by the volume
specified in the contract and discounted at the counterparties' credit adjusted
risk free rate are recorded as derivative contract assets or liabilities. $202
million of cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2009 are in-the-money contracts
with counterparties who are all currently investment grade.  $2
million of the cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2009 are out-of-the-money
contracts supported by corporate guarantees, which would require additional cash
or letters of credit in the event of a decrease in Entergy Corporation’s credit
rating to below investment grade.

The
following tables set forth, by level within the fair value hierarchy, Entergy's
assets and liabilities that are accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis
as of December 31, 2009 and 2008.  The assessment of the significance
of a particular input to a fair value measurement requires judgment and may
affect their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels.

NOTE
17.                      DECOMMISSIONING
TRUST FUNDS (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy)

Entergy
holds debt and equity securities, classified as available-for-sale, in nuclear
decommissioning trust accounts.  The NRC requires Entergy to maintain
trusts to fund the costs of decommissioning ANO 1, ANO 2, River Bend, Waterford
3, Grand Gulf, Pilgrim, Indian Point 1 and 2, Vermont Yankee, and Palisades
(NYPA currently retains the decommissioning trusts and liabilities for Indian
Point 3 and FitzPatrick).  The funds are invested primarily in equity
securities; fixed-rate, fixed-income securities; and cash and cash
equivalents.

Entergy records decommissioning trust
funds on the balance sheet at their fair value.  Because of the
ability of the Registrant Subsidiaries to recover decommissioning costs in rates
and in accordance with the regulatory treatment for decommissioning trust funds,
the Registrant Subsidiaries have recorded an offsetting amount of unrealized
gains/(losses) on investment securities in other regulatory
liabilities/assets.  For the nonregulated portion of River Bend,
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana has recorded an offsetting amount of unrealized
gains/(losses) in other deferred credits.  Decommissioning trust funds
for Pilgrim, Indian Point 2, Vermont Yankee, and Palisades do not meet the
criteria for regulatory accounting treatment.  Accordingly, unrealized
gains recorded on the assets in these trust funds are recognized in the
accumulated other comprehensive income component of shareholders' equity because
these assets are classified as available for sale.  Unrealized losses
(where cost exceeds fair market value) on the assets in these trust funds are
also recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of
shareholders' equity unless the unrealized loss is other than temporary and
therefore recorded in earnings.  Effective January 1, 2009, Entergy
adopted an accounting pronouncement providing guidance regarding recognition and
presentation of other-than-temporary impairments related to investments in debt
securities.  The assessment of whether an investment in a debt security has
suffered an other-than-temporary impairment is based on whether Entergy has the
intent to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt
security before recovery of its amortized costs.  Further, if Entergy does
not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the debt security, an
other-than-temporary impairment is considered to have occurred and it is
measured by the present value of cash flows expected to be collected less the
amortized cost basis (credit loss).  The assessment of whether an
investment in an equity security has suffered an other-than-temporary impairment
continues to be based on a number of factors including, first, whether Entergy
has the ability and intent to hold the investment to recover its value, the
duration and severity of any losses, and, then, whether it is expected that the
investment will recover its value within a reasonable period of
time.  Entergy's trusts are managed by third parties who operate in
accordance with agreements that define investment guidelines and place
restrictions on the purchases and sales of investments.

Other-than-temporary
impairments and unrealized gains and losses

Entergy,
Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System
Energy evaluate unrealized losses at the end of each period to determine whether
an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred.  Effective January 1,
2009, Entergy adopted an accounting pronouncement providing guidance regarding
recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairments related to
investments in debt securities.  The assessment of whether an investment in
a debt security has suffered an other-than-temporary impairment is based on
whether Entergy has the intent to sell or more likely than not will be required
to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized costs.  Further,
if Entergy does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the
debt security, an other-than-temporary impairment is considered to have occurred
and it is measured by the present value of cash flows expected to be collected
less the amortized cost basis (credit loss).  For debt securities held as
of January 1, 2009 for which an other-than-temporary impairment had


Entergy
Corporation and Subsidiaries

Notes to
Financial Statements

previously
been recognized but for which assessment under the new guidance indicates this
impairment is temporary, Entergy recorded an adjustment to its opening balance
of retained earnings of $11.3 million ($6.4 million net-of-tax). Entergy did not
have any material other-than-temporary impairments relating to credit losses on
debt securities in 2009.  The assessment of whether an investment in an
equity security has suffered an other-than-temporary impairment continues to be
based on a number of factors including, first, whether Entergy has the ability
and intent to hold the investment to recover its value, the duration and
severity of any losses, and, then, whether it is expected that the investment
will recover its value within a reasonable period of time.  Entergy's
trusts are managed by third parties who operate in accordance with agreements
that define investment guidelines and place restrictions on the purchases and
sales of investments. Non-Utility Nuclear recorded charges to other income of
$86 million in 2009, $50 million in 2008, and $5 million in 2007, resulting from
the recognition of the other-than-temporary impairment of certain equity
securities held in its decommissioning trust funds.

NOTE
18.                      ENTERGY
NEW ORLEANS BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas,
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy
New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy)

As a result of the effects of Hurricane
Katrina and the effect of extensive flooding that resulted from levee breaks in
and around the New Orleans area, on September 23, 2005, Entergy New Orleans
filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy court seeking reorganization relief
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  On May 7, 2007,
the bankruptcy judge entered an order confirming Entergy New Orleans' plan of
reorganization.  With the receipt of CDBG funds, and the agreement on
insurance recovery with one of its excess insurers, Entergy New Orleans waived
the conditions precedent in its plan of reorganization and the plan became
effective on May 8, 2007.  Following are significant terms in
Entergy New Orleans' plan of reorganization:

·

Entergy
      New Orleans paid in full, in cash, the allowed third-party prepetition
      accounts payable (approximately $29 million, including
      interest).  Entergy New Orleans paid interest from September 23,
      2005 at the Louisiana judicial rate of interest for 2005 (6%) and 2006
      (8%), and at the Louisiana judicial rate of interest (9.5%) plus 1% for
      2007 through the date of payment.

·

Entergy
      New Orleans issued notes due in three years in satisfaction of its
      affiliate prepetition accounts payable (approximately $74 million,
      including interest), including its indebtedness to the Entergy System
      money pool.  Entergy New Orleans included in the principal
      amount of the notes accrued interest from September 23, 2005 at the
      Louisiana judicial rate of interest for 2005 (6%) and 2006 (8%), and at
      the Louisiana judicial rate of interest plus 1% for 2007 through the date
      of issuance of the notes.  Entergy New Orleans will pay interest
      on the notes from their date of issuance at the Louisiana judicial rate of
      interest plus 1%.  The Louisiana judicial rate of interest is
      9.5% for 2007, 8.5% for 2008, 5.5% for 2009, and 3.5% for
      2010.

·

Entergy
      New Orleans repaid in full, in cash, the outstanding borrowings under the
      debtor-in-possession credit agreement between Entergy New Orleans and
      Entergy Corporation (approximately $67
million).

·

Entergy
      New Orleans' first mortgage bonds remain outstanding with their stated
      maturity dates and interest terms.  Pursuant to an agreement
      with its first mortgage bondholders, Entergy New Orleans paid the first
      mortgage bondholders an amount equal to the one year of interest from the
      bankruptcy petition date that the bondholders had waived previously in the
      bankruptcy proceeding (approximately $12
  million).

·

Entergy
      New Orleans' preferred stock will remain outstanding on its stated
      dividend terms, and Entergy New Orleans paid its unpaid preferred
      dividends in arrears (approximately $1
million).

·

Litigation
      claims were generally unaltered, and will generally proceed as if Entergy
      New Orleans had not filed for bankruptcy protection, with exceptions for
      certain claims.

Notes to

(Entergy
Corporation)

With confirmation of the plan of
reorganization, Entergy reconsolidated Entergy New Orleans in the second quarter
2007, retroactive to January 1, 2007.  Because Entergy owns all of the
common stock of Entergy New Orleans, reconsolidation does not affect the amount
of net income that Entergy records from Entergy New Orleans' operations for any
current or prior periods, but does result in Entergy New Orleans' results being
included in each individual income statement line item in 2007.

NOTE
19.                      TRANSACTIONS
WITH AFFILIATES (Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy
Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System
Energy)

Each Registrant Subsidiary purchases
electricity from or sells electricity to the other Registrant Subsidiaries, or
both, under rate schedules filed with FERC.  The Registrant
Subsidiaries purchase fuel from System Fuels; receive management, technical,
advisory, operating, and administrative services from Entergy Services; and
receive management, technical, and operating services from Entergy
Operations.  These transactions are on an "at cost"
basis.  In addition, Entergy Power sells electricity to Entergy
Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy New Orleans.   RS Cogen
sells electricity to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana.

As
described in Note 1 to the financial statements, all of System Energy's
operating revenues consist of billings to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana,
Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans.

Additionally, as described in Note 4 to
the financial statements, the Registrant Subsidiaries participate in Entergy's
money pool and earn interest income from the money pool.  Entergy
Arkansas, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans also receive interest
income from System Fuels, Inc.

ENTERGY'S
BUSINESS (continued from page 3)
























Utility

The
Utility business segment includes six wholly-owned retail electric utility
subsidiaries: Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy
Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy
Texas.  These companies generate, transmit, distribute and sell
electric power to retail and wholesale customers in Arkansas, Louisiana,
Mississippi, and Texas. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans
also provide natural gas utility services to customers in and around Baton
Rouge, Louisiana, and New Orleans, Louisiana, respectively.  Also
included in the Utility is System Energy, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy
Corporation that owns or leases 90 percent of Grand Gulf.  System
Energy sells its power and capacity from Grand Gulf at wholesale to Entergy
Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New
Orleans.

The six
retail utility subsidiaries are each regulated by state utility commissions, or,
in the case of Entergy New Orleans, the City Council.  System Energy
is regulated by FERC as all of its transactions are at the wholesale level. The
Utility continues to operate as a rate-regulated business as efforts toward
deregulation have been delayed, abandoned, or not initiated in its service
territories.  The overall generation portfolio of the Utility, which
relies heavily on natural gas and nuclear generation, is consistent with
Entergy's strong support for the environment.

The
Utility is focused on providing highly reliable and cost-effective electricity
and gas service while working in an environment that provides the highest level
of safety for its employees.  Since 1998, the Utility has
significantly improved key customer service, reliability, and safety metrics and
continues to actively pursue additional improvements.

Customers

As of
December 31, 2009, the Utility operating companies provided retail electric and

include an energy cost recovery rider to recover fuel and purchased energy costs
in monthly bills.  The rider utilizes prior calendar year energy costs
and projected energy sales for the twelve-month period commencing on April 1 of
each year to develop an energy cost rate, which is redetermined annually and
includes a true-up adjustment reflecting the over-recovery or under-recovery,
including carrying charges, of the energy cost for the prior calendar
year.  The energy cost recovery rider tariff also allows an interim
rate request depending upon the level of over- or under-recovery of fuel and
purchased energy costs.  In December 2007, the APSC issued an order
stating that Entergy Arkansas' energy cost recovery rider will remain in effect,
and any future termination of the rider would be subject to eighteen months
advance notice by the APSC, which would occur following notice and
hearing.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of
Entergy Arkansas' energy cost recovery rider proceedings before the
APSC.

Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana

Fuel
Recovery

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's
electric rates include a fuel adjustment clause designed to recover the cost of
fuel and purchased power costs.  The fuel adjustment clause contains a
surcharge or credit for deferred fuel expense and related carrying charges
arising from the monthly reconciliation of actual fuel costs incurred with fuel
cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges.

To help stabilize electricity costs,
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana received approval from the LPSC to hedge its
exposure to natural gas price volatility through the use of financial
instruments.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana hedges approximately
one-third of the projected exposure to natural gas price changes for the gas
used to serve its native electric load for all months of the
year.  The hedge quantity is reviewed on an annual basis.

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's gas
rates include a purchased gas adjustment clause based on estimated gas costs for
the billing month adjusted by a surcharge or credit that arises from an annual
reconciliation of fuel costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to
customers, including carrying charges.

To help stabilize retail gas costs,
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana received approval from the LPSC to hedge its
exposure to natural gas price volatility for its gas purchased for resale
through the use of financial instruments.  Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana hedges approximately one-half of the projected natural gas volumes
used to serve its natural gas customers for November through
March.  The hedge quantity is reviewed on an annual
basis.

Fuel
Recovery

Entergy Louisiana's rate schedules
include a fuel adjustment clause designed to recover the cost of fuel and
purchased power costs.  The fuel adjustment clause contains a
surcharge or credit for deferred fuel expense and related carrying charges
arising from the monthly reconciliation of actual fuel costs incurred with fuel
cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges.

In the Delaney vs. Entergy Louisiana
proceeding, the LPSC ordered Entergy Louisiana, beginning with the May 2000 fuel
adjustment clause filing, to re-price costs flowed through its fuel adjustment
clause related to the Evangeline gas contract so that the price included for
fuel adjustment clause recovery shall thereafter be at the rate of the Henry Hub
first of the month cash market price (as reported by the publication

Inside FERC

) plus $0.24 per
mmBtu for the month for which the fuel adjustment clause is calculated,
irrespective of the actual cost for the Evangeline contract quantity reflected
in that month's fuel adjustment clause.

To help stabilize electricity costs,
Entergy Louisiana received approval from the LPSC in 2001 to hedge its exposure
to natural gas price volatility through the use of financial
instruments.  Entergy Louisiana hedges approximately one-third of the
projected exposure to natural gas price changes for the gas used to serve its
native electric load for all months of the year.  The hedge quantity
is reviewed on an annual basis.

In September 2002, Entergy Louisiana
settled a proceeding that concerned a contract entered into by Entergy Louisiana
to purchase, through 2031, energy generated by a hydroelectric facility known as
the Vidalia project.  In the settlement, the LPSC approved Entergy
Louisiana's proposed treatment of the regulatory effect of the benefit from a
tax accounting election related to that project.  In general, the
settlement permits Entergy Louisiana to keep a portion of the tax benefit in
exchange for bearing the risk associated with sustaining the tax
treatment.  The LPSC settlement divided the term of the Vidalia
contract into two segments: 2002-2012 and 2013-2031. During the first eight
years of the 2002-2012 segment, Entergy Louisiana agreed to credit rates by
flowing through its fuel adjustment calculation $11 million each year, beginning
monthly in October 2002.  Entergy Louisiana must credit rates in this
way and by this amount even if Entergy Louisiana is unable to sustain the tax
deduction.  Entergy Louisiana also must credit rates by $11 million
each year for an additional two years unless either the tax accounting method
elected is retroactively repealed or the IRS denies the entire deduction related
to the tax accounting method.  In addition, in accordance with an LPSC
settlement, Entergy Louisiana credited rates in August 2007 by $11.8 million
(including interest) as a result of a settlement with the IRS of the 2001 tax
treatment of the Vidalia contract.  Entergy Louisiana agreed to credit
ratepayers additional amounts unless the tax accounting election was not
sustained.  During the years 2013-2031, Entergy Louisiana and its
ratepayers would share the remaining benefits of this tax accounting
election.  Note 8 to the financial statements contains further
discussion of the obligations related to the Vidalia project.

Fuel
Recovery

Entergy Mississippi's rate schedules
include energy cost recovery riders to recover fuel and purchased energy
costs.  The rider utilizes projected energy costs filed quarterly by
Entergy Mississippi to develop an energy cost rate.  The energy cost
rate is redetermined each calendar quarter and includes a true-up adjustment
reflecting the over-recovery or under-recovery of the energy cost as of the
second quarter preceding the redetermination.

Power Management
Rider

The MPSC
approved the purchase of the Attala power plant in November 2005.  In
December 2005, the MPSC issued an order approving the investment cost recovery
through its power management rider and limited the recovery to a period that
begins with the closing date of the purchase and ends the earlier of the date
costs are incorporated into base rates or December 31, 2006.  As a
consequence of the events surrounding Entergy Mississippi's ongoing efforts to
recover storm restoration costs associated with Hurricane Katrina, in October
2006, the MPSC approved a revision to Entergy Mississippi's power management
rider.  The revision has the effect of allowing Entergy Mississippi to
recover the annual ownership costs of the Attala plant until such time as a
general rate case is filed.

To help stabilize electricity costs,
Entergy Mississippi received approval from the MPSC to hedge its exposure to
natural gas price volatility through the use of financial

Entergy New Orleans' electric rate
schedules include a fuel adjustment tariff designed to reflect no more than
targeted fuel and purchased power costs, adjusted by a surcharge or credit for
deferred fuel expense arising from the monthly reconciliation of actual fuel and
purchased power costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers,
including carrying charges.  In June 2006, the City Council authorized
the recovery of all Grand Gulf costs through Entergy New Orleans' fuel
adjustment clause (a significant portion of Grand Gulf costs was previously
recovered through base rates), and continued that authorization in approving the
October 2006 formula rate plan filing settlement.  Effective June
2009, the majority of Grand Gulf costs were realigned to base rates and are no
longer flowed through the fuel adjustment clause.

Entergy New Orleans' gas rate schedules
include a purchased gas adjustment to reflect estimated gas costs for the
billing month, adjusted by a surcharge or credit similar to that included in the
electric fuel adjustment clause, including carrying charges.  In
October 2005, the City Council approved modification of the current gas cost
collection mechanism effective November 2005 in order to address concerns
regarding its fluctuations, particularly during the winter heating
season.  The modifications are intended to minimize fluctuations in
gas rates during the winter months.

To help stabilize retail gas costs,
Entergy New Orleans received approval from the City Council to hedge its
exposure to natural gas price volatility for its gas purchased for resale
through the use of financial instruments.  Entergy New Orleans hedges

Entergy
Texas

Fuel
Recovery

Entergy Texas' rate schedules include a
fixed fuel factor to recover fuel and purchased power costs, including carrying
charges, not recovered in base rates.  The fixed fuel factor formula
was revised and approved by a PUCT order in August 2006.  The new
formula was implemented in September 2006.  Under the new method,
semi-annual revisions of the fixed fuel factor will continue to be made in March
and September based on the expected change in the market price of natural gas
over the next 12 months.  The method also accounts for changes in
resource mix and retail sales.  To the extent actual costs vary from
the fixed fuel factor, refunds or surcharges are required or
permitted.  The amounts collected under the fixed fuel factor through
the start of retail open access are subject to fuel reconciliation proceedings
before the PUCT.  The PUCT fuel cost reviews are discussed in Note 2
to the financial statements.

Franchises

Entergy Arkansas holds exclusive
franchises to provide electric service in approximately 307 incorporated cities
and towns in Arkansas.  These franchises are unlimited in duration and
continue unless the municipalities purchase the utility property.  In
Arkansas, franchises are considered to be contracts and, therefore, are
terminable upon breach of the terms of the franchise.

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana holds
non-exclusive franchises, permits, or certificates of convenience and necessity
to provide electric service in approximately 56 incorporated municipalities and
the unincorporated areas of approximately 18 parishes, and to provide gas
service in the City of Baton Rouge and the unincorporated areas of two
parishes.  Most of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's franchises have a
term of 60 years.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's current electric
franchises expire during 2015-2046.

Entergy Louisiana holds non-exclusive
franchises to provide electric service in approximately 116 incorporated
Louisiana municipalities.  Most of these franchises have 25-year
terms.  Entergy Louisiana also supplies electric service in
approximately 353 unincorporated communities, all of which are located in the 45
Louisiana parishes in which it holds non-exclusive
franchises.  Entergy Louisiana's electric franchises expire during
2010-2036.

Entergy Mississippi has received from
the MPSC certificates of public convenience and necessity to provide electric
service to areas within 45 counties, including a number of municipalities, in
western Mississippi.  Under Mississippi statutory law, such
certificates are exclusive.  Entergy Mississippi may continue to serve
in such municipalities upon payment of a statutory franchise fee, regardless of
whether an original municipal franchise is still in existence.

Entergy New Orleans provides electric
and gas service in the City of New Orleans pursuant to city ordinances (except
electric service in Algiers, which is provided by Entergy
Louisiana).  These ordinances contain a continuing option for the City
of New Orleans to purchase Entergy New Orleans' electric and gas utility
properties.

Entergy Texas holds a certificate of
convenience and necessity from the PUCT to provide electric service to areas
within approximately 26 counties in eastern Texas, and holds non-exclusive
franchises to provide electric service in approximately 68 incorporated
municipalities.  Entergy Texas typically is granted 50-year
franchises.  Entergy Texas' electric franchises expire during

"Owned
      and Leased Capability" is the dependable load carrying capability as
      demonstrated under actual operating conditions based on the primary fuel
      (assuming no curtailments) that each station was designed to
      utilize.

The
Entergy System's load and capacity projections are reviewed periodically to
assess the need and timing for additional generating capacity and
interconnections.  These reviews consider existing and projected
demand, the availability and price of power, the location of new load, and the
economy.  Summer peak load in the Entergy System service territory has
averaged 21,036 MW from 2002-2009.  In the 2002 time period, the
Entergy System's long-term capacity resources, allowing for an adequate reserve
margin, were approximately 3,000 MW less than the total capacity required for
peak period demands.  In this time period Entergy met its capacity
shortages almost entirely through short-term power purchases in the wholesale
spot market.  In the fall of 2002, the Entergy System began a program
to add new resources to its existing generation portfolio and began a process of
issuing requests for proposals (RFP) to procure supply-side resources from
sources other than the spot market to meet the unique regional needs of the
Utility operating companies.  The Entergy System has adopted a
long-term resource strategy that calls for the bulk of capacity needs to be met
through long-term resources, whether owned or contracted.  The System
refers to this strategy as "The Portfolio Transformation
Strategy".  Over the past eight years, Portfolio Transformation has
resulted in the addition of about 4,000 MW of new long-term resources, including
approximately 900 MW of resources that are currently under regulatory
review.  Adjusting for unit deactivations of older generation,
currently, the System's portfolio of long-term resources is about 1,500 MW short
of its projected 2010 peak load plus reserve margin.  The remaining
need has been met with limited-term resource procurements.  The System
will continue to access the spot power market to economically purchase energy in
order to minimize customer cost.  In addition, Entergy considers in
its planning processes the implications of the notices from Entergy Arkansas and
Entergy Mississippi regarding their future withdrawal from the System
Agreement.  Furthermore, as with other transmission systems, there are
certain times during which congestion occurs on the Utility operating companies'
transmission system that limits the ability of the Utility operating companies
as well as other parties to fully utilize the generating resources that have
been granted transmission service.

RFP
Procurements

The RFPs issued by the Entergy System
since the fall of 2002 have sought resources needed to meet near-term summer
reliability requirements as well as longer-term resources through a broad range
of wholesale power products, including limited-term (1 to 3 years) and long-term
contractual products and asset acquisitions.  Detailed evaluation
processes have been developed to analyze submitted proposals, and, with the
exception of the January 2008 RFP and the 2008 Western Region RFP, each RFP has
been overseen by an independent monitor.  The following table
illustrates the results of the RFP process for resources acquired since the Fall
2002 RFP.  The contracts below were primarily with non-affiliated

In
      September 2009, on behalf of the Entergy operating companies, Entergy
      Services issued the Summer 2009 Long-Term RFP seeking proposals for
      long-term capacity and energy through products offered in the
      RFP.  The RFP includes a Utility self-build
      option.  The tentative RFP schedule targets resource selection
      in the third quarter 2010 and execution of definitive agreements by the
      fourth quarter 2010.

Entergy
Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans currently purchase 101 MW of capacity and
energy from Entergy Power, Inc. sourced from Independence Steam Electric Station
Unit 2.  The transaction, which originated from the Fall 2002 RFP,
included an option for Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans to acquire an
ownership interest in the unit for a total price of $80 million, subject to
various adjustments.  On March 5, 2008, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy
New Orleans provided notice of their intent to exercise the
option.  The parties are negotiating the terms and conditions of the
ownership acquisition.

In
January 2009, Entergy Texas issued an RFP seeking long-term CCGT resources for
the Western Region of the Entergy System in pursuit of multiple supply
procurement objectives.  As a result of the RFP, Entergy Services, as
agent for Entergy Texas, has signed a PPA with Exelon Generation Company, LLC to
purchase 150-300 megawatts of capacity and energy from the Tenaska Frontier
Generating Station located in Grimes County, Texas.  The PPA has an
approximately ten-year delivery term and may be terminated by Entergy Texas if
necessary regulatory approvals, including full cost recovery, are not
obtained.

In July
2009, Entergy Services issued the July 2009 Baseload RFP on behalf of Entergy
Texas, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Mississippi seeking limited-term flexible
baseload resources.  A self-supply alternative was considered and
ultimately selected from the RFP, and consists of a 336 MW limited-term
cost-based wholesale baseload purchase from Entergy Arkansas.

Other
Procurements From Third Parties

The above
table does not include resource acquisitions made outside of the RFP process,
including Entergy Mississippi's January 2006 acquisition of the 480 MW,
combined-cycle, gas-fired Attala power plant, and Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana's March 2008 acquisition of the 322 MW, simple-cycle, gas-fired
Calcasieu Generating Facility.  In addition, in October 2009 Entergy
Louisiana, LLC entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement to acquire Unit 2 of
the Acadia Energy Center, a 580 MW generating unit located near Eunice,
Louisiana from Acadia Power Partners, LLC, an independent power
producer.  The purchase is contingent on regulatory
approvals.  The above table also does not reflect various limited- and
long-term contracts that have been entered into in recent years by the Utility
operating companies as a result of bilateral negotiations.

Interconnections

The Entergy System's generating units
are interconnected by a transmission system operating at various voltages up to
500 kV.  These generating units consist primarily of steam-electric
production facilities and are centrally dispatched and
operated.  Entergy's Utility operating companies are interconnected
with many neighboring utilities.  In addition, the Utility operating
companies are members of the SERC Reliability Corporation.  The
primary purpose of SERC is to ensure the reliability and adequacy of the
electric bulk power supply in the southeast region of the United
States.  SERC is a member of the North American Electric Reliability
Corporation.

Gas
Property

As of December 31, 2009, Entergy New
Orleans distributed and transported natural gas for distribution within Algiers
and New Orleans, Louisiana, through a total of 33 miles of gas transmission
pipeline, 1,655 miles of gas distribution pipeline, and 855 miles of gas service
pipeline from the distribution mains to the customers.  As of December
31, 2009, the gas properties of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, which are located
in and around Baton Rouge, Louisiana, were not material to Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana's financial position.

Titles

The Entergy System's generating
stations are generally located on properties owned in fee simple. Most of the
substations and transmission and distribution lines are constructed on private
property or public rights-of-way pursuant to easements, servitudes, or
appropriate franchises.  Some substation properties are owned in fee
simple.  The Utility operating companies generally have the right of
eminent domain, whereby they may perfect title to, or secure easements or
servitudes on, private property for their utility operations.

Substantially all of the physical
properties and assets owned by Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana,
Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and
System Energy are subject to the liens of mortgages securing bonds issued by
those companies.  The Lewis Creek generating station is owned by

      to provide approximately 1% of its generation in 2010.

(b)

Capacity
      and energy from System Energy's interest in Grand Gulf was historically
      allocated as follows: Entergy Arkansas - 36%; Entergy Louisiana - 14%;
      Entergy Mississippi - 33%; and Entergy New Orleans -
      17%.  Pursuant to purchased power agreements, Entergy Arkansas
      is selling a portion of its owned capacity and energy from Grand Gulf to
      Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and
      Entergy New Orleans.

Natural
Gas

The Utility operating companies have
long-term firm and short-term interruptible gas contracts for both supply and
gas transportation.  Long-term firm contracts for power plants
comprise less than 15% of the Utility operating companies' total
requirements.  Short-term contracts and spot-market purchases satisfy
additional gas requirements.  Entergy Texas owns a gas storage
facility that provides reliable and flexible natural gas service to certain
generating stations.

Entergy Louisiana has a long-term
natural gas supply contract, which expires in 2012, in which Entergy Louisiana
agreed to purchase natural gas in annual amounts equal to approximately
one-third of its projected annual fuel requirements for certain generating
units.  Annual demand charges associated with this contract are
estimated to be $6.6 million.

Many factors, including wellhead
deliverability, storage and pipeline capacity, and demand requirements of end
users, influence the availability and price of natural gas supplies for power
plants.  Demand is tied to weather conditions as well as to the prices
and availability of other energy sources.  Pursuant to federal and
state regulations, gas supplies to power plants may be interrupted during
periods of shortage.  To the extent natural gas supplies are disrupted
or natural gas prices significantly increase, the Utility operating companies
will use alternate fuels, such as oil, or rely to a larger extent on coal,
nuclear generation, and purchased power.

Coal

Entergy Arkansas has a long-term
contract for low-sulfur Powder River Basin (PRB) coal which expires in 2011 and
is expected to provide for approximately 40% of the total expected coal
requirements for 2010.  Over the past three years, Entergy Arkansas
has committed to seven medium-term (one- to three-year) contracts that will
supply approximately 55% of the total coal supply needs in
2010.  These contracts are staggered in term so that not all contracts
have to be renewed the same year.  The additional 5% of total coal
requirements will be satisfied by spot market or over-the-counter
purchases.  Based on greater PRB coal deliveries and the high cost of
foreign coal, no alternative coal consumption is expected at Entergy Arkansas
during 2010.  Entergy Arkansas has an existing long-term railroad
transportation contract that will provide all of Entergy Arkansas' coal
transportation requirements for 2010 and will provide most of the transportation
requirements for several years beyond 2010.

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana has
executed three medium-term contracts for the supply of low-sulfur PRB coal for
Nelson Unit 6 that will expire in late 2010 and 2011.  These three
contracts will supply approximately 95% of Nelson Unit 6 coal needs in
2010.  Additional PRB coal will be purchased through spot market or
over-the-counter purchases provided that adequate transportation is available
from BNSF Railway Company.  For the same reasons as for Entergy
Arkansas' plants, no alternative coal consumption is expected at Nelson Unit 6
during 2010.  Coal will be transported to Nelson via an existing rail
transportation agreement with BNSF Railway Company during 2010.

For the year 2009, coal transportation
delivery to all Utility operating company coal-fired units have met coal demand
at the plants.  It is expected that improved delivery times
experienced in 2009 will continue through 2010.  Both Entergy Arkansas
and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana control a sufficient number of railcars to
satisfy the rail transportation requirement.

The operator of Big Cajun 2 - Unit 3,
Louisiana Generating, LLC, has advised Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy
Texas that it has adequate rail car and barge capacity to meet the volumes of
low-sulfur PRB coal requested for 2010.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana
and Entergy Texas coal nomination requests to Big Cajun 2 - Unit 3 are made on
an annual basis.

Nuclear
Fuel

The nuclear fuel cycle consists of the
following:

·

mining
      and milling of uranium ore to produce a
  concentrate;

·

conversion
      of the concentrate to uranium hexafluoride
gas;

·

enrichment
      of the uranium hexafluoride gas;

·

fabrication
      of nuclear fuel assemblies for use in fueling nuclear reactors;
      and

·

disposal
      of spent fuel.

System Fuels, a company owned by
Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New
Orleans, is responsible for contracts to acquire nuclear material to be used in
fueling Entergy's Utility nuclear units, except for River
Bend.  System Fuels also maintains inventories of such materials
during the various stages of processing.  The Utility operating
companies, except Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, purchase enriched uranium
hexafluoride from System Fuels, but contract separately for the fabrication of
their own nuclear fuel.  The requirements for River Bend are met
pursuant to contracts made by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana.  All
contracts for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel are between the Department of
Energy (DOE) and each of the nuclear power plants.

Based upon currently planned fuel
cycles, Entergy's Utility and Non-Utility Nuclear nuclear units have a
diversified portfolio of contracts and inventory that provides substantially
adequate nuclear fuel materials and conversion and enrichment services at what
Entergy believes are reasonably predictable or fixed prices through most of
2010, and with substantial additional amounts after that
time.  Entergy's ability to purchase nuclear fuel at reasonably
predictable prices, however, depends upon the creditworthiness and performance
reliability of uranium miners, as well as upon the structure of Entergy's
contracts for the purchase of nuclear fuel.  For example, some of the
supply under Entergy's contracts for nuclear fuel is effectively on a
"mine-contingent" basis, which means that if applicable mines are unable to
supply sufficient uranium, Entergy may be required to purchase some nuclear fuel
from another supplier.  There are a number of possible alternate
suppliers that may be accessed to mitigate such an event, including potentially
drawing upon Entergy's inventory intended for later generation periods depending
upon its risk management strategy at that time, although the pricing of any such
alternate uranium supply from the market will be dependent upon the market for
uranium supply at that time.  In addition, some nuclear fuel contracts
are on a non-fixed price basis subject to prevailing prices at the time of
delivery.

Uranium supply became extremely limited
in 2006 and 2007, but this supply shortfall was substantially eliminated in
2008.  Market prices for uranium concentrates increased from about $7
per pound in December 2000 to a range of $70 to $135 per pound in
2007.  In 2008, however, market prices for uranium concentrates ranged
from $45 to $90 per pound and from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009
ranged from $40 to $55 per pound.  The effects of market price changes
may be reduced and deferred by risk management strategies (such as buying for
inventory or entering into forward physical contracts at fixed prices when
Entergy believes it is appropriate and useful).  Entergy buys uranium
from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries, and
from time to time purchases from nearly all qualified reliable major market
participants worldwide that sell into the U.S.

The recent higher nuclear fuel market
prices of 2006-2009 compared to the 2000-2005 period affects the U.S. nuclear
utility industry, including Entergy, first in cash flow requirements for fuel
acquisition, and then, some time later, in nuclear fuel expenses.  For
example, for a nuclear fleet the size of Entergy's, the current market value of
annual enriched uranium requirements has increased by several hundred million
dollars compared to about five years ago.  As nuclear fuel installed
in the core in nuclear power plants is replaced fractionally over an approximate
five-year period, nuclear fuel expense is beginning to, and will eventually with
a time lag, reflect current market prices and can be expected to increase from
the previously reported industry levels of about 0.5 cents per kWh to closer to
1.0 cent per kWh.  Entergy's nuclear fuel contract portfolio has
provided a degree of price hedging against the full extent of market prices
through 2010, but market trends will eventually affect the costs of all nuclear
plant operators.


Part I
Item 1

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy each have made arrangements to
lease nuclear fuel and related equipment and services.  The lessors
finance the acquisition and ownership of nuclear fuel through credit agreements
and the issuance of notes.  These arrangements are subject to periodic
renewal.  See Note 10 to the financial statements for a discussion of
nuclear fuel leases.

Natural Gas Purchased for
Resale

Entergy New Orleans has several
suppliers of natural gas.  Its system is interconnected with three
interstate and three intrastate pipelines.  Entergy New Orleans has a
"no-notice" service gas purchase contract with Atmos Energy which guarantees
Entergy New Orleans gas delivery at specific delivery points and at any volume
within the minimum and maximum set forth in the contract amounts.  The
Atmos Energy gas supply is transported to Entergy New Orleans pursuant to a
transportation service agreement with Gulf South Pipeline Co.  This service
is subject to FERC-approved rates.  Entergy New Orleans also makes
interruptible spot market purchases.  In recent years, natural gas
deliveries to Entergy New Orleans have been subject primarily to weather-related
curtailments.

As a result of the implementation of
FERC-mandated interstate pipeline restructuring in 1993, curtailments of
interstate gas supply could occur if Entergy New Orleans' suppliers failed to
perform their obligations to deliver gas under their supply agreements. 
Gulf South Pipeline Co. could curtail transportation capacity only in the event
of pipeline system constraints.

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana purchases
natural gas for resale under a firm contract from Enbridge Marketing (U.S.)
Inc.  In August 2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana entered into a new
five-year contract with Enbridge Marketing (U.S.) Inc.  The gas is
delivered through a combination of intrastate and interstate
pipelines.

Federal
Regulation of the Utility

State or local regulatory authorities,
as described above, regulate the retail rates of the Utility operating
companies.  FERC regulates wholesale rates (including intrasystem
sales pursuant to the System Agreement) and interstate transmission of
electricity, as well as rates for System Energy's sales of capacity and energy
from Grand Gulf to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and
Entergy New Orleans pursuant to the Unit Power Sales Agreement.

System Agreement

(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy
Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy
Texas)

The Utility operating companies
historically have engaged in the coordinated planning, construction, and
operation of generating and bulk transmission facilities under the terms of the
System Agreement, which is a rate schedule that has been approved by the
FERC.  Under the terms of the System Agreement, generating capacity
and other power resources are jointly operated by the Utility operating
companies.  The System Agreement provides, among other things, that
parties having generating reserves greater than their allocated share of
reserves (long companies) shall receive payments from those parties having
generating reserves that are less than their allocated share of reserves (short
companies). Such payments are at amounts sufficient to cover certain of the long
companies' costs for intermediate and peaking oil/gas-fired generation,
including operating expenses, fixed charges on debt, dividend requirements on
preferred equity, and a fair rate of return on common equity
investment.  Under the System Agreement, these charges are based on
costs associated with the long companies' steam electric generating units fueled
by oil or gas and having an annual average heat rate above 10,000
Btu/kWh.  In addition, for all energy exchanged among the Utility
operating companies under the System Agreement, the companies purchasing
exchange energy are required to pay the cost of fuel consumed in generating such
energy plus a charge to cover other associated costs.

Citing its concerns that the benefits
of its continued participation in the current form of the System Agreement have
been seriously eroded, in December 2005, Entergy Arkansas submitted its notice
that it will terminate its participation in the current System Agreement
effective ninety-six (96) months from the date of the notice or such earlier
date as authorized by the FERC.  Entergy Arkansas indicated, however,
that a properly structured replacement agreement could be a viable
alternative.  In November 2007, pursuant to the provisions of the
System Agreement, Entergy Mississippi provided its written notice to terminate
its participation in the System Agreement effective ninety-six (96) months from
the


Part I
Item 1

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

date of
the notice or such earlier date as authorized by the FERC.  In light
of the notices of Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi to terminate
participation in the current System Agreement, in January 2008 the LPSC
unanimously voted to direct the LPSC Staff to begin evaluating the potential for
a new agreement.  Likewise, the New Orleans City Council opened a
docket to gather information on progress towards a successor
agreement.

In November 2009 the FERC accepted the
notices of cancellation and determined that Entergy Arkansas and Entergy
Mississippi are permitted to withdraw from the System Agreement following the 96
month notice period without payment of a fee or being required to otherwise
compensate the remaining Utility operating companies as a result of
withdrawal.  The FERC stated it expected Entergy and all interested
parties to move forward and develop details of all needed successor arrangements
and encouraged Entergy to file its Section 205 filing for post 2013 arrangements
as soon as possible.  The LPSC and the City Council have requested
rehearing of the FERC's decision.

System Energy and Related
Agreements

System Energy recovers costs related to
its interest in Grand Gulf through rates charged to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy
Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans for capacity and energy
under the Unit Power Sales Agreement (described below).  In December
1995, System Energy commenced a rate proceeding at the FERC.  In July
2001, the rate proceeding became final, with the FERC approving a prospective
10.94% return on equity.  The FERC's decision also affected other
aspects of System Energy's charges to the Utility operating companies that it
supplies with power.  In 1998, the FERC approved requests by Entergy
Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi to accelerate a portion of their Grand Gulf
purchased power obligations.  Entergy Arkansas' and Entergy
Mississippi's acceleration of Grand Gulf purchased power obligations ceased
effective July 2001 and July 2003, respectively, as approved by
FERC.

Unit
Power Sales Agreement

The Unit Power Sales Agreement
allocates capacity, energy, and the related costs from System Energy's current
90% ownership and leasehold interests in Grand Gulf to Entergy Arkansas (36%),
Entergy Louisiana (14%), Entergy Mississippi (33%), and Entergy New Orleans
(17%). Each of these companies is obligated to make payments to System Energy
for its entitlement of capacity and energy on a full cost-of-service basis
regardless of the quantity of energy delivered, so long as Grand Gulf remains in
commercial operation.  Payments under the Unit Power Sales Agreement
are System Energy's only source of operating revenue.  The financial
condition of System Energy depends upon the continued commercial operation of
Grand Gulf and the receipt of such payments.  Entergy Arkansas,
Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans generally
recover payments made under the Unit Power Sales Agreement through rates charged
to their customers.

In the case of Entergy Arkansas and
Entergy Louisiana, payments are also recovered through sales of electricity from
their respective retained shares of Grand Gulf.  Under a settlement
agreement entered into with the APSC in 1985 and amended in 1988, Entergy
Arkansas retains 22% of its 36% share of Grand Gulf-related costs and recovers
the remaining 78% of its share in rates.  In the event that Entergy
Arkansas is not able to sell its retained share to third parties, it may sell
such energy to its retail customers at a price equal to its avoided cost, which
is currently less than Entergy Arkansas' cost from its retained
share.  Entergy Arkansas has life-of-resources purchased power
agreements with Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans that sell a portion of
the output of Entergy Arkansas' retained share of Grand Gulf to those
companies.  In a series of LPSC orders, court decisions,
and


Part I
Item 1

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

agreements
from late 1985 to mid-1988, Entergy Louisiana was granted rate relief with
respect to costs associated with Entergy Louisiana's share of capacity and
energy from Grand Gulf, subject to certain terms and
conditions.  Entergy Louisiana retains and does not recover from
retail ratepayers 18% of its 14% share of the costs of Grand Gulf capacity and
energy and recovers the remaining 82% of its share in rates. Entergy Louisiana
is allowed to recover through the fuel adjustment clause 4.6 cents per kWh for
the energy related to its retained portion of these
costs.  Alternatively, Entergy Louisiana may sell such energy to
non-affiliated parties at prices above the fuel adjustment clause recovery
amount, subject to the LPSC's approval.

Availability
Agreement

The Availability Agreement among System
Energy and Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy
New Orleans was entered into in 1974 in connection with the financing by System
Energy of Grand Gulf. The Availability Agreement provides that System Energy
make available to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and
Entergy New Orleans all capacity and energy available from System Energy's share
of Grand Gulf.

Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana,
Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans also agreed severally to pay System
Energy monthly for the right to receive capacity and energy from Grand Gulf in
amounts that (when added to any amounts received by System Energy under the Unit
Power Sales Agreement) would at least equal System Energy's total operating
expenses for Grand Gulf (including depreciation at a specified rate) and
interest charges. The September 1989 write-off of System Energy's
investment in Grand Gulf 2, amounting to approximately $900 million, is being
amortized for Availability Agreement purposes over 27 years.

The allocation percentages under the
Availability Agreement are fixed as follows: Entergy Arkansas - 17.1%; Entergy
Louisiana - 26.9%; Entergy Mississippi - 31.3%; and Entergy New Orleans - 24.7%.
The allocation percentages under the Availability Agreement would remain in
effect and would govern payments made under such agreement in the event of a
shortfall of funds available to System Energy from other sources, including
payments under the Unit Power Sales Agreement.

System Energy has assigned its rights
to payments and advances from Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy
Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans under the Availability Agreement as
security for its first mortgage bonds and reimbursement obligations to certain
banks providing letters of credit in connection with the equity funding of the
sale and leaseback transactions described in Note 10 to the financial statements
under "

Sale and
Leaseback Transactions

-
Grand Gulf Lease Obligations

."  In these assignments, Entergy
Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans
further agreed that, in the event they were prohibited by governmental action
from making payments under the Availability Agreement (for example, if FERC
reduced or disallowed such payments as constituting excessive rates), they would
then make subordinated advances to System Energy in the same amounts and at the
same times as the prohibited payments. System Energy would not be allowed to
repay these subordinated advances so long as it remained in default under the
related indebtedness or in other similar circumstances.

Each of the assignment agreements
relating to the Availability Agreement provides that Entergy Arkansas, Entergy
Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans will make payments
directly to System Energy. However, if there is an event of default, those
payments must be made directly to the holders of indebtedness that are the
beneficiaries of such assignment agreements. The payments must be made pro rata
according to the amount of the respective obligations secured.

The obligations of Entergy Arkansas,
Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans to make payments
under the Availability Agreement are subject to the receipt and continued
effectiveness of all necessary regulatory approvals.  Sales of
capacity and energy under the Availability Agreement would require that the
Availability Agreement be submitted to FERC for approval with respect to the
terms of such sale. No such filing with FERC has been made because sales of
capacity and energy from Grand Gulf are being made pursuant to the Unit Power
Sales Agreement.  If, for any reason, sales of capacity and energy are
made in the future pursuant to the Availability Agreement, the jurisdictional
portions of the Availability Agreement would be submitted to FERC for
approval.


Part I
Item 1

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

Since commercial operation of Grand
Gulf began, payments under the Unit Power Sales Agreement to System Energy have
exceeded the amounts payable under the Availability Agreement. Therefore, no
payments under the Availability Agreement have ever been required.  If
Entergy Arkansas or Entergy Mississippi fails to make its Unit Power Sales
Agreement payments, and System Energy is unable to obtain funds from other
sources, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans could become subject to
claims or demands by System Energy or its creditors for payments or advances
under the Availability Agreement (or the assignments thereof) equal to the
difference between their required Unit Power Sales Agreement payments and their
required Availability Agreement payments because their Availability Agreement
obligations exceed their Unit Power Sales Agreement obligations.

The Availability Agreement may be
terminated, amended, or modified by mutual agreement of the parties thereto,
without further consent of any assignees or other creditors.

Capital
Funds Agreement

System Energy and Entergy Corporation
have entered into the Capital Funds Agreement, whereby Entergy Corporation has
agreed to supply System Energy with sufficient capital to (i) maintain System
Energy's equity capital at an amount equal to a minimum of 35% of its total
capitalization (excluding short-term debt) and (ii) permit the continued
commercial operation of Grand Gulf and pay in full all indebtedness for borrowed
money of System Energy when due.

Entergy Corporation has entered into
various supplements to the Capital Funds Agreement. System Energy has assigned
its rights under such supplements as security for its first mortgage bonds and
for reimbursement obligations to certain banks providing letters of credit in
connection with the equity funding of the sale and leaseback transactions
described in Note 10 to the financial statements under "

Sale and
Leaseback Transactions

-
Grand Gulf Lease Obligations

."  Each such supplement provides
that permitted indebtedness for borrowed money incurred by System Energy in
connection with the financing of Grand Gulf may be secured by System Energy's
rights under the Capital Funds Agreement on a pro rata basis (except for the
Specific Payments, as defined below). In addition, in the supplements to the
Capital Funds Agreement relating to the specific indebtedness being secured,
Entergy Corporation has agreed to make cash capital contributions directly to
System Energy sufficient to enable System Energy to make payments when due on
such indebtedness (Specific Payments). However, if there is an event of default,
Entergy Corporation must make those payments directly to the holders of
indebtedness benefiting from the supplemental agreements. The payments (other
than the Specific Payments) must be made pro rata according to the amount of the
respective obligations benefiting from the supplemental agreements.

The Capital Funds Agreement may be
terminated, amended, or modified by mutual agreement of the parties thereto,
upon obtaining the consent, if required, of those holders of System Energy's
indebtedness then outstanding who have received the assignments of the Capital
Funds Agreement.

Service
Companies

Entergy
Services, a corporation wholly-owned by Entergy Corporation, provides
management, administrative, accounting, legal, engineering, and other services
primarily to the Utility operating companies. Entergy Operations is also
wholly-owned by Entergy Corporation and provides nuclear management, operations
and maintenance services under contract for ANO, River Bend, Waterford 3, and
Grand Gulf, subject to the owner oversight of Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf
States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy,
respectively.  Entergy Services and Entergy Operations provide their
services to the Utility operating companies and System Energy on an "at cost"
basis, pursuant to cost allocation methodologies for these service agreements
that were approved by the FERC.

Jurisdictional
Separation of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. into Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and
Entergy Texas

Effective December 31, 2007, Entergy
Gulf States, Inc. completed a jurisdictional separation into two vertically
integrated utility companies, one operating under the sole retail jurisdiction
of the PUCT, Entergy Texas, and the other operating under the sole retail
jurisdiction of the LPSC, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana.  Management
believes that the jurisdictional separation will better align Entergy Gulf
States, Inc.'s Louisiana and Texas operations to serve customers in those states
and to operate consistent with state-specific regulatory requirements as the
utility regulatory environments in those jurisdictions evolve.  The
jurisdictional separation provides for regulation of each separated company by a
single retail regulator, which should reduce regulatory complexity.

Entergy Texas now owns all Entergy Gulf
States, Inc. distribution and transmission assets located in Texas, the
gas-fired generating plants located in Texas, undivided 42.5% ownership shares
of Entergy Gulf States, Inc.'s 70% ownership interest in Nelson 6 and 42%
ownership interest in Big Cajun 2, Unit 3, which are coal-fired generating
plants located in Louisiana, and other assets and contract rights to the extent
related to utility operations in Texas.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana
now owns all of the remaining assets that were owned by Entergy Gulf States,
Inc.  On a book value basis, approximately 58.1% of the Entergy Gulf
States, Inc. assets were allocated to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and
approximately 41.9% were allocated to Entergy Texas.

Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana remains primarily liable for all of the long-term debt
issued by Entergy Gulf States, Inc. that was outstanding on December 31,
2007.  Under a debt assumption agreement with Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana, Entergy Texas assumed its pro rata share of this long-term debt,
which was $1.079 billion, or approximately 46%, of which $168 million remains
outstanding at December 31, 2009.  The pro rata share of the long-term
debt assumed by Entergy Texas was determined by first determining the net assets
for each company on a book value basis, and then calculating a debt assumption
ratio that resulted in the common equity ratios for each company being
approximately the same as the Entergy Gulf States, Inc. common equity ratio
immediately prior to the jurisdictional separation.  Entergy Texas'
debt assumption does not discharge Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's liability for
the long-term debt.  To secure its debt assumption obligations,
Entergy Texas granted to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana a first lien on Entergy
Texas' assets that were previously subject to the Entergy Gulf States, Inc.
mortgage.  Entergy Texas has until December 31, 2010 to repay the
assumed debt.  In addition, Entergy Texas, as the owner of Entergy
Gulf States Reconstruction Funding I, LLC ("EGSRF I"), reports the $329.5
million of senior secured transition bonds ("securitization bonds") issued by
EGSRF I as long-term debt on its consolidated balance sheet.  The
securitization bonds are non-recourse to Entergy Texas.

Entergy
Texas will purchase from Entergy Gulf States Louisiana pursuant to a
life-of-unit purchased power agreement (PPA) a 42.5% share of capacity and
energy from the 70% of River Bend subject to retail
regulation.  Entergy Texas was allocated a share of River Bend's
nuclear and environmental liabilities that is identical to the share of the
plant's output purchased by Entergy Texas under the PPA.  Entergy Gulf
States Louisiana will purchase a 57.5% share of capacity and energy from the
gas-fired generating plants owned by Entergy Texas, and Entergy Texas will
purchase a 42.5% share of capacity and energy from the gas-fired generating
plants owned by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana.  The PPAs associated
with the gas-fired generating plants will terminate when retail open access
commences in Entergy Texas' jurisdiction or when the unit(s) is no longer
dispatched by the Entergy System.  If Entergy Texas implements retail
open access, it will terminate its participation in the System Agreement,
except for the portion of the System Agreement related to transmission
equalization.  The dispatch and operation of the generating plants
will not change as a result of the jurisdictional separation.

The
jurisdictional separation occurred through completion of the following
steps:

·

Through
      a Texas statutory merger-by-division, Entergy Gulf States, Inc. was
      renamed as Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Inc., a Texas corporation, and
      the new Texas business corporation Entergy Texas, Inc. was
      formed.

·

Entergy
      Gulf States, Inc. allocated the assets described above to Entergy Texas,
      and all of the capital stock of Entergy Texas was issued directly to
      Entergy Gulf States, Inc.'s parent company, Entergy
      Corporation.

·

Entergy
      Corporation formed EGS Holdings, Inc., a Texas corporation, and
      contributed all of the common stock of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Inc.
      to EGS Holdings, Inc.

Entergy

Entergy
Louisiana Corporate Restructuring

Effective
December 31, 2005, Entergy Louisiana, LLC, a limited liability company organized
under the laws of the State of Texas, as part of a restructuring involving a
Texas statutory merger-by-division succeeded to all of the regulated utility
operations of Entergy Louisiana, Inc.  Entergy Louisiana, LLC was
allocated substantially all of the property and other assets of Entergy
Louisiana, Inc., including all assets used to provide retail and wholesale
electric service to Entergy Louisiana, Inc.'s customers.  Entergy
Louisiana, LLC also assumed substantially all of the liabilities of Entergy
Louisiana, Inc., including all of its debt securities and leases but excluding
the outstanding preferred stock of Entergy Louisiana, Inc.

As the
operator of Entergy Louisiana, Inc.'s retail utility operations, Entergy
Louisiana, LLC is subject to the jurisdiction of the LPSC over electric service,
rates and charges to the same extent that the LPSC possessed jurisdiction over
Entergy Louisiana, Inc.'s retail utility operations.  The
restructuring implemented a recommendation from the LPSC staff, intended to
reduce corporate franchise taxes, and is expected to result in a decrease in
that component of Entergy Louisiana, LLC's rates to its Louisiana retail
customers.

On
December 31, 2005, and immediately prior to the formation of Entergy Louisiana,
LLC, Entergy Louisiana, Inc. changed its state of incorporation from Louisiana
to Texas and its name to Entergy Louisiana Holdings, Inc.  Upon the
effectiveness of the statutory merger-by-division on December 31, 2005, Entergy
Louisiana, LLC was organized and Entergy Louisiana Holdings held all of Entergy
Louisiana, LLC's common membership interests.  All of the common
membership interests of Entergy Louisiana, LLC continue to be held by Entergy
Louisiana Holdings and all of the common stock of Entergy Louisiana Holdings
continues to be held by Entergy Corporation.  As part of the
merger-by-division, Entergy Louisiana Holdings succeeded to Entergy Louisiana,
Inc.'s rights and obligations with respect to Entergy Louisiana, Inc.'s
outstanding preferred stock, which had an aggregate par value of approximately
$100 million.  In June 2006, Entergy Louisiana Holdings redeemed all
of its preferred stock and amended its charter to eliminate authority to issue
any future series of preferred stock.

Although
Entergy Louisiana, LLC has been consolidated for financial reporting purposes
since its inception, it did not join in the filing of Entergy's consolidated
federal income tax return through the tax year 2007.  Entergy Louisiana,
LLC filed separate federal income tax returns, paid federal income taxes on a
stand-alone basis, and was not a party to the Entergy System's intercompany tax
allocation agreement through 2007.  As such, Entergy Louisiana, LLC may
have made elections for tax purposes that may differ from those made by the
Entergy consolidated tax group, which may result in Entergy Louisiana, LLC
having more exposure to tax liability than it would have had, had it been
included in the Entergy consolidated tax return.  Beginning in 2008,
Entergy Louisiana, LLC joined the consolidated federal income tax return and
participated in the Entergy System's intercompany tax allocation
agreement.  Entergy Louisiana Holdings will continue as a party to the
Entergy System's intercompany tax allocation agreement.

After the
merger-by-division, Entergy Louisiana, LLC issued $100 million of its preferred
membership interests, which grant the holders thereof the power to vote
together, as a single class, with Entergy Corporation as the holder of the
common membership interests.  The preferred membership interests have
approximately 23% of the total voting power.  Because Entergy
Corporation, indirectly through Entergy Louisiana Holdings, owns all of the
common membership interests in Entergy Louisiana, LLC, Entergy Corporation will
be able to elect the entire board of directors of Entergy Louisiana, LLC, except
in certain circumstances if distributions on Entergy Louisiana, LLC's preferred
membership interests are in arrears.

Non-Utility
Nuclear

Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear business
owns and operates six nuclear power plants, five of which are located in the
Northeast United States, with the sixth located in Michigan, and is primarily
focused on selling electric power produced by those plants to wholesale
customers.  Non-Utility Nuclear's revenues are primarily derived from
sales of energy and sales of generation capacity.  This business also
provides operations and management services to nuclear power plants owned by
other utilities in the United States.  Operations and management
services, including decommissioning services, are provided through Entergy's
wholly-owned subsidiary, Entergy Nuclear, Inc.

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

Non-Utility
Nuclear also owns two non-operating facilities, Big Rock Point in Michigan and
Indian Point 1 in New

York,
that were acquired when Non-Utility Nuclear purchased the Palisades and Indian
Point 2 nuclear plants, respectively.  These facilities are in various
stages of the decommissioning process.

The operating licenses for Vermont
Yankee, Pilgrim, Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 expire in 2012 to
2015.  License renewal applications are pending at the NRC for these
four plants, and are the subject of public and local political debate as well as
state permitting requirements.  Various parties have expressed
opposition to the pending license renewal applications

.

There is an
ongoing proceeding before the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board (ASLB) of the
NRC and contentions have been admitted for litigation regarding the Indian Point
License renewals.  The ASLB has completed its proceedings regarding
Vermont Yankee, but the New England Coalition filed a petition for NRC review of
the ASLB's decision on July 23, 2009.

Also, the ASLB has
completed its proceedings regarding Pilgrim, but Pilgrim Watch filed a petition
for NRC review of the ASLB's decision on November 12, 2008.  Both the
Vermont Yankee and Pilgrim license renewals are awaiting an NRC decision on the
petitions for review.  On September 8, 2008, the NRC granted Entergy's
request for a renewed operating license for the FitzPatrick nuclear plant, which
extends the operating license term for that plant by twenty years, to October
17, 2034.

In addition, for Vermont Yankee the
state certificates of public good to operate the plant and store spent nuclear
fuel also expire in 2012.  Non-Utility Nuclear filed an application
with the Vermont Public Service Board on March 3, 2008 for approval of continued
operations and storage of spent nuclear fuel generated after March 21,
2012.  Under Vermont law the Vermont General Assembly approval of
Non-Utility Nuclear's request is required for the request to be
granted.  During its 2009 session, which concluded in May, several
committees of the Vermont General Assembly held hearings on Vermont Yankee, but
no bill or resolution was introduced for approval of continued operation and
storage of spent nuclear fuel generated after March 21, 2012.  Entergy
had anticipated that the Vermont General Assembly might consider authorizing
continued operation of Vermont Yankee and spent fuel storage during its 2010
session, which began in January.  Governor Jim Douglas, however,
issued a statement on January 27, 2010 indicating he would not ask the Vermont
General Assembly to consider Vermont Yankee license renewal during its 2010
session pending an ongoing investigation relating to elevated levels of tritium
found in Vermont Yankee groundwater monitoring wells.  The
Governor's statement also expressed concerns about potential decommissioning
costs and about inconsistent information related to underground piping at
Vermont Yankee carrying radionuclides that was provided by Entergy Nuclear
Vermont Yankee and Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc. in a proceeding before the
Vermont Public Service Board related to extending operation of Vermont Yankee
beyond its current operating license.  Notwithstanding the Governor’s
position, on February 24, 2010, a bill to approve the continued operation of
Vermont Yankee was advanced to a vote by the Vermont Senate leadership and
defeated by a margin of 26 to 4.  This vote does not preclude the
Vermont Senate from voting again on a similar bill in the
future.  Vermont is the only state of which Entergy is aware the state
legislature has asserted that it has the authority to approve the continued
operation of a Non-Utility Nuclear plant for a renewed license
term.

In April 2007, Non-Utility Nuclear
submitted an application to the NRC to renew the operating licenses for Indian
Point 2 and 3 for an additional 20 years.  The NRC Staff currently is
performing its technical and environmental reviews of the
application.  It issued a draft supplemental environmental impact
statement in December 2008, a safety evaluation with open items in January 2009,
and a final safety evaluation report in August 2009.  The New York
Department of Environmental Conservation has taken the position that Indian
Point must obtain a new state-issued Clean Water Act Section 401 water quality
certification as part of the license renewal process.  Indian Point
also must obtain a Coastal Zone Management Act consistency determination from
the New York Department of State prior to getting its renewed
license.  For a discussion concerning the status of Non-Utility
Nuclear’s efforts to obtain these certifications and determinations, see
"Environmental Regulation, Clean Water Act" below.

The NRC is required by statute to
provide an opportunity to members of the public to request a hearing on the
Indian Point 2 and 3 license renewal application.  In early December
2007, the NRC received thirteen petitions to intervene in the license renewal
proceeding for Indian Point 2 and 3.  The petitions were filed by
various state and local government entities, including the States of New York
and Connecticut, as well as several public interest groups.  The ASLB
summarily rejected four of the thirteen petitions to


Part I
Item 1

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

intervene
in December 2007.  The nine remaining petitions contained over 160
proposed contentions, which are issues of law or fact pertaining to the license
renewal application that the petitioners seek to have adjudicated by the
NRC.

In January 2008, in accordance with the
NRC's hearing rules, Non-Utility Nuclear filed nine detailed answers to the
petitions, opposing all of the petitioners' proposed contentions.  The
NRC Staff, which functions as an independent party in any hearing, also filed
detailed responses to the petitions.  The NRC Staff opposed admission
of all but a few of the petitioners' proposed contentions.  On July
31, 2008, the ASLB granted, in part, the petitions to intervene of the State of
New York, Riverkeeper, Inc., and Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, Inc., admitting
a total of 17 technical and environmental contentions for
adjudication.  Due to similarities among certain contentions, the
Board consolidated the 17 admitted contentions into 13 discrete
issues.  The ASLB subsequently permitted the Town of Cortlandt,
Village of Buchanan, City of New York, State of Connecticut, and Westchester
County to participate in the proceeding as "interested" governmental entities,
as allowed by the NRC regulations.  The ASLB issued its initial case
management and scheduling order during the first quarter 2009, although the
parties began the discovery process pursuant to an ASLB order issued in December
2008 and an agreement reached by the parties in January 2009 regarding
disclosure issues.  Any evidentiary hearings on the admitted
contentions are expected to occur in 2010.

The hearing process is an integral
component of the NRC's regulatory framework, and evidentiary hearings on license
renewal applications are not uncommon.  Non-Utility Nuclear intends to
participate fully in the hearing process as permitted by the NRC's hearing
rules.  As noted in Non-Utility Nuclear's responses to the various
petitions to intervene, Non-Utility Nuclear believes that many of the issues
raised by the petitioners are unsupported and without
merit.  Furthermore, Non-Utility Nuclear believes that it will carry
its burden of proof with respect to any issues that were admitted for
evidentiary hearings.  Non-Utility Nuclear will continue to work with
the NRC Staff as it completes its technical and environmental reviews of the
license renewal application, and based on current scheduling expects to obtain
20-year license renewals for Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 in
2011.

Interconnections

The Pilgrim and Vermont Yankee plants
fall under the authority of the Independent System Operator (ISO) New England
and the FitzPatrick and Indian Point plants fall under the authority of the New
York Independent System Operator (NYISO).  The Palisades plant falls
under the authority of the Midwest Independent System Operator
(MidwestISO).  The primary purpose of ISO New England, NYISO and
MidwestISO is to direct the operations of the major generation and transmission
facilities in their respective regions and in doing so also takes responsibility
for ensuring grid reliability, administering and monitoring wholesale
electricity markets and planning for their respective region’s energy
needs.

Energy
and Capacity Sales

As a wholesale generator, Entergy's
Non-Utility Nuclear business's core business is selling energy, measured in MWh,
to its customers.  Non-Utility Nuclear enters into forward contracts
with its customers and sells energy in the day ahead or spot
markets.  In addition to selling the energy produced by its plants,
Non-Utility Nuclear sells unforced capacity to load-serving entities, which
allows those companies to meet specified reserve and related requirements placed
on them by the ISOs in their respective areas. Non-Utility Nuclear's forward
fixed price power contracts consist of contracts to sell energy only, contracts
to sell capacity only, and bundled contracts in which it sells both capacity and
energy.  While the terminology and payment mechanics vary in these
contracts, each of these types of contracts requires Non-Utility Nuclear to
deliver MWh of energy to its counterparties, make capacity available to them, or
both.  See "

Commodity Price Risk

- - Power Generation" in Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management's
Discussion and Analysis for additional information regarding these
contracts.

In
addition to the contracts discussed in "

Commodity Price Risk

- - Power Generation," Non-Utility Nuclear's purchase of the Vermont Yankee plant
included a value sharing agreement providing for payments to the seller in the
event that the plant's operating license term is renewed beyond its original
expiration in 2012.  Under the value sharing agreement, to the extent
that the average annual price of the energy sales from the plant exceeds the
specified strike price, initially $61/MWh and then adjusted annually based on
three indices, the Non-Utility Nuclear business will pay 50% of the amount
exceeding the strike prices to the seller.  These payments, if
required, will be recorded as adjustments to the purchase price of the
plants.  The value sharing would begin in 2012 and extend into
2022.


Part I
Item 1

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

As part
of the purchase of the Palisades plant, Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear business
executed a 15-year PPA with the seller, Consumers Energy, for 100% of the
plant's output, excluding any future uprates.  Under the purchased
power agreement, Consumers Energy will receive the value of any new
environmental credits for the first ten years of the
agreement.  Entergy and Consumers Energy will share on a 50/50 basis
the value of any new environmental credits for years 11 through 15 of the
agreement.  The environmental credits are defined as benefits from a
change in law that causes capability of the plant as of the purchase date to
become a tradable attribute (e.g., emission credit, renewable energy credit,
environmental credit, "green" credit, etc.) or otherwise to have a market
value.

Customers

Non-Utility Nuclear's customers for the
sale of both energy and capacity include retail power providers, utilities,
electric power co-operatives, power trading organizations and other power
generation companies.  These customers include Consolidated Edison,
NYPA, and Consumers Energy, companies from which Non-Utility Nuclear purchased
plants, and ISO New England and NYISO.  As of December 31, 2009, for
the planned energy output under contract for Non-Utility Nuclear through 2014,
99.7% of the planned energy output is under contract with counterparties with
public investment grade credit ratings and 0.3% is with load-serving entities
without public credit ratings.

Competition

The ISO
New England and NYISO markets are highly competitive.  Non-Utility
Nuclear has approximately 85 competitors in New England and 70 competitors in
New York, including generation companies affiliated with regulated utilities,
other independent power producers, municipal and co-operative generators, owners
of co-generation plants and wholesale power marketers.  Non-Utility
Nuclear is an independent power producer, which means it generates power for
sale to third parties at market prices to the extent that the power is not sold
under a fixed price contract.  Municipal and co-operative generators
also generate power but use most of it to deliver power to their municipal or
co-operative power customers. Owners of co-generation plants produce power
primarily for their own consumption. Wholesale power marketers do not own
generation; rather they buy power from generators or other market participants
and resell it to retail providers or other market
participants.  Competition in the New England and New York power
markets is affected by, among other factors, the amount of generation and
transmission capacity in these markets.  Based on the latest available
information, Non-Utility Nuclear's plants provided approximately 7% of the
aggregate net generation capacity serving the New England power market and 16%
of the aggregate net generation capacity serving the New York power
market.  The MidwestISO market includes approximately 280
participants.  The MidwestISO does not have a formal, centralized
forward capacity market, but load serving entities do transact capacity through
bilateral contracts.  Palisades' current output is fully contracted to
Consumers Energy through 2022 and, therefore, Non-Utility Nuclear does not
expect to be materially affected by competition in the MidwestISO market in the
near term.

Seasonality

Non-Utility
Nuclear's revenues and operating income are subject to mild fluctuations during
the year due to seasonal factors and weather conditions.  When outdoor
and cooling water temperatures are lower, generally during colder months,
Non-Utility Nuclear's nuclear power plants operate more efficiently, and
consequently, it generates more electricity and records higher revenues and
operating income.  Although some of its annual contracts provide for
monthly pricing, Non-Utility Nuclear derives the majority of its revenues from
fixed price forward power sales that are generally sold at a single price for a
calendar year, which can offset the effects of seasonality and weather
conditions on monthly power prices.

Other
Business Activities

Entergy
Nuclear Power Marketing, LLC (ENPM) was formed in 2005 to centralize the power
marketing function for Non-Utility Nuclear.  Upon its formation, ENPM
entered into long-term power purchase agreements with the Non-Utility Nuclear
subsidiaries that own that business's power plants (generating
subsidiaries).  As part of a series of agreements, ENPM agreed to
assume and/or otherwise service the existing power purchase agreements that were
in effect between the generating subsidiaries and their
customers.  ENPM functions include origination of new energy and
capacity transactions, generation scheduling, contract management (including
billing and settlements), and market and credit risk mitigation.

Entergy
Nuclear, Inc. pursues service agreements with other nuclear power plant owners
who seek the advantages of Entergy's scale and expertise but do not necessarily
want to sell their assets. Services provided by either Entergy Nuclear, Inc. or
other Non-Utility Nuclear subsidiaries include engineering, operations and
maintenance, fuel procurement, management and supervision, technical support and
training, administrative support, and other managerial or technical services
required to operate, maintain, and decommission nuclear electric power
facilities.  Entergy Nuclear, Inc. provided decommissioning services
for the Maine Yankee nuclear power plant and continues to pursue opportunities
for Non-Utility Nuclear with other nuclear plant owners through operating
agreements or innovative arrangements such as structured leases.

In
September 2003, Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear business agreed to provide plant
operation support services for the 800 MW Cooper Nuclear Station located near
Brownville, Nebraska.  The contract is for 10 years, the remaining
term of the plant's current operating license.  Entergy will receive
$14 million in each of the remaining years of the contract.  Entergy
can also receive up to $6 million more per year if safety and regulatory goals
are met.  In addition, Entergy will be reimbursed for all
employee-related expenses.  In 2006, Entergy Nuclear, Inc. signed an
agreement to provide license renewal services for the Cooper Nuclear
Station.

Entergy
Nuclear, Inc. has now signed an agreement with Nebraska Public Power District to
extend management support services to Cooper Nuclear Station until January
2029.  The plant’s original operating license, currently due to expire
in 2014, is currently under review by the NRC for a 20-year license
renewal.

Entergy Nuclear, Inc. offers operating
license renewal and life extension services to nuclear power plants
owners.  Entergy Nuclear Inc., through its subsidiary, TLG Services,
offers decommissioning, engineering, and related services to nuclear power plant
owners.  In April 2009, Non-Utility Nuclear announced that it will
team with energy firm ENERCON to offer nuclear development services ranging from
plant relicensing to full-service, new plant deployment.  ENERCON has
experience in engineering, environmental, technical and management
services.

Non-Nuclear Wholesale Assets
Business

The non-nuclear wholesale assets
business sells to wholesale customers the electric power produced by power
plants that it owns while it focuses on improving performance and exploring
sales or restructuring opportunities for its power plants.  Such
opportunities are evaluated consistent with Entergy's market-based
point-of-view.

Entergy-Koch

Entergy-Koch
is a joint venture owned 50% each by Entergy and Koch Industries, Inc, through
subsidiaries.  Entergy-Koch began operations on February 1,
2001.  Entergy contributed most of the assets and trading contracts of
its power marketing and trading business and $414 million cash to the venture
and Koch contributed its approximately 8,000-mile Koch Gateway Pipeline (renamed
Gulf South Pipeline), gas storage facilities, and Koch Energy Trading, which
marketed and traded electricity, gas, weather derivatives, and other
energy-related commodities and services.  As specified in the
partnership agreement, Entergy contributed an additional $72.7 million to the
partnership in January 2004.

In the fourth quarter of 2004,
Entergy-Koch sold its energy trading and pipeline businesses to third
parties.  The sales came after a review of strategic alternatives for
enhancing the value of Entergy-Koch, LP.  Entergy received
$862 million of cash distributions in 2004 from Entergy-Koch after the
business sales.  Due to the November 2006 expiration of contingencies
on the sale of Entergy-Koch's trading business, and the corresponding release to
Entergy-Koch of sales proceeds held in escrow, Entergy received additional cash
distributions of approximately $163 million during the fourth quarter of 2006
and recorded a gain of approximately $55 million (net-of-tax).  In
December 2009, Entergy reorganized its investment in Entergy-Koch, received a
$25.6 million cash distribution, and received a distribution of certain software
owned by the joint venture.  Entergy-Koch is no longer an operating
entity.

Regulation of Entergy's
Business

Energy
Policy Act of 2005

The
Energy Policy Act of 2005 became law in August 2005.  The legislation
contains electricity provisions that, among other things:

·

Repealed
      PUHCA 1935, through enactment of PUHCA 2005, effective February 8, 2006;
      PUHCA 2005 and/or related amendments to Section 203(a) of the Federal
      Power Act (a) remove various limitations on Entergy Corporation as a
      registered holding company under PUHCA 1935; (b) require the maintenance
      and retention of books and records by certain holding company system
      companies for inspection by the FERC and state commissions, as
      appropriate; and (c) effectively leave to the jurisdiction of the FERC (or
      state or local regulatory bodies, as appropriate) (i) the issuance by an
      electric utility of securities; (ii) (A) the disposition of jurisdictional
      FERC electric facilities by an electric utility; (B) the acquisition by an
      electric utility of securities of an electric utility; (C) the acquisition
      by an electric utility of electric generating facilities (in each of the
      cases in (A), (B) and (C) only in transactions in excess of $10 million);
      (iv) electric public utility mergers; and (v) the acquisition by an
      electric public utility holding company of securities of an electric
      public utility company or its holding company in excess of $10 million or
      the merger of electric public utility holding company
      systems.  PUHCA 2005 and the related FERC rule-making also
      provide a savings provision which permits continued reliance on certain
      PUHCA 1935 rules and orders after the repeal of PUHCA
  1935.

·

Codifies
      the concept of participant funding or cost causation, a form of cost
      allocation for transmission interconnections and upgrades, and allows the
      FERC to apply participant funding in all regions of the
      country.  Participant funding helps ensure that a utility's
      native load customers only bear the costs that are necessary to provide
      reliable transmission service to them and not bear costs imposed by
      generators (the participants) who seek to deliver power to other
      regions.

·

Provides
      financing benefits, including loan guarantees and production tax credits,
      for new nuclear plant construction, and reauthorizes the Price-Anderson
      Act, the law that provides an umbrella of insurance protection for the
      payment of public liability claims in the event of a major nuclear power
      plant incident.

·

Revises
      current tax law treatment of nuclear decommissioning trust funds by
      allowing regulated and non-regulated taxpayers to make deductible
      contributions to fund the entire amount of estimated future
      decommissioning costs.

·

Provides
      a more rapid tax depreciation schedule for transmission assets to
      encourage investment.

·

Creates
      mandatory electricity reliability guidelines with enforceable penalties to
      help ensure that the

nation's power
      transmission grid is kept in good repair and that disruptions in the
      electricity system are

minimized.

Entergy already voluntarily complies with National
      Electricity Reliability Council standards, which are similar to the
      guidelines mandated by the Energy Policy Act of
  2005.

·

Establishes
      conditions for the elimination of the Public Utility Regulatory Policy
      Act's (PURPA) mandatory purchase obligation from qualifying
      facilities.

·

Significantly
      increased the FERC's authorization to impose criminal and civil penalties
      for violations of the provisions of the Federal Power
  Act.

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana.  FERC also regulates the rates charged
for intrasystem sales pursuant to the System Agreement and the provision of
transmission service to wholesale market participants.

Entergy Arkansas holds a FERC license
that expires in 2053 for two hydroelectric projects totaling 70 MW of
capacity.

Regulation
of the Nuclear Power Industry

Atomic Energy Act of 1954
and Energy Reorganization Act of 1974

Under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and
the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, the operation of nuclear plants is
heavily regulated by the NRC, which has broad power to impose licensing and
safety-related requirements.  The NRC has broad authority to impose
fines or shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the
severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved.  Entergy
Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy,
as owners of all or portions of ANO, River Bend, Waterford 3, and Grand Gulf,
respectively, and Entergy Operations, as the licensee and operator of these
units, are subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC.  Entergy's
Non-Utility Nuclear business is subject to the NRC's jurisdiction as the owner
and operator of Pilgrim, Indian Point Energy Center, FitzPatrick, Vermont
Yankee, and Palisades.  Substantial capital expenditures at Entergy's
nuclear plants because of revised safety requirements of the NRC could be
required in the future.

Nuclear Waste Policy Act of

Spent
Nuclear Fuel

Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of
1982, the DOE is required, for a specified fee, to construct storage facilities
for, and to dispose of, all spent nuclear fuel and other high-level radioactive
waste generated by domestic nuclear power reactors.  Entergy's nuclear
owner/licensee subsidiaries provide for the estimated future disposal costs of
spent nuclear fuel in accordance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of
1982.  The affected Entergy companies entered into contracts with the
DOE, whereby the DOE is to furnish disposal services at a cost of one mill per
net kWh generated and sold after April 7, 1983, plus a one-time fee for
generation prior to that date.  Entergy Arkansas is the only one of
the Utility operating companies that generated electric power with nuclear fuel
prior to that date and has a recorded liability as of December 31, 2009 of
$180.7 million for the one-time fee.  Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear
business has accepted assignment of the Pilgrim, FitzPatrick, Indian
Point 3, Indian Point 1 and 2, Vermont Yankee, and Palisades/Big Rock Point
spent fuel disposal contracts with the DOE held by their previous
owners.  The previous owners have paid or retained liability for the
fees for all generation prior to the purchase dates of those
plants.  The fees payable to the DOE may be adjusted in the future to
assure full recovery.  Entergy considers all costs incurred for the
disposal of spent nuclear fuel, except accrued interest, to be proper components
of nuclear fuel expense.  Provisions to recover such costs have been
or will be made in applications to regulatory authorities for the Utility
plants.  Entergy's total spent fuel fees to date, including the
one-time fee liability of Entergy Arkansas, have surpassed $1
billion.

The permanent spent fuel repository in
the U.S. has been legislated to be Yucca Mountain, Nevada.  The DOE is
required by law to proceed with the licensing (the DOE filed the license
application in June 2008) and, after the license is granted by the NRC, proceed
with the repository construction and commencement of receipt of spent
fuel.  Because the DOE has not begun accepting spent fuel, it is in
non-compliance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and has breached its
spent fuel disposal contracts.  The DOE continues to delay meeting its
obligation.  Moreover, the Obama administration has expressed its
intention to discontinue the Yucca Mountain project and plans to study a new
spent fuel strategy.  Therefore, uncertainty remains regarding the
time frame under which the DOE will begin to accept spent fuel from Entergy's
facilities for storage or disposal.  As a result, continuing future
expenditures will be required to increase spent fuel storage capacity at
Entergy's nuclear sites.


Part I
Item 1

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

As a result of the DOE's failure to
begin disposal of spent nuclear fuel in 1998 pursuant to the Nuclear Waste
Policy Act of 1982 and the spent fuel disposal contracts, Entergy's nuclear
owner/licensee subsidiaries have incurred and will continue to incur
damages.  In November 2003 these subsidiaries, except for the owner of
Palisades, began litigation to recover the damages caused by the DOE's delay in
performance.  In two separate decisions in October 2007, the U.S. Court of
Federal Claims awarded $10.0 million jointly to System Fuels, System Energy, and
SMEPA, and awarded $48.7 million jointly to System Fuels and Entergy
Arkansas, in damages related to the DOE's breach of its
obligations.  Both decisions are subject to appeal by the DOE, and the
DOE has filed an appeal of the Entergy Arkansas decision with the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  The System Energy case awaits a
final decision in the trial court, but a DOE appeal is likely upon issuance of
the final decision.  Management cannot predict the timing or amount of
any potential recoveries on other claims filed by Entergy subsidiaries, and
cannot predict the timing of any eventual receipt from the DOE of the U.S. Court
of Federal Claims damage awards.

Pending DOE acceptance and disposal of
spent nuclear fuel, the owners of nuclear plants are providing their own spent
fuel storage.  Storage capability additions using dry casks began
operations at Palisades in 1993, at ANO in 1996, at FitzPatrick in 2002, at
River Bend in 2005, at Grand Gulf in 2006, and at Indian Point and Vermont
Yankee in 2008.  These facilities will be expanded as
needed.  Current on-site spent fuel storage capacity at Waterford 3
and Pilgrim is estimated to be sufficient until approximately 2012 and 2014,
respectively; by which time dry cask storage facilities are planned to be placed
into service at these units.

Nuclear
Plant Decommissioning

Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana and Entergy Texas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy are entitled
to recover from customers through electric rates the estimated decommissioning
costs for ANO, the portion of River Bend subject to retail rate regulation,
Waterford 3, and Grand Gulf, respectively.  These amounts are
deposited in trust funds that can only be used for future decommissioning
costs.  Entergy periodically reviews and updates the estimated
decommissioning costs to reflect inflation and changes in regulatory
requirements and technology, and then makes applications to the regulatory
authorities to reflect, in rates, the changes in projected decommissioning
costs.

In June 2001, Entergy Arkansas received
notification from the NRC of approval for a renewed operating license
authorizing operations at ANO 1 through May 2034.  In July 2005,
Entergy Arkansas received notification from the NRC of approval for a renewed
operating license authorizing operations at ANO 2 through July
2038.  Entergy Arkansas' projections showed that with the assumption
of 20 years of extended operational life for both units, the decommissioning
fund balances with earnings over the extended life would be sufficient to
decommission both units.  Pursuant to APSC approval, which was granted
based on assumption of renewed licenses for ANO 1 and 2, beginning in 2001
Entergy Arkansas stopped collecting funds to decommission ANO 1 and
2.  The APSC requires Entergy Arkansas to update every five years the
estimated costs to decommission ANO.  In March 2009, Entergy Arkansas
filed with the APSC its fourth five-year estimate of ANO decommissioning
costs.  The updated estimate indicated the cost to decommission the
two ANO units would be $1,265 million.

In December 2002, the LPSC approved a
settlement between Entergy Gulf States, Inc. and the LPSC staff.  The
settlement included, among other things, the requirement to cease collection of
funds to decommission River Bend based on an assumed license renewal for River
Bend.

As part of the Pilgrim, Indian Point 1
and 2, Vermont Yankee, and Palisades/Big Rock Point purchases, the former owners
transferred decommissioning trust funds, along with the liability to
decommission the plants, to Entergy.  As part of the Indian Point 1
and 2 purchase, Entergy also funded an additional $25 million to the
decommissioning trust fund.  As part of the Palisades transaction,
Non-Utility Nuclear assumed responsibility for spent fuel at the decommissioned
Big Rock Point nuclear plant, which is located near Charlevoix,
Michigan.  Once the spent fuel is removed from the site, Non-Utility
Nuclear will dismantle the spent fuel storage facility and complete site
decommissioning.  Non-Utility Nuclear expects to fund this activity
from operating revenue, and Non-Utility Nuclear is providing $5 million in
credit support to provide financial assurance for this obligation to the
NRC.


Part I
Item 1

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

On June 18, 2009, the NRC issued
letters indicating that the NRC staff had concluded that there were shortfalls
in the amount of decommissioning funding assurance provided for Indian Point 2,
Vermont Yankee, Palisades, Waterford 3, and River Bend.  The NRC staff
conducted a telephone conference with Entergy on this issue on June 29, 2009,
and Entergy agreed to submit a plan by August 13, 2009, for addressing the
identified shortfalls.  In its August 13, 2009 submittal, Entergy
provided updated analyses to the NRC that indicated that there was no current
shortfall in the amounts of the required decommissioning funding assurance for
Palisades and Indian Point 2, based upon the balances as of July 31, 2009 and an
analysis of the costs that would be incurred if Entergy elected to use a
sixty-year period of safe storage for decommissioning, as permitted by the NRC's
rules.  The NRC accepted the analyses regarding Palisades and Indian
Point 2 by letters dated December 12, 2009 and December 28, 2009, and with
respect to each plant, the NRC concluded that no further action was
required.  For Vermont Yankee, Entergy concluded that, based upon the
balances as of July 31, 2009 and an analysis of the costs that would be incurred
if Entergy elected to use a sixty-year period of safe storage for
decommissioning, there was a shortfall of approximately $58 million, which could
be satisfied with additional financial assurance in a current dollar value of
approximately $51 million.  Entergy also indicated that it planned to
address this shortfall by December 31, 2009 by providing a financial assurance
mechanism that is consistent with the regulatory requirements and acceptable to
the NRC.  A subsequent submittal to the NRC indicated that increases
in the decommissioning fund, as of September 30, 2009, have lowered the
shortfall to approximately $40 million, or approximately $35 million on a
current dollar basis.  This submittal proposed using a corporate
guarantee as financial assurance, and a corporate guarantee in the amount of $40
million was executed by December 31, 2009 for this purpose.  For
Waterford 3 and River Bend, Entergy made the appropriate filings by December 31,
2009 with its retail regulators that request increases in rates to address the
shortfalls identified by the NRC.

For the Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick
plants purchased in 2000, NYPA retained the decommissioning trusts and the
decommissioning liability.  NYPA and Entergy executed decommissioning
agreements, which specify their decommissioning obligations.  NYPA has
the right to require Entergy to assume the decommissioning liability provided
that it assigns the corresponding decommissioning trust, up to a specified
level, to Entergy.  If the decommissioning liability is retained by
NYPA, Entergy will perform the decommissioning of the plants at a price equal to
the lesser of a pre-specified level or the amount in the decommissioning
trusts.

Additional information with respect to
decommissioning costs is found in Note 9 to the financial
statements.

Price-Anderson
Act

The
Price-Anderson Act requires that reactor licensees purchase insurance and
participate in a secondary insurance pool that provides insurance coverage for
the public in the event of a nuclear power plant accident.  The costs
of this insurance are borne by the nuclear power industry.  Congress
amended and renewed the Price-Anderson Act in 2005 for a term through
2025.  The Price-Anderson Act limits contingent liability for a single
nuclear incident to approximately $117.5 million per reactor (with 104 nuclear
industry reactors currently participating).  Entergy Arkansas, Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, System Energy, and Entergy's
Non-Utility Nuclear business have protection with respect to this liability
through a combination of private insurance and an industry assessment program,
as well as insurance for property damage, costs of replacement power, and other
risks relating to nuclear generating units.  The Price-Anderson Act
and insurance applicable to the nuclear programs of Entergy are discussed in
more detail in Note 8 to the financial statements.

Environmental
Regulation

Entergy's facilities and operations are
subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction
over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and
solid wastes, and other environmental matters.  Management believes
that Entergy's businesses are in substantial compliance with environmental
regulations currently applicable to its facilities and
operations.  Because environmental regulations are subject to change,
future compliance requirements and costs cannot be precisely
estimated.  Except to the extent discussed below, at this time
compliance with federal, state, and local provisions regulating the discharge of
materials into the environment, or otherwise protecting the environment, is
incorporated into the routine cost structure of Entergy's businesses and is not
expected to have a material adverse effect on their competitive position,
results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

Clean Air Act and Subsequent
Amendments

The Clean Air Act and its subsequent
Amendments established several programs that currently or in the future may
affect Entergy's fossil-fueled generation facilities.  Individual
states also operate similar independent state programs or delegated federal
programs that may include requirements more stringent than federal regulatory
requirements.  These programs include:

·

New
      source review and preconstruction permits for new sources of criteria air
      pollutants and significant modifications to existing
      facilities;

·

Acid
      rain program for control of sulfur dioxide (SO


) and
      nitrogen oxides (NO

x

);

·

Nonattainment
      area programs for control of criteria air
  pollutants;

·

Hazardous
      air pollutant emissions reduction
program;

·

Interstate
      Air Transport;

·

Operating
      permits program for administration and enforcement of these and other
      Clean Air Act programs; and

·

Regional
      Haze and Best Available Retrofit Technology
  programs.

New
Source Review (NSR)

Preconstruction
permits are required for new facilities and for existing facilities that undergo
a modification that results in a significant net emissions increase and is not
classified as routine repair, maintenance, or replacement.  Units that
undergo a non-routine modification must obtain a permit modification and may be
required to install additional air pollution control
technologies.  Entergy has an established process for identifying
modifications requiring additional permitting approval and has followed the
regulations and associated guidance provided by the states and the federal
government with regard to the determination of routine repair, maintenance, and
replacement.  In recent years, however, the EPA has begun an
enforcement initiative, aimed primarily at coal plants, to identify
modifications that it does not consider routine and that have failed to obtain a
permit modification.  Entergy to date has not been included in any of
these enforcement actions. Nevertheless, various courts and the EPA have been
inconsistent in their judgments regarding what modifications are considered
routine.

In April
2007 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the applicability of Clean Air Act NSR
requirements is not limited only to modifications that create an increase in
hourly emission rates, but also can apply to modifications that create an
increase in annual emission rates (

Environmental Defense v. Duke
Energy

).  This Supreme Court decision has resulted in a renewed
effort by the EPA to bring enforcement actions against electric generating units
for major non-permitted facility modifications.

Acid Rain
Program

The Clean
Air Act provides SO


allowances
to most of the affected Entergy generating units for emissions based upon past
emission levels and operating characteristics.  Each allowance is an
entitlement to emit one ton of SO


per
year.  Plant owners are required to possess allowances for SO


emissions
from affected generating units.  Virtually all Entergy fossil-fueled
generating units are subject to SO


allowance
requirements.  Entergy could be required to purchase additional
allowances when it generates power using fuel oil.  Fuel oil usage is
determined by economic dispatch and influenced by the price of natural gas,
incremental emission allowance costs, and the availability and cost of purchased
power.

Ozone
Nonattainment

Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas each operate fossil-fueled generating
units in geographic areas that are not in attainment of the currently-enforced
national ambient air quality standards for ozone.  The Louisiana
nonattainment area that affects Entergy Gulf States Louisiana is the Baton Rouge
area.  Texas nonattainment areas that affect Entergy Texas are the
Houston-Galveston-Brazoria and the Beaumont-Port Arthur areas.  Areas
in nonattainment are classified as "marginal", "moderate," "serious," or
"severe."  When an area fails to meet the ambient air standard, the
EPA requires state regulatory authorities to prepare state implementation plans
meant to cause progress toward bringing the area into attainment with applicable
standards.


Part I
Item 1

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

In April 2004, the EPA issued a final
rule, effective June 2005, revoking a 1-hour ozone standard, including
designations and classifications.  In a separate action over the same
period, the EPA enacted 8-hour ozone nonattainment classifications and stated
that areas designated as nonattainment under a new 8-hour ozone standard shall
have one year to adjust to the new requirements with submittal of a new
attainment plan.

The Baton Rouge area was classified as
a ''marginal" nonattainment area under the 8-hour standard with an attainment
date of June 15, 2007.  On March 21, 2008, the EPA published a notice
that the Baton Rouge area had failed to meet the standard by the attainment date
and that the EPA was proceeding with a "bump-up" of the area to the next higher
nonattainment level.  The Baton Rouge area is now classified as a
"moderate" nonattainment area with an attainment date of June 15,
2010.

The Beaumont-Port Arthur area was
originally classified as a "marginal" nonattainment area under the 8-hour
standard with an attainment date of June 15, 2007.  On March 18, 2008,
the EPA published a notice that the Beaumont-Port Arthur area had failed to meet
the standard by the attainment date based on the area's 2004-2006 monitoring
data and that the EPA was proceeding with a "bump-up" of the area to the next
higher nonattainment level.  The 2005-2007 monitoring data showed the
area to be in attainment, however, and on July 9, 2008, the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality proposed a plan for EPA re-designation of the area from
nonattainment to attainment under the 8-hour ozone standard.

The Houston-Galveston-Brazoria area was
originally classified as "moderate" nonattainment under the 8-hour standard with
an attainment date of June 15, 2010.  On June 15, 2007, the Texas
governor petitioned the EPA to reclassify Houston-Galveston-Brazoria from
"moderate" to "severe."  On October 1, 2008, the EPA granted the
request by the Texas governor to voluntarily reclassify the
Houston-Galveston-Brazoria area from a "moderate" 8-hour ozone nonattainment
area to a "severe" 8-hour ozone nonattainment area.  The EPA also set
April 15, 2010, as the date for the State of Texas to submit a revised state
implementation plan addressing the "severe" ozone nonattainment area
requirements of the Clean Air Act.  The area's new attainment date for
the 8-hour ozone standard is as expeditiously as practicable, but no later than
June 15, 2019.

In December 2006, the EPA's revocation
of the 1-hour ozone standard was rejected in a judicial
proceeding.  As a result, numerous requirements can return for areas
that fail to meet 1-hour ozone levels by dates set by the law.  These
requirements include the potential to increase fees significantly for plants
operating in these areas.  In addition, it is possible that new
emission controls may be required.  Specific costs of compliance
cannot be estimated at this time, but Entergy is monitoring development of the
respective state implementation plans and will develop specific compliance
strategies as the plans move through the adoption
process.  Additionally, in February 2010, the EPA published a
determination that the Baton Rouge area has reached attainment status for the
former 1-hour ozone level.  This determination may reduce or eliminate
any fees required in the area.

In March
2008, the EPA revised the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone,
creating the potential for additional counties and parishes in which Entergy
operates to be placed in nonattainment status.  The LDEQ recommended
that eleven parishes be designated as nonattainment for the 75 parts per billion
ozone standard.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana has two fossil plants
and Entergy Louisiana has one fossil plant affected by this
recommendation.  In Arkansas, the governor recommended that Pulaski
County be designated in nonattainment with the new ozone standard, where two of
Entergy Arkansas' smaller facilities are located.  These
recommendations have not been approved yet by the EPA, and in September 2009 the
EPA announced that it is reconsidering the 75 parts per billion standard and may
lower it further.  Lowering the standard would cause the need for
additional analysis of county and parish attainment status.  On
January 7, 2010, the EPA proposed to set the primary 8-hour ozone standard at a
level between 60 to 70 parts per billion.  The proposal is expected to
result in 11 additional Entergy facilities operating in areas designated as
non-attainment for ozone.  Following nonattainment designation, states
will be required to develop state implementation plans that outline control
requirements that will enable the affected counties and parishes to reach
attainment status.  Entergy facilities in these areas may be subject
to installation of NOx controls, but the degree of control will remain unknown
until the state implementation plans are developed.  Entergy will
continue to monitor and engage in the state implementation plan development
process in Entergy states.

Hazardous
Air Pollutants

In March 2005, the EPA issued a federal
rule to cap and reduce mercury emissions from coal-fired power
plants.  The Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR) established "standards of
performance" limiting mercury emissions from new and existing coal-fired power
plants and created a market-based cap-and-trade program intended to reduce
nationwide utility emissions of mercury in two distinct phases.  The
rule was challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit (D.C. Circuit).  On February 8, 2008, the D.C. Circuit struck
down CAMR and remanded the rule to the EPA for further
consideration.  The EPA likely will proceed with developing a Maximum
Achievable Control Technology (MACT) retrofit standard for coal and oil-fired
units.  In 2009 the EPA issued an Information Collection Request to
gather data needed for promulgation of Hazardous Air Pollutant
regulations.  It is currently expected that the EPA will propose a
mercury MACT rule in 2011 with a final rule in 2013.  Entergy is
continuing to conduct mercury research through coordination with the Electric
Power Research Institute (EPRI) and others and remains involved in the current
rulemaking process.

Interstate
Air Transport

In March 2005, the EPA finalized the
Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which is intended to reduce SO


and NOx
emissions from electric generation plants in order to improve air quality in
twenty-nine eastern states.  The rule requires a combination of
investment of capital to install pollution control equipment and increased
operating costs through the purchase of emission
allowances.  Entergy's capital investment and annual allowance
purchase costs under the CAIR will depend on the economic assessment of NOx and
SO


allowance markets, the cost of control technologies, and unit
usage.  Entergy began implementation in 2007, including installation
of controls at several facilities and the development of an emission allowance
procurement strategy.

The effect on capital spending could be
offset by emission allowance markets which allow for purchases or use of
allocated allowances; however, the allocation of the emission allowances and the
set up of the market will determine the ultimate cost to
Entergy.  Entergy believes that the original allocation was unfairly
skewed towards states with relatively higher emissions by the use of a
fuel-adjustment factor.  Entergy filed a challenge to this aspect of
the rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C.
Circuit).

The CAIR was vacated by the D.C.
Circuit in July 2008.  The court found that the EPA failed to
address basic obligations under the Clean Air Act's "good neighbor" provision
regarding "upwind" states' contribution to air quality impairment in "downwind"
states.  The court also ruled favorably on Entergy's challenge,
finding that the EPA exceeded its statutory authority when it included a fuel
adjustment factor to calculate the state NOx emission budgets.

On December 23, 2008, the D.C. Circuit
remanded the CAIR decision to the EPA without vacatur, allowing the CAIR to
become effective on January 1, 2009, while EPA revises the rule.  The
revised rule must address all the flaws identified in the D.C. Circuit decision,
including the use of a fuel adjustment factor and the use of acid rain SO


allowances
for the CAIR.  Entergy has reactivated its compliance effort for the
CAIR based on this court ruling.  The EPA is expected to issue a
proposed CAIR replacement rule in 2010.

Regional
Haze

In June 2005, the EPA issued final Best
Available Retrofit Control Technology (BART) regulations that could potentially
result in a requirement to install SO


pollution
control technology on certain of Entergy's coal and oil generation
units.  The rule leaves certain BART determinations to the
states.  The Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ)
prepared a State Implementation Plan (SIP) for Arkansas facilities to implement
its obligations under the Clean Air Visibility Rule.  The ADEQ
determined that Entergy Arkansas' White Bluff power plant affects a Class I Area
visibility and will be subject to the EPA's presumptive BART requirements to
install scrubbers and low NOx burners

.

Under current
regulations, the scrubbers would have to be operational by October
2013.  Entergy filed a petition in December 2009 with the Arkansas
Pollution Control and Ecology Commission


Part I
Item 1

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

requesting
a variance from this deadline, however, because the EPA has not approved
Arkansas' Regional Haze SIP and the EPA has recently expressed concerns about
Arkansas' Regional Haze SIP and questioned the appropriateness of issuing an air
permit prior to that approval.  Entergy Arkansas' petition requests
that, consistent with federal law, the compliance deadline be changed to as
expeditiously as practicable, but in no event later than five years after EPA
approval of the Arkansas Regional Haze SIP.  The Arkansas Pollution
Control and Ecology (PC&E) Commission adopted a procedural schedule that
includes a public hearing and a comment period ending in March 2010 with the
expectation that the variance could be considered at the Commission's March 26,
2010 meeting.  The timeline for EPA action on the Arkansas Regional
Haze SIP is uncertain at this time.

In March 2009, Entergy Arkansas made a
filing with the APSC seeking a declaratory order that the White Bluff project is
in the public interest.  In May 2009 the APSC Staff filed a motion
requesting that the APSC require Entergy Arkansas to file testimony on several
issues.  In December 2009, in response to the EPA concerns regarding
Arkansas' Regional Haze SIP, the APSC suspended the procedural schedule in the
proceeding.

Currently, the White Bluff project is
suspended, but the latest conceptual cost estimate indicated that Entergy
Arkansas' share of the project could cost approximately $465
million.  The plant would continue to operate during construction,
although an outage would be necessary to complete the tie in of the
scrubbers.  Entergy continues to review potential environmental
spending needs and financing alternatives for any such spending, and future
spending estimates could change based on the results of this continuing
analysis.

Potential
Legislative, Regulatory, and Judicial Developments (Air)

In addition to the specific instances
described above, there are a number of legislative and regulatory initiatives
relating to the reduction of emissions that are under consideration at the
federal, state, and local level.  Because of the nature of Entergy's
business, the adoption of each of these could affect its
operations.  Entergy continues to monitor these initiatives and
activities in order to analyze their potential operational and cost
implications.  These initiatives include:

·

designation
      by the EPA and state environmental agencies of areas that are not in
      attainment with national ambient air quality
  standards;

·

introduction
      of several bills in Congress and development of regulations by the EPA
      proposing further limits on NOx, SO2, mercury and CO


and
      other greenhouse gas emissions.  New legislation or regulations
      applicable to stationary sources could take the form of market-based
      cap-and-trade programs, direct requirements for the installation of air
      emission controls onto air emission sources or other or combined
      regulatory programs.  Entergy cannot estimate the effect of any
      future legislation at this time due to the uncertainty of the regulatory
      format;

·

efforts
      to implement a voluntary program intended to reduce CO


emissions and efforts in Congress to establish a mandatory federal CO


emission control structure;

·

passage
      and implementation of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative by several
      states in the northeast U.S. and similar actions in the Midwest and
      California;

·

efforts
      on the state and federal level to codify renewable portfolio standards
      requiring utilities to produce or purchase a certain percentage of their
      power from defined renewable energy sources;
and

·

efforts
      by certain external groups to encourage reporting and disclosure of
      CO


emissions and risk.  Entergy has prepared responses for the
      Carbon Disclosure Project's (CDP) annual questionnaire for the past
      several years and has given permission for those responses to be posted to
      CDP's website.

In addition to these initiatives,
certain states and environmental advocacy groups are seeking judicial action to
require the EPA to promulgate regulations under existing provisions of the Clean
Air Act to control CO


emissions
from power plants.  In April 2007 the U.S. Supreme Court held that the
EPA is authorized by the current provisions of the Clean Air Act to regulate
emissions of CO


and other
"greenhouse gases" as "pollutants" (

Massachusetts v. EPA

) and
that the EPA is required to regulate these emissions from motor vehicles if the
emissions are anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.  The
Supreme Court directed the EPA to make further findings in this
regard.  The decision is expected to affect a similar case pending in
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (

Coke Oven Environmental Task Force
v. EPA

) considering the same question under a similar Clean Air Act
provision in the context of CO


emissions
from electric generating units.  Entergy participated as a friend of
the court in

Massachusetts v.
EPA

and has been granted the same status in

Coke Oven

.  Entergy
will continue to advocate in support of reasonable market-based regulation of
CO


.  Entergy
has also supported the comments of various industry groups


Part I
Item 1

Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

advocating
national legislation to address CO


emissions
instead of attempting to regulate under the provisions of the Clean Air
Act.  Entergy continues to monitor these and similar actions in order
to analyze their potential operational and cost implications and
benefits.

In 2009, the EPA published an
"endangerment finding" stating that the emission of greenhouse gases "may
reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare" and that the
emission of these pollutants from mobile sources (such as cars and trucks)
contributes to this endangerment.  The EPA has stated that the
endangerment finding itself does not create any immediate requirements for any
emissions source; however, in 2009 the EPA also proposed rules limiting the
emissions of certain greenhouse gases, including CO


, from cars
and light trucks, adopting a policy that the "actual control" of greenhouse gas
emissions (such as by the mobile source rule) would trigger the application of
new source review permitting requirements for stationary sources under section
165 of the Clean Air Act, and creating a threshold of 25,000 tons of emissions
for the application of new source review permitting for new sources and 10,000
to 25,000 tons for modifications.  These changes, taken together and
if finalized by the EPA, would likely require new stationary sources of
greenhouse gas emissions and significant modifications of existing sources to
undergo a new source review permitting process that would include the required
application of best available control technology (BACT) for the control of such
emissions to the stationary source.  The likely outcome of
permit-by-permit determinations of required BACT and the associated costs is, at
this time, uncertain.  Additionally, subsequent to the endangerment
finding, the EPA may be required to develop new source performance standards for
both new and existing sources of greenhouse gas emissions.  The
details of these standards and any required operational changes are
uncertain.

In anticipation of the potential
imposition of CO


emission
limits on the electric industry in the future, Entergy has initiated actions
designed to reduce its exposure to potential new governmental requirements
related to CO


emissions.  These voluntary actions included establishment of a formal
program to stabilize power plant CO


emissions
at 2000 levels through 2005, and Entergy succeeded in actually reducing
emissions below 2000 levels.  Entergy has now established a second
formal voluntary program to stabilize power plant CO


emissions
and emissions from controllable power purchases at 20% below 2000 levels through
2010 and continues to support national legislation that would increase planning
certainty for electric utilities while addressing emissions in a responsible and
flexible manner.  By virtue of its proportionally large investment in
low- or non-emitting gas-fired and nuclear generation technologies, Entergy's
overall CO


emission
"intensity," or rate of CO


emitted
per kilowatt-hour of electricity generated, is already among the lowest in the
industry.  Total CO


emissions
representing Entergy's ownership share of power plants in the United States were
approximately 53.2 million tons in 2000, 49.6 million tons in 2001, 44.2 million
tons in 2002, 36.8 million tons in 2003, 38.3 million tons in 2004, 35.6 million
tons in 2005, 38.8 million tons in 2006, 40.2 million tons in 2007, 43.9 million
tons in 2008, and 39.8 million tons in 2009.  In 2006, Entergy
changed its method of calculating emissions and now includes emissions from
controllable power purchases as well as its ownership share of generation, which
accounts for the increase beginning in 2006 compared to the trend for the prior
years.

Greenhouse
Gas Reporting

In September 2009, the EPA finalized a
rule to require reporting of several greenhouse gases.  This rule will
require Entergy to annually report greenhouse gas emissions from operating power
plants and natural gas distribution operations.  Entergy has developed
compliance plans, is collecting the necessary data, and will report as required
in 2011.

Clean Water
Act

The 1972 amendments to the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act (known as the Clean Water Act) provide the statutory
basis for the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit
program and the basic structure for regulating the discharge of pollutants from
point sources to waters of the United States.  The Clean Water Act
requires all discharges of pollutants to waters of the United States to be
permitted, section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act regulates cooling water intake
structures, section 401 of the Clean Water Act requires a water quality
certification from the state in support of certain federal actions and
approvals, and section 404 regulates the dredge and fill of waters of the United
States, including jurisdictional wetlands.

NPDES
Permits and Section 401 Water Quality Certifications

NPDES permits are subject to renewal
every five years.  Consequently, Entergy is currently in various
stages of the data evaluation and discharge permitting process for its Utility
power plants and its Non-Utility Nuclear power plants.  Additionally,
the State of New York has taken the position that a new state-issued water
quality certification is required as part of the NRC license renewal
process.  Therefore, Non-Utility Nuclear's New York facilities also
are seeking, or have obtained, a section 401 certification prior to license
renewal.

FitzPatrick

As agreed to as settlement of the
FitzPatrick discharge permit and water quality certification, Entergy installed
Ristroph screens for safely removing fish from intake screens, and plans to
install an initial fish return system during the next five-year permit
cycle.  Additionally, Entergy is undertaking studies regarding the
feasibility and effectiveness of relocating FitzPatrick’s offshore intake
structure and of additional fish return technologies.  The permit
issued under the agreement requires that the New York State Department of
Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) initiate a permit modification, triggering
Entergy's right to challenge, if New York State decides to require the
installation and operation of additional fish return technology.  The
Clean Water Act permit, water quality certification, and Coastal Zone Management
Act consistency determination have now been issued.

Vermont
Yankee

Opposition groups appealed a water
discharge permit amendment issued to Vermont Yankee pursuant to the state's
NPDES program in which the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources (VANR) allowed a
small increase in the amount of heat the facility can discharge to the
Connecticut River from June 16 to October 14 each year.  The VANR
permit amendment increases operational flexibility for the required usage rate
of the existing cooling towers and for the generation rate of the facility that
is especially helpful in conditions of high ambient temperatures or low river
flow conditions.  The trial of this matter occurred in the Vermont
Environmental Court during the summer of 2007.  On May 22, 2008, the
Vermont Environmental Court entered its judgment and order granting the
increased thermal discharge provided in the amendment for the period from July 8
through October 14 each year, but imposing additional management and measurement
requirements with respect to the period from June 16 through July
7.  Entergy and opposition groups appealed aspects of the ruling to
the Vermont Supreme Court.  On December 18, 2009, the Vermont Supreme
Court affirmed the thermal increase but overturned the Vermont Environmental
Court's imposition of additional management and measurement
requirements.

Indian
Point

Non-Utility Nuclear is involved in an
administrative permitting process with the NYSDEC for renewal of the Indian
Point 2 and 3 discharge permits.  In November 2003, the NYSDEC issued
a draft permit indicating that closed cycle cooling would be considered the
"best technology available" for minimizing alleged adverse environmental effects
attributable to the intake of cooling water at Indian Point 2 and Indian Point
3, subject to a feasibility determination and alternatives analysis for that
technology, if Entergy applied for and received NRC license renewal at Indian
Point 2 and Indian Point 3.  Upon becoming effective, the draft permit
also would have required payment of approximately $24 million annually, and an
annual 42 unit-day outage period, until closed cycle cooling is
implemented.  Non-Utility Nuclear is participating in the
administrative process to request that the draft permit be modified prior to
final issuance, and opposes any requirement to install cooling towers at Indian
Point 2 and Indian Point 3.  In the past Non-Utility Nuclear notified
the NYSDEC that the cost of retrofitting Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 with
cooling towers likely would cost, in 2003 dollars, at least $740 million in
capital costs and an additional $630 million in lost generation during
construction.

In the February 2010 feasibility report
noted in the paragraph below, Non-Utility Nuclear provided an updated estimate
of the cost to retrofit Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 with cooling
towers.  Construction costs for retrofitting with cooling towers are
now estimated to be at least $1.19 billion, in addition to lost generation of
approximately 14.5 TWh during the estimated 42-week forced outage of both
units.  Non-Utility Nuclear also proposed an alternative to the
cooling towers, the use of Wedgewire screens, that would cost up to
approximately $100 million to install.  Due to fluctuations in power
pricing and because a retrofitting of this size and complexity has never been
undertaken, significant uncertainties exist in these estimates and, therefore,
they could be materially higher than estimated.


Part I
Item 1

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

An August 13, 2008 ruling by the
NYSDEC's Assistant Commissioner has restructured the permitting and
administrative process, including by applying a new economic test designed to
implement the Second Circuit's standard.  The NYSDEC has directed
Entergy to develop detailed feasibility information regarding the construction
and operation of cooling towers, and alternatives to closed cycle cooling, prior
to the issuance of a new draft permit by the NYSDEC staff and commencement of
the adjudicatory proceeding.  The reports include a visual impact and
aesthetics report filed on June 1, 2009, a plume and emissions report filed on
September 1, 2009, a technical feasibility report due and filed in February
2010, and an economic report to establish whether the technology, if feasible,
satisfies the economic test that is part of the New York
standard.  Entergy has also requested that the Assistant Commissioner
reconsider the New York standard in light of the U.S. Supreme Court decision
reversing the Second Circuit's alternative economic test adopted in the August
13, 2008 ruling.  The current procedural schedule calls for hearings
to commence in 2011.  The NYSDEC is expected to consider the
information submitted and issue another draft permit with a new best technology
available determination, which may or may not be cooling towers.  A
new comment period and further contested proceedings likely would
follow.

On April 6, 2009, with a reservation of
rights regarding the applicability of the section, Entergy's Indian Point
facility submitted a Section 401 water quality certification to the
NYSDEC.  The certification, or a waiver or exemption of the same, is
potentially required pursuant to Section 401 of the Clean Water Act as a
supporting document to the NRC's license renewal decision.  On May 13,
2009, the NYSDEC deemed the application incomplete and requested additional
information.  The NYSDEC requested that Entergy respond within 120
days or by September 10, 2009 and set the deadline for submitting all the
requested information as February 13, 2010.  Entergy continues to work
with the NYSDEC in order to provide the requested additional information and
filed two additional reports with the NYSDEC in early February
2010.  By law, the NYSDEC must act on the water quality certification
application within one year of receipt.

Effluent
Limitations

On December 1, 2009, the EPA published
a final rule directed at establishing effluent limitation guidelines and
standards for the construction and development water pollution point source
category.  Included within the industry sector affected by this
rulemaking are electric utility transmission line and substation construction
projects.  The effective date of this rulemaking is February 1,
2010.  In the rulemaking the EPA is promulgating a series of
non-numeric effluent limitations, as well as a numeric effluent limitation for
turbidity.  All construction sites will be required to meet the series
of non-numeric effluent limitations.  In general, the non-numeric
effluent limitations are a reiteration of the requirement to use siltation and
erosion control best management practices directed at stormwater pollution
prevention.

Of greater significance to Entergy,
construction sites that disturb ten or more acres of land at one time will be
required to monitor discharges from the site and comply with the numeric
effluent limitation.  If a project initially exceeds the acreage
threshold but later, due to permanent stabilization of disturbed areas, falls
below the threshold, the numeric effluent limit will no longer apply;
consequently, phasing construction projects to limit the amount of soil
disturbed at any given time will be an allowed strategy for addressing
applicability of the rulemaking.  The EPA is phasing in the numeric
effluent limitation over four years to allow permitting authorities adequate
time to develop monitoring requirements and to allow the regulated community
time to prepare for compliance with the numeric effluent
limitation.  The numeric limit established by this rulemaking is
measured as a daily maximum value.  Due to the nature of this
analytical parameter, sampling and analysis of the effluent must occur on-site
during any day that stormwater run-off occurs at a frequency that will be
established by the permitting authority.


Part I
Item 1

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

The numeric turbidity limitation will
apply to all discharges from the site except on days when total precipitation
during the day exceeded the local 2-year, 24-hour storm.  If the total
precipitation in any one day is greater than the local 2-year, 24-hour storm
event, then permittees would still need to sample (because they wouldn't know in
advance whether the precipitation on that day was going to exceed the storm size
threshold) but the numeric effluent limitation would not apply to discharges for
that day.  The numeric effluent limitation is applicable to all
discharges from the site on subsequent days, however, if there is no 2-year,
24-hour storm event during those days.

In order to achieve the numeric
discharge limit, many Entergy construction projects exceeding the acreage
threshold will likely be required to utilize chemical flocullants, either
applied within a stormwater conveyance in the project watershed or in a
stormwater detention basin.  In some cases, capture of stormwater
run-off and usage of fractionation tanks to temporarily store the water until
sufficient settling of suspended soil particles may be required in order to meet
the numeric limit.

Construction sites that disturb 20 or
more acres at one time will be required to conduct monitoring of discharges from
the site and comply with the numeric effluent limitation beginning 18 months
after the effective date of the final rule.  Assuming the rulemaking
survives any legal challenge, this compliance deadline for 20 acre sites will be
August 1, 2011.  Construction sites that disturb ten or more acres at
one time will be required to conduct monitoring of discharges from the site and
comply with the numeric effluent limitation beginning four years after the
effective date of the final rule (February 1, 2014).

The final rule, in part based on the
considerations of linear projects (electrical line construction), no longer
contains a requirement to install a sediment basin and revisions were made to
the non-numeric effluent limitations based on comments concerning the
feasibility at linear projects.  However, the EPA disagreed with
comments from Entergy and the Utility Water Act Group that suggested the EPA
should either exempt all linear projects from the final rule or from the numeric
effluent limitation.  The EPA has determined that numeric effluent
limitations are feasible for linear projects and passive treatment systems
provide flexibility to linear projects to take into account site specific
considerations.  Additionally, the EPA believes that the permitting
authority, which in Entergy's Utility service area is delegated to the states,
should exercise discretion when determining the monitoring locations and
monitoring frequency for linear construction projects.  This
establishes what will likely be a very subjective development of requirements
for electrical line construction projects.

316(b)
Cooling Water Intake Structures

The EPA finalized new regulations in
July 2004 governing the intake of water at large existing power plants employing
cooling water intake structures.  The rule sought to reduce perceived
impacts on aquatic resources by requiring covered facilities to implement
technology or other measures to meet EPA-targeted reductions in water use and
corresponding perceived aquatic impacts.  Entergy, other industry
members and industry groups, environmental groups, and a coalition of
northeastern and mid-Atlantic states challenged various aspects of the
rule.  In January 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit remanded the rule to the EPA for reconsideration.  The
court instructed the EPA to reconsider several aspects of the rule that were
beneficial to the regulated community after finding that these provisions of the
rule were contrary to the language of the Clean Water Act or were not
sufficiently explained in the rule.  In April 2008, the United States
Supreme Court agreed to review the decision of the Second Circuit on the
question of whether the EPA may take into consideration a cost-benefit analysis
in developing these regulations, a consideration of potential benefit to the
regulated community that the Second Circuit disallowed.  In March
2009, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the petitioners that cost-benefit
analysis may be taken into consideration.  The EPA may now reissue a
rule similar in structure to the rule remanded by the Second Circuit, or the EPA
may issue a rule with a substantially different structure and
effect.  Until the EPA issues guidance to the regulated community on
what actions should be taken to comply with the Clean Water Act, and until the
form and substance of the new rule itself is determined, it is impossible to
estimate the effect of the Supreme Court's decision on Entergy's
business.  See the discussion above regarding the Indian Point and
FitzPatrick permitting processes under similar New York state provisions of
law.

At the request of the EPA Region 1
(Boston), Entergy submitted extensive data to the agency in July 2008 concerning
cooling water intake impacts at the Pilgrim nuclear power
plant.  Analysis of technologies that may be appropriate for Pilgrim
continues, but it appears at this point that cooling towers are not feasible due
to restrictions in the plant's condenser design and capacity.  Other
technologies, such as variable speed pumps and the relocation of the cooling
water intake, are under analysis.


Part I
Item 1

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

Entergy's Utility business generation
facilities are likewise in the process of reviewing data, considering
implementation options, and providing information required by the current rule
to the EPA and the affected states concerning cooling water intake
structures.  Entergy will continue to monitor the activities of the
EPA and the states toward the implementation of section 316(b) of the Clean
Water Act in the wake of the remand of the current rule and will respond
accordingly.  Deadlines for determining compliance with Section 316(b)
and for any required capital or operational expenditures are unknown at this
time due to the remand of the rule to the EPA.  As a result,
management cannot predict the amounts Entergy will ultimately be required to
spend to comply with Section 316(b) and any related state regulations, although
such amounts could be significant.

Coastal
Zone Management Act

The Coastal Zone Management Act
requires federal activities within a coastal zone to be consistent with the
state's federally approved coastal zone management
program.  Therefore, a nuclear facility located within a coastal zone
must obtain a consistency certification from the state as part of the NRC's
license renewal process.  Entergy has Non-Utility Nuclear plants that
are within coastal zones.  Pilgrim has received its consistency
determination from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  Vermont Yankee
is not within a coastal zone and does not need a consistency
determination.

In New York, the Coastal Management
Program promotes waterfront revitalization, protects fish and wildlife habitats,
protects and enhances scenic and historic areas, and promotes water access and
public recreation.  As discussed above, FitzPatrick already has
obtained its consistency certification.  Indian Point expects to file
its consistency determination application with the New York Department of State
in mid-2010.  The New York Department of State has six months from the
date it deems the application complete to issue or deny the consistency
certification.

Groundwater at Certain
Nuclear Sites

The NRC requires nuclear power plants
to regularly monitor and report the presence of radioactive material in the
environment.  Entergy joined other nuclear utilities and the Nuclear
Energy Institute in 2006 to develop a voluntary groundwater monitoring and
protection program.  This initiative began after detection of very low
levels of radioactive material, primarily tritium, in groundwater at several
plants in the United States, including the Indian Point Energy
Center.  In addition to tritium, other radionuclides have been found
in on site ground water at Indian Point.

As part of the groundwater monitoring
and protection program, Entergy has: (1) performed reviews of plant groundwater
characteristics (hydrology) and historical records of past events on site that
may have potentially impacted groundwater; (2) implemented fleet procedures on
how to handle events that could impact groundwater; and (3) installed
groundwater monitoring wells and began periodic sampling.  The program
also includes protocols for notifying local officials if contamination is
found.  To date, radionuclides have been detected at Entergy's
FitzPatrick, Indian Point, Palisades, Pilgrim, and Vermont Yankee
plants.

Entergy identified and addressed two
sources of the contamination at Indian Point: the Unit 1 and 2 spent fuel
pools.  In October 2007, the EPA announced that it was consulting with
the NRC and the NYSDEC regarding Indian Point.  The EPA stated that
after reviewing data it confirmed with New York State that there have been no
violations of federal drinking water standards for radionuclides in drinking
water supplies.  Indian Point has implemented an extensive groundwater
monitoring and protection program, including installing approximately 35
monitoring wells, with five to six sampling points per well.  Entergy
has been working cooperatively with the NRC and the NYSDEC in a split sample
program to independently analyze test samples.

At Palisades, Entergy identified
tritium in two monitoring wells in December 2007 caused by leakage from the
buried piping for a recirculation line.  Non-destructive evaluation of
the line identified one area of leakage and repairs were completed in
2008.  Since early 2008, groundwater from three wells have been
sampled and analyzed on a bi-weekly basis. Following the repairs, tritium levels
declined in all of the wells and trended downward until one well spiked in March
2009.  Additional investigation was performed to locate the
source,


Part I
Item 1

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

including
installation of 18 temporary monitoring wells along the path of the buried
piping.  A new leak location was identified and repairs at the
location were completed in mid-summer 2009.  However, when the system
was put back in service, it became evident from groundwater samples that this
same buried piping system was also breached at locations other than at the leak
location that had earlier been repaired.  Therefore, the piping system
was again taken out of service and drained to prevent further leakage into the
ground.  Subsequently, Entergy decided to abandon this piping and to
run new replacement buried pipe for this system.  This effort was
completed in December 2009.  Bi-weekly sampling will continue until
the groundwater tritium levels in the monitoring wells are below minimum
detection levels.

At Pilgrim, six existing monitoring
wells are being sampled and analyzed on a periodic basis.  Results
continue to show low levels of tritium.  A hydrogeological analysis
was performed in 2009 to pinpoint the location for six additional wells to
further study the situation, and these wells will be installed in
2010.  Currently, the detections are believed to be from wash out of
atmospheric tritium.  Precipitation studies are being performed to
confirm this theory.

At FitzPatrick, a sample collected from
a reactor building perimeter sump in November 2009 showed elevated levels of
tritium.  Follow up samples collected in December 2009 from a storm
drain that communicates with this sump also found elevated levels of
tritium.  Investigations are ongoing to determine the source of the
tritium and to determine what action should be taken.  No elevated
levels of tritium have been found in manholes, equipment pits or any of the
groundwater monitoring wells.

In January 2010, Vermont Yankee was
notified by its off-site analytical laboratory that a sample collected from a
groundwater monitoring well in mid-November 2009 showed elevated levels of
tritium.  Subsequent analyses continue to confirm the presence of an
elevated tritium concentration.  Investigations are ongoing to
determine the source of the tritium, including the installation of additional
monitoring wells in February 2010, and to determine what action should be
taken.  No elevated levels of tritium have been found in any potable
water wells located on- or off-site.

Indian Point Units 1 and 2
Hazardous Waste Remediation

As part
of the effort to terminate the current Indian Point 2 mixed waste storage
permit, Entergy was required to perform groundwater and soil sampling for
metals, PCBs and other non-radiological contaminants on plant property,
regardless of whether these contaminants stem from onsite activities or were
related to the waste stored on-site pursuant to the permit.  Entergy
believes this permit is no longer necessary for the facility due to an exemption
for mixed wastes (hazardous waste that is also radioactive) promulgated as part
of the EPA's hazardous waste regulations.  This exemption allows mixed
waste to be regulated through the NRC license instead of through a separate EPA
or state hazardous waste permit.  In February 2008, Entergy submitted
its report on this sampling effort to the NYSDEC.  The report
indicated the presence of various metals in soils at levels above the NYSDEC
cleanup objectives.  It does not appear that these metals are
connected to operation of the nuclear facility.  At the request of the
NYSDEC, Entergy submitted a plan on August 8, 2008, for a study that will
identify the sources of the metals.  The NYSDEC recently approved this
workplan with some conditions related to the need to study whether the soil
impact observed may have originated from plant construction
materials.  This issue is being studied by Entergy to determine if any
changes to the workplan are necessary.  The NYSDEC may require
additional work to define the vertical and lateral extent of the contamination
on-site, and evaluate any potential for migration off-site.  The
NYSDEC plans to use the results of this investigation to determine whether the
permit can be terminated and the metals left in place until plant
decommissioning or if further investigation or remediation is
required.  Entergy is unable to determine what the extent or cost of
required remediation, if any, will be at this time.

Prior to
Entergy's purchase of Indian Point Unit 1, the previous owner completed the
cleanup and desludging of the Unit 1 water storage pool, generating mixed waste
(waste that is regulated as both low-level nuclear waste and hazardous
waste).  The waste currently is stored in the Unit 1 containment
building in accordance with NRC regulations controlling low level radioactive
waste.  The waste is also regulated by the NYSDEC.  The NYSDEC
requires Entergy to survey quarterly the availability of any commercial facility
capable of treating, processing and disposing of this waste in a commercially
reasonable manner.  Entergy continues to review this matter and to conduct
its quarterly searches for a commercially reasonable vendor that is acceptable
both to the NRC and the NYSDEC.  The cost of this disposal cannot be
estimated at this time due to the many variables existing in the type and manner
of disposal.

Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980

The Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (CERCLA),
authorizes the EPA to mandate clean-up by, or to collect reimbursement of
clean-up costs from, owners or operators of sites at which hazardous substances
may be or have been released.  Certain private parties also may use
CERCLA to recover response costs.  Parties that transported hazardous
substances to these sites or arranged for the disposal of the substances are
also deemed liable by CERCLA.  CERCLA has been interpreted to impose
strict, joint, and several liability on responsible
parties.  Entergy's Utility and Non-Utility Nuclear businesses have
sent waste materials to various disposal sites over the years, and releases have
occurred at Entergy facilities.  In addition, environmental laws now
regulate certain of Entergy's operating procedures and maintenance practices
that historically were not subject to regulation.  Some disposal sites
used by Entergy have been the subject of governmental action under CERCLA,
resulting in site clean-up activities.  Entergy's Utility and
Non-Utility Nuclear businesses have participated to various degrees in
accordance with their respective potential liabilities in such site clean-ups
and have developed experience with clean-up costs.  The affected
Entergy companies have established reserves for such environmental clean-up and
restoration activities.  Details of significant CERCLA liabilities are
discussed in the "Other Environmental Matters" section below.

Other Environmental
Matters

Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas

Several class action and other suits
have been filed in state and federal courts seeking relief from Entergy Gulf
States, Inc. and others for damages caused by the disposal of hazardous waste
and for asbestos-related disease allegedly resulting from exposure on Entergy
Gulf States, Inc.'s premises (see "

Litigation

"
below).

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana is
currently involved in the second phase of the remedial investigation of the Lake
Charles Service Center site, located in Lake Charles, Louisiana.  A
manufactured gas plant (MGP) is believed to have operated at this site from
approximately 1916 to 1931.  Coal tar, a by-product of the
distillation process employed at MGPs, was apparently routed to a portion of the
property for disposal.  The same area has also been used as a
landfill.  In 1999, Entergy Gulf States, Inc. signed a second
Administrative Consent Order with the EPA to perform removal action at the
site.  In 2002, approximately 7,400 tons of contaminated soil and
debris were excavated and disposed of from an area within the service
center.  In 2003, a cap was constructed over the remedial area to
prevent the migration of contamination to the surface.  In August
2005, an administrative order was issued by the EPA requiring that a 10-year
groundwater study be conducted at this site.  The groundwater
monitoring study commenced in January 2006, and is continuing on a quarterly
basis.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas each believe
that its ultimate responsibility for this site will not materially exceed the
existing clean-up provisions of $0.4 million for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana
and $0.3 million for Entergy Texas.

In 1994, Entergy Gulf States, Inc.
performed a site assessment in conjunction with a construction project at the
Louisiana Station Generating Plant (Louisiana Station).  In 1995, a
further assessment confirmed subsurface soil and groundwater impact to three
areas on the plant site.  After validation, a notification was made to
the LDEQ and a phased process was executed to remediate each area of
concern.  The final phase of groundwater clean-up and monitoring at
Louisiana Station is expected to continue for several more years.  The
remediation cost incurred through December 31, 2009 for this site was $6.8
million.  Future costs are not expected to exceed Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana's existing provision of $0.7 million.

The Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality (TCEQ) notified Entergy Gulf States, Inc. that the TCEQ believed that
Entergy Gulf States, Inc. is one of many potentially responsible parties (PRP)
concerning contamination existing at the Spector Salvage Yard proposed state
superfund site in Orange, Texas.  The TCEQ conducted a removal
action


Part I
Item 1

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

consisting
of the excavation and offsite disposal of contaminated surface
soil.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas do not believe
at this time that the former Gulf States Utilities contributed any significant
amount of hazardous substances to this site and therefore are contesting
liability.  Entergy Texas and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana believe
that their ultimate responsibility for this site will not exceed their existing
clean-up provisions.

Entergy
Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans

Several class action and other suits
have been filed in state and federal courts seeking relief from Entergy
Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans and others for damages caused by the disposal
of hazardous waste and for asbestos-related disease allegedly resulting from
exposure on Entergy Louisiana's and Entergy New Orleans' premises (see "

Litigation

"
below).

During 1993, the LDEQ issued new rules
for solid waste regulation, including regulation of wastewater
impoundments.  Entergy Louisiana has determined that some of its power
plant wastewater impoundments were affected by these regulations and may require
remediation, repair, or closure.  Completion of this work is dependent
on pending LDEQ approval of submitted solid waste permit
applications.  As a result, a recorded liability in the amount of $1.9
million for Entergy Louisiana existed at December 31, 2009 for ongoing
wastewater remediation and repairs and closures.  Management believes
this reserve to be adequate based on current estimates.

Transmission
and distribution storm teams entered wetland areas of Lafourche Parish to
restore Entergy Louisiana's Barataria-Golden Meadow line shortly after
Hurricane Katrina.  A portion of this line crosses property owned by a
third party.  The landowner has requested that Entergy Louisiana conduct an
extensive wetland mitigation program over a ten-acre area and has filed suit
against Entergy Louisiana and certain other Entergy subsidiaries concerning the
extent of the mitigation.  Entergy Louisiana believes that the marsh area
affected by its activities is less than 2 acres and that restoration can be
conducted to the satisfaction of the U. S. Corps of Engineers and the State of
Louisiana for substantially less than the over $4 million claimed by the
plaintiff.  Entergy Louisiana will meet with the Corps of Engineers
and the State of Louisiana to determine the extent of mitigation required by the
Clean Water Act and parallel state law.

Entergy
Louisiana and Entergy Texas

Damage sustained by Entergy Louisiana's
and Entergy Texas' electrical transmission infrastructure due to the effects of
Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike necessitated that significant amounts of
restoration work occur in areas classified as jurisdictional wetlands and
coastal marsh.  While measures were taken to minimize the impact in
these environmentally-sensitive areas, some level of damage to the wetland and
marsh areas likely occurred.  Mitigation requirements for these
possible impacts have yet to be assessed or required by regulatory
authorities.  Following Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita, the
regulatory authorities deferred assessing mitigation requirements for such
impacts pending an evaluation of spontaneous recovery of the marsh and wetlands
damaged during line repairs.

Entergy
Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy New Orleans,
and Entergy Texas

The TCEQ
notified Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Texas, Entergy
Louisiana, and Entergy New Orleans that the TCEQ believes those entities are
PRPs concerning contamination existing at the San Angelo Electric Service
Company (SESCO) facility in San Angelo, Texas.  The facility operated
as a transformer repair and scrapping facility from the 1930s until
2003.  Both soil and groundwater contamination exists at the
site.  Entergy Gulf States, Inc. and Entergy Louisiana sent
transformers to this facility during the 1980s.  Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana, Entergy Texas, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy Arkansas responded to
an information request from the TCEQ and continue to cooperate in this
investigation.  Entergy New Orleans provided requested information
concerning its former status in bankruptcy. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana,
Entergy Texas, and Entergy Louisiana joined a group of PRPs responding to site
conditions in cooperation with the State of Texas, creating cost allocation
models based on review of SESCO documents and employee interviews, and
investigating contribution actions against other PRPs.  Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy Texas have agreed to contribute to the
remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater at the site in a measure
proportionate to those companies' involvement at the site, while Entergy
Arkansas and Entergy New Orleans


Part I
Item 1

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

likely
will pay de minimis amounts.  Current estimates, although preliminary and
variable depending on the level of third-party cost contributions, indicate that
Entergy's total share of remediation costs likely will be less than $1 million.
The TCEQ approved an Agreed Administrative Order on September 20, 2006, that
allows the implementation of a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study at the
SESCO site; with the ultimate disposition being a remedial action to remove
contaminants of concern.  TCEQ approved the Remedial Investigation
Work Plan in May 2007 and field sampling began in July 2007.

Entergy
Mississippi, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy New
Orleans, and Entergy Texas

The EPA
has notified Entergy Mississippi, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Texas,
and Entergy New Orleans that the EPA believes those entities are PRPs concerning
contamination of an area known as "Devil's Swamp Lake" near the Port of Baton
Rouge, Louisiana.  The area allegedly was contaminated by the operations of
Rollins Environmental (LA), Inc, which operated a disposal facility to which
many companies contributed waste.  Documents provided by the EPA indicate
that Entergy Louisiana may also be a PRP.  Entergy continues to monitor
this developing situation.

Litigation

Entergy uses legal and appropriate
means to contest litigation threatened or filed against it, but certain states
in which Entergy operates have proven to be unusually litigious
environments.  Judges and juries in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas
have demonstrated a willingness to grant large verdicts, including punitive
damages, to plaintiffs in personal injury, property damage, and business tort
cases.  The litigation environment in these states poses a significant
business risk to Entergy.

Ratepayer and Fuel Cost
Recovery Lawsuits

(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas,
Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy
Texas)

Entergy
New Orleans Fuel Adjustment Clause Litigation

In April
1999, a group of ratepayers filed a complaint against Entergy New Orleans,
Entergy Corporation, Entergy Services, and Entergy Power in state court in
Orleans Parish purportedly on behalf of all Entergy New Orleans
ratepayers.  The plaintiffs seek treble damages for alleged injuries
arising from the defendants' alleged violations of Louisiana's antitrust laws in
connection with certain costs passed on to ratepayers in Entergy New Orleans'
fuel adjustment filings with the City Council.  In particular,
plaintiffs allege that Entergy New Orleans improperly included certain costs in
the calculation of fuel charges and that Entergy New Orleans imprudently
purchased high-cost fuel or energy from other Entergy
affiliates.  Plaintiffs allege that Entergy New Orleans and the other
defendant Entergy companies conspired to make these purchases to the detriment
of Entergy New Orleans' ratepayers and to the benefit of Entergy's shareholders,
in violation of Louisiana's antitrust laws.  Plaintiffs also seek to
recover interest and attorneys' fees.  Entergy filed exceptions to the
plaintiffs' allegations, asserting, among other things, that jurisdiction over
these issues rests with the City Council and the FERC.  In March 2004,
the plaintiffs supplemented and amended their petition.  If necessary,
at the appropriate time, Entergy will also raise its defenses to the antitrust
claims.  The suit in state court was stayed by stipulation of the
parties and order of the court pending review of the decision by the City
Council in the proceeding discussed in the next paragraph.

Plaintiffs
also filed a corresponding complaint with the City Council in order to initiate
a review by the City Council of the plaintiffs' allegations and to force
restitution to ratepayers of all costs they allege were improperly and
imprudently included in the fuel adjustment filings.  Testimony was
filed on behalf of the plaintiffs in this proceeding asserting, among other
things, that Entergy New Orleans and other defendants have engaged in fuel
procurement and power purchasing practices and included costs in Entergy New
Orleans' fuel adjustment that could have resulted in Entergy New Orleans
customers being overcharged by more than $100 million over a period of years.
Hearings were held in February and March 2002.  In February 2004, the
City Council approved a resolution that resulted in a refund to customers of
$11.3 million, including interest, during the months of June through September
2004.  In May 2005 the Civil District Court for the Parish of
Orleans affirmed the City Council resolution, finding no support for the
plaintiffs' claim that the refund amount should be higher.  In
June 2005, the plaintiffs appealed the Civil District Court decision to the
Louisiana Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal.  On February 25, 2008, the
Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal


Part I
Item 1

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

issued a
decision affirming in part, and reversing in part, the Civil District Court's
decision.  Although the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal did not reverse any
of the substantive findings and conclusions of the City Council or the Civil
District Court, the Fourth Circuit found that the amount of the refund was
arbitrary and capricious and increased the amount of the refund to $34.3
million.  Entergy New Orleans and the City Council filed with the Louisiana
Supreme Court seeking, among other things, review and reversal of the Fourth
Circuit decision.  In April 2009 the Louisiana Supreme Court reversed
the decision of the Louisiana Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal and reinstated the
decision of the Civil District Court.  In May 2009 the Louisiana
Supreme Court denied the plaintiffs' request for rehearing.  In
January 2010 the plaintiffs filed a motion to lift the stay and to supplement
and amend their state court petition.

In the Entergy New Orleans bankruptcy
proceeding, the named plaintiffs in the Entergy New Orleans fuel clause lawsuit,
together with the named plaintiffs in the Entergy New Orleans rate of return
lawsuit, filed a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment asking the court to declare
that Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Corporation, and Entergy Services are a single
business enterprise, and, as such, are liable in solido with Entergy New Orleans
for any claims asserted in the Entergy New Orleans fuel adjustment clause
lawsuit and the Entergy New Orleans rate of return lawsuit, and, alternatively,
that the automatic stay be lifted to permit the movants to pursue the same
relief in state court.  The bankruptcy court dismissed the action on April
26, 2006.  The matter was appealed to the U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of Louisiana, and the district court affirmed the dismissal in
October 2006, but on different grounds, concluding that the lawsuit was
premature.  In Entergy New Orleans' plan of reorganization that was
confirmed by the bankruptcy court in May 2007, the plaintiffs' claims are
treated as unimpaired "Litigation Claims," which will "ride through" the
bankruptcy proceeding, with any legal, equitable and contractual rights to which
the plaintiffs' Litigation Claim entitles the plaintiffs unaltered by the plan
of reorganization.

Entergy
New Orleans Rate of Return Lawsuit

In April 1998, a group of residential
and business ratepayers filed a complaint against Entergy New Orleans in state
court in Orleans Parish purportedly on behalf of all ratepayers in New
Orleans.  The plaintiffs allege that Entergy New Orleans overcharged
ratepayers by at least $300 million since 1975 in violation of limits on Entergy
New Orleans' rate of return that the plaintiffs allege were established by
ordinances passed by the City Council in 1922.  The plaintiffs seek,
among other things, (i) a declaratory judgment that such franchise ordinances
have been violated; and (ii) a remand to the City Council for the establishment
of the amount of overcharges plus interest.  Entergy New Orleans
believes the lawsuit is without merit.  Entergy New Orleans has
charged only those rates authorized by the City Council in accordance with
applicable law.  In May 2000, a court of appeal granted Entergy New
Orleans' exception to jurisdiction in the case and dismissed the
proceeding.  The Louisiana Supreme Court denied the plaintiffs'
request for a writ of certiorari.

The
plaintiffs then commenced a similar proceeding before the City
Council.  The plaintiffs and the advisors for the Council each filed
their first round of testimony in January 2002.  In their testimony,
the plaintiffs allege that Entergy New Orleans earned in excess of the legally
authorized rate of return during the period 1979 to 2000 and that Entergy New
Orleans should be required to refund between $240 million and $825 million to
its ratepayers.  In the testimony submitted by the Council advisors,
the advisors allege that Entergy New Orleans has not earned in excess of its
authorized rate of return for the period at issue and that no refund is
therefore warranted.

In December 2003, the Council advisors
filed a motion in the City Council proceedings to bifurcate the hearing in this
matter, such that the effect of the provision of the 1922 Ordinance in setting
lawful rates would be considered first.  Only if it is determined that
this provision establishes a limitation would the remaining issues be reached.
The motion to bifurcate was granted by the City Council in April 2004, and a
hearing on the first part of the bifurcated proceeding was completed in June
2005.  After the submission of briefs and oral argument in April 2006,
the City Council dismissed with prejudice the plaintiffs' claims on multiple
grounds.  In May 2006, the plaintiffs appealed the City Council's
decision, and the plaintiffs' appeal is currently pending in Civil District
Court for the Parish of Orleans.  Entergy New Orleans also appealed,
separately, certain evidentiary rulings included in the City Council's
decision.  These matters were consolidated and oral argument on these
appeals took place before the Civil District Court in August 2008.


Part I
Item 1

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

Additionally,
in the Entergy New Orleans bankruptcy proceeding, the named plaintiffs in the
Entergy New Orleans rate of return lawsuit, together with the named plaintiffs
in the Entergy New Orleans fuel adjustment clause lawsuit, filed a Complaint for
Declaratory Judgment asking the court to declare that Entergy New Orleans,
Entergy Corporation, and Entergy Services are a single business enterprise, and,
as such, are liable in solido with Entergy New Orleans for any claims asserted
in the Entergy New Orleans rate of return lawsuit and the Entergy New Orleans
fuel adjustment clause lawsuit, and, alternatively, that the automatic stay be
lifted to permit the movants to pursue the same relief in state court.  The
bankruptcy court dismissed the action on April 26, 2006.  The matter
was appealed to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana,
and the district court affirmed the dismissal in October 2006, but on different
grounds, concluding that the lawsuit was premature.  In Entergy New
Orleans' plan of reorganization that was confirmed by the bankruptcy court in
May 2007, the plaintiffs' claims are treated as unimpaired "Litigation Claims,"
which will "ride through" the bankruptcy proceeding, with any legal, equitable
and contractual rights to which the plaintiffs' Litigation Claim entitles the
plaintiffs unaltered by the plan of reorganization.

Texas
Power Price Lawsuit

In August
2003, a lawsuit was filed in the district court of Chambers County, Texas by
Texas residents on behalf of a purported class apparently of the Texas retail
customers of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. who were billed and paid for electric
power from January 1, 1994 to the present.  The named defendants
include Entergy Corporation, Entergy Services, Entergy Power, Entergy Power
Marketing Corp., and Entergy Arkansas.  Entergy Gulf States, Inc. was
not a named defendant, but is alleged to be a co-conspirator.  The
court granted the request of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. to intervene in the
lawsuit to protect its interests.

Plaintiffs
allege that the defendants implemented a "price gouging accounting scheme" to
sell to plaintiffs and similarly situated utility customers higher priced power
generated by the defendants while rejecting and/or reselling to off-system
utilities less expensive power offered and/or purchased from off-system
suppliers and/or generated by the Entergy system.  In particular,
plaintiffs allege that the defendants manipulated and continue to manipulate the
dispatch of generation so that power is purchased from affiliated expensive
resources instead of buying cheaper off-system power.

Plaintiffs
stated in their pleadings that customers in Texas were charged at least $57
million above prevailing market prices for power.  Plaintiffs seek
actual, consequential and exemplary damages, costs and attorneys' fees, and
disgorgement of profits.  The plaintiffs' experts have tendered a
report calculating damages in a large range, from $153 million to $972 million
in present value, under various scenarios.  The Entergy defendants
have tendered expert reports challenging the assumptions, methodologies, and
conclusions of the plaintiffs' expert reports.

The case
is pending in state district court, and the court has not set a date for a class
certification hearing.

Mississippi
Attorney General Complaint

The
Mississippi attorney general filed a complaint in state court in December 2008
against Entergy Corporation, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy Services, and Entergy
Power alleging, among other things, violations of Mississippi statutes, fraud,
and breach of good faith and fair dealing, and requesting an accounting and
restitution.  The litigation is wide ranging and relates to tariffs
and procedures under which Entergy Mississippi purchases power not generated in
Mississippi to meet electricity demand.  Entergy believes the
complaint is unfounded.  On December 29, 2008, the defendant Entergy
companies filed to remove the attorney general's suit to U.S. District Court
(the forum that Entergy believes is appropriate to resolve the types of federal
issues raised in the suit), where it is currently pending, and additionally
answered the complaint and filed a counter-claim for relief based upon the
Mississippi Public Utilities Act and the Federal Power Act.  The
Mississippi attorney general has filed a pleading seeking to remand the matter
to state court.  In May 2009, the defendant Entergy companies filed a
motion for judgment on the pleadings asserting grounds of federal preemption,
the exclusive jurisdiction of the MPSC, and factual errors in the attorney
general's complaint.

Fiber Optic Cable
Litigation

(Entergy Corporation and Entergy Louisiana)

Several
property owners have filed a class action suit against Entergy Louisiana,
Entergy Services, ETHC, and Entergy Technology Company in state court in St.
James Parish, Louisiana purportedly on behalf of all property owners in
Louisiana who have conveyed easements to the defendants.  The lawsuit
alleges that Entergy installed fiber optic cable across the plaintiffs' property
without obtaining appropriate easements.  The plaintiffs seek damages
equal to the fair market value of the surplus fiber optic cable capacity,
including a share of the profits made through use of the fiber optic cables, and
punitive damages.  Entergy removed the case to federal court in New
Orleans; however, the district court remanded the case back to state
court.  In February 2004, the state court entered an order certifying
this matter as a class action.  Entergy's appeals of this ruling were
denied.  The parties have entered into a term sheet establishing basic
terms for a settlement that must be approved by the court.

Asbestos
Litigation

(Entergy Arkansas,
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy
New Orleans, and Entergy Texas)

Numerous lawsuits have been filed in
federal and state courts primarily in Texas and Louisiana, primarily by
contractor employees who worked in the 1940-1980s timeframe, against Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas, and to a lesser extent the other
Utility operating companies, as premises owners of power plants, for damages
caused by alleged exposure to asbestos.  Many other defendants are
named in these lawsuits as well.  Currently, there are approximately
500 lawsuits involving approximately 5,000 claimants.  Management
believes that adequate provisions have been established to cover any
exposure.  Additionally, negotiations continue with insurers to
recover reimbursements.  Management believes that loss exposure has
been and will continue to be handled so that the ultimate resolution of these
matters will not be material, in the aggregate, to the financial position or
results of operation of the Utility operating companies.

Employment and Labor-related
Proceedings

(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy
Texas, and System Energy)

The Registrant Subsidiaries and other
Entergy subsidiaries are responding to various lawsuits in both state and
federal courts and to other labor-related proceedings filed by current and
former employees.  Generally, the amount of damages being sought is
not specified in these proceedings.  These actions include, but are
not limited to, allegations of wrongful employment actions; wage disputes and
other claims under the Fair Labor Standards Act or its state counterparts;
claims of race, gender and disability discrimination; disputes arising under
collective bargaining agreements; unfair labor practice proceedings and other
administrative proceedings before the National Labor Relations Board; claims of
retaliation; and claims for or regarding benefits under various Entergy
Corporation sponsored plans. Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries are
responding to these suits and proceedings and deny liability to the
claimants.

RISK
FACTORS

Investors
should review carefully the following risk factors and the other information in
this Form 10-K.  The risks that Entergy faces are not limited to those
in this section.  There may be additional risks and uncertainties
(either currently unknown or not currently believed to be material) that could
adversely affect Entergy's financial condition, results of operations and
liquidity.  See "FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION."

Utility Regulatory
Risks

(Entergy
Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana,
Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas and System
Energy)

The
terms and conditions of service, including electric and gas rates, of the
Utility operating companies and System Energy are determined through regulatory
approval proceedings that are lengthy and subject to appeal that could result in
delays in effecting rate changes and uncertainty as to ultimate
results.

The rates
that the Utility operating companies and System Energy charge reflect their
capital expenditures, operations and maintenance charges, allowed rates of
return, financing costs, and related costs of service. These rates significantly
influence the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of
Entergy and each of the Utility operating companies and System
Energy.  These rates are determined in regulatory proceedings and are
subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment.

In
addition, regulators can initiate proceedings to investigate the prudence of
costs in the Utility operating companies' base rates and examine, among other
things, the prudence of the companies' operation and maintenance practices,
level of expenditures (including storm costs), allowed rates of
return and appropriate rate base, proposed resource acquisitions and
previously incurred capital expenditures.  The regulators can disallow
costs found not to have been prudently incurred, creating some risk to the
ultimate recovery of those costs.  Regulatory proceedings relating to
rates and other matters typically involve multiple parties seeking to limit or
reduce rates.  The proceedings generally have long timelines, are
primarily based on historical costs, and may or may not be limited by statute,
which could cause the Utility operating companies and System Energy to
experience regulatory lag in recovering such costs through
rates.  Decisions are typically subject to appeal, potentially leading
to additional uncertainty associated with rate case proceedings.  The
Utility operating companies and System Energy, and the energy industry as a
whole, have experienced a period of rising costs and investments, which could
result in more frequent rate cases and requests for, and the continuation of,
cost recovery mechanisms.  For information regarding rate case
proceedings and formula rate plans applicable to certain of the Utility
operating companies, see Note 2 to the financial statements.

The
Utility operating companies recover fuel and purchased power costs through rate
mechanisms that are subject to risks of delay or disallowance in regulatory
proceedings.

The
Utility operating companies recover their fuel and purchased power costs from
their customers through rate mechanisms subject to periodic regulatory review
and adjustment.  Because regulatory review can result in the
disallowance of incurred costs found not to have been prudently incurred, there
exists some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs.  Regulators
can initiate proceedings to investigate the continued usage or the adequacy and
operation of the fuel and purchased power recovery clauses of the Utility
operating companies.

The
Utility operating companies' cash flows can be negatively affected by the time
delays between when gas, power or other commodities are purchased and the
ultimate recovery from customers in rates. On occasion, when the level
of incurred costs for fuel and purchased power rises very dramatically, some
of the Utility operating companies may agree to defer recovery of a
portion of that period's fuel and purchased power costs for recovery at a later
date, which could increase the near-term working capital and borrowing
requirements of those companies.  For a description of fuel and
purchased power recovery mechanisms and information regarding the regulatory
proceedings for fuel and purchased power recovery, see Note 2 to the financial
statements.


Part I
Item 1A & 1B

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

As
a result of a challenge by the LPSC, the manner in which the Utility operating
companies have traditionally shared the costs associated with coordinated
planning, construction and operation of generating resources and bulk
transmission facilities has been changed by the FERC, which will require
adjustment of retail rates in the jurisdictions where the Utility operating
companies provide service and has introduced additional uncertainty in the
ratemaking process.

The
Utility operating companies historically have engaged in the coordinated
planning, construction, and operation of generating resources and bulk
transmission facilities under the terms of the System Agreement, which is a rate
schedule that has been approved by the FERC.  In 2005, the FERC issued
a decision requiring changes to the cost allocation methodology used in that
rate schedule.  In 2007 through 2009, payments were made by Entergy
Arkansas to certain of the Utility operating companies.

Although actual
payments/receipts for 2010, based on calendar year 2009 production costs, will
not be calculated until the Utility operating companies have filed their FERC
Form 1s, preliminary estimates indicate that Entergy Arkansas will be required
to make payments of approximately $70 million in 2010.  Entergy's
management believes that any changes in the allocation of production costs
resulting from the FERC's decision and related retail proceedings should result
in similar rate changes for retail customers.  The timing of recovery
of these costs in rates, however, could be the subject of additional regulatory
and other proceedings.

In
December 2005, Entergy Arkansas provided notice of its intent to terminate its
participation in the System Agreement.  In November 2007, Entergy
Mississippi provided its notice to terminate its participation in the System
Agreement.  Each notice of termination is effective ninety-six (96)
months from the date of notice or such earlier date as authorized by the
FERC.  The FERC accepted the notices in November 2009; the LPSC and
City Council have requested rehearing of that order.  Entergy cannot
predict the timing or the form of any successor arrangement to the System
Agreement, to the extent one is implemented, or the effect such a successor
arrangement (or the absence thereof) will have on Entergy or the Utility
operating companies.

The LPSC,
APSC, MPSC and the AEEC have appealed the 2005 FERC decision to the Court of
Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.  Entergy and the City of New Orleans
intervened in the various appeals.  The D.C. Circuit issued its
decision in April 2008. The D.C. Circuit affirmed the FERC's decision in most
respects, but remanded the case to the FERC for further proceedings and
reconsideration of its conclusion that it was prohibited from ordering refunds
and its determination to implement the bandwidth remedy commencing with calendar
year 2006 production costs (with the first payments/receipts commencing in June
2007), rather than commencing the remedy on June 1, 2005. The D.C. Circuit
concluded the FERC had failed to offer a reasoned explanation regarding these
issues.  The proceeding is pending at the FERC. For information

materially adversely affected by the destructive effects of severe
weather.  Severe weather can also result in significant outages for
the customers of the Utility operating companies and, therefore, reduced
revenues for the Utility operating companies during the period of the

Nuclear Operating and
Regulatory Risks

(Entergy
Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States

Louisiana, Entergy
Louisiana, and System Energy)

Certain of the
Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear
subsidiaries must consistently operate their nuclear power plants at high
capacity factors in order to be successful, and lower capacity factors could
materially adversely affect Entergy's and their results of operations, financial
condition and liquidity.

Nuclear
capacity factors significantly affect certain Utility operating companies',
System Energy's and the Non-Utility Nuclear subsidiaries' results of operations.
Nuclear plant operations involve substantial fixed operating costs, as well as
non-fixed costs associated with plant operating conditions and issues.
Consequently, to be successful, a plant owner must consistently operate its
nuclear power plants at high capacity factors. Lower capacity factors increase
operating costs by requiring the affected companies to generate additional
energy, sometimes at higher costs, from their fossil or hydroelectric facilities
or purchase additional energy in the spot or forward markets in order to satisfy
their supply needs.  Although most of the Non-Utility Nuclear forward
sales are on a pure unit-contingent basis, which depends on the availability of
the asset, some of the unit-contingent contracts guarantee a specific capacity
factor.  Non-Utility Nuclear forward sales can also be on a Firm LD
basis.  In the event these plants were operating below the guaranteed
capacity factors, the unit-contingent contracts carrying damage provisions
would subject the Entergy System to price risk for the undelivered
power.

Certain
of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy's Non-Utility
Nuclear subsidiaries periodically shutdown their nuclear power plants to
replenish fuel.  Plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled
during such fuel outages. If refueling outages last longer than anticipated or
if unplanned outages arise, Entergy's and their results of operations, financial
condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.

Outages
at nuclear power plants to replenish fuel require the plant to be "turned
off."  Refueling outages generally are planned to occur once every 18
to 24 months and have historically averaged approximately 30 days in
duration.  Plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during
such planned outages.   When refueling outages last longer than
anticipated or a plant experiences unplanned outages, capacity factors decrease
and maintenance costs increase.  The Non-Utility Nuclear subsidiaries
may face lower margins due to higher costs and lower energy sales for
unit-contingent power supply contracts or potentially higher energy replacement
costs for unit-contingent contracts with capacity guarantees that are not met
due to extended or unplanned outages.

Certain
of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy's Non-Utility
Nuclear subsidiaries face risks related to the purchase of uranium fuel (and its
conversion, enrichment and fabrication), and their inability to effectively
manage these risks by purchasing from a diversified mix of sellers located in a
diversified mix of countries could materially adversely affect Entergy's and
their results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

Based
upon currently planned fuel cycles, Entergy's nuclear units have a diversified
portfolio of contracts and inventory that provides substantially adequate
nuclear fuel materials and conversion and enrichment services at what Entergy
believes are reasonably predictable prices through most of 2010. It will be
necessary for Entergy to enter into additional arrangements to acquire nuclear
fuel and related services beyond 2010.  Entergy's ability to purchase
nuclear fuel at reasonably predictable prices depends upon the creditworthiness
and performance reliability of uranium miners, as well as upon the structure of
Entergy's contracts for the purchase of nuclear fuel. For example, some of the
supply under Entergy's contracts for nuclear fuel is effectively on a
"mine-contingent" basis, which means that if applicable mines are unable to
supply sufficient uranium, Entergy may be required to purchase some nuclear fuel
from another supplier. There are a number of possible alternate suppliers that
may be accessed to mitigate such an event, including potentially drawing upon
Entergy's own inventory intended for later generation periods depending upon its
risk management strategy at that time, although the pricing of any such
alternate uranium supply from the market will be dependent upon the market for
uranium supply at that time. The market for uranium supply became extremely
limited in 2006 and 2007, but this supply shortfall was substantially eliminated
in 2008 and 2009. Market prices for uranium concentrates rose from about $7 per
pound in December 2000 to a 2007 range of $70 to $135 per pound.  In
2008, however, market prices for uranium concentrates ranged from $45 to $90 per
pound and from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009 ranged from $40 to $55
per pound.  The recent higher nuclear fuel market prices of 2006-2009
compared to the 2000-2005 period affect the U.S. nuclear utility industry,
including Entergy, first in cash flow requirements for fuel acquisition, and
then, some time later, in nuclear fuel expenses. For example, for a nuclear
fleet the size of Entergy's, the current market value of annual
enriched

uranium
requirements has increased by several hundred million dollars compared to about
five years ago. As nuclear fuel installed in the core in nuclear power plants is
replaced fractionally over an approximate five-year period, nuclear fuel expense
is beginning to, and will eventually with a time lag, reflect current market
prices and can be expected to increase from the previously reported industry
levels of about 0.5 cents per kWh to closer to 1.0 cent per kWh. Entergy buys
uranium from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of
countries, and from time to time purchases from nearly all qualified reliable
major market participants worldwide that sell into the U.S.  Entergy's
nuclear fuel contract portfolio has provided a degree of price hedging against
the full extent of market prices through 2010, but market trends will eventually
affect the costs of all nuclear plant operators.  Entergy is dependent
on the continued performance by suppliers of their obligations under their
long-term agreements and Entergy’s ability to manage these risks by purchasing
uranium from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of
countries.  Entergy’s financial results could be materially adversely
affected if Entergy is unable to successfully manage these risks and any one
major supplier fails to fulfill its contractual obligations and Entergy is
unable to find other suppliers that can perform under terms that allow Entergy
to achieve the same level of profitability. As a result of the failure of a
major supplier to meet its contractual obligations or Entergy’s ability to
manage such a risk, Entergy may face higher costs to secure other suppliers,
which may have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial
condition and liquidity of the Utility operating companies, System Energy and
the Non-Utility Nuclear subsidiaries.

Certain
of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy's Non-Utility
Nuclear subsidiaries face the risk that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission will
change or modify its regulations or suspend or revoke their licenses, which
could materially adversely affect Entergy's and their results of operations,
financial condition and liquidity.

Under the Atomic Energy Act and Energy
Reorganization Act, the NRC regulates the operation of nuclear power plants. The
NRC may modify, suspend or revoke licenses, shut down a nuclear facility and
impose civil penalties for failure to comply with the Atomic Energy Act, related
regulations or the terms of the licenses for nuclear facilities. A change in the
Atomic Energy Act or the applicable regulations or licenses may require a
substantial increase in capital expenditures or may result in increased
operating or decommissioning costs and could materially adversely affect the
results of operations, liquidity or financial condition of Entergy (through its
ownership of the Non-Utility Nuclear subsidiaries), its Utility operating
companies, System Energy or the Non-Utility Nuclear
subsidiaries.  Events at nuclear plants owned by others, as well as
those owned by one of these companies, may cause the NRC to initiate such
actions.  As a result, if an incident were to occur at any nuclear
generating unit –whether an Entergy nuclear generating unit or not - it could
materially adversely affect the financial condition, results of operations and
liquidity of Entergy, certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy
or the Non-Utility Nuclear subsidiaries.

A
failure to obtain renewed licenses for the continued operation of Entergy’s
nuclear power plants could have a material adverse effect on Entergy's
operations and could lead to an increase in depreciation rates or an
acceleration of the timing for the funding of decommissioning
obligations.

The
license renewal and related processes for Entergy's nuclear power plants has
been and may continue to be the subject of significant public debate and
regulatory and legislative review and scrutiny at the federal and, in certain
cases, state level.   The operating licenses for Vermont Yankee,
Pilgrim, Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 expire between 2012 and 2015. Various
parties have expressed opposition to the pending license renewal
applications.  There is an ongoing proceeding before the Atomic Safety
and Licensing Board of the NRC and contentions have been admitted for litigation
regarding the Indian Point license renewals. The Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board has completed its proceedings regarding


Part I
Item 1A & 1B

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

Vermont
Yankee, but the New England Coalition filed a petition for NRC review of the
Atomic Safety Licensing Board’s decision on July 23, 2009. Finally, with respect
to the Pilgrim license renewal, the NRC has issued decisions resolving most of
the issues that were previously on appeal, but the NRC has asked for further
briefing regarding one final issue, which could later be referred back for
further proceedings before the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board. In addition, a
group of environmental and civic organizations has filed a petition with the NRC
seeking a suspension of the currently pending license renewal proceedings for
Indian Point, Pilgrim and Vermont Yankee.

In
relation to Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3, the New York Department of
Environmental Conservation has taken the position that Indian Point must obtain
a new state-issued Clean Water Act Section 401 water quality certification as
part of the license renewal process. Indian Point also must obtain a Coastal
Zone Management Act consistency determination from the New York Department of
State prior to getting its renewed license.

In
addition to the NRC license renewal process with respect to Vermont Yankee,
under Vermont law the Vermont Public Service Board will need to amend the
certificate of public good held by Entergy Vermont Yankee, LLC and Entergy
Nuclear Operations, Inc., which also requires Vermont legislative approval, and
the Vermont Public Service Board and the Vermont legislature must approve and
the Vermont Public Service Board must issue a certificate of public good for the
continued operation of Vermont Yankee and storing of spent fuel generated in
Vermont after March 21, 2012. An application has been filed with the Vermont
Public Service Board (as required by Vermont law) for approval of continued
operation and storage of spent nuclear fuel generated after that date. During
its 2009 session, which concluded in May, several committees of the Vermont
General Assembly held hearings on Vermont Yankee, but no bill or resolution was
introduced for approval of continued operation and storage of spent nuclear fuel
generated after March 21, 2012.  In January 2010, the Governor of the
State of Vermont issued a statement indicating he would not ask the Vermont
General Assembly to consider the Vermont Yankee license renewal during its 2010
session, based on the discovery of tritium leakage from Vermont Yankee, concerns
about miscommunication by Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee and Entergy Nuclear
Operations related to underground piping at Vermont Yankee carrying
radionuclides, and other issues including
decommissioning.  Notwithstanding the Governor's position, on February
24, 2010, a bill to approve the continued operation of Vermont Yankee was
advanced to a vote by the Vermont Senate leadership and defeated by a margin of
26 to 4.  This vote does not preclude the Vermont Senate from voting
again on a similar bill in the future.

If the
NRC does not renew the operating licenses for one or more of Entergy's nuclear
power plants, or the states in which Entergy’s nuclear power plants are located
do not otherwise take the necessary actions for the continued operation of these
plants, to the extent applicable, Entergy’s results of operations could be
materially adversely affected by loss of revenue associated with the plant or
plants, potential impairments of the carrying value of the plants, increased
depreciation rates, and an accelerated need for decommissioning funds, which
could require additional funding. In addition, Entergy may incur increased
operating costs depending on any conditions that may be imposed in connection
with license renewal.

Certain of the
Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear
subsidiaries  are exposed to risks and costs related to operating and
maintaining their  aging nuclear power plants, and their failure to
maintain operational efficiency at their nuclear power plants could materially
adversely affect Entergy's and  their results of operations, financial
condition and liquidity.

The nuclear generating units owned by
certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy,

and
Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear business began commercial operations in the
1970s-1980s.  Older equipment may require significant capital
expenditures to keep each of these nuclear power plants operating efficiently.
This equipment is also likely to require periodic upgrading and
improvement.  Any unexpected failure, including failure associated
with breakdowns, forced outages or any unanticipated capital expenditures, could
result in reduced profitability.  Operations at any of the nuclear
generating units owned and operated by Entergy's subsidiaries could degrade to
the point where the affected unit needs to be shut down or operated at less than
full capacity. If this were to happen, identifying and correcting the causes may
require significant time and expense. A decision may be made to close a unit
rather than incur the expense of restarting it or returning the unit to full
capacity. For the Non-Utility Nuclear subsidiaries, this could result in lost
revenue and increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply
commitments and penalties for failure to perform under their contracts with
customers.  Moreover, Entergy is becoming more dependent on fewer
suppliers for key parts of Entergy's nuclear power plants that may need to be
replaced or refurbished.  This dependence on a reduced number of
suppliers could result in delays in obtaining qualified replacement parts and,
therefore, greater expense for Entergy.

The costs
associated with the storage of the spent nuclear fuel of certain of the Utility
operating companies, System Energy and the Non-Utility Nuclear subsidiaries, as
well as the costs of and their ability to fully decommission their nuclear power
plants, could be significantly affected by the timing of the opening of a spent
nuclear fuel storage facility, as well as interim storage and transportation
requirements.

Certain of the Utility operating
companies, System Energy and the Non-Utility Nuclear subsidiaries incur costs on
an annual basis for the on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel.  The
approval of a national repository for the storage of spent nuclear fuel, such as
the one proposed for Yucca Mountain, Nevada, and the timing of such facility
opening, will significantly affect the costs associated with storage of spent
nuclear fuel.  For example, while the DOE is required by law to
proceed with the licensing of Yucca Mountain and, after the license is granted
by the NRC, to construct the repository and commence the receipt of spent fuel,
the Obama administration has cut the budget for the Yucca Mountain project, and
has made various statements that Yucca Mountain will not be the solution for
spent fuel storage. These actions are likely to prolong the time before spent
fuel is removed from Entergy’s plant sites. Because the DOE has not accomplished
its objectives, it is in non-compliance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of
1982 and has breached its spent fuel disposal contracts. Furthermore, Entergy is
uncertain as to when the DOE plans to commence acceptance of spent fuel from its
facilities for storage or disposal. As a result, continuing future expenditures
will be required to increase spent fuel storage capacity at its nuclear sites.
The costs of on-site storage are also affected by regulatory requirements for
such storage and will be subject to the costs of transportation to a permanent
storage facility. In addition, the availability of a repository for spent
nuclear fuel may affect the ability to fully decommission the nuclear units and
the costs relating to decommissioning.

Certain of the
Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear
subsidiaries  may be required to pay substantial retrospective
premiums imposed under the Price-Anderson Act in the event of a nuclear
incident, and losses not covered by insurance could have a material adverse
effect on Entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition or
liquidity.

Accidents and other unforeseen problems
at nuclear power plants have occurred both in the United States and elsewhere.
The consequences of an accident can be severe and include personal injury, loss
of life and property damage.  The Price-Anderson Act limits each
reactor owner's public liability (off-site) for a single nuclear incident to the
payment of retrospective premiums into a secondary insurance pool of up to
approximately $117.5 million per reactor.  With 104 reactors currently
participating, this translates to a total public liability cap of approximately
$12.2 billion per incident.  The limit is subject to change to account
for the effects of inflation, a change in the primary limit of insurance
coverage, and changes in the number of licensed reactors.  As required
by the Price-Anderson Act, the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and
Non-Utility Nuclear subsidiaries carry the maximum available amount of primary
nuclear liability insurance with American Nuclear Insurers (currently $375
million for each operating site).  Claims for any nuclear incident
exceeding that amount are covered under the retrospective premiums paid into the
secondary insurance pool.  As a result, in the event of a nuclear
incident that causes damages (off-site) in excess of the $375 million in primary
insurance coverage, each owner of a nuclear plant reactor, including Entergy's
Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Non-Utility Nuclear plant
owners, regardless of fault or proximity to the incident, will be required to
pay a retrospective premium, equal to its proportionate share of the loss in
excess of the $375 million primary level, up to a maximum of $117.5 million per
reactor per incident (Entergy's maximum total contingent obligation per incident
is $1.3 billion).  The retrospective premium payment is currently
limited to $17.5 million per year per reactor until the aggregate public
liability for each licensee is paid up to the $117.5 million cap. Nuclear
accident damage to on-site facilities is covered by Nuclear Electric Insurance
Limited up to the limits of the primary and excess property policies in force at
the time of the accident.  As an owner of nuclear power plants,
Entergy participates in these mandatory industry self-insurance programs and
could be liable to fund claims should a plant owned by a different company
experience a major event.  Any resulting liability from a nuclear
accident may exceed any of the Utility operating companies', System Energy's, or
the Non-Utility Nuclear subsidiaries' primary insurance coverage, and require
contribution of additional funds through the industry-wide program that could
significantly affect the results of operations, financial condition or liquidity
of Entergy, certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy or the
Non-Utility Nuclear subsidiaries.

Market
performance and other changes may decrease the value of assets in the
decommissioning trusts, which then could require significant additional
funding.

Owners of nuclear generating plants
have an obligation to decommission those plants. Certain of the Utility
operating companies, System Energy and the Non-Utility Nuclear subsidiaries
maintain decommissioning trust funds for this purpose.  Certain of the
Utility operating companies collect funds from their customers, which are
deposited into the trusts covering the units operated for or on behalf of those
companies. Those rate collections are based upon operating license lives as well
as estimated trust fund earnings and decommissioning costs. In connection with
the acquisition of certain nuclear plants, the Entergy Non-Utility Nuclear
subsidiaries also acquired decommissioning trust funds that are funded in
accordance with NRC regulations.  Assets in these trust funds are
subject to market fluctuations, will yield uncertain returns that may fall below
projected return rates, and may result in losses resulting from the recognition
of impairments of the value of certain securities held in these trust
funds.  As part of the Pilgrim, Indian Point 1 and 2, Vermont Yankee,
and Palisades/Big Rock Point purchases, the former owners transferred
decommissioning trust funds, along with the liability to decommission the
plants, to Entergy. As part of the Indian Point 1 and 2 purchase, Entergy also
funded an additional $25 million to a supplemental ecommissioning trust
fund.  As part of the Palisades transaction, Non-Utility Nuclear
assumed responsibility for spent fuel at the decommissioned Big Rock Point
nuclear plant, which is located near Charlevoix, Michigan. Once the spent fuel
is removed from the site, Non-Utility Nuclear will dismantle the spent fuel
storage facility and complete site decommissioning.  Non-Utility
Nuclear expects to fund this activity from operating revenue, and Entergy is
providing $5 million in credit support to provide financial assurance for this
obligation to the NRC.

In 2008,
Entergy experienced declines in the market value of assets held in the trust
funds for meeting its decommissioning funding assurance obligations for its
plants.  This decline adversely affected Entergy’s ability to
demonstrate compliance with the NRC’s requirements for providing financial
assurance for decommissioning funding for some of its plants.  In June
2009, the NRC issued letters indicating that the NRC staff had concluded that
there were shortfalls in the amount of decommissioning funding assurance
provided for Indian Point 2, Vermont Yankee, Palisades, Waterford 3, and River
Bend. The NRC staff subsequently conducted a telephone conference with Entergy
on this issue and, in August 2009, Entergy submitted a plan for addressing the
identified shortfalls.  In its submittal, Entergy provided updated
analyses to the NRC indicating that there was no current shortfall in the
amounts of the required decommissioning funding assurance for Palisades and
Indian Point 2, based upon the trust fund balances as of July 31, 2009 and an
analysis of the costs that would be incurred if Entergy elected to use a
sixty-year period of safe storage for decommissioning, as permitted by the NRC's
rules.  In December 2009 the NRC accepted the analyses regarding
Palisades and Indian Point and, with respect to each plant, the NRC concluded
that no further action was required.  For Vermont Yankee, Entergy
concluded that, when using the July 31, 2009 trust fund balance, and based on an
analysis of the costs that would be incurred if Entergy elected to use a sixty
year period of safe storage for decommissioning as permitted by the NRC’s rules,
there was a shortfall of approximately $58 million, which could be satisfied
with a cash contribution to a decommissioning trust of approximately $51
million, or by using another financial assurance mechanism in the amount of
approximately $58 million.  In September 2009, the NRC requested
further information regarding plans to address the shortfall in decommissioning
funding assurance for Vermont Yankee, which Entergy provided in October
2009.  Based on the trust fund balance as of September 30, 2009, the
shortfall had decreased from $58 million to $40 million.  This $40
million shortfall was satisfied with a $40 million guarantee from Entergy
Corporation that was effective as of December 31, 2009.  For Waterford
3 and River Bend, Entergy made the appropriate filings by December 31, 2009 with
its retail regulators that request decommissioning funding from ratepayers to
address the shortfalls identified by the NRC.

An early plant shutdown, poor
investment results (depending on the performance of and volatility in the
capital markets) or higher than anticipated decommissioning costs could cause
trust fund assets to be insufficient to meet the decommissioning obligations,
with the result that the Non-Utility Nuclear subsidiaries may be required to
provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements
for decommissioning.  For further information regarding nuclear
decommissioning costs, see the "

Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

New
or existing safety concerns regarding operating nuclear power plants and nuclear
fuel could lead to restrictions upon the operation of Entergy’s nuclear power
plants.

New and
existing concerns are being expressed in public forums about the safety of
nuclear generating units and nuclear fuel, in particular in the northeastern
United States, which is where five of the six units in the current fleet of
Non-Utility Nuclear generating units are located.  These concerns have
led to, and are expected to continue to lead to, various proposals to Federal
regulators and governing bodies in some localities where Entergy's subsidiaries
own nuclear generating units for legislative and regulatory changes that could
lead to the shut-down of nuclear units, denial of license renewal applications,
municipalization of nuclear units, restrictions on nuclear units as a result of
unavailability of sites for spent nuclear fuel storage and disposal, or other
adverse effects on owning and operating nuclear generating
units.  Entergy vigorously responds to these concerns and
proposals.  If any of the existing proposals, or any proposals that
may arise in the future with respect to legislative and regulatory changes,
become effective, they could have a material adverse effect on Entergy's results
of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

(Entergy
Corporation)

The
decommissioning trust fund assets for the nuclear power plants owned by
Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear subsidiaries may not be adequate to meet
decommissioning obligations if one or more of their nuclear power plants is
retired earlier than the anticipated shutdown date or if current regulatory
requirements change which then could require additional
funding.

Under
Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations, Entergy is permitted to project the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission-required decommissioning amount based on a Nuclear
Regulatory Commission formula and the amount in each of its Non-Utility Nuclear
nuclear power plant's decommissioning trusts. The projections are made based on
the scheduled shutdown date and the mid-point of the subsequent decommissioning
process for each of  these nuclear power plants, with the earliest
scheduled shutdown being Vermont Yankee in 2012. As a result, if the projected
amount of our decommissioning trusts exceeds the projected Nuclear Regulatory
Commission-required decommissioning amount, then its decommissioning obligations
are considered to be funded in accordance with Nuclear Regulatory Commission
regulations. In the event the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's formula does not
sufficiently reflect the actual costs Entergy would be required to incur to
decommission these nuclear power plants, additional resources would be required.
Furthermore, depending upon the level of funding available in the trust funds,
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission may not permit the trust funds to be used to
pay for related costs such as the management of spent nuclear fuel that are not
included in the formula. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission may also require that
separate financial assurances be provided as part of a plan for the funding of
spent fuel management costs. In addition to Nuclear Regulatory Commission
requirements, certain of the states in which Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear
nuclear power plants are located have imposed other decommissioning related
obligations, which Entergy believes it will be able to satisfy.

With
respect to the decommissioning trusts for Vermont Yankee, Indian Point 2 and
Palisades, the total amount in each of those trusts as of December 31, 2009
would not have been sufficient to initiate and complete the immediate near-term
decommissioning of the respective unit as of such date, but rather the funds
would have been sufficient to place the unit in a condition of safe storage
status pending future completion of decommissioning. For example, if Entergy had
decided to shutdown and immediately begin decommissioning one of those nuclear
power plants on December 31, 2009, its trust funds for the plant would have
been insufficient and Entergy would have been required to rely on other capital
resources to fund the entire decommissioning obligations unless the completion
of decommissioning could be deferred during some number of years of safe storage
status. Thus, if Entergy decides to shutdown one of these nuclear power plants
earlier than the scheduled shutdown date, Entergy may be unable to rely upon
only the decommissioning trust to fund the entire decommissioning obligations,
which would require it to obtain funding from other sources.

Further,
federal or state regulatory changes, including mandated increases in
decommissioning funding, may also increase the funding requirements of, or
accelerate the timing for funding of, the obligations related to the
decommissioning of its Non-Utility Nuclear nuclear power plants. As a result,
under any of these circumstances, Entergy's results of operations, liquidity and
financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

Item 1A & 1B

Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

The
nuclear power plants owned by Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear business will be
exposed to price risk to the extent they must compete for the advance sale of
energy and capacity or accept spot prices in the day-ahead markets.

Entergy
and its subsidiaries are not guaranteed any rate of return on their capital
investments in non-utility regulated businesses. In particular, the sale of
capacity and energy from the nuclear power plants owned by Entergy's Non-Utility
Nuclear business, unless otherwise contracted, is subject to the fluctuation of
market power prices.  As of December 31, 2009, the nuclear power
generation plants owned by Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear business had sold
forward 88%, 74%, 32%, 18% and 17% of its generation portfolio's planned energy
output for 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively.  Many of
Entergy’s Non-Utility Nuclear business’s existing long-term contracts expire by
the end of 2012.  The obligations under most of these agreements are
contingent on a generating asset that is operating; if the generation asset is
not operating, the seller generally is not liable for damages.  For
some unit-contingent obligations, however, there is also a guarantee of
availability that provides for the payment to the power purchaser of contract
damages, if incurred, in the event the unit owner fails to deliver power as a
result of the failure of the specified generation unit to generate power at or
above a specified availability threshold. In addition, for those obligations
that are not unit-contingent, the unit owner will be required to pay the
purchaser the difference between the market price at the delivery point and the
contract price, and the amount of such payments could be
substantial.

Market
prices may fluctuate substantially sometimes over relatively short periods of
time and at other times experience sustained increases or
decreases.  Demand for electricity and its fuel stock can fluctuate
dramatically, creating periods of substantial under- or
over-supply.  During periods of over-supply, prices might be
depressed. Also, from time to time there may be political pressure, or pressure
from regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over wholesale and retail energy
commodity and transportation rates, to impose price limitations, credit
requirements, bidding rules and other mechanisms to address volatility and other
issues in these markets.

The price
that different counterparties offer for forward sales is influenced both by
market conditions as well as the contract terms such as damage provisions,
credit support requirements and the number of available counterparties
interested in contracting for the desired forward period.  Depending
on differences between market factors at the time of contracting versus current
conditions, Non-Utility Nuclear's contract portfolio may have average contract
prices above or or below current market prices, including at the expiration of
the contracts, which could significantly affect Non-Utility Nuclear's results of
operations, financial condition and liquidity.

Among the
factors that could affect market prices for electricity and fuel, all of which
are beyond Entergy's control to a significant degree, are:

·

prevailing
      market prices for natural gas, uranium (and its conversion, enrichment and
      fabrication), coal, oil, and other fuels used in electric generation
      plants, including associated transportation costs, and supplies of such
      commodities;

·

seasonality;

·

availability
      of competitively priced alternative energy sources and the requirements of
      a renewable portfolio standard;

·

changes
      in production and storage levels of natural gas, lignite, coal and crude
      oil and refined products;

·

liquidity
      in the general wholesale electricity market, including the number of
      creditworthy counterparties available and interested in entering into
      forward sales agreements for Entergy’s full hedging
  term;

·

the
      actions of external parties, such as the FERC and local independent system
      operators and other state or Federal energy regulatory bodies, that may
      impose price limitations and other mechanisms to address some of the
      volatility in the energy markets;

·

transmission
      or fuel transportation constraints, inoperability or
      inefficiencies;

·

the
      general demand for electricity, which may be significantly affected by
      regional economic conditions;

·

weather
      conditions affecting demand for electricity or availability of
      hydroelectric power or fuel
supplies;

·

the
      rate of growth in demand for electricity as a result of population
      changes, regional economic conditions and the implementation of
      conservation programs;

·

regulatory
      policies of state agencies that affect the willingness of Entergy's
      Non-Utility Nuclear customers to enter into long-term contracts generally,
      and contracts for energy in
particular;

·

increases
      in supplies due to actions of current Entergy Non-Utility Nuclear
      competitors or new market entrants, including the development of new
      generation facilities, expansion of existing generation facilities, the
      disaggregation of vertically integrated utilities and improvements in
      transmission that allow additional supply to reach Entergy's Non-Utility
      Nuclear markets;

·

union
      and labor relations;

·

changes
      in Federal and state energy and environmental laws and regulations and
      other initiatives, including but not limited to, the price impacts of
      proposed emission controls such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative
      (RGGI); and

Entergy's
Non-Utility Nuclear business is subject to substantial governmental regulation
and may be adversely affected by legislative, regulatory or market design
changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with,
existing or future regulations or requirements.

Entergy's
Non-Utility Nuclear business is subject to extensive federal, state and local
laws and regulation. Compliance with the requirements under these various
regulatory regimes may cause the Non-Utility Nuclear business to incur
significant additional costs, and failure to comply with such requirements could
result in the shutdown of the non-complying facility, the imposition of liens,
fines and/or civil or criminal liability.

Public
utilities under the Federal Power Act are required to obtain FERC acceptance of
their rate schedules for wholesale sales of electricity. Each of the Non-Utility
Nuclear business's nuclear power plants, as well as Entergy Nuclear Power
Marketing, LLC, is a "public utility" under the Federal Power Act by virtue of
making wholesale sales of electric energy.  The FERC has granted these
generating and power marketing companies the authority to sell electricity at
market-based rates.  The FERC’s orders that grant the Non-Utility
Nuclear business's generating and power marketing companies market-based rate
authority reserve the right to revoke or revise that authority if the FERC
subsequently determines that the Non-Utility Nuclear business can exercise
market power in transmission or generation, create barriers to entry, or engage
in abusive affiliate transactions. In addition, the Non-Utility Nuclear
business's market-based sales are subject to certain market behavior rules, and
if any of its generating and power marketing companies were deemed to have
violated one of those rules, they would be subject to potential disgorgement of
profits associated with the violation and/or suspension or revocation of their
market-based rate authority and potential penalties of up to $1 million per day
per violation.  If the Non-Utility Nuclear business's generating or
power marketing companies were to lose their market-based rate authority, such
companies would be required to obtain the FERC’s acceptance of a cost-of-service
rate schedule and could become subject to the accounting, record-keeping and
reporting requirements that are imposed on utilities with cost-based rate
schedules.  This could have an adverse effect on the rates the
Non-Utility Nuclear business charges for power from its facilities.

The
Non-Utility Nuclear business is also affected by legislative and regulatory
changes, as well as changes to market design, market rules, tariffs, cost
allocations and bidding rules imposed by the existing Independent System
Operators.  The Independent System Operators that oversee most of the
wholesale power markets impose, and in the future may continue to impose,
mitigation, including price limitations, offer caps and other mechanisms, to
address some of the volatility and the potential exercise of market power in
these markets.  These types of price limitations and other regulatory
mechanisms may have an adverse effect on the profitability of the Non-Utility
Nuclear business's generation facilities that sell energy and capacity into the
wholesale power markets.

The
regulatory environment applicable to the electric power industry has undergone
substantial changes over the past several years as a result of restructuring
initiatives at both the state and federal levels.  These changes are
ongoing and Entergy cannot predict the future design of the wholesale power
markets or the ultimate effect that the changing regulatory environment will
have on the Non-Utility Nuclear business.  In addition, in some of
these markets, interested parties have proposed material market design changes,
including the elimination of a single clearing price mechanism and claims that
the competitive marketplace is not working because energy prices in wholesale
markets exceed the marginal cost of operating nuclear power plants, as well as
proposals to re-regulate the markets, impose a generation tax or require
divestitures by generating companies to reduce their market share.


Part I
Item 1A & 1B

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

Other
proposals to re-regulate may be made and legislative or other attention to the
electric power market restructuring process may delay or reverse the
deregulation process, which could require material changes to business planning
models.  If competitive restructuring of the electric power markets is
reversed, modified, discontinued or delayed, the Non-Utility Nuclear business's
results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially
adversely affected.

General Business
Risks

(Entergy
Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana,
Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas)

Entergy
and the Utility operating companies depend on access to the capital markets and,
at times, may face potential liquidity constraints, which could make it more
difficult to handle future contingencies such as natural disasters or
substantial increases in gas and fuel prices.  Disruptions in the
capital and credit markets may adversely affect Entergy and its subsidiaries'
ability to meet liquidity needs, access capital and operate and grow their
businesses, and the cost of capital.

Entergy's
business is capital intensive and dependent upon its ability to access capital
at reasonable rates and other terms.  At times there are also spikes
in the price for natural gas and other commodities that increase the liquidity
requirements of the Utility operating companies.  In addition,
Entergy's and the Utility operating companies' liquidity needs could
significantly increase in the event of a hurricane or other weather-related or
unforeseen disaster similar to that experienced in Entergy's service territory
with Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita in 2005 and Hurricane Gustav and
Hurricane Ike in 2008.  The occurrence of one or more contingencies,
including a delay in regulatory recovery of fuel or purchased power costs or
storm restoration costs, higher than expected pension contributions, an
acceleration of payments or decreased credit lines, less cash flow from
operations than expected or other unknown events, such as future storms, could
cause the financing needs of Entergy and its subsidiaries to
increase.  In addition, accessing the capital markets more frequently
in these situations may result in an increase in leverage.  Material
leverage increases could negatively affect the credit ratings of Entergy and the
Utility operating companies, which in turn could negatively affect access to the
capital markets.

The
global capital and credit markets experienced extreme volatility and disruption
in the fourth quarter of 2008 and much of 2009.  The inability to
raise capital on favorable terms, particularly during times of uncertainty in
the capital markets, could negatively affect Entergy and its subsidiaries'
ability to maintain and to expand their businesses.  Events beyond
Entergy's control, such as the volatility and disruption in global capital and
credit markets in 2008 and 2009, may create uncertainty that could increase its
cost of capital or impair its ability to access the capital markets, including
the ability to draw on its bank credit facilities.  Entergy and its
subsidiaries are unable to predict the degree of success they will have in
renewing or replacing their credit facilities as they come up for
renewal.  Moreover, the size, terms, and covenants of any new credit
facilities may not be comparable to, and may be more restrictive than, existing
facilities.  If Entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to access the
credit and capital markets on terms that are reasonable, they may have to delay
raising capital, issue shorter-term securities and/or bear an unfavorable cost
of capital, which, in turn, could impact their ability to grow their businesses,
decrease earnings, significantly reduce financial flexibility and/or limit
Entergy's ability to sustain its current common stock dividend
level.

Part I
Item 1A & 1B

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

There are
a number of factors that rating agencies evaluate to arrive at credit ratings
for Entergy Corporation and the Registrant Subsidiaries, including the ability
to cover liquidity requirements, the availability of committed external credit
support, and Entergy Corporation's share repurchase program, dividend policy and
other commitments for capital.  If one or more rating agencies
downgrade Entergy Corporation's, any of the Utility operating companies', or
System Entergy's ratings, particularly below investment grade, borrowing costs
would increase, the potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely
decrease, and cash or letter of credit quality collateral demands may be
triggered by the terms of a number of commodity contracts, leases and other
agreements.

Most of
Entergy Corporation's and its subsidiaries' large customers, suppliers and
counterparties require sufficient creditworthiness to enter into
transactions.  If Entergy Corporation's or its subsidiaries' ratings
decline, particularly below investment grade, or if certain counterparties
believe Entergy Corporation or the Utility operating companies are losing
creditworthiness and demand adequate assurance under fuel, gas and purchased
power contracts, the counterparties may require posting of collateral in cash or
letters of credit, prepayment for fuel, gas or purchased power or accelerated
payment, or counterparties may decline business with Entergy Corporation or its
subsidiaries. At December 31, 2009, based on power prices at that time, Entergy
had $369 million of collateral in place to support Entergy Nuclear Power
Marketing transactional activity, consisting primarily of Entergy Corporation
guarantees, but also including $20 million of guarantees that support letters of
credit and $2 million of cash collateral. As of December 31, 2009, the credit
exposure associated with Non-Utility Nuclear assurance requirements could
increase by an estimated amount of up to $308 million for each $1 per MMBtu
increase in gas prices in both the short- and long-term markets, but because
market prices have fallen below most contract prices, the credit exposure would
increase by only $8 million.  In the event of a decrease in Entergy
Corporation's credit rating to below investment grade, based on power prices as
of December 31, 2009, Entergy would have been required to provide approximately
$73 million of additional cash or letters of credit under some of the
agreements.  The amount of Entergy Corporation guarantees Entergy
would be required to replace will fluctuate depending on changes in power
prices.

The
construction of, and capital improvements to, power generation facilities
involve substantial risks.  Should construction or capital improvement
efforts be unsuccessful, the financial conditions, results of operations or
liquidity of Entergy  and the Utility operating companies could be
materially adversely affected.

Entergy's
and the Utility operating companies' ability to complete construction of power
generation facilities in a timely manner and within budget is contingent upon
many variables and subject to substantial risks. These variables include,
but are not limited to, project management expertise and escalating costs for
materials, labor and environmental compliance. Delays in obtaining permits,
shortages in materials and qualified labor, suppliers and contractors not
performing as required under their contracts, changes in the scope and timing of
projects, the inability to raise capital on favorable terms, and other events
beyond the control of the Utility operating companies may occur that may
materially affect the schedule, cost and performance of these
projects.  If these projects are significantly delayed or become
subject to cost overruns or cancellation, Entergy and the Utility operating
companies could incur additional costs and termination payments, or face
increased risk of potential write-off of the investment in the
project.  For further information regarding capital expenditure plans
and other uses of capital in connection with the potential construction of
additional generation supply sources within the Utility operating companies'
service territory, see the "

Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy and each of the Registrant
Subsidiaries.

The
Utility operating companies, System Energy and Entergy's Non-Utility Nuclear
business may incur substantial costs to fulfill their obligations related to
reliability standards, environmental, and other matters.

The
businesses in which the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the
Non-Utility Nuclear business operate are subject to extensive environmental
regulation by local, state and Federal authorities.  These laws and
regulations affect the manner in which the Utility operating companies, System
Energy and the Non-Utility Nuclear business conduct their operations and make
capital expenditures.  These laws and regulations also affect how the
Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Non-Utility Nuclear business
manage air emissions, discharges to water, solid and hazardous waste storage and
disposal, cooling and service water intake, the protection of threatened and
endangered

species,
hazardous materials transportation, and similar matters.  Federal, state,
and local authorities continually revise these laws and regulations, and the
laws and regulations are subject to judicial interpretation and to the
permitting and enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies.
Developing and implementing plans for facility compliance with these
requirements can lead to capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance
expenditures.  Violations of these requirements can subject the Utility
operating companies, System Energy and the Non-Utility Nuclear business to
enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into
compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve
compliance, remediation and clean-up costs, civil penalties, and exposure to
third parties' claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations
of applicable permits or standards.  In addition, the Utility operating
companies, System Energy and the Non-Utility Nuclear business are subject to
liability under these laws for the costs of remediation of environmental
contamination of property now or formerly owned or operated by the Utility
operating companies, System Energy and the Non-Utility Nuclear business and of
property contaminated by hazardous substances they generate.  The Utility
operating companies are currently involved in proceedings relating to sites
where hazardous substances have been released and may be subject to additional
proceedings in the future.  The Utility operating companies, System Energy
and the Non-Utility Nuclear business have incurred and expect to incur
significant costs related to environmental compliance.

Emissions
of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury, particulates, and other regulated air
contaminants from fossil-fueled generating plants are potentially subject to
increased regulation, controls and mitigation expenses.  In addition,
existing air regulations and programs promulgated by the EPA often are
challenged legally, sometimes resulting in large-scale changes to anticipated
regulatory regimes.  Risks relating to global climate change and
initiatives to compel CO


emission
reductions are discussed below.

Entergy's
business is also subject to extensive and mandatory reliability
standards.  Such standards, which are established by the North
American Electric Reliability Corporation and the SERC Reliability Corporation,
are approved by the FERC and currently are being reviewed and
amended.  Significant capital expenditures for the Utility operating
companies' transmission system could be required to achieve on-going compliance
with the requirements under these regimes, and failure to comply with such
requirements could result in the imposition of fines or civil penalties, and
exposure to third party claims for alleged violations of applicable
standards.  The laws and regulations are subject to judicial
interpretation and to the enforcement discretion vested in the implementing
agencies.  The changes to the reliability requirements applicable to
the electric power industry are ongoing, and Entergy cannot predict the ultimate
effect that the changing reliability requirements will have on its
business.

Entergy
and its subsidiaries may not be able to obtain or maintain all required
environmental regulatory approvals.  If there is a delay in obtaining any
required environmental regulatory approvals, or if Entergy and its subsidiaries
fail to obtain, maintain or comply with any such approval, the operation of its
facilities could be stopped or become subject to additional costs. For further

The effects of weather and economic
conditions and the related impact on electricity and gas usage, may materially

Temperatures
above normal levels in the summer tend to increase summer cooling electricity
demand and revenues, and temperatures below moderate levels in the winter tend
to increase winter heating electricity and gas demand and
revenues.  As a corollary, moderate temperatures tend to decrease
usage of energy and resulting revenues. Seasonal pricing differentials, coupled
with higher consumption levels, typically cause the Utility operating companies
to report higher revenues in the third quarter of the fiscal year than in the
other quarters.  Extreme weather conditions or
storms,  however, may stress the Utility operating companies'
generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems, resulting in
increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing
needs), limits on their ability to meet peak customer demand, increased
regulatory oversight, and lower customer satisfaction.  These extreme
conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Utility operating
companies' financial condition, results of operations and
liquidity.


Part I
Item 1A & 1B

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

Industrial
sales volume was depressed in the latter part of 2008 and through most of 2009,
in part because the overall economy declined, with lower usage across the
industrial sector affecting both the large customer industrial segment as well
as small and mid-sized industrial customers.  Despite the apparently
improving economic conditions in the service territories of the Utility
operating companies in the fourth quarter of 2009, it  is possible that
continued or recurrent poor economic conditions, combined with increasing rates
in certain of the Utility operating companies' service territories, could result
in slower or declining sales growth and increased bad debt expense relative to
recent years, which could materially adversely affect Entergy's and the Utility
operating companies' results of operations, financial condition and
liquidity.

The effects of climate change and
environmental and regulatory obligations intended to compel CO


emission
reductions could materially adversely affect the financial condition, results of
operations and liquidity of Entergy and the Utility operating
companies.

In an
effort to address climate change concerns, Federal, state, and local authorities
are calling for additional laws and regulations aimed at known or suspected
causes of climate change.  For example, in response to the United
States Supreme Court's 2007 decision holding that the EPA has authority to
regulate emissions of CO


and other
"greenhouse gases" under the Clean Air Act, the EPA, various environmental
interest groups and other organizations are focusing considerable attention on
CO


emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate
change.  Developing and implementing plans for compliance with CO


emissions
reduction requirements can lead to additional capital, personnel, and operation
and maintenance expenditures. Violations of such requirements may subject
Entergy and the Utility operating companies to enforcement actions, capital
expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating
costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, remediation and clean-up
costs, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties' claims for alleged health
or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or
standards.  To the extent Entergy believes any of these costs are
recoverable in rates, however, additional material rate increases for customers
could be resisted by Entergy's regulators and, in extreme cases, Entergy's
regulators might deny or defer timely recovery of these costs.  Future
changes in environmental regulation governing the emission of CO


and other
"greenhouse gases" could make some of Entergy's electric generating units
uneconomical to maintain or operate, and could increase the difficulty that
Entergy and its subsidiaries have with obtaining or maintaining required
environmental regulatory approvals, which could also materially adversely affect
the financial condition, results of operations and liquidity of Entergy and the
Utility operating companies.  In addition, several lawsuits currently
are pending against emitters of greenhouse gases alleging that these companies
are liable for personal injuries and property damage caused by climate
change.  These lawsuits seek injunctive relief, monetary compensation
and punitive damages.

In addition to the regulatory and
financial risks associated with climate change discussed above, physical risks
from climate change include an increase in sea level, wetland and barrier island
erosion, risks of flooding and changes in weather conditions, such as changes in
precipitation, average temperatures and potential increased impacts of extreme
weather conditions or storms.  Entergy owns assets in, and serves,
communities that are at risk from sea level rise, changes in weather conditions,
storms and loss of the protection offered by coastal wetlands.  A
significant portion of the nation’s oil and gas infrastructure is located in
these areas and susceptible to storm damage that could be aggravated by wetland
and barrier island erosion, which could give rise to fuel supply interruptions
and price spikes.

These and other physical changes could
result in changes in customer demand, increased costs associated with repairing
and maintaining generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems
resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased
financing needs), limits on the Entergy System's ability to meet peak customer
demand, increased regulatory oversight, and lower customer
satisfaction.  Also, to the extent that climate change adversely
impacts the economic health of a region or results in energy conservation or
demand side management programs, it may adversely impact customer demand and
revenues.  Such physical or operational risks could have a material
adverse effect on Entergy's and the Utility operating companies' financial
condition, results of operations and liquidity.

Entergy
and its subsidiaries may not be adequately hedged against changes in commodity
prices, which could materially adversely affect Entergy's and its subsidiaries'
results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.


Part I
Item 1A & 1B

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

To manage
their near-term financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations,
Entergy and its subsidiaries may enter into contracts to hedge portions of their
purchase and sale commitments, weather positions, fuel requirements and
inventories of natural gas, uranium (and its conversion), lignite, coal, refined
products, and other commodities, within established risk management
guidelines.  As part of this strategy, Entergy and its subsidiaries
may utilize fixed- and variable-price forward physical purchase and sales
contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the
over-the-counter markets or on exchanges.  However, Entergy and its
subsidiaries normally cover only a portion of the exposure of their assets and
positions to market price volatility, and the coverage will vary over
time.  In addition, Entergy also elects to leave certain volumes
during certain years unhedged.  To the extent Entergy and its
subsidiaries have unhedged positions, fluctuating commodity prices can
materially adversely affect Entergy's and its subsidiaries' results of
operations and financial position.

Although
Entergy and its subsidiaries devote a considerable effort to these risk
management strategies, they cannot eliminate all the risks associated with these
activities.  As a result of these and other factors, Entergy and its
subsidiaries cannot predict with precision the impact that risk management
decisions may have on their business, results of operations or financial
position.

Entergy
has guaranteed or indemnified the performance of a portion of the obligations
relating to hedging and risk management activities. Reductions in Entergy's or
its subsidiaries' credit quality or changes in the market prices of energy
commodities could increase the cash or Letter of Credit quality collateral
required to be posted in connection with hedging and risk management activities,
which could materially affect Entergy's or its subsidiaries' liquidity and
financial position.

The Utility operating companies and
Entergy

'

s Non-Utility
Nuclear business are exposed to the risk that counterparties may not meet their
obligations, which may materially adversely affect the Utility operating
companies' and Non-Utility Nuclear's business.

Entergy's
Utility operating companies' and its Non-Utility Nuclear subsidiaries' hedging
and risk management activities are exposed to the risk that counterparties that
owe Entergy and its subsidiaries money, energy, or other commodities will not
perform their obligations. Currently, some hedging agreements contain provisions
that require the counterparties to provide credit support to secure their
obligations to Entergy or its subsidiaries. If the counterparties to these
arrangements fail to perform, Entergy or its subsidiaries might be forced to act
on the credit support provided and acquire alternative hedging arrangements or
draw on the credit support provided by the counterparties, which credit support
may not always be adequate to cover the related obligations. In such event,
Entergy and its subsidiaries might incur losses in addition to amounts, if any,
already paid to the counterparties. In addition, the credit commitments of
Entergy's lenders under its bank facilities may not be honored for a variety of
reasons, including unexpected periods of financial distress affecting such
lenders, which could materially adversely affect the adequacy of its liquidity
sources.

New
legislation may subject the Utility operating companies and Entergy’s
Non-Utility Nuclear business to governmental regulation of energy derivatives
used in hedging and risk management transactions, which may  materially
adversely affect the Utility operating companies’ and Entergy’s 
Non-Utility Nuclear business.

New
legislation may subject the Utility operating companies and Entergy’s
Non-Utility Nuclear business to governmental regulation relating to certain
hedging transactions. For example, Congress is considering legislation to impose
restrictions on the use of over-the-counter derivatives, including energy
derivatives. The United States House of Representatives passed its version of
the legislation (H.R. 4173, Title III) on December 11, 2009. If such legislation
becomes law, Entergy’s subsidiaries could potentially face higher costs to hedge
their risks, fewer potential counterparties still active in the newly regulated
marketplace, and increased liquidity requirements. Under the proposed
legislation, hedging and other risk management transactions conducted by the
Utility operating companies and Entergy’s Non-Utility Nuclear business would be
regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. If such legislation were
to become law without the addition of appropriate exemptions for energy
transactions and energy markets, then Entergy believes that the forward hedging
strategies and other risk management activities of its subsidiaries could either
be curtailed or become significantly more expensive. A substantial number of
these hedge transactions currently used by Entergy’s subsidiaries rely upon
bilaterally negotiated contracts that are unsecured or utilize corporate
guarantees or fixed credit support


Part I
Item 1A & 1B

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

structures.
If Entergy’s subsidiaries were to be required to “clear” their transactions, or
to post margin based on the mark-to-market forward price of power (as margin is
calculated by Commodity Futures Trading Commission-regulated exchanges and
clearing entities), then these subsidiaries would need to arrange a substantial
amount of additional liquidity in order to maintain their current level of
hedging and risk management activities.

Market
performance and other changes may decrease the value of benefit plan assets,
which then could require significant additional funding.

The
performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in
trust under Entergy's pension and postretirement benefit plans. A decline in the
market value of the assets may increase the funding requirements relating to
Entergy's benefit plan liabilities. The recent significant volatility in the
capital markets has affected the market value of these assets, which may affect
Entergy's planned levels of contributions in the future. Additionally, changes
in interest rates affect the liabilities under Entergy's pension and
postretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities
increase, potentially requiring additional funding. The funding requirements of
the obligations related to the pension benefit plans can also increase as a
result of changes in retirement rates, life expectancy assumptions, or Federal
regulations.  Guidance pursuant to the Pension Protection Act of 2006
rules, effective for the 2008 plan year and beyond, continues to evolve, be
interpreted through technical corrections bills and discussed within the
industry and by congressional lawmakers.  Any changes to the Pension
Protection Act of 2006 as a result of these discussions and efforts may affect
the level of Entergy's pension contributions in the future. For further
information regarding Entergy's pension and other postretirement benefit plans,
reference is made to the "

" section of
Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy and each of its
Registrant Subsidiaries and Note 11 to the consolidated financial
statements.

The
litigation environment in the states in which certain Entergy subsidiaries
operate poses a significant risk to those businesses.

Entergy
and its subsidiaries are involved in the ordinary course of business in a number
of lawsuits involving employment, commercial, asbestos, hazardous material and
ratepayer matters, and injuries and damages issues, among other matters. States
in which the Utility operating companies operate, in particular Louisiana,
Mississippi and Texas, have proven to be unusually litigious
environments.  Judges and juries in these states have demonstrated a
willingness to grant large verdicts, including punitive damages, to plaintiffs
in personal injury, property damage, and business tort cases.  Entergy
and its subsidiaries use legal and appropriate means to contest litigation
threatened or filed against them, but the litigation environment in these states
poses a significant business risk.

Terrorist attacks, future war or risk
of war may adversely affect Entergy's results of operations.

As power generators, Entergy and its
subsidiaries face heightened risk of an act of terrorism, either as a direct act
against one of Entergy's generation facilities or an act against the
transmission and distribution infrastructure used to transport power which
affects its ability to operate.  If such an attack were to occur, Entergy's
business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially
adversely affected.  The risk of terrorist attacks also may cause
Entergy to incur increased capital and operating costs to implement increased
security for its nuclear power plants, such as additional physical facility
security and additional security personnel.

Changes in taxation as well as the
inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions
could negatively impact Entergy

'

s, the Utility operating companies'
and System Energy's results of operations, financial condition and
liquidity.

Entergy
and its subsidiaries make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of
various financial transactions and results of operations to estimate their
obligations to taxing authorities.  These tax obligations include
income, franchise, real estate, sales and use and employment-related
taxes.  These judgments include reserves for potential adverse
outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken.  Entergy and
its subsidiaries also estimate their ability to utilize tax benefits, including

Federal, state, or local tax laws, adverse tax audit results or adverse tax
rulings on positions taken by Entergy and its subsidiaries could negatively
affect Entergy's, the Utility operating companies' and System Energy's results

The effect of higher purchased gas
cost charges to customers may adversely affect Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's

'

results of operations and liquidity.

Gas rates
charged to customers are comprised primarily of purchased gas cost charges,
which provide no return or profit to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana or Entergy
New Orleans, and distribution charges, which provide a return or profit to the
utility.  Distribution charges are affected by the amount of gas sold
to customers. Purchased gas cost charges, which comprise most of a customer's
bill and may be adjusted quarterly, represent gas commodity costs that Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana or Entergy New Orleans recovers from its
customers.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's or Entergy New Orleans'
cash flows can be affected by differences between the time period when gas is
purchased and the time when ultimate recovery from customers
occurs.  When purchased gas cost charges increase substantially
reflecting higher gas procurement costs incurred by Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana or Entergy New Orleans, customer usage may decrease, especially in
weaker economic times, resulting in lower distribution charges for Entergy Gulf
States Louisiana or Entergy New Orleans.

(System
Energy)

System
Energy owns and operates a single nuclear generating facility, and it is
dependent on affiliated companies for all of its revenues.

System
Energy's operating revenues are derived from the allocation of the capacity,
energy, and related costs associated with its 90% ownership/leasehold interest
in Grand Gulf.  Charges under the Unit Power Sales Agreement are paid
by the Utility operating companies as consideration for their respective
entitlements to receive capacity and energy and are payable on a full
cost-of-service basis only so long as Grand Gulf remains in commercial
operation.  The useful economic life of Grand Gulf is finite and is
limited by the terms of its operating license, which is currently due to expire
on November 1, 2024.  System Energy's financial condition depends both
on the receipt of payments from the Utility operating companies under the Unit
Power Sales Agreement and on the continued commercial operation of Grand
Gulf.  For information regarding the Unit Power Sales Agreement and
certain other agreements relating to the Entergy System companies' support of
System Energy (including the Capital Funds Agreement), see the "Grand Gulf -
Related Agreements" section of Note 8 to the financial statements and the
"Utility - System Energy and Related Agreements" section of Part I Item
1.

(Entergy
Corporation)

Entergy Corporation

'

s holding company structure could
limit its ability to pay dividends.

Entergy
Corporation is a holding company with no material assets other than the stock of
its subsidiaries. Accordingly, all of its operations are conducted by its
subsidiaries.  Entergy Corporation's ability to pay dividends on its
common stock depends on the payment to it of dividends or distributions by its
subsidiaries. The payments of dividends or distributions to Entergy Corporation
by its subsidiaries in turn depend on their results of operations and cash flows
and other items affecting retained earnings.  Provisions in the
organizational documents, indentures for debt issuances and other agreements of
certain of Entergy Corporation's subsidiaries restrict the payment of cash
dividends to Entergy Corporation.  For further information regarding
dividend or distribution restrictions to Entergy Corporation, reference is made
to the "

Entergy
Corporation's proposed spin-off of its Non-Utility Nuclear business is subject
to risks inherent to a large-scale transaction subject to regulatory approvals
and the completion of complex financings.


Part I
Item 1A & 1B

Entergy
Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy

The proposed spin-off of Entergy
Corporation's Non-Utility Nuclear business is subject to multiple risks and
uncertainties, including the risk that the spin-off will not be consummated, the
risk that the financing transactions contemplated as part of the spin-off cannot
be consummated on terms and conditions acceptable to Entergy Corporation or the
risk that state and Federal regulatory jurisdictions may impose conditions to
the transaction not acceptable to Entergy Corporation.  If the
spin-off is consummated, it is possible that Entergy Corporation or Enexus
Energy Corporation, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy whose shares will be
distributed in the spin-off , may not achieve the full strategic and financial
benefits that they expect will result from the transaction or that such benefits
may be delayed or not occur due to unforeseen changes in market and economic
conditions or other events.  As a result, the aggregate market price
of the common stock of Entergy Corporation and Enexus Energy Corporation as
separate companies could be less than the market price of Entergy Corporation's
common stock if the spin-off had not occurred.

MANAGEMENT'S
FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Results of
Operations

Net
Income

2009 Compared to

Net income increased $19.7 million
primarily due to lower other operation and maintenance expenses and a lower
effective income tax rate, partially offset by lower net revenue, higher
depreciation and amortization expenses, higher nuclear refueling outage
expenses, and higher interest expense.

2008 Compared to

Net income decreased $92.0 million
primarily due to higher other operation and maintenance expenses, higher
depreciation and amortization expenses, and a higher effective income tax rate,
partially offset by higher net revenue.  The higher other operation
and maintenance expenses resulted primarily from the write-off of approximately
$70.8 million of costs as a result of the December 2008 Arkansas Court of
Appeals decision in Entergy Arkansas' 2006 base rate case.  The 2006
base rate case is discussed in more detail in Note 2 to the financial
statements.

Net
Revenue

2009 Compared to

Net revenue consists of operating
revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale,
2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges
(credits).  Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue
comparing 2009 to 2008.

The provision for regulatory
proceedings variance is primarily due to provisions recorded in
2009.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of
regulatory proceedings affecting Entergy Arkansas.

The volume/weather variance is
primarily due to the effect of less favorable weather and an 11.6% volume
decrease in industrial sales primarily in the mid to small customer
class.

The retail electric price variance is
primarily due to the recovery of 2008 extraordinary storm costs as approved by
the APSC, effective January 2009, which is discussed in Note 2 to the financial
statements.  Also contributing to the increase are increases in the
capacity acquisition rider related to the Ouachita acquisition.  The
net income effect of the Ouachita cost recovery is limited to a portion
representing an allowed return on equity with the remainder offset by Ouachita
plant costs in other operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation expenses,
and taxes other than income taxes.

Gross
operating revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses

Gross operating revenues decreased
primarily due to:

·

a
      decrease of $119.9 million in gross wholesale revenue due to a decrease in
      the average price of energy available for resale
  sales;

·

a
      decrease of $63.2 million in fuel cost recovery revenues due to a change
      in the energy cost recovery rider effective April 2009 and decreased
      usage; and

·

a
      decrease of $24.4 million related to volume/weather, as discussed
      above.

The
decrease was offset by an increase of $90.7 million in rider
revenues.

Fuel and purchased power expenses
decreased primarily due to a decrease in the average market price of purchased
power.

2008 Compared to

Net revenue consists of operating
revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale,
2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory
credits.  Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue
comparing 2008 to 2007.

The rider revenue variance is primarily
due to an Energy Efficiency rider which became effective in November
2007.  The establishment of the rider results in an increase in rider
revenue and a corresponding increase in other operation and maintenance expense
with no effect on net income.  Also contributing to the variance was
an increase in franchise tax rider revenue as a result of higher retail
revenues.  The corresponding increase is in taxes other than income
taxes, resulting in no effect on net income.

The purchased power capacity variance
is primarily due to lower reserve equalization expenses.

The volume/weather variance is
primarily due to the effect of less favorable weather on residential and
commercial sales during the billed and unbilled sales periods compared to 2007
and a 2.9% volume decrease in industrial sales, primarily in the wood industry
and the small customer class.  Billed electricity usage decreased 333
GWh in all sectors.  See "

Critical
Accounting Estimates

" below and Note 1 to the financial statements for
further discussion of the accounting for unbilled revenues.

Gross
operating revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses

Gross operating revenues increased
primarily due to:

·

an
      increase of $114 million in gross wholesale revenue due to an increase in
      the average price of energy available for resale sales and an increase in
      sales to affiliated customers;

·

an
      increase of $106.1 million in production cost allocation rider revenues
      which became effective in July 2007 as a result of the System Agreement
      proceedings.  As a result of the System Agreement proceedings,
      Entergy Arkansas also has a corresponding increase in deferred fuel
      expense for payments to other Entergy system companies such that there is
      no effect on net income.  Entergy Arkansas makes payments over a
      seven-month period but collections from customers occur over a
      twelve-month period.  The production cost allocation rider is
      discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements and the System Agreement
      proceedings are referenced below under "

Federal
      Regulation

Entergy
Arkansas, Inc.

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

·

an
      increase of $58.9 million in fuel cost recovery revenues due to changes in
      the energy cost recovery rider effective April 2008 and September 2008,
      partially offset by decreased usage.  The energy cost recovery
      rider filings are discussed in Note 2 to the financial
      statements.

The
increase was partially offset by a decrease of $14.6 million related to
volume/weather, as discussed above.

Fuel and purchased power expenses
increased primarily due to an increase of $106.1 million in deferred System
Agreement payments, as discussed above and an increase in the average market
price of purchased power.

Other
Income Statement Variances

2009 Compared to

Nuclear refueling outage expenses
increased primarily due to the amortization of higher expenses associated with
the planned maintenance and refueling outage at ANO 1 which ended in December
2008 and the planned maintenance and refueling outage at ANO 2 which ended in
September 2009.

Other
operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to:

·

the
      write off in the fourth quarter 2008 of $52 million of costs previously
      accumulated in Entergy Arkansas' storm reserve and $16 million of removal
      costs associated with the termination of a lease, both in connection with
      the December 2008 Arkansas Court of Appeals decision in Entergy Arkansas's


base rate
      case.  The


base rate case is discussed in more detail in Note 2 to the
      financial statements;

·

the
      capitalization in 2009 of $12.5 million of Ouachita service charges
      previously expensed in 2008;

·

prior
      year storm damage charges as a result of several storms hitting Entergy
      Arkansas' service territory in 2008, including Hurricane Gustav and
      Hurricane Ike in the third quarter 2008.  Entergy Arkansas
      discontinued regulatory storm reserve accounting beginning July 2007 as a
      result of the APSC order issued in Entergy Arkansas' rate
      case.  As a result, non-capital storm expenses of $41 million
      were charged to other operation and maintenance expenses.  In
      December 2008, $19.4 million of these storm expenses were deferred per an
      APSC order and were recovered through revenues in 2009;
  and

·

a
      decrease of $10.8 million in payroll-related and benefits
      costs.

The
decrease was partially offset by the following:

·

an
      increase of $17.9 million due to higher fossil costs primarily due to a
      full year of Ouachita costs in 2009 and higher fossil plant outage costs
      in 2009;

·

an
      increase of $14.4 million due to the reinstatement of storm reserve
      accounting effective January 2009;

·

an
      increase of $9.6 million in nuclear expenses primarily due to increased
      nuclear labor and contract costs;

·

an
      increase in legal expenses as a result of a reimbursement in April 2008 of
      $7 million of costs in connection with a litigation settlement;
      and

·

an
      increase of $4.0 million in customer service costs primarily as a result
      of write-offs of uncollectible customer
  accounts.

Depreciation
and amortization expenses increased primarily due to an increase in plant in
service.

Interest expense increased primarily
due to an increase in long-term debt outstanding as a result of the issuance of
$300 million of 5.40% Series first mortgage bonds in July 2008.

Taxes other than income taxes increased
primarily due to an increase in local franchise taxes as a result of higher
residential and commercial revenue and an increase in ad valorem taxes due to a
higher millage rate and a higher 2008 assessment.

Depreciation and amortization expenses
increased primarily due to an increase in plant in service.

postretirement plans in 2010; although the required pension contributions will
not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2010 valuations are
completed by April 1, 2010.  Also, guidance pursuant to the Pension

industry
and by congressional lawmakers.  Any changes to the Pension Protection
Act as a result of these discussions and efforts may affect the level of Entergy
Arkansas’ pension contributions in the future.

Also in addition to the contractual
obligations, Entergy Arkansas has $178.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits
and interest net of unused tax attributes for which the timing of payments
beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the
timing of effective settlement of tax positions.  See Note 3 to the
financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax
benefits.

The
planned capital investment estimate for Entergy Arkansas also reflects capital
required to support existing business and customer growth.  The above
amounts include approximately $420 million for installation of scrubbers and low
NOx burners at Entergy Arkansas' White Bluff coal plant, which is discussed
below.  Entergy Arkansas continues to review potential environmental
spending needs and financing alternatives for any such spending, and future
spending estimates could change based on the results of this continuing
analysis.

White Bluff Coal Plant
Project

In June 2005 the EPA issued final Best
Available Retrofit Control Technology (BART) regulations that could potentially
result in a requirement to install SO


pollution
control technology on certain of Entergy's coal and oil generation
units.  The rule leaves certain BART determinations to the
states.  The Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ)
prepared a State Implementation Plan (SIP) for Arkansas facilities to implement
its obligations under the Clean Air Visibility Rule.  The ADEQ
determined that Entergy Arkansas' White Bluff power plant affects a Class I Area
visibility and will be subject to the EPA's presumptive BART requirements to
install scrubbers and low NOx burners

.

Under current
regulations, the scrubbers would have to be operational by October
2013.  Entergy filed a petition in December 2009 with the Arkansas
Pollution Control and Ecology Commission requesting a variance from this
deadline, however, because the EPA has not approved Arkansas' Regional Haze SIP
and the EPA has recently expressed concerns about Arkansas' Regional Haze SIP
and questioned the appropriateness of issuing an air permit prior to that
approval.  Entergy Arkansas' petition requests that, consistent with
federal law, the compliance deadline be changed to as expeditiously as
practicable, but in no event later than five years after EPA approval of the
Arkansas Regional Haze SIP.  The Arkansas Pollution Control and
Ecology (PC&E) Commission adopted a procedural schedule that includes a
public hearing and a comment period ending in March 2010 with the expectation
that the variance could be considered at the Commission's March 26, 2010
meeting.  The timeline for EPA action on the Arkansas Regional Haze
SIP is uncertain at this time.

In March 2009, Entergy Arkansas made a
filing with the APSC seeking a declaratory order that the White Bluff project is
in the public interest.  In May 2009 the APSC Staff filed a motion
requesting that the APSC require Entergy Arkansas to file testimony on several
issues.  In December 2009, in response to the EPA concerns regarding
Arkansas' Regional Haze SIP, the APSC suspended the procedural schedule in the
proceeding.

Currently, the White Bluff project is
suspended, but the latest conceptual cost estimate indicated that Entergy
Arkansas' share of the project could cost approximately $465
million.  The plant would continue to operate during construction,
although an outage would be necessary to complete the tie in of the
scrubbers.  Entergy continues to review potential environmental
spending needs and financing alternatives for any such spending, and future
spending estimates could change based on the results of this continuing
analysis.

Ouachita Power
Plant

Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC in
September 2007 for its approval of the Ouachita plant acquisition, including
full cost recovery.  In June 2008 the APSC approved Entergy Arkansas'
acquisition of the Ouachita plant and approved recovery of the acquisition and
ownership costs through a rate rider.  The APSC also approved the
planned sale of one-third of the capacity and energy to Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana.  Entergy Arkansas purchased the Ouachita plant in September
2008.

Financial Discussion and Analysis

In August
2008, the LPSC issued an order approving an uncontested settlement between
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and the LPSC Staff authorizing Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana's purchase, under a life-of-unit agreement, of one-third of the
capacity and energy from the 789 MW Ouachita power plant.  The LPSC's
approval was subject to certain conditions, including a study to determine the
costs and benefits of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana exercising an option to
purchase one-third of the plant (Unit 3) from Entergy Arkansas.  In
April 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana made a filing with the LPSC seeking
approval of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana exercising its option to convert its
purchased power agreement into the ownership interest in Unit 3 and a one-third
interest in the Ouachita common facilities.  In September 2009 the
LPSC, pursuant to an uncontested settlement, approved the acquisition and a cost
recovery mechanism.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana purchased Unit 3
and a one-third interest in the Ouachita common facilities for $75 million in
November 2009.

Entergy's
Utility supply plan initiative will continue to seek to transform its generation
portfolio with new or repowered generation resources.  Opportunities
resulting from the supply plan initiative, including new projects or the
exploration of alternative financing sources, could result in increases or
decreases in the capital expenditure estimates given above.  The
estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification
and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, market
volatility, economic trends, environmental compliance, and the ability to access
capital.  Management provides more information on long-term debt and
preferred stock maturities in Notes 5 and 6 to the financial
statements.

As a wholly-owned subsidiary, Entergy
Arkansas pays dividends to Entergy Corporation from its earnings at a percentage
determined monthly.  Entergy Arkansas' long-term debt indentures
restrict the amount of retained earnings available for the payment of cash
dividends or other distributions on its common and preferred
stock.  As of December 31, 2009, Entergy Arkansas had restricted
retained earnings unavailable for distribution to Entergy Corporation of $461.6
million.

Sources
of Capital

Entergy Arkansas' sources to meet its
capital requirements include:

·

internally
      generated funds;

·

cash
      on hand;

·

debt
      or preferred stock issuances; and

·

bank
      financing under new or existing
facilities.

Entergy Arkansas may refinance or
redeem debt and preferred stock prior to maturity, to the extent market
conditions and interest and dividend rates are favorable.

All debt and common and preferred stock
issuances by Entergy Arkansas require prior regulatory
approval.  Preferred stock and debt issuances are also subject to
issuance tests set forth in Entergy Arkansas' corporate charters, bond
indentures, and other agreements.  Entergy Arkansas has sufficient
capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs.

In April
2009, Entergy Arkansas renewed its credit facility through April 2010 in the
amount of $88 million.  There were no outstanding borrowings under the
Entergy Arkansas credit facility as of December 31, 2009.

Entergy Arkansas' receivables from or
(payables to) the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the
following years:

In May
2007, $1.8 million of Entergy Arkansas' receivable from the money pool was
replaced by a note receivable from Entergy New Orleans.  See Note 4 to
the financial statements for a description of the money pool.

State and Local Rate
Regulation

Retail
Rates

2006 Base Rate
Filing

In August 2006, Entergy Arkansas filed
with the APSC a request for a change in base rates.  Entergy Arkansas
requested a general base rate increase (using an ROE of 11.25%), which it
subsequently adjusted to a request for a $106.5 million annual
increase.  In June 2007, after hearings on the filing, the APSC
ordered Entergy Arkansas to reduce its annual rates by $5 million, and set a
return on common equity of 9.9% with a hypothetical common equity level lower
than Entergy Arkansas' actual capital structure.  For the purpose of
setting rates, the APSC disallowed a portion of costs associated with incentive
compensation based on financial measures and all costs associated with Entergy's
stock-based compensation plans.  In addition, under the terms of the
APSC's decision, the order eliminated storm reserve accounting and set an amount
of $14.4 million in base rates to address storm restoration costs, regardless of
the actual annual amount of future restoration costs.  The APSC's June
2007 decision left Entergy Arkansas with no mechanism to recover
$52 million of costs previously accumulated in Entergy Arkansas' storm
reserve and $18 million of removal costs associated with the termination of a
lease.

The APSC denied Entergy Arkansas'
request for rehearing of its June 2007 decision, and the base rate change was
implemented August 29, 2007, effective for bills rendered after June 15,
2007.  In December 2008 the Arkansas Court of Appeals upheld almost
all aspects of the APSC decision.  After considering the progress of
the proceeding in light of the decision of the Court of Appeals, Entergy
Arkansas recorded in the fourth quarter 2008 an approximately $70 million charge
to earnings, on both a pre- and after-tax basis because these are primarily
flow-through items, to recognize that the regulatory assets associated with the
storm reserve costs, lease termination removal costs, and stock-based
compensation are no longer probable of recovery.  In April 2009 the
Arkansas Supreme Court denied Entergy Arkansas' petition for review of the Court
of Appeals decision.

2009 Base Rate
Filing

On September 4, 2009, Entergy Arkansas
filed with the APSC for a general change in rates, charges, and
tariffs.  Entergy Arkansas requested a $223.2 million base rate
increase that would become effective in July 2010.  The filing
reflects an 11.5% return on common equity using a projected capital structure,
and proposes a formula rate plan mechanism.  Proposed formula rate
plan provisions include a +/- 25 basis point bandwidth, with earnings outside
the bandwidth reset to the 11.5% return on common equity midpoint and rates
changing on a prospective basis depending on whether Entergy Arkansas is over or
under-earning.  The proposed formula rate plan also includes a
recovery mechanism for APSC-approved costs for additional capacity purchases or
construction/acquisition of new transmission or generating
facilities.  Entergy Arkansas is also seeking an increase in its
annual storm damage accrual from $14.4 million to $22.3 million.  The
APSC scheduled hearings in the proceeding beginning in May 2010.

Production
Cost Allocation Rider

In its June 2007 decision on Entergy
Arkansas' August 2006 rate filing, the APSC approved a production cost
allocation rider for recovery from customers of the retail portion of the costs
allocated to Entergy Arkansas as a result of the System Agreement
proceedings.  These costs cause an increase in Entergy Arkansas'
deferred fuel cost balance, because Entergy Arkansas pays the costs over seven
months but collects them from customers over twelve months.  In
December 2007, the APSC issued a subsequent order stating that termination of
the rider would be subject to eighteen months advance notice by the APSC, which
would occur following notice and hearing.

Energy
Cost Recovery Rider

Entergy Arkansas' retail rates include
an energy cost recovery rider.  In December 2007, the APSC issued an
order stating that termination of the energy cost recovery rider would be
subject to eighteen months advance notice by the APSC, which would occur
following notice and hearing.

In March 2009, Entergy Arkansas filed
with the APSC its annual energy cost rate for the period April 2009 through
March 2010.  The filed energy cost rate decreased from $0.02456/kWh to
$0.01552/kWh.  The decrease was caused by the following: 1) all three
of the nuclear power plants from which Entergy Arkansas obtains power, ANO 1 and
2 and Grand Gulf, had refueling outages in 2008, and the previous energy cost
rate had been adjusted to account for the replacement power costs that would be
incurred while these units were down; 2) Entergy Arkansas had a deferred fuel
cost liability from over-recovered fuel costs at December 31, 2008, as compared
to a deferred fuel cost asset from under-recovered fuel costs at December 31,
2007; offset by 3) an increase in the fuel and purchased power prices included
in the calculation.

In August 2009, as provided for by its
energy cost recovery rider, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC an interim
revision to its energy cost rate.  The revised energy cost rate is a
decrease from $0.01552/kWh to $0.01206/kWh.  The decrease was caused
by a decrease in natural gas and purchased power prices from the levels used in
setting the rate in March 2009.  The interim revised energy cost rate
went into effect for the first billing cycle of September 2009.  In
its order approving the new rate, the APSC ordered Entergy Arkansas to show
cause why the rate should not be further reduced.  In its September
14, 2009 response, Entergy Arkansas explained that it used the same methodology
it had used in previous interim revisions, which is based on estimating what the
rate would be in the next annual update based on the information known at the
time.  There has been no further activity in this
proceeding.

APSC
Investigations

In September 2005, Entergy Arkansas
filed with the APSC an interim energy cost rate per the energy cost recovery
rider, which provides for an interim adjustment should the cumulative over- or
under-recovery for the energy period exceed 10 percent of the energy costs for
that period.  In early October 2005, the APSC initiated an
investigation into Entergy Arkansas' interim energy cost rate.  The
investigation is focused on Entergy Arkansas' 1) gas contracting, portfolio, and
hedging practices; 2) wholesale purchases during the period; 3) management of
the coal inventory at its coal generation plants; and 4) response to the
contractual failure of the railroads to provide coal deliveries.  In
March 2006, the APSC extended its investigation to cover the costs included in
Entergy Arkansas' March 2006 annual energy cost rate filing, and a hearing was
held in the APSC energy cost recovery investigation in October
2006.

In January 2007, the APSC issued an
order in its review of the energy cost rate.  The APSC found that
Entergy Arkansas failed to maintain an adequate coal inventory level going into
the summer of 2005 and that Entergy Arkansas should be responsible for any
incremental energy costs resulting from two outages caused by employee and
contractor error.  The coal plant generation curtailments were caused
by railroad delivery problems and Entergy has since resolved litigation with the
railroad regarding the delivery problems.  The APSC staff was directed
to perform an analysis with Entergy Arkansas' assistance to determine the
additional fuel and purchased energy costs associated with these findings and
file the analysis within 60 days of the order.  After a final
determination of the costs is made by the APSC, Entergy Arkansas would be
directed to refund that amount with interest to its customers as a credit on the
energy cost recovery rider.  Entergy Arkansas requested rehearing of
the order.  In March 2007, in order to allow further consideration by
the APSC, the APSC granted Entergy Arkansas' petition for rehearing and for stay
of the APSC order.

In October 2008, Entergy Arkansas filed
a motion to lift the stay and to rescind the APSC's January 2007 order in light
of the arguments advanced in Entergy Arkansas' rehearing petition and because
the value for Entergy Arkansas' customers obtained through the resolved railroad
litigation is significantly greater than the incremental cost of actions
identified by the APSC as imprudent.  The APSC staff, the AEEC, and
the Arkansas attorney general support the lifting of the stay but request
additional proceedings.  In December 2008, the APSC denied the motion
to lift the stay pending resolution of Entergy Arkansas' rehearing request and
of the unresolved issues in the proceeding.  The APSC ordered
the


Entergy
Arkansas, Inc.

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

parties
to submit their unresolved issues list in the pending proceeding, which the
parties have done.  In February 2010 the APSC denied Entergy Arkansas'
request for rehearing, and scheduled a hearing for September 2010 to determine
the amount of damages, if any, that should be assessed against Entergy
Arkansas.

The APSC also established a separate
docket to consider the resolved railroad litigation, and in February 2010 it
established a procedural schedule that concludes with testimony through
September 2010.  The APSC may set a hearing in a future order, if
necessary.

Storm
Cost Recovery

Entergy Arkansas Storm
Reserve Accounting

The APSC's June 2007 order in Entergy
Arkansas' base rate proceeding eliminated storm reserve accounting for Entergy
Arkansas.  In March 2009 a law was enacted in Arkansas that requires
the APSC to permit storm reserve accounting for utilities that request
it.  Entergy Arkansas filed its request with the APSC, and has
reinstated storm reserve accounting effective January 1, 2009.  A
hearing on Entergy Arkansas' request is scheduled for March 2010.

Entergy Arkansas January
2009 Ice Storm

In January 2009 a severe ice storm
caused significant damage to Entergy Arkansas' transmission and distribution
lines, equipment, poles, and other facilities.  On January 30, 2009,
the APSC issued an order inviting and encouraging electric public utilities to
file specific proposals for the recovery of extraordinary storm restoration
expenses associated with the ice storm.  On February 16, 2009, Entergy
Arkansas filed a request with the APSC for an accounting order authorizing
deferral of the operating and maintenance cost portion of Entergy Arkansas' ice
storm restoration costs pending their recovery.  The APSC issued such
an order in March 2009 subject to certain conditions, including that if Entergy
Arkansas seeks to recover the deferred costs, those costs will be subject to
investigation for whether they are incremental, prudent, and
reasonable.  A law was enacted in April 2009 in Arkansas that
authorizes securitization of storm damage restoration costs.  On
February 1, 2010, Entergy Arkansas requested a financing order to issue
approximately $127.5 million in storm recovery bonds, which included carrying
costs of $11.7 million and $4.6 million of up-front financing costs to pay for
ice storm restoration because Entergy Arkansas' analysis demonstrates retail
customers will benefit from lower costs using securitization.  The
APSC has established a procedural schedule that includes a hearing in April 2010
and states that the APSC will issue its final order by June 15,
2010.  Entergy Arkansas' September 2009 general rate filing also
requested recovery of the January 2009 ice storm costs over 10 years if it was
expected that securitization would not produce lower costs for customers, and
Entergy Arkansas will remove this request if the APSC approves
securitization.

Co-Owner-Initiated
Proceeding at the FERC

In October 2004, Arkansas Electric
Cooperative Corporation (AECC) filed a complaint at the FERC against Entergy
Arkansas relating to a contract dispute over the pricing of substitute energy at
the co-owned Independence and White Bluff coal plants.  The main issue
in the case related to the consequences under the governing contracts when the
dispatch of the coal units is constrained due to system operating
conditions.  A hearing was held on the AECC complaint and an ALJ Initial
Decision was issued in January 2006 in which the ALJ found AECC's claims to be
without merit.  On October 25, 2006, the FERC issued its order in the
proceeding.  In the order, the FERC reversed the ALJ's
findings.  Specifically, the FERC found that the governing contracts
do not recognize the effects of dispatch constraints on the co-owned
units.  The FERC explained that for over twenty-three years the course
of conduct of the parties was such that AECC received its full entitlement to
the two coal units, regardless of any reduced output caused by system operating
constraints.  Based on the order, Entergy Arkansas is required to
refund to AECC all excess amounts billed to AECC as a result of the system
operating constraints.  The FERC denied Entergy Arkansas'
request

for
rehearing and Entergy Arkansas refunded $22.1 million (including interest) to
AECC in September 2007.  Entergy Arkansas had previously recorded a
provision for the estimated effect of this refund.  In January 2010
the FERC issued an order conditionally accepting the refund report and ordering
further refunds, noting that the refund period should have included the period
July 1, 2004 through December 23, 2004.  Entergy Arkansas had
previously recorded a provision for the estimated effect of this
refund.

Utility
Restructuring

In April 1999, the Arkansas legislature
enacted Act 1556, the Arkansas Electric Consumer Choice Act, providing for
competition in the electric utility industry through retail open
access.  In December 2001, the APSC recommended to the Arkansas
General Assembly that legislation be enacted during the 2003 legislative session
to either repeal Act 1556 or further delay retail open access until at least
2010.  In February 2003, the Arkansas legislature voted to repeal Act
1556 and the repeal was signed into law by the governor.

Nuclear
Matters

Entergy
Arkansas owns and operates, through an affiliate, the ANO 1 and ANO 2 nuclear
power plants.  Entergy Arkansas is, therefore, subject to the risks
related to owning and operating nuclear plants. These include risks from the
use, storage, handling and disposal of high-level and low-level radioactive
materials, regulatory requirement changes, including changes resulting from
events at other plants, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance
commercially available for losses in connection with nuclear operations, and
technological and financial uncertainties related to decommissioning nuclear
plants at the end of their licensed lives, including the sufficiency of funds in
decommissioning trusts.  In the event of an unanticipated early
shutdown of either ANO 1 or ANO 2, Entergy Arkansas may be required to file with
the APSC a rate mechanism to provide additional funds or credit support to
satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning.

The
nuclear industry continues to address susceptibility to stress corrosion
cracking of certain materials associated with components within the reactor
coolant system.  The issue is applicable to ANO and is managed in
accordance with industry standard practices and guidelines and includes
in-service examinations, replacement and mitigation strategy.  Several
major modifications to the ANO units have been implemented to mitigate the
susceptibility of large bore dissimilar metal welds.  In addition, a
replacement reactor vessel head has been fabricated for ANO
2.  Routine inspections of the existing ANO 2 reactor vessel head have
identified no significant material degradation issues for that
component.  These inspections will continue at planned refueling
outages.  Timing for installation of the new reactor vessel head will
be based on the results of future inspection efforts.

Environmental
Risks

Entergy Arkansas' facilities and
operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having
jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and
hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental
matters.  Management believes that Entergy Arkansas is in substantial
compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities
and operations.  Because environmental regulations are subject to
change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely
estimated.  See

"

discussion of the project to install scrubbers and low NOx burners at Entergy
Arkansas' White Bluff coal plant, which under current environmental regulations
must be operational by September 2013.

Critical Accounting
Estimates

The
preparation of Entergy Arkansas' financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply
appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can
have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations,
and cash flows.  Management has identified the following accounting
policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and
measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for
future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates
that would have a material effect on the presentation of Entergy Arkansas'
financial position or results of operations.

Nuclear
Decommissioning Costs

See
"

Nuclear Decommissioning
Costs

" in the "

Critical
Accounting Estimates

" section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries
Management's Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the estimates inherent in
accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs.

In the
first quarter 2009, Entergy Arkansas recorded a revision to its estimated
decommissioning cost liabilities for ANO 1 and 2 as a result of a revised
decommissioning cost study.  The revised estimates resulted in an $8.9
million reduction in its decommissioning liability, along with a corresponding
reduction in the related regulatory asset.

Unbilled
Revenue

As
discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Entergy Arkansas records an
estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer
billing.  Each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are
recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month's estimate is
reversed.  The difference between the estimate of the unbilled
receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the
amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period.  The estimate
recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the
unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that
month.  Therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated
price and usage at the beginning and end of each period, in addition to changes
in certain components of the calculation.

Qualified
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Entergy
sponsors qualified, defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all
employees.  Additionally, Entergy currently provides postretirement
health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees who
reach retirement age while still working for Entergy.  Entergy's
reported costs of providing these benefits, as described in Note 11 to the
financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions
of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial
calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms.  See the "

Critical
Accounting Estimates

" section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries
Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.  Because
of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these
obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy's estimate
of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.

Costs and
Funding

Total
qualified pension cost for Entergy Arkansas in 2009 was $19.8
million.  Entergy Arkansas anticipates 2010 qualified pension cost to
be approximately $31.7 million.  Entergy Arkansas' contributions to
the pension trust were $24.8 million in 2009 and are currently estimated to be
approximately $73.1 million in 2010; although the required pension contributions
will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2010 valuations are
completed by April 1, 2010.  Also, guidance pursuant to the Pension
Protection Act of 2006 rules, effective for the 2008 plan year and beyond,
continues to evolve, be interpreted through technical corrections bills, and
discussed within the industry and by congressional lawmakers.  Any
changes to the Pension Protection Act as a result of these discussions and
efforts may affect the level of Entergy Arkansas’ pension contributions in the
future.

Total
postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for Entergy Arkansas
in 2009 were $21.9 million, including $4.9 million in savings due to the
estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies.  Entergy
Arkansas expects 2010 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit
costs to approximate $18.9 million, including $5.3 million in savings due to the
estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies.  Entergy
Arkansas expects to contribute approximately $21.6 million to other
postretirement plans in 2010.

ENTERGY
GULF STATES LOUISIANA, L.L.C.

MANAGEMENT'S
FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Jurisdictional Separation of
Entergy Gulf States, Inc. into Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy
Texas

Effective December 31, 2007, Entergy
Gulf States, Inc. completed a jurisdictional separation into two vertically
integrated utility companies, one operating under the sole retail jurisdiction
of the PUCT, Entergy Texas, and the other operating under the sole retail
jurisdiction of the LPSC, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana.  Management
believes that the jurisdictional separation will better align Entergy Gulf
States, Inc.'s Louisiana and Texas operations to serve customers in those states
and to operate consistent with state-specific regulatory requirements as the
utility regulatory environments in those jurisdictions evolve.  The
jurisdictional separation provides for regulation of each separated company by a
single retail regulator, which should reduce regulatory complexity.

Entergy Texas now owns all Entergy Gulf
States, Inc. distribution and transmission assets located in Texas, the
gas-fired generating plants located in Texas, undivided 42.5% ownership shares
of Entergy Gulf States, Inc.'s 70% ownership interest in Nelson 6 and 42%
ownership interest in Big Cajun 2, Unit 3, which are coal-fired generating
plants located in Louisiana, and other assets and contract rights to the extent
related to utility operations in Texas.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana
now owns all of the remaining assets that were owned by Entergy Gulf States,
Inc.  On a book value basis, approximately 58.1% of the Entergy Gulf
States, Inc. assets were allocated to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and
approximately 41.9% were allocated to Entergy Texas.

Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana remains primarily liable for all of the long-term debt
issued by Entergy Gulf States, Inc. that was outstanding on December 31,
2007.  Under a debt assumption agreement with Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana, Entergy Texas assumed its pro rata share of this long-term debt,
which was $1.079 billion, or approximately 46%, of which $168 million remains
outstanding at December 31, 2009.  The pro rata share of the long-term
debt assumed by Entergy Texas was determined by first determining the net assets
for each company on a book value basis, and then calculating a debt assumption
ratio that resulted in the common equity ratios for each company being
approximately the same as the Entergy Gulf States, Inc. common equity ratio
immediately prior to the jurisdictional separation.  Entergy Texas'
debt assumption does not discharge Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's liability for
the long-term debt.  To secure its debt assumption obligations,
Entergy Texas granted to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana a first lien on Entergy
Texas' assets that were previously subject to the Entergy Gulf States, Inc.
mortgage.  Entergy Texas has until December 31, 2010 to repay the
assumed debt.  In addition, Entergy Texas, as the owner of Entergy
Gulf States Reconstruction Funding I, LLC ("EGSRF I"), reports the $329.5
million of senior secured transition bonds ("securitization bonds") issued by
EGSRF I as long-term debt on its consolidated balance sheet.  The
securitization bonds are non-recourse to Entergy Texas.

Entergy
Texas will purchase from Entergy Gulf States Louisiana pursuant to a
life-of-unit purchased power agreement (PPA) a 42.5% share of capacity and
energy from the 70% of River Bend subject to retail
regulation.  Entergy Texas was allocated a share of River Bend's
nuclear and environmental liabilities that is identical to the share of the
plant's output purchased by Entergy Texas under the PPA.  Entergy Gulf
States Louisiana will purchase a 57.5% share of capacity and energy from the
gas-fired generating plants owned by Entergy Texas, and Entergy Texas will
purchase a 42.5% share of capacity and energy from the gas-fired generating
plants owned by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana.  The PPAs associated
with the gas-fired generating plants will terminate when retail open access
commences in Entergy Texas' jurisdiction or when the unit(s) is no longer
dispatched by the Entergy System.  If Entergy Texas implements retail
open access, it will terminate its participation in the System Agreement,
except for the portion of the System Agreement related to transmission
equalization.  The dispatch and operation of the generating plants
will not change as a result of the jurisdictional separation.

As the
successor to Entergy Gulf States, Inc. for financial reporting purposes, Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana's income statement and cash flow statement for the year
ended December 31, 2007 include the operations of Entergy
Texas.

Net
Income

2009 Compared to

Net income increased by $8.3 million
primarily due to higher net revenue, lower interest and other charges, and lower
taxes other than income taxes, partially offset by a higher effective income tax
rate and lower other income.

2008 Compared to

Net income decreased $48 million
primarily due to the jurisdictional separation of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. into
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas, effective December 31, 2007, in
addition to lower other income and lower net revenue other than the effects
directly caused by the jurisdictional separation, partially offset by lower
other operation and maintenance expenses and a lower effective income tax
rate.  For the year ended December 31, 2007, Entergy Texas reported
net income of $58.9 million.

Net
Revenue

2009 Compared to

Net revenue consists of operating
revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale,
2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory
credits.  Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue
comparing 2009 to 2008.

The fuel recovery variance resulted
primarily from an adjustment to deferred fuel costs in the fourth quarter 2009
relating to unrecovered nuclear fuel costs incurred since January 2008 that will
now be recovered after a revision to the fuel adjustment clause
methodology.

The volume/weather variance is
primarily due to an increase in unbilled sales volume, including the effects of
Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike which decreased sales volume in 2008, and the
effect of more favorable weather.

The retail electric price variance is
primarily due to:

·

a
      formula rate plan provision of $3.7 million recorded in the third quarter
      of 2009 for refunds made to customers in November 2009 in accordance with
      a settlement approved by the LPSC.  See Note 2 to the financial
      statements for further discussion of the
  settlement;

·

a
      credit passed on to customers as a result of the Act 55 storm cost
      financing; and

·

a
      net decrease in the formula rate plan effective September 2008 to remove
      interim storm recovery upon the Act 55 financing of storm costs as well as
      the storm damage accrual.  A portion of the decrease is offset
      in other operation and maintenance expenses.  See Note 2 to the
      financial statements for further discussion of the formula rate
      plan.

The
decrease was partially offset by a formula rate plan increase effective
September 2008 and November 2009.  Refer to "

MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS -

State and
Local Rate Regulation

- -Retail Rates - Electric"

and Note 2 to the financial statements for a
discussion of the formula rate plan.

Gross
operating revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses

Gross operating revenues decreased
primarily due to:

·

a
      decrease of $638.2 million in electric fuel cost recovery revenues due to
      lower fuel rates;

·

a
      decrease of $245 million in gross wholesale revenue due to a decrease in
      the average price of energy available for resale sales;
  and

·

a
      decrease of $33.5 million in gross gas revenue primarily due to lower fuel
      rates.

The
decrease was partially offset by formula rate plan increases effective November
2009 as discussed above.

Fuel and purchased power expenses
decreased primarily due to a decrease in the average market prices of natural
gas and purchased power and a decrease in deferred fuel expense due to decreased
recovery from customers of fuel costs in addition to a credit recorded in the
fourth quarter 2009 as a result of a revision to the fuel adjustment clause
methodology as explained above.

The Other variance is primarily caused
by various operational effects of the jurisdictional separation on revenues and
fuel and purchased power expenses.

Gross
operating revenues, fuel and purchased power expenses, and other regulatory
charges (credits)

The change in gross operating revenues,
fuel and purchased power expenses, and other regulatory charges was primarily
caused by the jurisdictional separation of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. into
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas, effective December 31,
2007.

Other
Income Statement Variances

2009 Compared to

Other operation and maintenance
expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease of $7.7 million in storm damage
reserves in 2009 as a result of the completion of the Act 55 storm cost
financing and a decrease of $5.5 million in payroll-related costs. The decrease
was partially offset by an increase of $7.8 million in nuclear expenses due to
higher nuclear labor and contract costs.

Taxes other than income taxes decreased
primarily due to a decrease in local franchise taxes as a result of lower
residential and commercial revenue.

Other income decreased primarily due
to:

·

a
      decrease of $15.6 million in interest and dividend income related to the
      debt assumption agreement with Entergy Texas.  Entergy Gulf
      States Louisiana remains primarily liable on this debt, of which $168
      million remained outstanding as of December 31, 2009 and $770 million
      remained outstanding as of December 31,
2008;

·

the
      decrease of $4.7 million in carrying charges on Hurricane Katrina and
      Hurricane Rita storm restoration costs as a result of the Act 55 storm
      cost financing; and

·

a
      decrease of $3.5 million in interest earned on money pool
      investments.

The
decrease is partially offset by additional distributions of $8.7 million earned
on preferred membership interests purchased from Entergy Holdings Company with
the proceeds received from the Act 55 storm costs financings and $5.5 million in
carrying charges on Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike storm restoration
costs.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the
Act 55 storm cost financing.

Interest expense decreased primarily
due to a decrease of $421 million in long-term debt outstanding.  See
Note 5 to the financial statements for a description of the decrease in
long-term debt.


Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C.

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

2008 Compared to

Other
operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to:

·

a
      decrease of $179.1 million due to the jurisdictional separation of Entergy
      Gulf States, Inc. into Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas,
      effective December 31, 2007;

·

a
      decrease of $16.3 million in payroll, payroll-related, and benefit
      costs;

·

a
      decrease of $9.7 million in nuclear labor and contract costs due to a
      non-refueling plant outage in March 2007;
and

·

a
      decrease of $10.1 million in plant maintenance
  costs.

The
decrease was partially offset by an increase of $8.8 million in transmission
spending due to higher transmission equalization expenses.

Taxes other than income taxes decreased
primarily due to the jurisdictional separation of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. into
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas, effective December 31,
2007.

Nuclear refueling outage expenses
increased due to the amortization of higher expenses associated with the planned
maintenance and refueling outage at River Bend in the first quarter 2008 as well
as the delay of this outage from late 2007 to early 2008 resulting in a shorter
amortization period for these costs.

Depreciation and amortization decreased
primarily due to the jurisdictional separation of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. into
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas, effective December 31,
2007.

Other income includes $60 million in
interest and dividend income in 2008 related to the debt assumption agreement
between Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas and the $1.079 billion
of debt assumed by Entergy Texas as of December 31, 2007.  Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana remains primarily liable on this debt, of which $770
million remained outstanding at December 31, 2008.  The increase in
interest income is partially offset by $34 million of other income reported by
Entergy Texas for the year ended December 31, 2007.  The income from
the debt assumption agreement offsets the interest expense on the portion of
long-term debt assumed by Entergy Texas.  The remaining variance is
primarily due to the cessation of carrying charges on storm restoration costs as
a result of the securitization and a decrease in interest earned on money pool
investments, partially offset by dividends of $10.3 million earned on preferred
stock purchased from Entergy Holdings Company with the proceeds received from
the Act 55 Storm Cost Financings.  See Note 2 to the financial
statements for a discussion of the Act 55 storm cost financing.

Interest
and other charges decreased primarily due to the jurisdictional separation of
Entergy Gulf States, Inc. into Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas,
effective December 31, 2007 and due to a decrease in long-term debt
outstanding.

Income
Taxes

The effective income tax rates were
36.8%, 28.3%, and 39.1% for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.  See

Operating
Activities

Net cash flow provided by operating
activities decreased $328 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to
storm cost proceeds of $274.7 million received from the Louisiana Utilities
Restoration Corporation (LURC) as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financing in
2008, decreased recovery of deferred fuel costs, and income tax payments of
$60.6 million in 2009 compared to income tax refunds of $1.8 million in 2008,
partially offset by a decrease of $28.2 million in pension contributions and
fluctuation in the timing of accounts receivable and payable
activity.

Net cash flow provided by operating
activities increased $2.2 million in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to
storm cost proceeds of $274.7 million received from the LURC as a result of the
Act 55 storm cost financing, almost entirely offset by the jurisdictional
separation of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. into Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and
Entergy Texas, effective December 31, 2007, increased recovery of fuel costs,
and an increase of $17.9 million in pension contributions.  See Note 2
to the financial statements for a discussion of the Act 55 storm cost
financing.

Investing
Activities

Net cash flow used in investing
activities decreased $232.9 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due
to:

·

the
      investment of $189.4 million in affiliate securities in 2008 as a result
      of the Act 55 storm cost financing.  See Note 2 to the financial
      statements for a discussion of the Act 55 storm cost
      financing;

·

higher
      construction expenditures in 2008 due to Hurricane
  Gustav;

·

the
      purchase of the Calcasieu Generating Facility for $56 million in March
      2008; and

·

timing
      differences between nuclear fuel purchases and fuel trust
      reimbursements.

The
decrease was partially offset by money pool activity and the purchase of
one-third of the Ouachita Power Plant for $75 million in November 2009 from
Entergy Arkansas.  See "

Ouachita Power Plant"

below for a discussion of the purchase of the Ouachita Power
Plant.  Increases in Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's receivable from
the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's
receivable from the money pool increased by $38.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2009 compared to decreasing by $43.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2008.  The money pool is an inter-company borrowing
arrangement designed to reduce the Utility subsidiaries' need for external
short-term borrowings.


Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C.

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

Net cash used in investing activities
decreased $282.1 million in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to the cash
allocated to Entergy Texas in the jurisdictional separation transaction in 2007
and due to the effect of the jurisdictional separation on money pool
activity.  The decrease was partially offset by the investment of
$189.4 million in affiliate securities as a result of the Act 55 storm costs
financings and the purchase of the Calcasieu Generating Facility for $56
million.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of
the Act 55 storm cost financing.  In March 2008, Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana purchased Calcasieu, a 322 MW, simple-cycle, gas-fired power
plant, from a subsidiary of Dynegy Inc.  The facility is located near
the city of Sulphur in southwestern Louisiana.  Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana received the plant, materials and supplies, SO


emission
allowances, and related real estate in the transaction.  The FERC and
the LPSC approved the acquisition.

Decreases in Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana's receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow, and
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's receivable from the money pool decreased by
$43.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to increasing by
$134.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.

Financing
Activities

Financing activities provided cash of
$146.7 million in 2009 compared to using cash of $102.3 million in 2008
primarily due to the issuance of $300 million of 5.59% Series first mortgage
bonds in October 2009 and a decrease of $73.5 million in common equity
distributions, partially offset by the retirement of $119 million of long term
debt in 2009.

Financing activities used cash of
$102.3 million in 2008 compared to providing cash of $168.4 million in 2007
primarily due to the issuance of $329.5 million of securitization bonds in June
2007 by a subsidiary of Entergy Texas, partially offset by the redemption of all
outstanding shares of Entergy Gulf States, Inc.'s preferred stock in December
2007.

Capital
Structure

Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana's capitalization is balanced between equity and debt, as
shown in the following table.  The calculation below does not reduce
the debt by the debt assumed by Entergy Texas ($168 million as of December 31,
2009, and $770 million as of December 31, 2008) because Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana remains primarily liable on the debt.  The reduction in the
debt to capital ratio in 2009 is primarily due to the repayment in 2009 of $602
million of assumed debt by Entergy Texas.

In
addition to the contractual obligations given above, Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana expects to contribute $21.9 million to its pension plans and $8.4
million to other postretirement plans in 2010; although the required pension
contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2010
valuations are completed by April 1, 2010.  Also, guidance pursuant to
the Pension Protection Act of 2006 rules, effective for the 2008 plan year and
beyond, continues to evolve, be interpreted through technical corrections bills,
and discussed within the industry and by congressional lawmakers.  Any
changes to the Pension Protection Act as a result of these discussions and
efforts may affect the level of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s pension
contributions in the future.

Also, in addition to the contractual
obligations, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana has $245.8 million of unrecognized
tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes for which the timing of
payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in
the timing of effective settlement of tax positions.  See Note 3 to
the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax
benefits.

The planned capital investment estimate
for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana reflects capital required to support existing
business and customer growth.  Entergy's Utility supply plan
initiative will continue to seek to transform its generation portfolio with new
or repowered generation resources.  Opportunities resulting from the
supply plan initiative, including new projects or the exploration of alternative
financing sources, could result in increases or decreases in the capital

Ouachita Power
Plant

In August 2008, the LPSC issued an
order approving an uncontested settlement between Entergy Gulf States Louisiana
and the LPSC Staff authorizing Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's purchase, under a
life-of-unit agreement, of one-third of the capacity and energy from the 789 MW
Ouachita power plant.  The LPSC's approval was subject to certain
conditions, including a study to determine the costs and benefits of Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana exercising an option to purchase one-third of the plant
(Unit 3) from Entergy Arkansas.  In April 2009, Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana made a filing with the LPSC seeking approval of Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana exercising its option to convert its purchased power agreement into
the ownership interest in Unit 3 and a one-third interest in the Ouachita common
facilities.  In September 2009 the LPSC, pursuant to an uncontested
settlement, approved the acquisition and a cost recovery
mechanism.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana purchased Unit 3 and a
one-third interest in the Ouachita common facilities for $75 million in November
2009.

New Nuclear
Development

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and
Entergy Louisiana provided public notice to the LPSC of their intention to make
a filing pursuant to the LPSC's general order that governs the development of
new nuclear generation in Louisiana.  The project option being
developed by the companies is for new nuclear generation at River
Bend.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana, together
with Entergy Mississippi, have been engaged in the development of options to
construct new nuclear generation at the River Bend and Grand Gulf
sites.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana are
leading the development at River Bend, and Entergy Mississippi is leading the
development at Grand Gulf.  This project is in the early stages, and
several issues remain to be addressed over time before significant additional
capital would be committed to this project.  In 2010, Entergy Gulf
States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana each paid for and will recognize on its
books $24.9 million in costs associated with the development of new nuclear
generation at the River Bend site; these costs previously had been recorded on
the books of Entergy New Nuclear Development, LLC, a System Energy
subsidiary.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana will
share costs going forward on a 50/50 basis, which reflects each company's
current participation level in the project.  In response to the
companies' previous notice, dated August 10, 2009, the LPSC opened a
docket.  A procedural schedule will be established after the companies
file the certification application referred to in the notice.

Sources
of Capital

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's sources
to meet its capital requirements include:

·

internally
      generated funds;

·

cash
      on hand;

·

debt
      or preferred membership interest issuances;
and

·

bank
      financing under new or existing
facilities.

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana may
refinance or redeem debt and preferred equity/membership interests prior to
maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and dividend rates are
favorable.

All debt and common and preferred equity/membership interest issuances by
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana require prior regulatory
approval.  Preferred equity/membership interest and debt issuances are
also subject to issuance tests set forth in its corporate charter, bond
indentures, and other agreements.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana has
sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital
needs.

Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana's receivables from the money pool were as follows as of
December 31 for each of the following years:

See Note

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana has a credit facility in the amount of $100 million
scheduled to expire in August 2012.  No borrowings were outstanding
under the credit facility as of December 31, 2009.

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana obtained
short-term borrowing authorization from the FERC under which it may borrow
through October 2011, up to the aggregate amount, at any one time outstanding,
of $200 million.  See Note 4 to the financial statements for further
discussion of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's short-term borrowing
limits.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana has also obtained an order from
the FERC authorizing long-term securities issuances through July
2011.

Hurricane Gustav and
Hurricane Ike

In September 2008, Hurricane Gustav and
Hurricane Ike caused catastrophic damage to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's
service territory.  The storms resulted in widespread power outages,
significant damage to distribution, transmission, and generation infrastructure,
and the loss of sales during the power outages.  In October 2008,
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana drew all of its $85 million funded storm
reserve.  On October 15, 2008, the LPSC approved Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana's request to defer and accrue carrying cost on unrecovered storm
expenditures during the period the company seeks regulatory
recovery.  The approval was without prejudice to the ultimate
resolution of the total amount of prudently incurred storm cost or final
carrying cost rate.

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and
Entergy Louisiana filed their Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike storm cost
recovery case with the LPSC in May 2009.  In September 2009, Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana made a supplemental filing to, among
other things, recommend recovery of the costs and replenishment of the storm
reserves by Louisiana Act 55 (passed in 2007) financing.  Entergy Gulf
States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana recovered their costs from Hurricane
Katrina and Hurricane Rita primarily by Act 55 financing, as discussed
below.  On December 30, 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and
Entergy Louisiana entered into a stipulation agreement with the LPSC Staff that,
if approved, provides for total recoverable costs of approximately $234 million
for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and $394 million for Entergy
Louisiana.  Under this stipulation, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana
agrees not to recover $4.4 million and Entergy Louisiana agrees not to recover
$7.2 million of their storm restoration spending.  The stipulation
also permits replenishing Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's storm reserve in the
amount of $90 million and Entergy Louisiana's storm reserve in the amount of
$200 million when Act 55 financing is accomplished.  The parties to
the proceeding have agreed to a procedural schedule that includes March/April
2010 hearing dates for both the recoverability and the method of recovery
proceedings.

Hurricane Rita and Hurricane
Katrina

In August and September 2005,
Hurricanes Katrina and Rita hit Entergy Gulf States Inc.'s jurisdictions in
Louisiana and Texas.  The storms resulted in power outages;
significant damage to electric distribution, transmission, and generation
infrastructure; and the temporary loss of sales and customers due to mandatory
evacuations.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana pursued a range of
initiatives to recover storm restoration and business continuity costs and
incremental losses.  Initiatives included obtaining reimbursement of
certain costs covered by insurance and pursuing recovery through existing or new
rate mechanisms regulated by the FERC and local regulatory bodies, in
combination with securitization.

Insurance
Claims

Entergy has received a total of $317
million as of December 31, 2009 on its Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita
insurance claims, including the settlements of its Hurricane Katrina claims with
each of its two excess insurers.  Of the $317 million received, $21
million was allocated to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana.  Entergy has
substantially completed its insurance recoveries related to Hurricane Katrina
and Hurricane Rita.

Storm
Cost Financings

In March 2008, Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and the Louisiana Utilities Restoration
Corporation (LURC), an instrumentality of the State of Louisiana, filed at the
LPSC an application requesting that the LPSC grant financing orders authorizing
the financing of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana storm
costs, storm reserves, and issuance costs pursuant to Act 55 of the Louisiana
Legislature (Act 55 financings).  The Act 55 financings are expected
to produce additional customer benefits as compared to Act 64 traditional
securitization.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana also
filed an application requesting LPSC approval for ancillary issues including the
mechanism to flow charges and savings to customers via a Storm Cost Offset
rider.  On April 3, 2008, the Louisiana State Bond Commission granted
preliminary approval for the Act 55 financings.  On April 8, 2008, the
Louisiana Public Facilities Authority (LPFA), which is the issuer of the bonds
pursuant to the Act 55 financings, approved requests for the Act 55
financings.  On April 10, 2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy
Louisiana and the LPSC Staff filed with the LPSC an uncontested stipulated
settlement that includes Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana's
proposals under the Act 55 financings, which includes a commitment to pass on to
customers a minimum of $10 million and $30 million of customer benefits,
respectively, through prospective annual rate reductions of $2 million and $6
million for five years.  On April 16, 2008, the LPSC approved the
settlement and issued two financing orders and one ratemaking order intended to
facilitate implementation of the Act 55 financings.  In May 2008, the
Louisiana State Bond Commission granted final approval of the Act 55
financings.

On August 26, 2008, the LPFA issued
$278.4 million in bonds under the aforementioned Act 55.  From the
$274.7 million of bond proceeds loaned by the LPFA to the LURC, the LURC
deposited $87 million in a restricted escrow account as a storm damage reserve
for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and transferred $187.7 million directly to
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana.  From the bond proceeds received by
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana from the LURC, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana
invested $189.4 million, including $1.7 million that was withdrawn from the
restricted escrow account as approved by the April 16, 2008 LPSC orders, in
exchange for 1,893,918.39 Class A preferred, non-voting, membership interest
units of Entergy Holdings Company LLC, a company wholly-owned and consolidated
by Entergy, that carry a 10% annual distribution rate.  Distributions
are payable quarterly commencing on September 15, 2008 and have a liquidation
price of $100 per unit.  The preferred membership interests are
callable at the option of Entergy Holdings Company LLC after ten years under the
terms of the LLC agreement.  The terms of the membership interests
include certain financial covenants to which Entergy Holdings Company LLC is
subject, including the requirement to maintain a net worth of at least $1
billion.

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana does not
report the bonds on its balance sheet because the bonds are the obligation of
the LPFA, and there is no recourse against Entergy Gulf States Louisiana in the
event of a bond default.

State and Local Rate
Regulation

The rates that Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana charges for its services significantly influence its financial
position, results of operations, and liquidity.  Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana is regulated and the rates charged to its customers are determined in
regulatory proceedings.  A governmental agency, the LPSC is primarily
responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers.

Retail
Rates - Electric

In March 2005, the LPSC approved a
settlement proposal to resolve various dockets covering a range of issues for
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana.  The settlement
included the establishment of a three-year formula rate plan for Entergy Gulf
States Louisiana that, among other provisions, establishes a return on common
equity mid-point of 10.65% for the initial three-year term of the plan and
permits Entergy Gulf States Louisiana to recover incremental capacity costs
outside of a traditional base rate proceeding.  Under the formula rate
plan, over- and under-earnings outside an allowed range of 9.9% to 11.4% are
allocated 60% to customers and 40% to Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana made its initial formula
rate plan filing in June 2005.  The formula rate plan was subsequently
extended one year.  As discussed below the formula rate plan has been
extended, with return on common equity provisions consistent with previously
approved provisions, to cover the 2008, 2009, and 2010 test years.


Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C.

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

In
October 2009 the LPSC approved a settlement that resolves Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana's 2007 test year filing.  The settlement provides for a new
formula rate plan for the 2008, 2009, and 2010 test years.  Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana is permitted, effective with the November 2009 billing
cycle, to reset its rates to achieve a 10.65% return on equity for the 2008 test
year.  10.65% is the target midpoint return on equity for the new
formula rate plan, with an earnings bandwidth of +/- 75 basis points (9.90% -
11.40%).  The rate reset, a $44.3 million increase that includes a
$36.9 million cost of service adjustment, plus $7.4 million net for increased
capacity costs and a base rate reclassification, was implemented for the
November 2009 billing cycle, and the rate reset will be subject to refund
pending review of the 2008 test year filing that was made on October 21,
2009.  The settlement does not allow recovery through the formula rate
plan of most of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's costs associated with Entergy's
stock option plan.  Pursuant to the settlement Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana refunded to its customers $3.7 million, which includes interest, in
the November 2009 billing cycle.  In January 2010, Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana implemented an additional $23.9 million rate increase pursuant to a
special rate implementation filing made in December 2009, primarily for
incremental capacity costs approved by the LPSC.  The discovery and
comment period for the 2008 test year filing is currently open, and Entergy Gulf
States Louisiana will implement any agreed changes by March 15,
2010.  A procedural schedule to address any contested issues would be
set after March 15, 2010.

In December 2009, Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana filed an application seeking LPSC approval for a $9.7 million
revenue requirement to provide supplemental funding for the decommissioning
trust maintained for the LPSC-regulated 70% share of River Bend, in response to
an NRC notification of a projected shortfall of decommissioning funding
assurance.  Currently, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's annual retail
rates contain no amount for decommissioning funding.

In May
2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana made its formula rate plan filing with the
LPSC for the 2007 test year.  The filing reflected a 9.26% return on
common equity, which was below the allowed earnings bandwidth, and indicated a
$5.4 million revenue deficiency, offset by a $4.1 million decrease in required
additional capacity costs.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana implemented
a $20.7 million formula rate plan decrease, subject to refund, effective the
first billing cycle in September 2008.  The decrease included removal
of interim storm cost recovery and a reduction in the storm damage
accrual.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana then implemented a $16.0
million formula rate plan increase, subject to refund, effective the first
billing cycle in October 2008 to collect previously deferred and ongoing costs
associated with LPSC approved additional capacity, including the Ouachita power
plant.  In November 2008 Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed to
implement an additional increase of $9.3 million to recover the costs of a new
purchased power agreement.

In May
2007, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana made its formula rate plan filing with the
LPSC for the 2006 test year.  The filing reflected a 10.0% return on
common equity, which was within the allowed earnings bandwidth, and an
anticipated formula rate plan decrease of $23 million annually attributable to
adjustments outside of the formula rate plan sharing mechanism related to
capacity costs and the anticipated securitization of storm costs related to
Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita and the securitization of a storm
reserve.  In September 2007, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana modified
the formula rate plan filing to reflect a 10.07% return on common equity, which
was still within the allowed bandwidth.  The modified filing also
reflected implementation of a $4.1 million rate increase, subject to refund,
attributable to recovery of additional LPSC-approved incremental deferred and
ongoing capacity costs.  The rate decrease anticipated in the original
filing did not occur because of the additional capacity costs approved by the
LPSC, and because securitization of storm costs associated with Hurricane
Katrina and Hurricane Rita and the establishment of a storm reserve had not yet
occurred.  In October 2007, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana implemented
a $16.4 million formula rate plan decrease that was due to the reclassification
of certain franchise fees from base rates to collection via a line item on
customer bills pursuant to an LPSC order.  In March 2008 the LPSC
approved an uncontested stipulated settlement that left the current base rates
in place and extended the formula rate plan for one year.

In May 2006, Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana made its formula rate plan filing with the LPSC for the 2005 test
year.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana modified the filing in August
2006 to reflect an 11.1% return on common equity which is within the allowed
bandwidth.  The modified filing includes a formula rate plan increase
of $17.2 million annually that provides for 1) interim recovery of $10.5 million
of storm costs from Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita and 2) recovery of $6.7
million of LPSC-approved incremental deferred and ongoing

capacity
costs.  The increase was implemented with the first billing cycle of
September 2006.  In May 2007 the LPSC approved a settlement between
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and the LPSC staff, affirming the rates that were
implemented in September 2006.

Retail
Rates - Gas

In January 2010, Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana filed with the LPSC its gas rate stabilization plan for the test year
ended September 30, 2009.  The filing showed an earned return on common
equity of 10.87%, which is within the earnings bandwidth of 10.5% plus or minus
fifty basis points.  The sixty day review and comment period for this
filing remains open.

In January 2009, Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana filed with the LPSC its gas rate stabilization plan for the test year
ending September 30, 2008.  The filing showed a revenue deficiency of $529
thousand based on a return on common equity mid-point of 10.5%.  In
April 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana implemented a $255 thousand rate
increase pursuant to an uncontested settlement with the LPSC staff.

In
January 2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed with the LPSC its gas rate
stabilization plan for the test year ending September 30, 2007.  The filing
showed a revenue deficiency of $3.7 million based on a return on common equity
mid-point of 10.5%.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana implemented a $3.4
million rate increase in April 2008 pursuant to an uncontested agreement with
the LPSC staff.

In
January 2007, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed with the LPSC its gas rate
stabilization plan for the test year ending September 30, 2006.  The filing
showed a revenue deficiency of $3.5 million based on a return on common equity
mid-point of 10.5%.  In March 2007, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed a
set of rate and rider schedules that reflected all proposed LPSC staff
adjustments and implemented a $2.4 million base rate increase effective with the
first billing cycle of April 2007 pursuant to the rate stabilization
plan.

Industrial and Commercial
Customers

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's large
industrial and commercial customers continually explore ways to reduce their
energy costs.  In particular, cogeneration is an option available to a
portion of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's industrial customer
base.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana responds by working with
industrial and commercial customers and negotiating electric service contracts
to provide competitive rates that match specific customer needs and load
profiles.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana actively participates in
economic development, customer retention, and reclamation activities to increase
industrial and commercial demand, from both new and existing
customers.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana does not currently expect
additional significant losses to cogeneration because of the current economics
of the electricity markets and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's marketing efforts
in retaining industrial customers.

Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C.

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

Nuclear
Matters

Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana owns and operates, through an affiliate, the River Bend
nuclear power plant.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana is, therefore,
subject to the risks related to owning and operating a nuclear
plant.  These include risks from the use, storage, handling and
disposal of high-level and low-level radioactive materials, regulatory
requirement changes, including changes resulting from events at other plants,
limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available for
losses in connection with nuclear operations, and technological and financial
uncertainties related to decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their
licensed lives, including the sufficiency of funds in decommissioning
trusts.  In the event of an unanticipated early shutdown of River
Bend, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana may be required to provide additional funds
or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for
decommissioning.

Environmental
Risks

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's
facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental
authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of
toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental
matters.  Management believes that Entergy Gulf States Louisiana is in
substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to
its facilities and operations.  Because environmental regulations are
subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely
estimated.

Critical Accounting
Estimates

The
preparation of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that
can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of
operations, and cash flows.  Management has identified the following
accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on
assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the
potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could
produce estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's financial position or results of
operations.

Nuclear
Decommissioning Costs

See
"

Critical
Accounting Estimates

" section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries'
Management's Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the estimates inherent in
accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs.

Unbilled
Revenue

As
discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana
records an estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest
customer billing.  Each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts
are recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month's estimate is
reversed.  The difference between the estimate of the unbilled
receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the
amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period.  The estimate
recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the
unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that
month.  Therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated
price and usage at the beginning and end of each period, in addition to changes
in certain components of the calculation.

Qualified
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Entergy
sponsors qualified defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all
employees.  Additionally, Entergy currently provides postretirement
health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees who
reach retirement age while still working for Entergy.  Entergy's
reported costs of providing these benefits, as described in Note 11 to the
financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions
of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial
calculations, assumptions,

and
accounting mechanisms.  See the "

Critical
Accounting Estimates

" section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries
Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.  Because
of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these
obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy's estimate
of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.

Costs and
Funding

Total
qualified pension income for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana in 2009 was $1.2
million.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana anticipates 2010 qualified
pension cost to be $10 million.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana
contributed $6 million to its pension plans in 2009 and estimates 2010 pension
contributions to be approximately $21.9 million; although the required pension
contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2010
valuations are completed by April 1, 2010.  Also, guidance pursuant to
the Pension Protection Act of 2006 rules, effective for the 2008 plan year and
beyond, continues to evolve, be interpreted through technical corrections bills,
and discussed within the industry and by congressional lawmakers.  Any
changes to the Pension Protection Act as a result of these discussions and
efforts may affect the level of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s pension
contributions in the future.

Total
postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for Entergy Gulf
States Louisiana in 2009 were $14.7 million, including $3.3 million in savings
due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D
subsidies.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana expects 2010 postretirement
health care and life insurance benefit costs to approximate $16.6 million,
including $3.4 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare
Part D subsidies.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana expects to contribute
approximately $8.4 million to its other postretirement plans in
2010.

REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the
Board of Directors and Members of

Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C.

Baton
Rouge, Louisiana

We have
audited the accompanying balance sheets of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C.
(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related
statements of income, members’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows
(pages 296 through 300 and applicable items in pages 63 through 193) for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our
opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C. as of
December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.

As
discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Entergy Gulf States, Inc.
completed a jurisdictional separation on December 31, 2007.  As
part of the separation, Entergy Gulf States, Inc. contributed certain assets and
liabilities to Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries and reflected the
distribution in the accompanying balance sheet and statement of members’ equity
as of December 31, 2007.

We have

MANAGEMENT'S
FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Results of
Operations

Net
Income

2009 Compared to

Net income increased $75.3 million
primarily due to a lower effective income tax rate, higher other income, higher
net revenue, and lower other operation and maintenance expenses, partially
offset by higher depreciation and amortization expenses.

2008 Compared to

Net income increased $14.2 million
primarily due to lower other operation and maintenance expenses, higher other
income, and a lower effective income tax rate, offset by lower net revenue and
higher depreciation and amortization expenses.

Net
Revenue

2009 Compared to

Net revenue consists of operating
revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale,
2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges
(credits).  Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue
comparing 2009 to 2008.

Volume/weather

36.7

Retail
      electric price

(19.2)

Other

3.3

      net revenue

$980.0

The volume/weather variance is
primarily due to an increase of 504 GWh in billed electricity usage in all
sectors, an increase in unbilled sales volume, including the effect of Hurricane
Gustav and Hurricane Ike which decreased sales volume in 2008, and the effect of
more favorable weather.

The
retail electric price variance is primarily due to:

·

a
      credit passed on to customers as a result of the Act 55 storm cost
      financing;

·

a
      net decrease in the formula rate plan effective August 2008 to remove
      interim storm cost recovery upon the Act 55 financing of storm costs as
      well as the storm damage accrual.  A portion of the decrease is
      offset in other operation and maintenance expenses.  See Note 2
      to the financial statements for further discussion of the formula rate
      plan; and

·

a
      formula rate plan provision of $12.9 million recorded in the third quarter
      2009 for refunds made to customers in November 2009 in accordance with a
      settlement approved by the LPSC.  See Note 2 to the financial
      statements for further discussion of the
  settlement.

The
decrease was offset by an interruptible load provision of $13.4 million recorded
in 2008 for rate refunds that occurred in August and September 2009 and formula
rate plan increases effective November 2009.

discussion of the interim recovery of storm costs and the Act 55 storm cost
financing.

Gross
operating revenues, fuel and purchased power expenses, and other regulatory
charges (credits)

Gross operating revenues decreased
primarily due to a decrease of $763.4 million in fuel cost recovery revenues due
to lower fuel rates and a decrease of $108.1 million in rider
revenues.  The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $36.7
million related to volume/weather, as discussed above.

Fuel and
purchased power expenses decreased primarily due to decreases in the average
market prices of natural gas and purchased power and a decrease in the recovery
from customers of deferred fuel costs.

Other
regulatory charges decreased primarily due to the amortization of deferred
capacity charges, which ceased in August 2009, as a result of the May 2006
formula rate plan filing with the LPSC, the recognition of interim storm cost
recoveries that ceased in July 2008 with the Act 55 financing of storm costs,
and the refunds of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita insurance proceeds
occurring over a twelve-month period.  See Note 2 to the financial
statements for a discussion of the formula rate plan, the interim recovery of
storm costs, and the Act 55 storm cost financing.

2008 Compared to

Net revenue consists of operating
revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale,

The retail electric price variance is
primarily due to the cessation of the interim storm recovery through the formula

customers as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financing, partially offset by
increases in the formula rate plan effective October 2007.  Refer to

" and "

" below for a discussion of the interim recovery of
storm costs, the Act 55 storm cost financing, and the formula rate plan

The purchased power capacity variance
is due to the amortization of deferred capacity costs effective September 2007
as a result of the formula rate plan filing in May 2007.  Purchased
power capacity costs are offset in base revenues due to a base rate increase
implemented to recover incremental deferred and ongoing purchased power capacity
charges.  See

"

State and
Local Rate Regulation

" below for a discussion of the formula rate plan
filing.

The net wholesale revenue variance is
primarily due to provisions recorded for potential rate refunds related to the
treatment of interruptible load in pricing Entergy System affiliate
sales.


Entergy
Louisiana, LLC

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

Gross
operating revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses

Gross operating revenues increased
primarily due to an increase of $364.7 million in fuel cost recovery revenues
due to higher fuel rates offset by decreased usage.  The increase was
partially offset by a decrease of $56.8 million in gross wholesale revenue due
to a decrease in System Agreement rough production cost equalization
credits.

Fuel and purchased power expenses
increased primarily due to increases in the average market prices of natural gas
and purchased power, partially offset by a decrease in the recovery from
customers of deferred fuel costs.

Other
Income Statement Variances

2009 Compared to

Other operation and maintenance
expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease of $6.5 million in
payroll-related costs and a decrease of $6.4 million in loss reserves in 2009,
including a decrease in the storm damage reserve.  The decrease was
partially offset by an increase of $9.0 million in nuclear expenses due to
higher nuclear labor and contract costs.

Depreciation and amortization expenses
increased primarily due to an increase in plant in service.

Other
income increased primarily due to:

·

an
      increase of $25 million in distributions earned on preferred membership
      interests purchased from Entergy Holdings Company with the proceeds
      received from the Act 55 storm cost financing.  See "

MANAGEMENT'S FINANCIAL
      DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS –

Hurricane
      Rita and Hurricane Katrina

" and Note 2 to the financial statements
      for a discussion of the Act 55 storm cost financing;
  and

·

an
      increase in the allowance for equity funds used during construction due to
      more construction work in progress throughout
  2009.

Interest
and other charges increased slightly primarily due to the issuance of $300
million of 6.50% Series first mortgage bonds in August 2008 and the issuance of
$400 million of 5.40% Series first mortgage bonds in November 2009,
substantially offset by an increase in the allowance for borrowed funds used
during construction due to more construction work in progress in
2009.

2008 Compared to

Other
operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to:

·

a
      decrease of $9.3 million in nuclear spending due to a prior year
      non-refueling outage;

·

a
      decrease of $8.6 million in payroll-related
  costs;

·

a
      decrease of $8.1 million in loss reserves for storm damage in 2008 because
      of completion of the Act 55 storm cost financing;
  and

·

a
      decrease of $5.7 million in customer service costs primarily as a result
      of write-offs in 2007 of uncollectible customer
  accounts.

The
decrease was partially offset by an increase of $4.5 million in transmission
spending due to additional costs related to compliance, substation maintenance,
and line and vegetation maintenance and an increase of $4.3 million in fossil
expenses due to a fossil plant maintenance outage in 2008.

Depreciation
and amortization expenses increased primarily due to:

·

a
      revision in the third quarter 2007 related to depreciation on storm
      cost-related assets.  Recovery of the cost of those assets will
      now be through the Act 55 financing of storm costs as approved by the LPSC
      in the third quarter 2007.  See "

Income
Taxes

The effective income tax rates for
2009, 2008, and 2007 were 16.2%, 31.0%, and 36.8%, respectively.  The
decline in the rate for 2009 is primarily due to the reallocation of Entergy
Corporation consolidated tax benefits based on the partial settlement of IRS
audits of prior tax years, the exclusion of dividend income from Entergy
Louisiana's preferred membership interest in Entergy Holdings Company, LLC, and
the flow-through of the equity component of AFUDC.  See Note 3 to the
financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35.0%
to the effective income tax rate and for a discussion of the IRS
audits.

The
decrease was partially offset by increased nuclear construction expenditures
primarily due to the Waterford 3 steam generator replacement project, the dry
fuel storage project, security upgrades, and the reactor coolant pump upgrades
project.

Decreases in Entergy Louisiana's
receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy
Louisiana's receivable from the money pool decreased $8.4 million in 2009
compared to increasing $61.2 million in 2008.  The money pool is an
inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the Utility subsidiaries'
need for external short-term borrowings.

Net cash flow used in investing

Financing
Activities

Entergy Louisiana's cash flow provided
by financing activities increased $134.3 million in 2009 compared to 2008
primarily due to the issuance of $400 million of 5.40% Series first mortgage
bonds in November 2009 compared to the issuance of $300 million of 6.50% Series
first mortgage bonds in August 2008 and the repurchase in 2008 of $60 million of
Auction Rate governmental bonds, partially offset by an increase of $20.6
million in common equity distributions paid in 2009.

Entergy
Louisiana's financings activities provided $227.0 million of cash in 2008
compared to using $58.4 million of cash in 2007 primarily due to the issuance of

required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the
January 1, 2010 valuations are completed by April 1, 2010.  Also,

corrections
bills, and discussed within the industry and by congressional
lawmakers.  Any changes to the Pension Protection Act as a result of
these discussions and efforts may affect the level of Entergy Louisiana’s
pension contributions in the future.

Also, in
addition to the contractual obligations, Entergy Louisiana has $282.1 million of
unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes

for which the timing of
payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in
the timing of effective settlement of tax positions.  See Note 3 to
the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax
benefits.

The planned capital investment estimate
for Entergy Louisiana reflects capital required to support existing business and
customer growth, including the purchase of Acadia Unit 2 and the replacement of
the Waterford 3 steam generators, which are discussed below, and dry cask spent
fuel storage.  Entergy's Utility supply plan initiative will continue
to seek to transform its generation portfolio with new or repowered generation
resources.  Opportunities resulting from the supply plan initiative,
including new projects or the exploration of alternative financing sources,
could result in increases or decreases in the capital expenditure estimates
given above.  The estimated capital expenditures are subject to
periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of
regulatory constraints, environmental compliance, market volatility, economic
trends, business restructuring, and the ability to access
capital.  Management provides more information on long-term debt and
preferred stock maturities in Notes 5 and 6 to the financial
statements.

Acadia Unit 2 Purchase
Agreement

In October 2009 Entergy Louisiana
announced that it signed an agreement to acquire Unit 2 of the Acadia Energy
Center, a 580 MW generating unit located near Eunice, La., from Acadia Power
Partners, LLC, an independent power producer.  The Acadia Energy
Center, which entered commercial service in 2002, consists of two combined-cycle
gas-fired generating units, each nominally rated at 580 MW.  Entergy
Louisiana proposes to acquire 100 percent of Acadia Unit 2 and a 50 percent
ownership interest in the facility’s common assets for approximately $300
million.  In a separate transaction, Cleco Power is acquiring Acadia
Unit 1 and the other 50 percent interest in the facility’s common
assets.  Upon closing the transaction, Cleco Power will serve as
operator for the entire facility.  Entergy Louisiana has committed to
sell one third of the output of Unit 2 to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana in
accordance with terms and conditions detailed under the existing Entergy System
Agreement.

Entergy
Louisiana's purchase is contingent upon, among other things, obtaining necessary
approvals, including full cost recovery, from various federal and state
regulatory and permitting agencies.  Closing is expected to occur in
late 2010 or early 2011.  Entergy Louisiana and Acadia Power Partners
also have entered into a purchased power agreement for 100 percent of the output
of Acadia Unit 2 that is expected to commence on May 1, 2010 and is set to
expire at the closing of the acquisition transaction.  Entergy
Louisiana has filed with the LPSC for approval of the transaction, and no party
filed an opposition to the purchase power agreement and it has been forwarded to
the LPSC for its review.  The parties have agreed to a procedural
schedule for the acquisition that would lead to LPSC consideration of the matter
at its January 2011 meeting and includes a hearing before the ALJ in September
2010.

Waterford 3 Steam Generator
Replacement Project

Entergy
Louisiana plans to replace the Waterford 3 steam generators, along with the
reactor vessel closure head and control element drive mechanisms, in
2011.  Replacement of these components is common to pressurized water
reactors throughout the nuclear industry.  The nuclear industry continues
to address susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking of certain materials
associated with these components within the reactor coolant system.  The
issue is applicable to Waterford 3 and is managed in accordance with standard
industry practices and guidelines.  Routine inspections of the steam
generators during Waterford 3's Fall 2006 refueling outage identified additional
degradation of certain tube spacer supports in the steam generators that
required repair beyond that anticipated prior to the outage.  Corrective
measures were successfully implemented to permit continued operation of the
steam generators.  While potential future replacement of these
components had been contemplated, additional steam generator tube and component
degradation necessitates replacement of


Entergy
Louisiana, LLC

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

the steam
generators as soon as reasonably achievable.  The earliest the new steam
generators can be manufactured and delivered for installation is
2011.  A mid-cycle outage performed in 2007 supports Entergy
Louisiana's 2011 replacement strategy.  The reactor vessel head and
control element drive mechanisms will be replaced at the same time, utilizing
the same reactor building construction opening that is necessary for the steam
generator replacement.

In June
2008, Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC for approval of the project,
including full cost recovery.  Following discovery and the filing of
testimony by the LPSC staff and an intervenor, the parties entered into a
stipulated settlement of the proceeding.  The LPSC unanimously
approved the settlement in November 2008.  The settlement resolved the
following issues: 1) the accelerated degradation of the steam generators is not
the result of any imprudence on the part of Entergy Louisiana; 2) the decision
to undertake the replacement project at the current estimated cost of $511
million is in the public interest, is prudent, and would serve the public
convenience and necessity; 3) the scope of the replacement project is in the
public interest; 4) undertaking the replacement project at the target
installation date during the 2011 refueling outage is in the public interest;
and 5) the jurisdictional costs determined to be prudent in a future prudence
review are eligible for cost recovery, either in an extention or renewal of the
formula rate plan or in a full base rate case including necessary proforma
adjustments.  Upon completion of the replacement project, the LPSC
will undertake a prudence review with regard to the following aspects of the
replacement project: 1) project management; 2) cost controls; 3) success in
achieving stated objectives; 4) the costs of the replacement project; and 5) the
outage length and replacement power costs.

In July 2009, the LPSC granted Entergy
Louisiana's motion to dismiss, without prejudice, its application seeking
recovery of cash earnings on construction work in progress (CWIP) for the steam
generator replacement project, acknowledging Entergy Louisiana's right, at any
time, to seek cash earnings on CWIP if Entergy Louisiana believes that
circumstances or projected circumstances are such that a request for cash
earnings on CWIP is merited.  The cash earnings on CWIP application
had been consolidated with a similar request for the Little Gypsy repowering
project, which was also dismissed in response to the same motion.

Entergy
Louisiana estimates that it will spend approximately $511 million on this
project, including $299 million over the 2010-2011 period.

Little Gypsy Repowering
Project

In April
2007, Entergy Louisiana announced that it intended to pursue the solid fuel
repowering of a 538 MW unit at its Little Gypsy plant, and Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana filed subsequently with the LPSC seeking certification to participate
in one-third of the project.  Petroleum coke and coal would be the unit's
primary fuel sources.  In July 2007, Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC
for approval of the repowering project.  In addition to seeking a
finding that the project is in the public interest, the filing with the LPSC
asked that Entergy Louisiana be allowed to recover a portion of the project's
financing costs during the construction period.

On March 11, 2009, the LPSC voted in
favor of a motion directing Entergy Louisiana to temporarily suspend the
repowering project and, based upon an analysis of the project's economic
viability, to make a recommendation regarding whether to proceed with the
project.  This action was based upon a number of factors including the
recent decline in natural gas prices, as well as environmental concerns, the
unknown costs of carbon legislation and changes in the capital/financial
markets.

On
April 1, 2009, Entergy Louisiana complied with the LPSC's directive and
recommended that the project be suspended for an extended period of time of
three years or more.  Entergy Louisiana estimated that its total costs
for the project, if suspended, including actual spending to date and estimated
contract cancellation costs, would be approximately $300
million.  Entergy Louisiana had obtained all major environmental
permits required to begin construction.  A longer-term suspension
places these permits at risk and may adversely affect the project's economics
and technological feasibility.  On May 22, 2009, the LPSC issued an
order declaring that Entergy Louisiana's decision to place the Little Gypsy
project into a longer-term suspension of three years or more is in the public
interest and prudent.  In October 2009, Entergy Louisiana made a
filing with the LPSC seeking permission to cancel the project and seeking
recovery over a five-year period of the project costs.  The parties to
the proceeding agreed to a procedural schedule that results in a hearing in
October 2010.  Entergy Louisiana currently estimates that its total
costs for the project, if canceled, will be approximately $215 million, of which
approximately $193 million was incurred through December 31, 2009.

New Nuclear
Development

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and
Entergy Louisiana provided public notice to the LPSC of their intention to make
a filing pursuant to the LPSC's general order that governs the development of
new nuclear generation in Louisiana.  The project option being
developed by the companies is for new nuclear generation at River
Bend.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana, together
with Entergy Mississippi, have been engaged in the development of options to
construct new nuclear generation at the River Bend and Grand Gulf
sites.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana are
leading the development at River Bend, and Entergy Mississippi is leading the
development at Grand Gulf.  This project is in the early stages, and
several issues remain to be addressed over time before significant additional
capital would be committed to this project.  In 2010, Entergy Gulf
States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana each paid for and will recognize on its
books $24.9 million in costs associated with the development of new nuclear
generation at the River Bend site; these costs previously had been recorded on
the books of Entergy New Nuclear Development, LLC, a System Energy
subsidiary.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana will
share costs going forward on a 50/50 basis, which reflects each company's
current participation level in the project.  In response to the
companies' previous notice, dated August 10, 2009, the LPSC opened a
docket.  A procedural schedule will be established after the companies
file the certification application referred to in the notice.

Sources
of Capital

Entergy Louisiana's sources to meet its
capital requirements include:

·

internally
      generated funds;

·

cash
      on hand;

·

debt
      or preferred membership interest issuances;
and

·

bank
      financing under new and existing
facilities.

Entergy Louisiana may refinance or
redeem debt and preferred membership interests prior to maturity, to the extent
market conditions and interest and distribution rates are
favorable.

All debt and common and preferred
membership interest issuances by Entergy Louisiana require prior regulatory
approval.  Preferred membership interest and debt issuances are also
subject to issuance tests set forth in corporate charters, bond indentures, and
other agreements.  Entergy Louisiana has sufficient capacity under
these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs.

Entergy
Louisiana's receivables from or (payables to) the money pool were as follows as
of December 31 for each of the following years:

See Note
4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool.

Entergy
Louisiana has a credit facility in the amount of $200 million scheduled to
expire in August 2012.  No borrowings were outstanding under the
credit facility as of December 31, 2009.

Entergy Louisiana obtained short-term
borrowing authorization from the FERC under which it may borrow through October
2011, up to the aggregate amount, at any one time outstanding, of $250
million.  See Note 4 to the financial statements for further
discussion of Entergy Louisiana's short-term borrowing
limits.  Entergy Louisiana has also obtained an order from the FERC
authorizing long-term securities issuances through July 2011.

Hurricane Gustav and
Hurricane Ike

In September 2008, Hurricane Gustav
(and, to a much lesser extent, Hurricane Ike) caused catastrophic damage to
Entergy Louisiana's service territory.  The storms resulted in
widespread power outages, significant damage to distribution, transmission, and
generation infrastructure, and the loss of sales during the power
outages.  On October 9, 2008, Entergy Louisiana drew all of its $134
million funded storm reserve.  On October 15, 2008, the LPSC approved
Entergy Louisiana's request to defer and accrue carrying costs on unrecovered
storm expenditures during the period the company seeks regulatory
recovery.  The approval was without prejudice to the ultimate
resolution of the total amount of prudently incurred storm costs or final
carrying costs rate.

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and
Entergy Louisiana filed their Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike storm cost
recovery case with the LPSC in May 2009.  In September 2009, Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana made a supplemental filing to, among
other things, recommend recovery of the costs and replenishment of the storm
reserves by Louisiana Act 55 (passed in 2007) financing.  Entergy Gulf
States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana recovered their costs from Hurricane
Katrina and Hurricane Rita primarily by Act 55 financing, as discussed
below.  On December 30, 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and
Entergy Louisiana entered into a stipulation agreement with the LPSC Staff that,
if approved, provides for total recoverable costs of approximately $234 million
for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and $394 million for Entergy
Louisiana.  Under this stipulation, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana
agrees not to recover $4.4 million and Entergy Louisiana agrees not to recover
$7.2 million of their storm restoration spending.  The stipulation
also permits replenishing Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's storm reserve in the
amount of $90 million and Entergy Louisiana's storm reserve in the amount of
$200 million when Act 55 financing is accomplished.  The parties to
the proceeding have agreed to a procedural schedule that includes March/April
2010 hearing dates for both the recoverability and the method of recovery
proceedings.

Hurricane Rita and Hurricane
Katrina

In August and September 2005, Hurricane
Katrina and Hurricane Rita, along with extensive flooding that resulted from
levee breaks in and around Entergy Louisiana's service territory, caused
catastrophic damage.  The storms and flooding resulted in widespread
power outages; significant damage to distribution, transmission, and generation
infrastructure; and the temporary loss of sales and customers due to mandatory
evacuations and destruction of homes and businesses due to wind, rain, and
extended periods of flooding.  Entergy pursued a broad range of
initiatives to recover storm restoration and business continuity costs and
incremental losses.  Initiatives included obtaining reimbursement of
certain costs covered by insurance and pursuing recovery through existing or new
rate mechanisms regulated by the FERC and local regulatory bodies, in
combination with securitization.

Insurance
Claims

Entergy
has received a total of $317 million as of December 31, 2009 on its Hurricane
Katrina and Hurricane Rita insurance claims, including the settlements of its
Hurricane Katrina claims with each of its two excess insurers.  Of the
$317 million received, $45 million was allocated to Entergy
Louisiana.  Entergy has substantially completed its insurance
recoveries related to Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita.

Storm
Cost Financings

In March 2008, Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and the Louisiana Utilities Restoration
Corporation (LURC), an instrumentality of the State of Louisiana, filed at the
LPSC an application requesting that the LPSC grant financing orders authorizing
the financing of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana storm
costs, storm reserves, and issuance costs pursuant to Act 55 of the Louisiana
Legislature (Act 55 financings).  The Act 55 financings are expected
to produce additional customer benefits as compared to Act 64 traditional
securitization.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana also
filed an application requesting LPSC approval for ancillary issues including the
mechanism to flow charges and savings to customers via a Storm Cost Offset
rider.  On April 3, 2008, the Louisiana State Bond Commission granted
preliminary approval for the Act 55 financings.  On April 8, 2008, the
Louisiana Public Facilities Authority (LPFA), which is the issuer of the bonds
pursuant to the Act 55 financings, approved requests for the Act 55

financings. 
On April 10, 2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana and the
LPSC Staff filed with the LPSC an uncontested stipulated settlement that
includes Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana's proposals under
the Act 55 financings, which includes a commitment to pass on to customers a
minimum of $10 million and $30 million of customer benefits, respectively,
through prospective annual rate reductions of $2 million and $6 million for five
years.  On April 16, 2008, the LPSC approved the settlement and issued
two financing orders and one ratemaking order intended to facilitate
implementation of the Act 55 financings.  In May 2008, the Louisiana State
Bond Commission granted final approval of the Act 55 financings.

On July 29, 2008, the LPFA issued
$687.7 million in bonds under the aforementioned Act 55.  From the
$679 million of bond proceeds loaned by the LPFA to the LURC, the LURC deposited
$152 million in a restricted escrow account as a storm damage reserve for
Entergy Louisiana and transferred $527 million directly to Entergy
Louisiana.  From the bond proceeds received by Entergy Louisiana from
the LURC, Entergy Louisiana invested $545 million, including $17.8 million that
was withdrawn from the restricted escrow account as approved by the April 16,
2008 LPSC orders, in exchange for 5,449,861.85 Class A preferred, non-voting,
membership interest units of Entergy Holdings Company LLC, a company
wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy, that carry a 10% annual distribution
rate.  Distributions are payable quarterly commencing on September 15,
2008 and have a liquidation price of $100 per unit.  The preferred
membership interests are callable at the option of Entergy Holdings Company LLC
after ten years under the terms of the LLC agreement.  The terms of
the membership interests include certain financial covenants to which Entergy
Holdings Company LLC is subject, including the requirement to maintain a net
worth of at least $1 billion.

Entergy Louisiana does not report the
bonds on its balance sheet because the bonds are the obligation of the LPFA, and
there is no recourse against Entergy Louisiana in the event of a bond
default.

State and Local Rate
Regulation

The rates that Entergy Louisiana
charges for its services significantly influence its financial position, results
of operations, and liquidity.  Entergy Louisiana is regulated and the
rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory
proceedings.  A governmental agency, the LPSC, is primarily
responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers.

Entergy Louisiana made a rate filing
with the LPSC requesting a base rate increase in January 2004.  In May
2005 the LPSC approved a settlement that included the adoption of a three-year
formula rate plan, the terms of which included an ROE mid-point of 10.25% for
the initial three-year term of the plan and permit Entergy Louisiana to recover
incremental capacity costs outside of a traditional base rate
proceeding.  Under the formula rate plan, over- and under-earnings
outside an allowed regulatory range of 9.45% to 11.05% will be allocated 60% to
customers and 40% to Entergy Louisiana.  The initial formula rate plan
filing was made in May 2006.  As discussed below the formula rate plan
has been extended, with return on common equity provisions consistent with
previously approved provisions, to cover the 2008, 2009, and 2010 test
years.

In October 2009 the LPSC approved a
settlement that resolves Entergy Louisiana's 2006 and 2007 test year
filings.  The settlement provides for a new formula rate plan for the
2008, 2009, and 2010 test years.  Entergy Louisiana is permitted,
effective with the November 2009 billing cycle, to reset its rates to achieve a
10.25% return on equity for the 2008 test year.  10.25% is the target
midpoint return on equity for the new formula rate plan, with an earnings
bandwidth of +/- 80 basis points (9.45% - 11.05%).  The rate reset, a
$2.5 million increase that includes a $16.3 million cost of service adjustment
less a $13.8 million net reduction for decreased capacity costs and a base rate
reclassification, was implemented for the November 2009 billing cycle, and the
rate reset will be subject to refund pending review of the 2008 test year filing
that was made on October 21, 2009.  The settlement does not allow
recovery through the formula rate plan of most of Entergy Louisiana's costs
associated with Entergy's stock option plan.  Pursuant to the
settlement Entergy Louisiana refunded to its customers $12.9 million, which
includes interest, in the November 2009 billing cycle.  The LPSC Staff
and one intervenor filed comments on the 2008 test year filing in January
2010.  Entergy Louisiana has until March 2010 to provide an initial
response to the proposed adjustments and discovery is
ongoing.  Entergy Louisiana will implement any agreed changes by March
15, 2010.  A procedural schedule to address any contested issues would
be set after March 15, 2010.


Entergy

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

In December 2009, Entergy Louisiana
filed an application seeking LPSC approval for a $10.3 million revenue
requirement to provide supplemental funding for the decommissioning trust
maintained for Waterford 3, in response to an NRC notification of a projected
shortfall of decommissioning funding assurance.  Currently, Entergy
Louisiana has $2.2 million in annual retail rates for decommissioning
funding.

In May 2008, Entergy Louisiana made its
formula rate plan filing with the LPSC for the 2007 test year, seeking an $18.4
million rate increase, comprised of $12.6 million of recovery of incremental and
deferred capacity costs and $5.8 million based on a cost of service revenue
deficiency related to continued lost contribution to fixed costs associated with
the loss of customers due to Hurricane Katrina.  In August 2008,
Entergy Louisiana implemented a $43.9 million formula rate plan decrease to
remove interim storm cost recovery and to reduce the storm damage
accrual.  Entergy Louisiana then implemented a $16.9 million formula
rate plan increase, subject to refund, effective the first billing cycle in
September 2008, comprised of $12.6 million of recovery of incremental and
deferred capacity costs and $4.3 million based on a cost of service
deficiency.

In May 2007, Entergy Louisiana made its
formula rate plan filing with the LPSC for the 2006 test year, indicating a 7.6%
earned return on common equity.  In September 2007, Entergy Louisiana
modified its formula rate plan filing to reflect its implementation of certain
adjustments proposed by the LPSC Staff in its review of Entergy Louisiana's
original filing with which Entergy Louisiana agreed, and to reflect its
implementation of an $18.4 million annual formula rate plan increase comprised
of (1) a $23.8 million increase representing 60% of Entergy Louisiana's revenue
deficiency, and (2) a $5.4 million decrease for reduced incremental and deferred
capacity costs.  In October 2007, Entergy Louisiana implemented a $7.1
million formula rate plan decrease that was due primarily to the
reclassification of certain franchise fees from base rates to collection via a
line item on customer bills pursuant to an LPSC Order.

In May 2006, Entergy Louisiana made its
formula rate plan filing with the LPSC for the 2005 test
year.  Entergy Louisiana modified the filing in August 2006 to reflect
a 9.45% return on equity which is within the allowed bandwidth.  The
modified filing includes an increase of $24.2 million for interim recovery of
storm costs from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and a $119.2 million rate increase
to recover LPSC-approved incremental deferred and ongoing capacity
costs.  The filing requested recovery of approximately $50 million for
the amortization of capacity deferrals over a three-year period, including
carrying charges, and approximately $70 million for ongoing capacity
costs.  The increase was implemented, subject to refund, with the
first billing cycle of September 2006.  Entergy Louisiana subsequently
updated its formula rate plan rider to reflect adjustments proposed by the LPSC
Staff with which it agrees.  The adjusted return on equity of 9.56%
remains within the allowed bandwidth.  Ongoing and deferred
incremental capacity costs were reduced to $118.7 million.  The
updated formula rate plan rider was implemented, subject to refund, with the
first billing cycle of October 2006.  An uncontested stipulated
settlement was filed in February 2008 that left the current base rates in place,
and the LPSC approved the settlement in March 2008.  In the settlement
Entergy Louisiana agreed to credit customers $7.2 million, plus $0.7 million of
interest, for customer contributions to the Central States Compact in Nebraska
that was never completed and agreed to a one-time $2.6 million deduction from
the deferred capacity cost balance.  The credit, for which Entergy
Louisiana had previously recorded a provision, was made in May
2008.

In
addition to rate proceedings, Entergy Louisiana's fuel costs recovered from
customers are subject to regulatory scrutiny.  This regulatory risk
represents Entergy Louisiana's largest potential exposure to price changes in
the commodity markets.

Entergy Louisiana's retail rate matters
and proceedings, including fuel cost recovery-related issues, are discussed
further in Note 2 to the financial statements.

Industrial and Commercial
Customers

Entergy Louisiana's large industrial
and commercial customers continually explore ways to reduce their energy
costs.  In particular, cogeneration is an option available to a
portion of Entergy Louisiana's industrial customer base.  Entergy
Louisiana responds by working with industrial and commercial customers and
negotiating electric service contracts to provide competitive rates that match
specific customer needs and load profiles.  Entergy Louisiana actively
participates in economic development, customer retention, and reclamation
activities to increase industrial and commercial demand, from both new and
existing customers.  Entergy Louisiana does not currently expect
additional significant losses to cogeneration because of the current economics
of the electricity markets and Entergy Louisiana's marketing efforts in
retaining industrial customers.

Nuclear
Matters

Entergy
Louisiana owns and operates, through an affiliate, the Waterford 3 nuclear power
plant.  Entergy Louisiana is, therefore, subject to the risks related
to owning and operating a nuclear plant.  These include risks from the
use, storage, handling and disposal of high-level and low-level radioactive
materials, regulatory requirement changes, including changes resulting from
events at other plants, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance
commercially available for losses in connection with nuclear operations, and
technological and financial uncertainties related to decommissioning nuclear
plants at the end of their licensed lives, including the sufficiency of funds in
decommissioning trusts.  In the event of an unanticipated early
shutdown of Waterford 3, Entergy Louisiana may be required to provide additional
funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for
decommissioning.

The
nuclear industry continues to address susceptibility to stress corrosion
cracking of certain materials associated with components within the reactor
coolant system.  The issue is applicable to Waterford 3 and is managed in
accordance with standard industry practices and guidelines.  As discussed
above in more detail, Entergy Louisiana plans to replace the Waterford 3 steam
generators, along with the reactor vessel closure head and control element drive
mechanisms, in 2011.


Entergy
Louisiana, LLC

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

Environmental
Risks

Entergy Louisiana's facilities and
operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having
jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and
hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental
matters.  Management believes that Entergy Louisiana is in substantial
compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities
and operations.  Because environmental regulations are subject to
change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated.

Critical Accounting
Estimates

The
preparation of Entergy Louisiana's financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply
appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can
have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations,
and cash flows.  Management has identified the following accounting
policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and
measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for
future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates
that would have a material effect on the presentation of Entergy Louisiana's
financial position or results of operations.

Nuclear
Decommissioning Costs

See "

Nuclear Decommissioning Costs

Critical
Accounting Estimates

" section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries
Management's Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the estimates inherent in
accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs.

Unbilled
Revenue

As
discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Entergy Louisiana records an
estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer
billing.  Each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are
recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month's estimate is
reversed.  The difference between the estimate of the unbilled
receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the
amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period.  The estimate
recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the
unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that
month.  Therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated
price and usage at the beginning and end of each period, in addition to changes
in certain components of the calculation.

Qualified
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Entergy
sponsors qualified defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all
employees.  Additionally, Entergy currently provides postretirement
health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees who
reach retirement age while still working for Entergy.  Entergy's
reported costs of providing these benefits, as described in Note 11 to the
financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions
of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial
calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms.  See the "

Critical
Accounting Estimates

" section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries
Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.  Because
of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these
obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy's estimate
of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.

Costs and
Funding

Total
qualified pension cost for Entergy Louisiana in 2009 was $6.2
million.  Entergy Louisiana anticipates 2010 qualified pension cost to
be $14.6 million. Entergy Louisiana contributed $7.6 million to its pension
plans in 2009 and anticipates funding approximately $27.1 million in 2010
although the required pension contributions will not be known with more
certainty until the January 1, 2010 valuations are completed by April 1,
2010.  Also, guidance pursuant to the Pension Protection Act of 2006
rules, effective for the 2008 plan year and beyond, continues to evolve, be
interpreted through technical corrections bills, and discussed within the
industry and by congressional lawmakers.  Any changes to the Pension
Protection Act as a result of these discussions and efforts may affect the level
of Entergy Louisiana’s pension contributions in the future.

Total
postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for Entergy
Louisiana in 2009 were $16.8 million, including $2.8 million in savings due to
the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies.  Entergy
Louisiana expects 2010 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit
costs to approximate $17.8 million, including $3.1 million in savings due to the
estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies.  Entergy
Louisiana expects to contribute approximately $9.9 million to its other
postretirement plans in 2010.

Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our
opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Entergy Louisiana, LLC as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have
also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission and our report dated February 24, 2010 expressed an
unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting.

ENTERGY
MISSISSIPPI, INC.

MANAGEMENT'S
FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Results of
Operations

Net
Income

2009 Compared to

Net income increased $17.9 million
primarily due to higher net revenue, partially offset by higher interest expense
and higher depreciation and amortization expenses.

2008 Compared to

Net income decreased $12.4 million
primarily due to higher other operation and maintenance expenses, lower other
income, and higher depreciation and amortization expenses, partially offset by
higher net revenue.

Net
Revenue

2009 Compared to

Net revenue consists of operating
revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale,
2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges
(credits).  Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue
comparing 2009 to 2008.

      net revenue

$533.9

The retail electric price variance is
primarily due to a formula rate plan increase effective July 2009 and an
increase in Attala power plant costs that are recovered through the power
management rider. The formula rate plan filing is discussed further in "

State and
Local Rate Regulation

" below. The net income effect of the Attala power
plant costs recovery is limited to a portion representing an allowed return on
equity with the remainder offset by Attala power plant costs in other operation
and maintenance expenses, depreciation expenses, and taxes other than income
taxes.

The net wholesale revenue variance is
primarily due to a change in a contract with a wholesale customer that increased
its monthly demand charge and an increased net balance on joint account sales as
a result of lower fuel prices in 2009.

The reserve equalization variance is
primarily due to increased reserve equalization revenue as a result of changes
in the Entergy System generation mix compared to the same period in
2008.

Gross
operating revenues, fuel and purchased power expenses, and other regulatory
charges (credits)

Gross operating revenues decreased
primarily due to a decrease of $254.6 million in fuel cost recovery revenues due
to lower fuel rates and decreased usage and a decrease of $52.1 million in gross
wholesale revenues


Entergy
Mississippi, Inc.

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

primarily
due to a decrease in volume as a result of less energy available for resale
sales, partially offset by an increase of $20.4 million in power management
rider revenue.

Fuel and purchased power expenses
decreased primarily due to decreases in the average market prices of natural gas
and purchased power.

Other regulatory charges (credits)
decreased primarily due to decreased recovery of costs associated with the power
management recovery rider and decreased recovery through the Grand Gulf Rider of
Grand Gulf capacity costs due to lower rates and decreased usage. There is no
material effect on net income due to quarterly adjustments to the power
management recovery rider and annual adjustments to the Grand Gulf rider. See
Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information regarding the
power management recovery rider and the Grand Gulf Rider.

2008 Compared to

Net revenue consists of operating
revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale,
2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory
charges.  Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue
comparing 2008 to 2007.

The Attala costs variance is primarily
due to an increase in the Attala power plant costs that are recovered through
the power management rider.  The net income effect of this recovery in
limited to a portion representing an allowed return on equity with the remainder
offset by Attala power plant costs in other operation and maintenance expenses,
depreciation expenses, and taxes other than income taxes.

The rider revenue variance is the
result of a storm damage rider that became effective in October 2007. The
establishment of this rider results in an increase in rider revenue and a
corresponding increase in other operation and maintenance expense for the storm
reserve with no effect on net income.

The base revenue variance is primarily
due to a formula rate plan increase effective July 2007.  The formula
rate plan filing is discussed further in "

State and
Local Rate Regulation

" below.

The reserve equalization variance is
primarily due to changes in the Entergy System generation mix compared to the
same period in 2007.

The net wholesale revenue variance is
primarily due to lower profit on joint account sales and reduced capacity
revenue from the Municipal Energy Agency of Mississippi.

Gross
operating revenues, fuel and purchased power expenses, and other regulatory
charges

Gross operating revenues increased
primarily due to an increase of $152.5 million in fuel cost recovery revenues
due to higher fuel rates, partially offset by a decrease of $43 million in gross
wholesale revenues due to a decrease in net generation and purchases in excess
of decreased net area demand resulting in less energy available for resale sales
coupled with a decrease in system agreement remedy receipts.


Entergy
Mississippi, Inc.

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

Fuel and purchased power expenses
increased primarily due to increases in the average market prices of natural gas
and purchased power, partially offset by decreased demand and decreased recovery
from customers of deferred fuel costs.

Other regulatory charges increased
primarily due to increased recovery through the Grand Gulf rider of Grand Gulf
capacity costs due to higher rates and increased recovery of costs associated
with the power management recovery rider. There is no material effect on net
income due to quarterly adjustments to the power management recovery rider. See
Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information regarding the
power management recovery rider and the Grand Gulf Rider.

Other
Income Statement Variances

2009 Compared to

Depreciation and amortization expenses
increased primarily due to an increase in plant in service.

Other income increased primarily due to
the gain recorded in 2009 on the sale of utility property, offset by a potential
buyer's forfeiture of a $1.7 million deposit in June 2008 for an option to
purchase non-utility property.

Interest expense increased primarily
due to the issuance of $150 million of 6.64% Series first mortgage bonds in June
2009.

2008 Compared to

Other operation and maintenance
expenses increased primarily due to:

·

an
      increase of $8.6 million in loss reserves in 2008 compared to 2007,
      including the effect of the storm damage rider implemented in October
      2007;

·

an
      increase of $3.5 million in fossil plant expenses due to increased
      outages, higher plant maintenance costs, and environmental
      costs;

·

an
      increase of $2.8 million in distribution expenses due primarily to the
      timing of contract work and lower reimbursements;
  and

·

an
      increase of $1.4 million in legal spending due to increased regulatory
      activity.

The
increase was partially offset by a decrease of $5.9 million in payroll,
payroll-related, and benefit costs.

Depreciation and amortization expenses
increased primarily due to an increase in plant in service.

Other income decreased primarily due to
decreased interest earned on money pool investments and the gain recorded in
2007 on the sale of non-utility property.

Income
Taxes

The effective income tax rates for
2009, 2008, and 2007 were 35.3%, 35.8%, and 33.2%, respectively.  See
Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory
rate of 35.0% to the effective income tax rate.

Operating
Activities

Cash flow provided by operating
activities increased $142 million in 2009 primarily due to increased recovery of
deferred fuel costs and a decrease of $5.9 million in pension contributions,
offset by an increase of $22.4 million in income tax payments.

Cash flow provided by operating
activities decreased $89.2 million in 2008 primarily due to:

·

decreased
      recovery of deferred fuel and purchased power
  costs;

·

the
      receipt of $48 million of securitization proceeds in
  2007;

·

the
      timing of collections of receivables from customers and payments to
      vendors; and

·

an
      increase of $10.9 million in pension
  contributions.

The
decrease was partially offset by a decrease in income tax payments.

Investing
Activities

Cash flow used in investing activities
increased $26.2 million in 2009 primarily due to money pool activity, offset by
decreased construction expenditures related to various fossil and distribution
projects.

Increases in Entergy Mississippi's
receivable from the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Mississippi's
receivable from the money pool increased by $31.4 million in
2009.  The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement
designed to reduce Entergy's subsidiaries' need for external short-term
borrowings.

Cash flow used in investing activities
increased $64.4 million in 2008 primarily due to the receipt of proceeds in 2007
from funds held in trust in 2006 that were used for the redemption in January
2007, prior to maturity, of $100 million of 4.35% Series First Mortgage
Bonds, partially offset by the transfer in 2007 of $30.7 million to the storm
damage reserve escrow account and money pool activity.

Decreases in Entergy Mississippi's
receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy
Mississippi's receivable from the money pool decreased by $21 million in
2008.

Financing
Activities

Cash flow
provided by financing activities increased $14 million in 2009 primarily due to
the issuance of $150 million of 6.64% Series first mortgage bonds in June 2009,
offset by money pool activity.

Decreases in Entergy Mississippi's
payable to the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Mississippi's
payable to the money pool decreased by $66 million in 2009.

Entergy
Mississippi's financing activities provided $13.8 million in cash flow in 2008
compared to using $133.1 million in cash flow in 2007 primarily due to the
redemption, prior to maturity, of $100 million of 4.35% Series First Mortgage
Bonds in January 2007 and money pool activity, partially offset by an increase
of $18 million in common stock dividends paid.

Increases
in Entergy Mississippi's payable to the money pool are a source of cash flow,
and Entergy Mississippi's payable to the money pool increased by $66 million in
2008.

See Note 5 to the financial statements
for details on long-term debt.

Capital
Structure

Entergy
Mississippi's capitalization is balanced between equity and debt, as shown in
the following table. The increase in the debt to capital ratio is due to the

      customer growth.

(2)

Includes
      estimated interest payments.  Long-term debt is discussed in
      Note 5 to the financial statements.

(3)

Purchase
      obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation
      charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or
      services.  For Entergy Mississippi, almost all of the total
      consists of unconditional fuel and purchased power obligations, including
      its obligations under the Unit Power Sales Agreement, which is discussed
      in Note 8 to the financial
statements.

In
addition to the contractual obligations given above, Entergy Mississippi
currently expects to contribute approximately $17.8 million to its pension plans
and approximately $5 million to other postretirement plans in 2010; although the
required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the
January 1, 2010 valuations are completed by April 1, 2010.  Also,
guidance pursuant to the Pension Protection Act of 2006 rules, effective for the
2008 plan year and beyond, continues to evolve, be interpreted through technical
corrections bills, and discussed within the industry and by congressional
lawmakers.  Any changes to the Pension Protection Act as a result of
these discussions and efforts may affect the level of Entergy Mississippi's
pension contributions in the future.

Also, in addition to the
contractual obligations, Entergy Mississippi has $8 million of unrecognized tax
benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes for which the timing of
payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in
the timing of effective settlement of tax positions.  See Note 3 to
the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax
benefits.

The planned capital investment estimate
for Entergy Mississippi reflects capital required to support existing business
and customer growth.  Entergy's Utility supply plan initiative will
continue to seek to transform its generation portfolio with new or repowered
generation resources.  Opportunities resulting from the supply plan
initiative, including new projects or the exploration of alternative financing
sources, could result in increases or decreases in the capital expenditure
estimates given above.  The estimated capital expenditures are subject
to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of
regulatory constraints, environmental compliance, market volatility, economic
trends, and the ability to access capital.  Management provides more
information on long-term debt and preferred stock maturities in Notes 5 and 6 to
the financial statements.

As a wholly-owned subsidiary, Entergy
Mississippi dividends its earnings to Entergy Corporation at a percentage
determined monthly.  Entergy Mississippi's long-term debt indentures
restrict the amount of retained earnings available for the payment of cash
dividends or other distributions on its common and preferred
stock.  As of December 31, 2009, Entergy Mississippi had restricted
retained earnings unavailable for distribution to Entergy Corporation of $236
million.

New Nuclear
Development

Pursuant to the Mississippi Baseload
Act and the Mississippi Public Utilities Act, Entergy Mississippi is developing
a project option for new nuclear generation at Grand Gulf Nuclear
Station.  Entergy Mississippi, together with Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana, has been engaged in the development of options
to construct new nuclear generation at the Grand Gulf and River Bend Station
sites.  Entergy Mississippi is leading the development at Grand Gulf,
and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana are leading the
development at River Bend.  This project is in the early stages, and
several issues remain to be addressed over time before significant additional
capital would be committed to this project.  In 2010, Entergy
Mississippi paid for and has recognized on its books $49.5 million in costs
associated with the development of new nuclear generation at Grand Gulf; these
costs previously had been recorded on the books of Entergy New Nuclear
Development, LLC, a System Energy subsidiary.

Sources
of Capital

Entergy Mississippi's sources to meet
its capital requirements include:

·

internally
      generated funds;

·

cash
      on hand;

·

debt
      or preferred stock issuances; and

·

bank
      financing under new or existing
facilities.

Entergy Mississippi may refinance or
redeem debt and preferred stock prior to maturity, to the extent market
conditions and interest and dividend rates are favorable.

All debt and common and preferred stock
issuances by Entergy Mississippi require prior regulatory
approval.  Preferred stock and debt issuances are also subject to
issuance tests set forth in its corporate charter, bond indenture, and other
agreements.  Entergy Mississippi has sufficient capacity under these
tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs.

In May and June 2009, Entergy
Mississippi renewed its two separate credit facilities through May 2010. In
August 2009, Entergy Mississippi increased its borrowing capacity with a third
line of credit which will also expire in May 2010, increasing the borrowing
limits to the aggregate amount of $70 million.  No borrowings were
outstanding under the credit facilities as of December 31, 2009.

Entergy Mississippi's receivables from
or (payables to) the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of
the following years:

In May
2007, $6.6 million of Entergy Mississippi's receivable from the money pool was
replaced by a note receivable from Entergy New Orleans.  See Note 4 to
the financial statements for a description of the money pool.

Entergy
Mississippi has obtained short-term borrowing authorization from the FERC under
which it may borrow through October 2011, up to the aggregate amount, at any one
time outstanding, of $175 million.  See Note 4 to the financial
statements for further discussion of Entergy Mississippi's short-term borrowing
limits.  Entergy Mississippi has also obtained an order from the FERC
authorizing long-term securities issuances through July 2011.


Entergy
Mississippi, Inc.

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

State and Local Rate
Regulation

The rates that Entergy Mississippi
charges for electricity significantly influence its financial position, results
of operations, and liquidity.  Entergy Mississippi is regulated and
the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory
proceedings.  A governmental agency, the MPSC, is primarily
responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers.

Formula
Rate Plan

In September 2009, Entergy Mississippi
filed proposed modifications to its formula rate plan rider.  The
proposed modifications include: (1) resetting Entergy Mississippi's return on
common equity to the middle of the formula rate plan bandwidth each year and
eliminating the 50/50 sharing in the current plan, (2) replacing the current
rate change limit of two percent of revenues subject to a $14.5 million revenue
adjustment cap with a proposed limit of four percent of revenues, (3)
implementing a projected test year for the annual filing and subsequent
look-back for the prior year, and (4) modifying the performance measurement
process.

In March 2009, Entergy Mississippi made
with the MPSC its annual scheduled formula rate plan filing for the 2008 test
year.  The filing reported a $27.0 million revenue deficiency and an earned
return on common equity of 7.41%.  Entergy Mississippi requested a
$14.5 million increase in annual electric revenues, which is the maximum
increase allowed under the terms of the formula rate plan.  The MPSC
issued an order on June 30, 2009, finding that Entergy Mississippi's earned
return was sufficiently below the lower bandwidth limit set by the formula rate
plan to require a $14.5 million increase in annual revenues, effective for bills
rendered on or after June 30, 2009.

In March 2008, Entergy Mississippi made
its annual scheduled formula rate plan filing for the 2007 test year with the
MPSC.  The filing showed that a $10.1 million increase in annual
electric revenues is warranted.  In June 2008, Entergy
Mississippi reached a settlement with the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff
that would result in a $3.8 million rate increase.  In January
2009 the MPSC rejected the settlement and left the current rates in
effect.  Entergy Mississippi appealed the MPSC's decision to the
Mississippi Supreme Court.  After the decision of the MPSC regarding
the formula rate plan filing for the 2008 test year, Entergy Mississippi filed a
motion to dismiss its appeal to the Mississippi Supreme Court.

In March 2007, Entergy Mississippi made
its annual scheduled formula rate plan filing for the 2006 test year with the
MPSC.  The filing showed that an increase of $12.9 million in
annual electric revenues is warranted.  In June 2007 the MPSC approved
a joint stipulation between Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public
Utilities staff that provides for a $10.5 million rate increase, which was
effective beginning with July 2007 billings.

Fuel
and Purchased Power Cost Recovery

Entergy Mississippi's rate schedules
include an energy cost recovery rider that is adjusted quarterly to reflect
accumulated over- or under-recoveries from the second prior
quarter.

In July 2008 the MPSC began a
proceeding to investigate the fuel procurement practices and fuel adjustment
schedules of the Mississippi utility companies, including Entergy
Mississippi.  A two-day public hearing was held in July 2008, and
after a recess during which the MPSC reviewed information, the hearing resumed
on August 5, 2008, for additional testimony by an expert witness retained by the
MPSC.  The MPSC's witness presented testimony regarding a review of
the utilities' fuel adjustment clauses.  The MPSC stated that the goal
of the proceeding is fact-finding so that the MPSC may decide whether to amend
the current fuel cost recovery process.  In February 2009 the MPSC
published a final report of its expert witness, which discussed Entergy
Mississippi's fuel procurement activities and made recommendations regarding
fuel recovery practices in Mississippi.

In addition, in October 2008 the MPSC
issued an order directing Entergy Mississippi and Entergy Services to provide
documents associated with fuel adjustment clause litigation in Louisiana
involving Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans, and in January 2009 issued
an order requiring Entergy Mississippi to provide additional information related
to the long-term Evangeline gas contract that had been an issue in the fuel
adjustment clause litigation in Louisiana.  Entergy Mississippi and
Entergy Services filed a response


Entergy

Financial Discussion and Analysis

to the
MPSC order stating that gas from the Evangeline gas contract had been sold into
the Entergy System exchange and had an effect on the costs paid by Entergy
Mississippi's customers.  The MPSC's investigation is
ongoing.

In August 2009 the MPSC retained an
independent audit firm to audit Entergy Mississippi's fuel adjustment clause
submittals for the period October 2007 through September 2009.  The
independent audit firm submitted its report to the MPSC in December
2009.  The report does not recommend that any costs be disallowed for
recovery.  The report did suggest that some costs, less than one
percent of the fuel and purchased power costs recovered during the period, may
have been more reasonably charged to customers through base rates rather than
through fuel charges, but the report did not suggest that customers should not
have paid for those costs.  In November 2009 the MPSC also retained
another firm to review processes and practices related to fuel and purchased
energy.  The results of that review are due to the MPSC in March
2010.

In January 2010 the MPSC issued an
order certifying to the Mississippi Legislature the independent audit report and
the Public Utilities Staff's annual fuel audit report for the years ended
September 30, 2008 and 2009, which did not find any imprudent
costs.  The order stated that the MPSC will open a rulemaking docket
to address certain policy issues regarding allowable fuel adjustment costs, fuel
adjustment mechanisms, and related matters.

Mississippi
Attorney General Complaint

The Mississippi attorney general filed
a complaint in state court in December 2008 against Entergy Corporation, Entergy
Mississippi, Entergy Services, and Entergy Power alleging, among other things,
violations of Mississippi statutes, fraud, and breach of good faith and fair
dealing, and requesting an accounting and restitution.  The litigation
is wide ranging and relates to tariffs and procedures under which Entergy
Mississippi purchases power not generated in Mississippi to meet electricity
demand.  Entergy believes the complaint is unfounded.  On
December 29, 2008, the defendant Entergy companies filed to remove the attorney
general's suit to U.S. District Court (the forum that Entergy believes is
appropriate to resolve the types of federal issues raised in the suit), where it
is currently pending, and additionally answered the complaint and filed a
counter-claim for relief based upon the Mississippi Public Utilities Act and the
Federal Power Act.  The Mississippi attorney general has filed a
pleading seeking to remand the matter to state court.  In May 2009,
the defendant Entergy companies filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings
asserting grounds of federal preemption, the exclusive jurisdiction of the MPSC,
and factual errors in the attorney general's complaint.

Critical Accounting
Estimates

The
preparation of Entergy Mississippi's financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply
appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can
have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations,
and cash flows.  Management has identified the following accounting
policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and
measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and there is the
potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could
produce estimates that would have a material impact on the presentation of
Entergy Mississippi's financial position or results of operations.


Entergy
Mississippi, Inc.

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

Unbilled
Revenue

As
discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Entergy Mississippi records an
estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer
billing.  Each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are
recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month's estimate is
reversed.  The difference between the estimate of the unbilled
receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the
amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period.  The estimate
recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the
unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that
month.  Therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated
price and usage at the beginning and end of each period, in addition to changes
in certain components of the calculation.

Qualified
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Entergy
sponsors qualified defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all
employees.  Additionally, Entergy currently provides postretirement
health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees who
reach retirement age while still working for Entergy.  Entergy's
reported costs of providing these benefits, as described in Note 11 to the
financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions
of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial
calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms.  See the "

Critical
Accounting Estimates

" section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries
Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.  Because
of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these
obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy's estimate
of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.

Costs and
Funding

Total
qualified pension cost for Entergy Mississippi in 2009 was $3.4
million.  Entergy Mississippi anticipates 2010 qualified pension cost
to be $7.3 million.  Entergy Mississippi contributed $5.8 million to
its qualified pension plans in 2009 and anticipates that it will contribute
approximately $17.8 million in 2010 although the required pension contributions
will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2010 valuations are
completed by April 1, 2010.  Also, guidance pursuant to the Pension
Protection Act of 2006 rules, effective for the 2008 plan year and beyond,
continues to evolve, be interpreted through technical corrections bills, and
discussed within the industry and by congressional lawmakers.  Any
changes to the Pension Protection Act as a result of these discussions and
efforts may affect the level of Entergy Mississippi's pension contributions in
the future.

Total
postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for Entergy
Mississippi in 2009 were $6.5 million, including $1.6 million in savings due to
the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies.  Entergy
Mississippi expects 2010 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit
costs to approximate $5.0 million, including $1.6 million in savings due to the
estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies.  Entergy
Mississippi expects to contribute approximately $5 million to its other
postretirement plans in 2010.

MANAGEMENT'S
FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Results of
Operations

Net
Income

2009 Compared to

Net income decreased $3.9 million
primarily due to lower net revenue and lower other income, partially offset by
lower interest expense and a lower effective income tax rate.

2008 Compared to

Net income increased $10.4 million
primarily due to higher net revenue, lower other operation and maintenance
expenses, partially offset by lower other income and higher taxes other than
income taxes.

Net
Revenue

2009 Compared to

Net revenue consists of operating
revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale,
2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory
charges.  Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue
comparing 2009 to 2008.

The effect of rate case settlement
variance results from the April 2009 settlement of Entergy New Orleans’ rate
case, and includes the effects of realigning non-fuel costs associated with the
operation of Grand Gulf from the fuel adjustment clause to electric base rates
effective June 2009.  See Note 2 to the financial statements for
further discussion of the rate case settlement.

The price applied to unbilled sales
variance results from a decline in natural gas and purchased power
prices.

The volume/weather variance is
primarily due to an increase in electricity usage in the service territory, and
more favorable weather in 2009 compared to the same period in
2008.  Entergy New Orleans estimates that approximately 150,000
electric customers and 96,000 gas customers have returned since Hurricane
Katrina and are taking service as of December 31, 2009, compared to
approximately 141,000 electric customers and 93,000 gas customers as of December
31, 2008.  Billed retail electricity usage increased a total of 238
GWh compared to the same period in 2008, an increase of 5.3%.


Entergy
New Orleans, Inc.

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

Gross
operating revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses

Gross operating revenues decreased
primarily due to:

·

a
      decrease of $107.5 million in electric fuel cost recovery revenues due to
      lower fuel rates offset by higher electricity
  usage;

·

a
      decrease of $74.8 million in gross wholesale revenue due to a decrease in
      the average price of energy available for resale sales;
  and

·

a
      decrease of $37 million in gross gas revenues primarily due to lower fuel
      cost recovery revenues.

Fuel and purchased power expenses
decreased primarily due to decreases in the average market prices of natural gas
and purchased power, partially offset by an increase in demand.

2008 Compared to

Net revenue consists of operating
revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale,
2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory
charges.  Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue

      net revenue

$252.7

The volume/weather variance is due to
an increase in electricity usage in the service territory in 2008 compared to
the same period in 2007.  Entergy New Orleans estimates that
approximately 141,000 electric customers and 93,000 gas customers have returned
since Hurricane Katrina and are taking service as of December 31, 2008, compared
to approximately 132,000 electric customers and 86,000 gas customers as of
December 31, 2007.  Billed retail electricity usage increased a total
of 184 GWh compared to the same period in 2007, an increase of 4%.

The net gas revenue variance is
primarily due to an increase in base rates in March and November
2007.  Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of
the base rate increase.

The rider revenue variance is due
primarily to higher total revenue and a storm reserve rider effective March 2007
as a result of the City Council's approval of a settlement agreement in October
2006.  The approved storm reserve has been set to collect $75 million
over a ten-year period through the rider and the funds will be held in a
restricted escrow account.  The settlement agreement is discussed in
Note 2 to the financial statements.

The base revenue variance is primarily
due to a base rate recovery credit, effective January 2008.  The base
rate credit is discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements.

Gross
operating revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses

Gross operating revenues increased
primarily due to:

·

an
      increase of  $58.9 million in gross wholesale revenue due to
      increased sales to affiliated customers and an increase in the average
      price of energy available for resale
sales;

·

an
      increase of $47.7 million in electric fuel cost recovery revenues due to
      higher fuel rates and increased electricity usage;
  and


Entergy
New Orleans, Inc.

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

·

an
      increase of $22 million in gross gas revenues due to higher fuel recovery
      revenues and increases in gas base rates in March 2007 and November
      2007.

Fuel and purchased power expenses
increased primarily due to increases in the average market prices of natural gas
and purchased power in addition to an increase in demand.

Other
Income Statement Variances

2009 Compared to

Other
income decreased primarily due to a decrease in the interest rate earned on
money pool investments.

Interest
and other charges decreased primarily due to a decrease in the interest rate on
notes payable issued to affiliates as part of Entergy New Orleans' plan of
reorganization, as described more fully in Note 18 to the financial
statements.

2008 Compared to

Other
operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to:

·

a
      provision for storm-related bad debts of $11 million recorded in
      2007;

·

a
      decrease of $6.2 million in legal and professional
  fees;

·

a
      decrease of $3.4 million in employee benefit expenses;
  and

·

a
      decrease of $1.9 million in gas operations spending due to higher labor
      and material costs for reliability work in
2007.

The
decrease was partially offset by:

·

an
      increase of $3 million due to the accrual of  Energy Efficiency
      and Economic Development Funds;

·

an
      increase of  $3 million in outside regulatory consultant fees;
      and

·

an
      increase of $2.7 million in loss reserves primarily due to the
      implementation of the storm reserve rider in March 2007.  The
      storm reserve rider is discussed above under "

Net
      Revenue

."

Taxes
other than income taxes increased primarily due to higher franchise taxes in
2008 as a result of higher revenues.

Other
income decreased due to a reduction in the allowance for equity funds used
during construction related to a decrease in storm-related construction and
lower carrying costs due to the reduction of the Hurricane Katrina storm costs
regulatory asset.

Income
Taxes

The effective income tax rates for
2009, 2008, and 2007 were 33.6%, 39.7%, and 35.5%, respectively.  See
Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory
rate of 35% to the effective income tax rate.

Hurricane
Katrina

In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina
caused catastrophic damage to Entergy New Orleans' service territory, including
the effect of extensive flooding that resulted from levee breaks in and around
the New Orleans area.  The storms and flooding resulted in power
outages; significant damage to electric distribution, transmission, and
generation and gas infrastructure; and the loss of sales and customers due to
mandatory evacuations and the destruction of homes and
businesses.  Entergy pursued a broad range of initiatives to recover
storm restoration and business continuity costs.  Initiatives included
obtaining reimbursement of certain costs covered by insurance, obtaining
assistance through federal legislation for damage caused by Hurricanes Katrina
and Rita, and pursuing recovery through existing or new rate mechanisms
regulated by the FERC and the City Council.


Entergy
New Orleans, Inc.

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

Community
Development Block Grant (CDBG)

In December 2005, the U.S. Congress
passed the Katrina Relief Bill, a hurricane aid package that included CDBG
funding (for the states affected by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma) that
allowed state and local leaders to fund individual recovery
priorities.  In March 2007, the City Council certified that Entergy
New Orleans incurred $205 million in storm-related costs through December 2006
that are eligible for CDBG funding under the state action plan, and certified
Entergy New Orleans' estimated costs of $465 million for its gas system rebuild
(which is discussed below).  Entergy New Orleans received $180.8
million of CDBG funds in 2007.

Insurance
Claims

Entergy has received a total of $317
million as of December 31, 2009 on its Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita
insurance claims, including the settlements of its Hurricane Katrina claims with
each of its two excess insurers.  Of the $317 million received, $206
million was allocated to Entergy New Orleans.  Entergy has
substantially completed its insurance recoveries related to Hurricane Katrina
and Hurricane Rita.

Rate
and Storm-related Riders Filings

See "

Formula Rate Plans and Storm-related
Riders

" below for a discussion of Entergy New Orleans' June 2006 formula
rate plan filings and request to implement two storm-related riders filed with
the City Council.

Gas
System Rebuild

In
addition to the Hurricane Katrina storm restoration costs that Entergy New
Orleans incurred, Entergy New Orleans expects that over a longer term rebuilding
of the gas system in New Orleans will be necessary due to the massive salt water
intrusion into the system caused by the flooding in New Orleans.  The
salt water intrusion is expected to shorten the life of the gas system, making
it necessary to rebuild portions of that system over time, earlier than
otherwise would be expected.  Entergy New Orleans currently expects
the cost to rebuild the gas system to be $465 million, with the project
extending many years into the future.  Entergy New Orleans received
insurance proceeds for future construction expenditures associated with
rebuilding its gas system, and the October 2006 City Council resolution
approving the settlement of Entergy New Orleans' rate and storm-cost recovery
filings requires Entergy New Orleans to record those proceeds in a designated
sub-account of other deferred credits until the proceeds are spent on the
rebuild project.  This other deferred credit is shown as "Gas system
rebuild insurance proceeds" on Entergy New Orleans' balance sheet.

Bankruptcy
Proceedings

As a result of the effects of Hurricane
Katrina and the effect of extensive flooding that resulted from levee breaks in
and around the New Orleans area, on September 23, 2005, Entergy New Orleans
filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy court seeking reorganization relief
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  On May 7, 2007, the
bankruptcy judge entered an order confirming Entergy New Orleans' plan of
reorganization.  With the receipt of CDBG funds, and the agreement on
insurance recovery with one of its excess insurers, Entergy New Orleans waived
the conditions precedent in its plan of reorganization, and the plan became
effective on May 8, 2007.  Following are significant terms in Entergy
New Orleans' plan of reorganization:

·

Entergy
      New Orleans paid in full, in cash, the allowed third-party prepetition
      accounts payable (approximately $29 million, including
      interest).  Entergy New Orleans paid interest from September 23,
      2005 at the Louisiana judicial rate of interest for 2005 (6%) and 2006
      (8%), and at the Louisiana judicial rate of interest (9.5%) plus 1% for
      2007 through the date of payment.

·

Entergy
      New Orleans issued notes due in three years in satisfaction of its
      affiliate prepetition accounts payable (approximately $74 million,
      including interest), including its indebtedness to the Entergy System
      money pool.  Entergy New Orleans included in the principal
      amount of the notes accrued interest from September 23, 2005 at the
      Louisiana judicial rate of interest for 2005 (6%) and 2006 (8%), and at
      the Louisiana judicial rate of interest plus 1% for 2007 through the date
      of issuance of the notes.  Entergy New Orleans will pay interest
      on the notes from their date of issuance at the Louisiana judicial rate of
      interest plus 1%.  The Louisiana judicial rate of interest is
      9.5% for 2007, 8.5% for 2008, 5.5% for 2009, and 3.5% for
      2010.

Entergy
      New Orleans repaid in full, in cash, the outstanding borrowings under the
      debtor-in-possession credit agreement between Entergy New Orleans and
      Entergy Corporation (approximately $67
million).

·

Entergy
      New Orleans' first mortgage bonds remain outstanding with their stated
      maturity dates and interest terms.  Pursuant to an agreement
      with its first mortgage bondholders, Entergy New Orleans paid the first
      mortgage bondholders an amount equal to the one year of interest from the
      bankruptcy petition date that the bondholders had waived previously in the
      bankruptcy proceeding (approximately $12
  million).

·

Entergy
      New Orleans' preferred stock remains outstanding on its stated dividend
      terms, and Entergy New Orleans paid its unpaid preferred dividends in
      arrears (approximately $1 million).

·

Litigation
      claims were generally unaltered, and are generally proceeding as if
      Entergy New Orleans had not filed for bankruptcy protection, with
      exceptions for certain claims.

Liquidity and Capital

Debtor-in-Possession
Credit Facility

On
September 26, 2005, Entergy New Orleans, as borrower, and Entergy Corporation,
as lender, entered into a debtor-in-possession credit facility to provide
funding to Entergy New Orleans during its business restoration
efforts.  The credit facility provided for up to $200 million in
loans.  The interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility was
the average interest rate of borrowings outstanding under Entergy Corporation's
revolving credit facility.  With the confirmation of Entergy New
Orleans' plan of reorganization in May 2007, Entergy New Orleans repaid to
Entergy Corporation, in full, in cash, the $67 million of outstanding borrowings
under the debtor-in-possession credit facility.

Operating
Activities

Net cash
provided by operating activities increased $61.4 million in 2009 primarily due
to:

·

the
      timing of collection of receivables from
  customers;

·

income
      tax refunds of $22.1 million in 2009 compared to income tax payments of
      $5.8 million in 2008; and

·

increased
      recovery of deferred fuel costs.

The
increase was partially offset by the timing of payments to vendors.

Net cash
provided by operating activities decreased $120.2 million in 2008 primarily due
to the receipt of $180.8 million of CBDG funds in 2007.  This decrease
was partially offset by a decrease of $43.6 million in pension contributions and
the timing of payments to vendors.

Financial Discussion and Analysis

Investing
Activities

Net cash used in investing activities
increased $50.1 million in 2009 primarily due to a decrease in Hurricane Katrina
insurance proceeds received in 2009 as compared to 2008, partially offset by
storm restoration spending in 2008 related to Hurricane Gustav.

Net cash used in investing activities
decreased $68.7 million in 2008 primarily due to an increase in Hurricane
Katrina insurance proceeds in 2008 as compared to 2007 and money pool activity,
partially offset by proceeds of $10 million related to the sale of a power plant
in 2007.

Increases in Entergy New Orleans'
receivable from the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy New Orleans'
receivable from the money pool increased by $12.4 million in
2008.  The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement
designed to reduce Entergy's subsidiaries' need for external short-term
borrowings.

Financing
Activities

Net cash used in financing activities
increased $3.0 million primarily due to $32.9 million of dividends paid on
common stock in 2009, partially offset by the redemption, at maturity, of $30
million of 3.875% Series First Mortgage Bonds in August 2008.

Net cash used in financing activities
decreased $22.1 million primarily due to the repayment of Entergy New Orleans'
borrowings under the debtor-in-possession credit facility in 2007, partially
offset by the redemption, at maturity, of $30 million of 3.875% Series First
Mortgage Bonds in August 2008.

Purchase
      obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation

      consists of unconditional fuel and purchased power obligations, including
      its obligations under the Unit Power Sales Agreement, which is discussed
      in Note 8 to the financial
statements.

In
addition to the contractual obligations given above, Entergy New Orleans expects
to make payments of approximately $59 million for the years 2010-2012 related to
Hurricane Katrina restoration work and its gas rebuild project, of which $34
million is expected to be incurred in 2010.  Also, Entergy New Orleans
expects to contribute approximately $5.1 million to its pension plan and
approximately $5.2 million to its other postretirement plans in 2010 although
the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until
the January 1, 2010 valuations are completed by April 1, 2010.  Also,
guidance pursuant to the Pension Protection Act of 2006 rules, effective for the
2008 plan year and beyond, continues to evolve, be interpreted through technical
corrections bills, and discussed within the industry and by congressional
lawmakers.  Any changes to the Pension Protection Act as a result of
these discussions and efforts may affect the level of Entergy New Orleans’
pension contributions in the future.

The planned capital investment estimate
for Entergy New Orleans reflects capital required to support existing
business.  The estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic
review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory
constraints, environmental compliance, market volatility, economic trends, and
the ability to access capital.  Management provides more information
on long-term debt and preferred stock maturities in Notes 5 and 6 and to the
financial statements.

Sources
of Capital

Entergy New Orleans' sources to meet
its capital requirements include:

·

internally
      generated funds;

·

cash
      on hand; and

·

      and preferred stock issuances.

Entergy New Orleans may refinance or

Entergy
New Orleans, Inc.

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

Entergy
New Orleans' receivables from or (payables to) the money pool were as follows as
of December 31 for each of the following years:

See Note
4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool.  As
discussed above in "

Bankruptcy
Proceedings

", in 2007, Entergy New Orleans issued notes due in 2010 to
satisfy its affiliate prepetition accounts payable, including its prepetition
indebtedness to the Entergy System money pool of $37.2 million.

Entergy
New Orleans has obtained short-term borrowing authorization from the FERC under
which it may borrow through October 2011, up to the aggregate amount, at any one
time outstanding, of $100 million.  See Note 4 to the financial
statements for further discussion of Entergy New Orleans' short-term borrowing
limits.  The long-term securities issuances of Entergy New Orleans are
limited to amounts authorized by the City Council, and the current authorization
extends through August 2010.

State and Local Rate
Regulation

The rates that Entergy New Orleans
charges for electricity and natural gas significantly influence its financial
position, results of operations, and liquidity.  Entergy New Orleans
is regulated and the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory
proceedings.  A governmental agency, the City Council, is primarily
responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers.

Formula
Rate Plans and Storm-related Riders

On July 31, 2008, Entergy New Orleans
filed an electric and gas base rate case with the City Council.  On
April 2, 2009, the City Council approved a comprehensive
settlement.  The settlement provided for a net $35.3 million reduction
in combined fuel and non-fuel electric revenue requirement, including conversion
of the $10.6 million voluntary recovery credit to a permanent reduction and
substantial realignment of Grand Gulf cost recovery from fuel to electric base
rates, and a $4.95 million gas base rate increase, both effective June 1, 2009,
with adjustment of the customer charges for all rate classes.  A new
three-year formula rate plan was also adopted, with terms including an 11.1%
benchmark electric return on common equity (ROE) with a +/- 40 basis point
bandwidth and a 10.75% benchmark gas ROE with a +/- 50 basis point
bandwidth.  Earnings outside the bandwidth reset to the midpoint
benchmark ROE, with rates changing on a prospective basis depending on whether
Entergy New Orleans is over- or under-earning.  The formula rate plan
also includes a recovery mechanism for City Council-approved capacity additions,
plus provisions for extraordinary cost changes and force majeure
events.

The rate case settlement also included
$3.1 million per year in electric rates to fund the Energy Smart energy
efficiency programs.  In September 2009 the City Council approved the
energy efficiency programs filed by Entergy New Orleans.  The rate
settlement provides an incentive for Entergy New Orleans to meet or exceed
energy savings targets set by the City Council and provides a mechanism for
Entergy New Orleans to recover lost contribution to fixed costs associated with
the energy savings generated from the energy efficiency programs.  The
programs are expected to begin in 2010.

In June 2006, Entergy New Orleans made
its annual formula rate plan filings with the City Council.  The filings
presented various alternatives to reflect the effect of Entergy New Orleans'
lost customers and decreased revenue following Hurricane Katrina.  The
alternative that Entergy New Orleans recommended adjusts for lost customers and
assumes that the City Council's June 2006 decision to allow recovery of all
Grand Gulf costs through the fuel adjustment clause stays in place during the
rate-effective period (a significant portion of Grand Gulf costs was previously
recovered through base rates).


Entergy
New Orleans, Inc.

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

At the same time as it made its formula
rate plan filings, Entergy New Orleans also filed with the City Council a
request to implement two storm-related riders.  With the first rider,
Entergy New Orleans sought to recover the electric and gas restoration costs
that it had actually spent through March 31, 2006.  Entergy New
Orleans also proposed semiannual filings to update the rider for additional
restoration spending and also to consider the receipt of CDBG funds or insurance
proceeds that it may receive.  With the second rider, Entergy New
Orleans sought to establish a storm reserve to provide for the risk of another
storm.

In October 2006, the City Council
approved a settlement agreement that resolved Entergy New Orleans' rate and
storm-related rider filings by providing for phased-in rate increases, while
taking into account with respect to storm restoration costs the anticipated
receipt of CDBG funding as recommended by the Louisiana Recovery
Authority.  The settlement provided for a 0% increase in electric base
rates through December 2007, with a $3.9 million increase implemented in January
2008.  Recovery of all Grand Gulf costs through the fuel adjustment
clause was continued.  Gas base rates increased by $4.75 million in
November 2006 and increased by an additional $1.5 million in March 2007 and an
additional $4.75 million in November 2007.  The settlement called for
Entergy New Orleans to file a base rate case by July 31, 2008, which it did as
discussed above.  The settlement agreement discontinued the formula
rate plan and the generation performance-based plan but permitted Entergy New
Orleans to file an application to seek authority to implement formula rate plan
mechanisms no sooner than six months following the effective date of the
implementation of the base rates resulting from the July 31, 2008 base rate
case.  The settlement also authorized a $75 million storm reserve for
damage from future storms, which will be created over a ten-year period through
a storm reserve rider beginning in March 2007.  These storm reserve
funds will be held in a restricted escrow account.

In January 2008, Entergy New Orleans
voluntarily implemented a 6.15% base rate credit (the recovery credit) for
electric customers, which returned approximately $11.3 million to electric
customers in 2008.  Entergy New Orleans was able to implement this
credit because during 2007 the recovery of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina
was occurring faster than expected in 2006 projections.  In addition,
Entergy New Orleans committed to set aside $2.5 million for an energy efficiency
program focused on community education and outreach and weatherization of
homes.

In addition to rate proceedings,
Entergy New Orleans' fuel costs recovered from customers are subject to
regulatory scrutiny.  Entergy New Orleans' electric rate schedules
include a fuel adjustment tariff designed to reflect no more than targeted fuel
and purchased power costs, adjusted by a surcharge or credit for deferred fuel
expense arising from the monthly reconciliation of actual fuel and purchased
power costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including
carrying charges.  In June 2006 the City Council authorized the
recovery of all Grand Gulf costs through Entergy New Orleans' fuel adjustment
clause (a significant portion of Grand Gulf costs was previously recovered
through base rates), and continued that authorization in approving the October
2006 formula rate plan filing settlement.  Effective June 2009, the
majority of Grand Gulf costs were realigned to base rates and are no longer
flowed through the fuel adjustment clause.

Entergy New Orleans' gas rate schedules
include a purchased gas adjustment to reflect estimated gas costs for the
billing month, adjusted by a surcharge or credit similar to that included in the
electric fuel adjustment clause, including carrying charges.  In
October 2005, the City Council approved modification of the gas cost collection
mechanism effective November 2005 in order to address concerns regarding its
fluctuations, particularly during the winter heating season.  The
modifications are intended to minimize fluctuations in gas rates during the
winter months.

Environmental
Risks

Entergy
New Orleans' facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various
governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality,
control of toxic substances and hazardous solid wastes, and other environmental
matters.  Management believes that Entergy New Orleans is in
substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to
its facilities and operations.  Because environmental regulations are
subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely
estimated.

Critical Accounting
Estimates

The
preparation of Entergy New Orleans' financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply
appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can
have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations,
and cash flows.  Management has identified the following accounting
policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and
measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and there is the
potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could
produce estimates that would have a material impact on the presentation of
Entergy New Orleans' financial position or results of operations.

Unbilled
Revenue

As
discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Entergy New Orleans records an
estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer
billing.  Each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are
recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month's estimate is
reversed.  The difference between the estimate of the unbilled
receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the
amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period.  The estimate
recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the
unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that month, including fuel
price.  Therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated
price and usage at the beginning and end of each period and fuel price
fluctuations, in addition to changes in certain components of the
calculation.  Effective June 2009, Entergy New Orleans reclassified
the fuel component of unbilled accounts receivable to deferred fuel and will no
longer include the fuel component in the unbilled calculation, which is in
accordance with regulatory treatment.

Qualified
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Entergy
sponsors qualified defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all
employees.  Additionally, Entergy currently provides postretirement
health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees who
reach retirement age while still working for Entergy.  Entergy's
reported costs of providing these benefits, as described in Note 11 to the
financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions
of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial
calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. See the "

Critical
Accounting Estimates

" section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries
Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.  Because
of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these
obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy's estimate
of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.

million.  Entergy New Orleans anticipates 2010 qualified pension cost
to be $3.6 million.  Entergy New Orleans contributed $1.1 million in
qualified pension contributions in 2009 and anticipates approximately a $5.1
million pension contribution in 2010 although the required pension contributions
will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2010 valuations are
completed by April 1, 2010.  Also, guidance pursuant to the Pension
Protection Act of 2006 rules, effective for the 2008 plan year and beyond,
continues to evolve, be interpreted through technical corrections bills, and
discussed within the industry and by congressional lawmakers.  Any
changes to the Pension Protection Act as a result of these discussions and
efforts may affect the level of Entergy New Orleans’ pension contributions in
the future.

Total
postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for Entergy New
Orleans in 2009 were $5.9 million, including $1 million in savings due to the
estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies.  Entergy New
Orleans expects 2010 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs
to approximate $5.2 million, including $1.1 million in savings due to the
estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies.  Entergy New
Orleans expects to contribute approximately $5.2 million to its other
postretirement plans in 2010.

ENTERGY
TEXAS, INC.

MANAGEMENT'S
FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Jurisdictional Separation of
Entergy Gulf States, Inc. into Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy
Texas

Effective December 31, 2007, Entergy
Gulf States, Inc. completed a jurisdictional separation into two vertically
integrated utility companies, one operating under the sole retail jurisdiction
of the PUCT, Entergy Texas, and the other operating under the sole retail
jurisdiction of the LPSC, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana.  Management
believes that the jurisdictional separation will better align Entergy Gulf
States, Inc.'s Louisiana and Texas operations to serve customers in those states
and to operate consistent with state-specific regulatory requirements as the
utility regulatory environments in those jurisdictions evolve.  The
jurisdictional separation provides for regulation of each separated company by a
single retail regulator, which should reduce regulatory complexity.

Entergy Texas now owns all Entergy Gulf
States, Inc. distribution and transmission assets located in Texas, the
gas-fired generating plants located in Texas, undivided 42.5% ownership shares
of Entergy Gulf States, Inc.'s 70% ownership interest in Nelson 6 and 42%
ownership interest in Big Cajun 2, Unit 3, which are coal-fired generating
plants located in Louisiana, and other assets and contract rights to the extent
related to utility operations in Texas.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana
now owns all of the remaining assets that were owned by Entergy Gulf States,
Inc.  On a book value basis, approximately 58.1% of the Entergy Gulf
States, Inc. assets were allocated to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and
approximately 41.9% were allocated to Entergy Texas.

Entergy
Gulf States Louisiana remains primarily liable for all of the long-term debt
issued by Entergy Gulf States, Inc. that was outstanding on December 31,
2007.  Under a debt assumption agreement with Entergy Gulf States
Louisiana, Entergy Texas assumed its pro rata share of this long-term debt,
which was $1.079 billion, or approximately 46%, of which $168 million remains
outstanding at December 31, 2009.  The pro rata share of the long-term
debt assumed by Entergy Texas was determined by first determining the net assets
for each company on a book value basis, and then calculating a debt assumption
ratio that resulted in the common equity ratios for each company being
approximately the same as the Entergy Gulf States, Inc. common equity ratio
immediately prior to the jurisdictional separation.  Entergy Texas'
debt assumption does not discharge Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's liability for
the long-term debt.  To secure its debt assumption obligations,
Entergy Texas granted to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana a first lien on Entergy
Texas' assets that were previously subject to the Entergy Gulf States, Inc.
mortgage.  Entergy Texas has until December 31, 2010 to repay the
assumed debt.  In addition, Entergy Texas, as the owner of Entergy
Gulf States Reconstruction Funding I, LLC ("EGSRF I"), will report the $329.5
million of senior secured transition bonds ("securitization bonds") issued by
EGSRF I as long-term debt on its consolidated balance sheet.  The
securitization bonds are non-recourse to Entergy Texas.

Entergy
Texas will purchase from Entergy Gulf States Louisiana pursuant to a
life-of-unit purchased power agreement (PPA) a 42.5% share of capacity and
energy from the 70% of River Bend subject to retail
regulation.  Entergy Texas was allocated a share of River Bend's
nuclear and environmental liabilities that is identical to the share of the
plant's output purchased by Entergy Texas under the PPA.  Entergy Gulf
States Louisiana will purchase a 57.5% share of capacity and energy from the
gas-fired generating plants owned by Entergy Texas, and Entergy Texas will
purchase a 42.5% share of capacity and energy from the gas-fired generating
plants owned by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana.  The PPAs associated
with the gas-fired generating plants will terminate when retail open access
commences in Entergy Texas' jurisdiction or when the unit(s) is no longer
dispatched by the Entergy System.  If Entergy Texas implements retail
open access, it will terminate its participation in the System Agreement,
except for the portion of the System Agreement related to transmission
equalization.  The dispatch and operation of the generating plants
will not change as a result of the jurisdictional separation.

Because the jurisdictional separation
was a transaction involving entities under common control, Entergy Texas
recognized the assets and liabilities allocated to it at their carrying amounts
in the accounts of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. at the time of the jurisdictional
separation.  Entergy Texas' financial statements report results of
operations for 2007 as though the jurisdictional separation had occurred at the
beginning of 2007, and presents its 2007 other financial information as of the
beginning of 2007 as though the assets and liabilities had been allocated at
that date.  Financial statements and financial information presented for
prior periods have also been presented on that basis to furnish comparative
information.

Results of
Operations

Net
Income

2009 Compared to

Net income increased by $5.9 million
primarily due to higher net revenue and higher other income, partially offset by
higher other operation and maintenance expenses and higher interest and other
charges.

2008 Compared to

Net income decreased $1 million
primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization expenses and lower other
income, partially offset by lower interest and other charges and a lower
effective income tax rate.

Net
Revenue

2009 Compared to

Net revenue consists of operating
revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale,
2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory
charges.  Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue
comparing 2009 to 2008.

The retail electric price variance is
primarily due to rate increases effective late-January 2009 and an Energy
Efficiency rider which became effective December 31, 2008, which is
substantially offset in other operation and maintenance expenses.  See
Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the rate
increases.

The volume/weather variance is
primarily due to the effect of more favorable weather on billed and unbilled
sales in 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 and an increase in unbilled
sales volume, including the effects of Hurricane Ike which decreased sales
volume in 2008.

The net wholesale revenue variance is
primarily due to higher capacity revenue as a result of the purchased power
agreements between Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas and increased
volume to municipal and co-op customers.

As discussed further in Note 2 to the
financial statements, the rough production cost equalization variance is due to
an additional $18.6 million allocation of 2007 rough production cost
equalization receipts ordered by the PUCT to Texas retail customers over what
was originally allocated to Entergy Texas prior to the jurisdictional separation
of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. into Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy
Texas, effective December 2007.

The reserve equalization variance is
primarily due to increased reserve equalization expense related to changes in
the Entergy System generation mix compared to the same period in
2008.


Entergy

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

Gross
operating revenues, fuel and purchased power expenses, and other regulatory
charges

Gross operating revenues decreased
primarily due to a decrease of $285.3 million in fuel cost recovery revenues
primarily attributable to lower fuel rates and a decrease in affiliated
wholesale revenue of $141.8 million due to a decrease in the average price of
energy available for resale sales.

Fuel and
purchased power expenses decreased primarily due to decreases in the average
market prices of natural gas and purchased power, partially offset by an
increase in deferred fuel expense due to fuel and purchased power expense
decreases in excess of lower fuel cost recovery revenues.

Other regulatory charges increased
primarily due to rough production cost equalization charges as described
above.

2008 Compared to

Net revenue consists of operating
revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale,
2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory

The volume/weather variance is
primarily due to decreased usage during the unbilled sales
period.  See "

Critical
Accounting Estimates

" below and Note 1 to the financial statements for
further discussion of the accounting for unbilled revenues.

The reserve equalization variance is
primarily due to lower reserve equalization revenue related to changes in the
Entergy System generation mix compared to the same period in 2007.

The securitization transition charge
variance is primarily due to the issuance of securitization bonds.  In
June 2007, Entergy Gulf States Reconstruction Funding I, a company wholly-owned
and consolidated by Entergy Texas, issued securitization bonds and with the
proceeds purchased from Entergy Texas the transition property, which is the
right to recover from customers through a transition charge amounts sufficient
to service the securitization bonds.  See Note 5 to the financial
statements for additional information regarding the securitization
bonds.

The fuel recovery variance is primarily
due to a reserve for potential rate refunds made in the first quarter 2007 as a
result of a PUCT ruling related to the application of past PUCT rulings
addressing transition to competition in Texas.

The other variance is primarily caused
by various operational effects of the jurisdictional separation on revenues and
fuel and purchased power expenses.

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

Gross
operating revenues, fuel and purchased power expenses, and other regulatory
charges

Gross operating revenues increased
$229.3 million primarily due to the following reasons:

·

an
      increase of $157 million in fuel cost recovery revenues due to higher fuel
      rates and increased usage, partially offset by interim fuel refunds to
      customers for fuel cost recovery over-collections through November
      2007.  The refund was distributed over a two-month period
      beginning February 2008.  The interim refund and the PUCT
      approval is discussed in Note 2 to the financial
    statements;

·

an
      increase of $37.1 million in affiliated wholesale revenue primarily due to
      increases in the cost of energy;

·

an
      increase in transition charge amounts collected from customers to service
      the securitization bonds as discussed above.  See Note 5 to the
      financial statements for additional information regarding the
      securitization bonds; and

·

implementation
      of an interim surcharge to collect $10.3 million in under-recovered
      incremental purchased capacity costs incurred through July
      2007.  The surcharge was collected over a two-month period
      beginning February 2008.  The incremental capacity recovery
      rider and PUCT approval is discussed in Note 2 to the financial
      statements.

Fuel and purchased power expenses
increased primarily due to an increase in power purchases as a result of the
purchased power agreements between Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy
Texas and an increase in the average market prices of purchased power and
natural gas, substantially offset by a decrease in deferred fuel expense as a
result of decreased recovery from customers of fuel costs.

Other regulatory charges increased
primarily due to an increase of $6.9 million in the recovery of bond expenses
related to the securitization bonds.  The recovery became effective
July 2007.  See Note 5 to the financial statements for additional
information regarding the securitization bonds.

Other
Income Statement Variances

2009 Compared to

Other operation and maintenance
expenses increased primarily due to:

·

an
      increase of $11.4 million in fossil expenses primarily due to higher plant
      maintenance costs and plant
outages;

·

an
      increase of $6.8 million due to the Hurricane Ike and Hurricane Gustav
      storm cost recovery settlement agreement, as discussed below under "

Hurricane Ike and
      Hurricane Gustav

";

·

an
      increase of $1.8 million in transmission spending primarily for costs
      related to the Independent Coordinator of Transmission and substation
      maintenance;

·

an
      increase of $1.8 million in local easement fees as the result of higher
      gross revenues in certain locations within the Texas jurisdiction;
      and

·

an
      increase of $1.7 million in customer service costs primarily as a result
      of write-offs of uncollectible customer
  accounts.

Other income increased primarily due to
carrying charges on Hurricane Ike storm restoration costs as authorized by Texas
legislation in the second quarter 2009, partially offset by a decrease in taxes
collected on advances for transmission projects and a decrease in interest
earned on money pool investments.  See Note 2 to the financial
statements for further discussion of Hurricane Ike storm cost recovery
filings.

Interest expense increased primarily
due to an increase in long-term debt outstanding as a result of the issuance of
$500 million of 7.125% Series mortgage bonds in January 2009 and the issuance of
$150 million of 7.875% Series mortgage bonds in May 2009, partially offset by
pay-down of debt assumption agreement liabilities.


Entergy
Texas, Inc.

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

2008 Compared to

Other
operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to:

·

a
      decrease of $4.7 million in transmission spending primarily due to lower
      transmission equalization expenses;

·

a
      decrease of $3.9 million in plant maintenance costs;
  and

·

a
      decrease of $3.6 million in customer service support costs, including a
      decrease in customer account
write-offs.

The
decrease was partially offset by an increase of $7.3 million due to the
write-off of certain disallowed costs resulting from the December 2008 rate case
settlement agreement filed with the PUCT and an increase of $1.7 in payroll and
payroll-related costs.  The rate case settlement agreement is
discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements.

Depreciation
and amortization expenses increased primarily due to an increase in plant in
service.

Other income decreased primarily due to
the absence of carrying charges on storm restoration costs that were approved by
the PUCT in the fourth quarter 2006 and a decrease in interest earned on money
pool investments.  In June 2007, Entergy Gulf States Reconstruction
Funding I, LLC issued securitization bonds and the carrying charges
ended.  The PUCT approval of carrying charges, the securitization
filing and the approval for the recovery of reconstruction costs are discussed
in Note 2 to the financial statements.  The decrease was partially
offset by an increase in taxes collected on advances for transmission
projects.

Interest
and other charges decreased primarily due to the absence of interest recorded on
advances from independent power producers per a FERC order during the first
quarter 2007 and a decrease in debt outstanding under the debt assumption
agreement.  This decrease was partially offset by an increase in
interest charges recorded on the securitization bonds which were issued during
the second quarter 2007.  See Note 5 to the financial statements for
additional information regarding the securitization bonds.

Operating
Activities

Cash flow provided by operating
activities increased $286.1 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due
to:

·

the
      timing of collection of receivables from
  customers;

·

increased
      recovery of deferred fuel costs.  The increased fuel recovery
      was primarily caused by the $71 million fuel cost over-recovery refund in
      2008 that is discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, in addition
      to the over-recovery of fuel costs in 2009 compared to
    2008;

·

income
      tax refunds of $72.3 million in 2009 compared to income tax payments of
      $762 thousand in 2008; and

·

a
      decrease of $15.3 million in pension
  contributions.

The
increase was partially offset by Hurricane Ike restoration spending in
2008.

Cash flow
provided by operating activities decreased $174.5 million in 2008 compared to
2007 primarily due to Hurricane Ike restoration spending, decreased recovery of
deferred fuel costs, and an increase of $9.9 million in pension contributions,
partially offset by the timing of collections of receivables from customers and
payments to vendors.  The decreased fuel recovery was primarily caused
by the $71 million fuel cost over-recovery refund that is discussed in Note 2 to
the financial statements, in addition to the over-recovery of fuel costs for the
year ended December 31, 2007 compared to under-recovering for the year ended
December 31, 2008.  Fuel prices increased and due to the time lag
before the fuel recovery rate increases in response, Entergy Texas had
under-recovered fuel costs in 2008.

Investing
Activities

Cash flow used in investing activities
increased $99.8 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to money pool
activity, partially offset by higher construction expenditures in 2008 due to
Hurricane Ike and insurance proceeds received in 2009 relating to Hurricane
Ike.

Increases in Entergy Texas' receivable
from the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Texas' receivable from
the money pool increased by $69.3 million in 2009 compared to decreasing by
$154.2 million in 2008.  The money pool is an inter-company borrowing
arrangement designed to reduce the Utility subsidiaries' need for external
short-term borrowings.

Cash flow used in investing activities
decreased $117.8 million in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to money pool
activity, partially offset by an increase in distribution construction
expenditures primarily due to Hurricane Ike.

Decreases in Entergy Texas' receivable
from the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy Texas' receivable
from the money pool decreased by $154.2 million for 2008 compared to increasing
by $56.9 million for 2007.

Financing
Activities

Financing activities provided cash of
$127.6 million for 2009 compared to using cash of $179.4 million for 2008
primarily due to:

·

the
      issuance of $545.9 million of securitization bonds in November
      2009.  See Note 5 to the financial statements for additional
      information regarding the securitization

      and

·

$150
      million of capital returned to Entergy Corporation in February
      2008.  After the effects of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane
      Rita, Entergy Corporation made a $300 million capital contribution to
      Entergy Gulf States, Inc. in 2005, which was part of Entergy's financing
      plan that provided liquidity and capital resources to Entergy and its
      subsidiaries while storm restoration cost recovery was
      pursued.

Financial Discussion and Analysis

Net debt
consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents.  Debt consists of
notes payable and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion and
also including the debt assumption liability.  Capital consists of
debt and shareholders' equity.  Net capital consists of capital less
cash and cash equivalents.  Entergy Texas uses the net debt to net
capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides
useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Texas'
financial condition.

Uses
of Capital

Entergy Texas requires capital
resources for:

·

construction
      and other capital investments;

·

debt
      maturities, including payments under the debt assumption agreement with
      Entergy Gulf States Louisiana;

·

working
      capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power
      costs; and

·

dividend

Purchase
      obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation
      charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or
      services.  For Entergy Texas, it primarily includes
      unconditional fuel and purchased power
  obligations.

In
addition to the contractual obligations given above, Entergy Texas expects to
contribute approximately $9.7 million to its pension plans and approximately
$7.7 million to other postretirement plans in 2010 although the required pension
contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2010
valuations are completed by April 1, 2010.  Also, guidance pursuant to
the Pension Protection Act of 2006 rules, effective for the 2008 plan year and
beyond, continues to evolve, be interpreted through technical corrections bills,
and discussed within the industry and by congressional lawmakers.  Any
changes to the Pension Protection Act as a result of these discussions and
efforts may affect the level of Entergy Texas’ pension contributions in the
future.

Entergy's Utility supply plan
initiative will continue to seek to transform its generation portfolio with new
or repowered generation resources.  Opportunities resulting from the
supply plan initiative, including new projects or the exploration of alternative
financing sources, could result in increases or decreases in the capital
expenditure estimates given above.  The estimated capital expenditures
are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the
ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental compliance, market
volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, and the ability to access
capital.  Management provides more information on long-term debt and
preferred stock maturities in Notes 5 and 6 to the financial
statements.

As a wholly-owned subsidiary, Entergy
Texas pays dividends to Entergy Corporation from its earnings at a percentage

Sources
of Capital

Entergy Texas' sources to meet its
capital requirements include:

·

internally
      generated funds;

·

cash
      on hand;

·

debt
      or preferred stock issuances; and

·

bank
      financing under new or existing
facilities.

Entergy Texas may refinance or redeem
debt prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and
dividend rates are favorable.

All debt and common and preferred stock
issuances by Entergy Texas require prior regulatory
approval.  Preferred stock and debt issuances are also subject to
issuance tests set forth in its corporate charter, bond indentures, and other
agreements.  Entergy Texas has sufficient capacity under these tests
to meet its foreseeable capital needs.

Entergy
Texas' receivables from or (payables to) the money pool were as follows as of
December 31 for each of the following years:

See Note
4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool.

Entergy
Texas has a credit facility in the amount of $100 million scheduled to expire in
August 2012.  No borrowings were outstanding under the facility as of
December 31, 2009.

Entergy Texas has obtained short-term
borrowing authorization from the FERC under which it may borrow through October
2011, up to the aggregate amount, at any one time outstanding, of $200
million.  See Note 4 to the financial statements for further
discussion of Entergy Texas' short-term borrowing limits.  Entergy
Texas has also obtained an order from the FERC authorizing long-term securities
issuances through July 2011.

In December 2008, Entergy Texas
borrowed $160 million from its parent company, Entergy Corporation, under a $300
million revolving credit facility pursuant to an Inter-Company Credit Agreement
between Entergy Corporation and Entergy Texas.  This borrowing would
have matured on December 3, 2013.  Entergy Texas used these
borrowings, together with other available corporate funds, to pay at maturity
the portion of the $350 million Floating Rate series of First Mortgage Bonds due
December 2008 that had been assumed by Entergy Texas, and that bond series is no
longer outstanding.  In January 2009, Entergy Texas repaid its $160
million note payable to Entergy Corporation with the proceeds from the $500
million bond issuance discussed above.

Hurricane Ike and Hurricane
Gustav

In September 2008, Hurricane Ike caused
catastrophic damage to Entergy Texas' service territory.  The storm
resulted in widespread power outages, significant damage to distribution,
transmission, and generation infrastructure, and the loss of sales during the
power outages.  Entergy Texas filed an application in April 2009
seeking a determination that $577.5 million of Hurricane Ike and Hurricane
Gustav restoration costs are recoverable, including estimated costs for work to
be completed.  On August 5, 2009, Entergy Texas submitted to the ALJ
an unopposed settlement agreement intended to resolve all issues in the storm
cost recovery case.  Under the terms of the agreement $566.4 million,
plus carrying costs, are eligible for recovery.  Insurance proceeds
will be credited as an offset to the securitized amount.  Of the $11.1
million difference between Entergy Texas' request and the amount agreed to,
which is part of the black box agreement and not directly attributable to any
specific individual issues raised, $6.8 million is operation and
maintenance expense for which Entergy Texas recorded a charge in the second
quarter 2009.  The remaining $4.3 million was recorded as utility
plant.  The PUCT approved the settlement in August 2009, and in
September 2009 the PUCT approved recovery of the costs, plus carrying costs, by
securitization.  See Note 5 to the financial statements for a
discussion of the November 2009 issuance of the securitization
bonds.


Entergy
Texas, Inc.

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

In the third quarter 2009, Entergy
settled with its insurer on its Hurricane Ike claim and Entergy Texas received
$75.5 million in proceeds (Entergy received a total of $76.5
million).

Hurricane
Rita

In September 2005, Hurricane Rita hit
Entergy Texas' service territory.  The storm resulted in power
outages; significant damage to electric distribution, transmission, and
generation infrastructure; and the temporary loss of sales and customers due to
mandatory evacuations.  In July 2006, Entergy Texas filed an
application with the PUCT with respect to its Hurricane Rita reconstruction
costs incurred through March 2006.  The filing asked the PUCT to
determine the amount of reasonable and necessary hurricane reconstruction costs
eligible for securitization and recovery, approve the recovery of carrying
costs, and approve the manner in which Entergy Texas allocates those costs among
its retail customer classes.  In December 2006, the PUCT approved $381
million of reasonable and necessary hurricane reconstruction costs incurred
through March 31, 2006, plus carrying costs, as eligible for
recovery.  After netting expected insurance proceeds, the amount is
$353 million.  In April 2007, the PUCT issued its financing order
authorizing the issuance of securitization bonds to recover the $353 million of
hurricane reconstruction costs and up to $6 million of transaction costs, offset
by $32 million of related deferred income tax benefits.  See Note 5 to
the financial statements for a discussion of the June 2007 issuance of the
securitization bonds.

Entergy
received a total of $317 million as of December 31, 2009 on its Hurricane
Katrina and Hurricane Rita insurance claims, including the settlements of its
Hurricane Katrina claims with each of its two excess insurers.  Of the
$317 million received, $34 million has been allocated to Entergy
Texas.  Entergy has substantially completed its insurance recoveries
related to Hurricane Rita.

Electric Industry
Restructuring

In June 2009, a law was enacted in
Texas that requires Entergy Texas to cease all activities relating to Entergy
Texas' transition to competition.  The law allows Entergy Texas to
remain a part of the SERC Region, although it does not prevent Entergy Texas
from joining the Southwest Power Pool.  The law provides that
proceedings to certify a power region that Entergy Texas belongs to as a
qualified power region can be initiated by the PUCT, or on motion by another
party, when the conditions supporting such a proceeding exist.  Under
the new law, the PUCT may not approve a transition to competition plan for
Entergy Texas until the expiration of four years from the PUCT's certification
of Entergy Texas' power region.  In response to the new law, Entergy
Texas in June 2009 gave notice to the PUCT of the withdrawal of its previously
filed transition to competition plan, and requested that its transition to
competition proceeding be dismissed.  In July 2009 the ALJ dismissed
the proceeding.

The new law also contains provisions
that allow Entergy Texas to be included in a cost recovery mechanism that
permits annual filings for the recovery of reasonable and necessary expenditures
for transmission infrastructure improvement and changes in wholesale
transmission charges.  This mechanism was previously available to
other non-ERCOT Texas utility companies, but not to Entergy Texas.

The new law further amends already
existing law that had required Entergy Texas to propose for PUCT approval a
tariff to allow eligible customers the ability to contract for competitive
generation.  The amending language in the new law provides, among
other things, that:  1) the tariff shall not be implemented in a
manner that harms the sustainability or competitiveness of manufacturers who
choose not to participate in the tariff; 2) Entergy Texas shall "purchase
competitive generation service, selected by the customer, and provide the
generation at retail to the customer"; and 3)  Entergy Texas shall
provide and price transmission service and ancillary services under that tariff
at a rate that is unbundled from its cost of service.    The
new law directs that the PUCT may not issue an order on the tariff that is
contrary to an applicable decision, rule, or policy statement of a federal
regulatory agency having jurisdiction.  The new law provides that the
PUCT shall approve, reject, or modify the proposed tariff not later than
September 1, 2010.


Entergy

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

State and Local Rate
Regulation

The rates that Entergy Texas charges
for its services significantly influence its financial position, results of
operations, and liquidity.  Entergy Texas is regulated and the rates
charged to its customers are determined in regulatory
proceedings.  The PUCT, a governmental agency, is primarily
responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers.

Filings
with the PUCT

2009 Rate
Case

In December 2009, Entergy Texas filed a
rate case requesting a $198.7 million increase reflecting an 11.5% return on
common equity based on an adjusted June 2009 test year.  The filing
includes a proposed cost of service adjustment rider with a three-year term
beginning with the 2010 calendar year as the initial evaluation
period.  Key provisions include a plus or minus 15 basis point
bandwidth, with earnings outside the bandwidth reset to the bottom or top of the
band and rates changing prospectively depending upon whether Entergy Texas is
under or over-earning.  The annual change in revenue requirement is
limited to a percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for urban areas, and
the filing includes a provision for extraordinary events greater than $10
million per year that would be considered separately.  The filing also
proposes a purchased power recovery rider and a competitive generation service
tariff, and will establish test year baseline values to be used in the
transmission cost recovery factor rider authorized for use by Entergy Texas in
the 2009 legislative session.  The rate case also includes a $2.8
million revenue requirement to provide supplemental funding for the
decommissioning trust maintained for the 70% share of River Bend for which
Entergy Texas retail customers are responsible, in response to an NRC
notification of a projected shortfall of decommissioning funding
assurance.  The filing also includes a request to reconcile $1.8
billion of fuel and purchased power costs covering the period April 2007 through
June 2009.  Hearings in the proceeding are scheduled for July 2010,
and the PUCT is required to issue a final order by November 1,
2010.  Beginning in May 2010, Entergy Texas will be allowed to
implement a $17.5 million interim rate increase, subject to
refund.  The rates set by a final order will be effective back to
September 13, 2010.

2007 Rate
Case

Entergy Texas made a rate filing in
September 2007 with the PUCT requesting an annual rate increase totaling $107.5
million, including a base rate increase of $64.3 million and riders totaling
$43.2 million.  On December 16, 2008, Entergy Texas filed a term sheet
that reflected a settlement agreement that included the PUCT Staff and the other
active participants in the rate case.  On December 19, 2008, the ALJs
approved Entergy Texas' request to implement interim rates reflecting the
agreement.  The agreement includes a $46.7 million base rate increase,
among other provisions.  Under the ALJs' interim order, Entergy Texas
implemented interim rates, subject to refund and surcharge, reflecting the rates
established through the settlement.  These rates became effective with
bills rendered on and after January 28, 2009, for usage on and after December
19, 2008.  In addition, the existing recovery mechanism for
incremental purchased power capacity costs ceased as of January 28, 2009, with
purchased power capacity costs then subsumed within the base rates set in this
proceeding.  The agreement adopted by the PUCT also reconciles fuel
and purchased power costs for the period January 1, 2006 through March 31,
2007.  Certain Texas municipalities exercised their original
jurisdiction and took final action to approve rates consistent with the interim
rates approved by the ALJs.  In March 2009, the PUCT approved the
settlement, which made the interim rates final.

Fuel and Purchased Power
Cost Recovery

Entergy Texas' rate schedules include a
fixed fuel factor to recover fuel and purchased power costs, including carrying
charges, not recovered in base rates.  The fixed fuel factor formula
was revised and approved by a PUCT order in August 2006.  The new
formula was implemented in September 2006.  Under the new methodology,
semi-annual revisions of the fixed fuel factor will continue to be made in March
and September based on the market price of natural gas and changes in fuel
mix.  The amounts collected under Entergy Texas' fixed fuel factor and
any interim surcharge or refund are subject to fuel reconciliation proceedings
before the PUCT.

In July 2005, Entergy Texas filed with
the PUCT a request for implementation of an incremental purchased capacity
recovery rider.  Through this rider Entergy Texas sought to recover
incremental revenues that represent the incremental purchased capacity costs,
including Entergy Texas' obligation to purchase power from Entergy Louisiana's
Perryville plant, over what is already in Entergy Texas' base
rates.  The PUCT approved an initial rider to collect $18 million
annually, which was increased to $21 million in subsequent
years.  Under the


Entergy
Texas, Inc.

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

settlement
of the 2007 rate case discussed above, this rider ceased on January 28, 2009,
with the implementation of stipulated base rates.  The amounts
collected through the rider are subject to reconciliation.

In May 2006, Entergy Texas filed with
the PUCT a fuel and purchased power reconciliation case covering the period
September 2003 through December 2005 for costs recoverable through the fixed
fuel factor rate and the incremental purchased capacity recovery
rider.  Entergy Texas sought reconciliation of $1.6 billion of fuel
and purchased power costs on a Texas retail basis.  A hearing was
conducted before the ALJs in April 2007.  In July 2007, the ALJs
issued a proposal for decision recommending that Entergy Texas be authorized to
reconcile all of its requested fixed fuel factor expenses and recommending a
minor exception to the incremental purchased capacity recovery
calculation.  The ALJs also recommended granting an exception to the
PUCT rules to allow for recovery of an additional $11.4 million in purchased
power capacity costs.  In September 2007, the PUCT issued an order,
which affirmed the ultimate result of the ALJs' proposal for
decision.  Upon motions for rehearing, the PUCT added additional
language in its order on rehearing to further clarify its position that 30% of
River Bend should not be regulated by the PUCT.  Two parties filed a
second motion for rehearing, but the PUCT declined to address
them.  The PUCT's decision has been appealed to the Travis County
District Court.

In March 2007, Entergy Texas filed a
request with the PUCT to refund $78.5 million, including interest, of fuel cost
recovery over-collections through January 2007.  In June 2007 the PUCT
approved a unanimous stipulation and settlement agreement that updated the
over-collection balance through April 2007 and established a refund amount,
including interest, of $109.4 million.  The refund was made over a
two-month period beginning with the first billing cycle in July
2007.

In October 2007, Entergy Texas filed a
request with the PUCT to refund $45.6 million, including interest, of fuel cost
recovery over-collections through September 2007.  In January 2008,
Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a stipulation and settlement agreement among
the parties that updated the over-collection balance through November 2007 and
established a refund amount, including interest, of $71 million.  The
PUCT approved the agreement in February 2008.  The refund was made
over a two-month period beginning February 2008, but was reduced by
$10.3 million of under-recovered incremental purchased capacity
costs.

In January 2008, Entergy Texas made a
compliance filing with the PUCT describing how its 2007 Rough Production Cost
Equalization receipts under the System Agreement were allocated between Entergy
Gulf States, Inc.'s Texas and Louisiana jurisdictions.  A hearing was
held at the end of July 2008, and in October 2008 the ALJ issued a proposal for
decision recommending an additional $18.6 million allocation to Texas retail
customers.  The PUCT adopted the ALJ's proposal for decision in
December 2008.  Because the PUCT allocation to Texas retail customers
is inconsistent with the LPSC allocation to Louisiana retail customers, the
PUCT's decision would result in trapped costs between the Texas and Louisiana
jurisdictions with no mechanism for recovery.  The PUCT denied Entergy
Texas' motion for rehearing and Entergy Texas commenced proceedings in both
state and federal district courts seeking to reverse the PUCT's
decision.  The federal proceeding has been abated pending further
action by the FERC in the proceeding discussed below.  No procedural
schedule has been set for the state proceeding.

Entergy Texas also filed with the FERC
a proposed amendment to the System Agreement bandwidth formula to specifically
calculate the payments to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas of
Entergy Gulf States, Inc.'s rough production cost equalization receipts for
2007.  On May 8, 2009, the FERC issued an order rejecting the proposed
amendment, stating, among other things, that the FERC does not have jurisdiction
over the allocation of an individual utility's receipts/payments among or
between its retail jurisdictions and that this was a matter for the courts to
review in the pending proceedings noted above.  Because of the FERC's
order, Entergy Texas recorded the effects of the PUCT's allocation of the
additional $18.6 million to retail customers in the second quarter
2009.  On an after-tax basis, the charge to earnings was approximately
$13.0 million (including interest).  Entergy requested rehearing of
the FERC's order, and on July 8, 2009, the FERC granted the request for
rehearing for the limited purpose of affording more time for consideration of
Entergy's request.


Entergy
Texas, Inc.

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

In May
2009, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to refund $46.1 million,
including interest, of fuel cost recovery over-collections through February
2009.  Entergy Texas requested that the proposed refund be made over a
four-month period beginning June 2009.  Pursuant to a stipulation
among the various parties, in June 2009 the PUCT issued an order approving a
refund of $59.2 million, including interest, of fuel cost recovery
overcollections through March 2009.  The refund was made over a
three-month period beginning July 2009, with the exception of certain industrial
and seasonal/agricultural customers who received a one-month
refund.

In October 2009, Entergy Texas filed
with the PUCT a request to refund approximately $71 million, including interest,
of fuel cost recovery over-collections through September
2009.  Entergy Texas requested that the proposed refund be made over a
six-month period beginning January 2010.  Pursuant to a stipulation
among the various parties, the PUCT issued an order approving a refund of $87.8
million, including interest, of fuel cost recovery overcollections through
October 2009.  The refund will be made over a three-month period
beginning January 2010, with the exception of certain industrial and
seasonal/agricultural customers who received a one-month refund.

Industrial and
Commercial

Entergy Texas' large industrial and
commercial customers continually explore ways to reduce their energy
costs.  In particular, cogeneration is an option available to a
portion of Entergy Texas' industrial customer base.  Entergy Texas
responds by working with industrial and commercial customers and negotiating
electric service contracts to provide, under existing rate schedules,
competitive rates that match specific customer needs and load
profiles.  Entergy Texas actively participates in economic
development, customer retention, and reclamation activities to increase
industrial and commercial demand, from both new and existing
customers.  Entergy Texas does not currently expect additional
significant losses to cogeneration because of the current economics of the
electricity markets and Entergy Texas' marketing efforts in retaining industrial
customers.

Environmental
Risks

Entergy Texas' facilities and
operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having
jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and
hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental
matters.  Management believes that Entergy Texas is in substantial
compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities
and operations.  Because environmental regulations are subject to
change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated.


Entergy
Texas, Inc.

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

Critical Accounting
Estimates

The
preparation of Entergy Texas' financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate
accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a
significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and
cash flows.  Management has identified the following accounting
policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and
measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for
future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates
that would have a material effect on the presentation of Entergy Texas'
financial position or results of operations.

Unbilled
Revenue

As
discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Entergy Texas records an
estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer
billing.  Each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are
recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month's estimate is
reversed.  The difference between the estimate of the unbilled
receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the
amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period.  The estimate
recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the
unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that
month.  Therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated
price and usage at the beginning and end of each period and fuel price
fluctuations, in addition to changes in certain components of the
calculation.

Qualified
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Entergy
sponsors qualified defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all
employees.  Additionally, Entergy currently provides postretirement
health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees who
reach retirement age while still working for Entergy.  Entergy's
reported costs of providing these benefits, as described in Note 11 to the
financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions
of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial
calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms.  See the "

Critical
Accounting Estimates

" section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries'
Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.  Because
of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these
obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy's estimate
of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.

Costs and
Funding

Total
qualified pension income for Entergy Texas in 2009 was $0.8
million.  Entergy Texas anticipates 2010 qualified pension expense to
be $3 million.  Entergy Texas contributed $3.6 million to its
qualified pension plans in 2009.  Entergy Texas' contributions to the
pension trust are currently estimated to be approximately $9.7 million in 2010
although the required pension contributions will not be known with more
certainty until the January 1, 2010 valuations are completed by April 1,
2010.  Also, guidance pursuant to the Pension Protection Act of 2006
rules, effective for the 2008 plan year and beyond, continues to evolve, be
interpreted through technical corrections bills, and discussed within the
industry and by congressional lawmakers.  Any changes to the Pension
Protection Act as a result of these discussions and efforts may affect the level
of Entergy Texas’ pension contributions in the future.

Total
postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for Entergy Texas in
2009 were $5.7 million, including $1 million in savings due to the estimated
effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies.  Entergy Texas expects
2010 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs to approximate
$5.6 million, including $1.1 million in savings due to the estimated effect of
future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy Texas expects to contribute
approximately $7.7 million to its other postretirement plans in
2010.

SYSTEM
ENERGY RESOURCES, INC.

MANAGEMENT'S
FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

System
Energy's principal asset currently consists of a 90% ownership and leasehold
interest in Grand Gulf.  The capacity and energy from its 90% interest
is sold under the Unit Power Sales Agreement to its only four customers, Entergy
Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New
Orleans.  System Energy's operating revenues are derived from the
allocation of the capacity, energy, and related costs associated with its 90%
interest in Grand Gulf pursuant to the Unit Power Sales
Agreement.  Payments under the Unit Power Sales Agreement are System
Energy's only source of operating revenues.

Results of
Operations

Net
Income

2009 Compared to

Net income decreased $42.2 million
primarily due to an increase in the effective income tax rate.

An increase in allowance for equity
funds used during construction, primarily due to the new nuclear development
project discussed below, was offset by a decrease in interest income, primarily
on money pool investments.

2008 Compared to

Net income decreased $45.0 million
primarily due to an increase in the effective tax rate, a decrease in rate base
in 2008 that resulted in lower operating income, and lower interest
income.  The lower interest income resulted from a decrease in
interest earned on money pool investments and from $2.5 million in interest
income recorded on an IRS audit settlement in 2007.

Taxes

The effective income tax rates for
2009, 2008, and 2007 were 66.5%, 39.5%, and 25.0%, respectively.  The
increase in the rate for 2009 is primarily due to the reallocation of Entergy
Corporation consolidated tax benefits based on the resolution of IRS audits of
prior tax years.  See Note 3 to the financial statements for a
reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35.0% to the effective income
tax rate and for a discussion of the IRS audits.

Financial Discussion and Analysis

Operating
Activities

Cash flow from operations increased by
$199.4 million in 2009 primarily due to income tax refunds of $120.4 million in
2009 compared to income tax payments of $54.4 million in 2008.

Cash flow from operations decreased by
$3.4 million in 2008 primarily due to lower net income substantially offset by a
decrease of $30.7 million in income tax payments.

Investing
Activities

Net cash flow used in

investing activities
increased $52.4 million in cash flow in 2009 primarily due to money pool
activity.  Increases in System Energy's receivable from the money pool
are a use of cash flow, and System Energy's receivable from the money pool
increased by $47.6 million in 2009 compared to decreasing by $10.7 million in
2008.  The money pool is an intercompany borrowing arrangement
designed to reduce Entergy’s subsidiaries’ need for external short-term
borrowings.

Financing
Activities

Net cash flow used in financing
activities decreased $17.0 million in 2009 primarily due to a decrease of $21.8
million in common stock dividends paid.

Net cash flow used in financing
activities decreased $31.2 million in 2008 primarily due to a decrease of $34
million in common stock dividends paid.

See Note 5 to the financial statements
for details of long-term debt.

analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to
its investors and creditors in evaluating System Energy's financial
condition.

Uses
of Capital

System Energy requires capital
resources for:

·

construction
      and other capital investments;

·

debt
      maturities;

·

working
      capital purposes, including the financing of fuel costs;
    and

·

      Note 5 to the financial statements.

(2)

It
      is expected that additional financing under the lease will be arranged as
      needed to acquire additional fuel, to pay interest, and to pay maturing
      debt.  If such additional financing cannot be arranged, however,
      System Energy must repurchase sufficient nuclear fuel to allow the lessor
      to meet its obligations.

(3)

Purchase
      obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation
      charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or
      services.  For System Energy, it includes nuclear fuel purchase
      obligations.

In
addition to the contractual obligations given above, System Energy expects to
contribute approximately $12.5 million to its pension plans and approximately
$3.4 million to its other postretirement plans in 2010 although the required
pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1,
2010 valuations are completed by April 1, 2010.  Also, guidance
pursuant to the Pension Protection Act of 2006 rules, effective for the 2008
plan year and beyond, continues to evolve, be interpreted through technical
corrections bills, and discussed within the industry and by congressional
lawmakers.  Any changes to the Pension Protection Act as a result of
these discussions and efforts may affect the level of System Energy’s pension
contributions in the future.

Also in addition to the contractual
obligations, System Energy has $168.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits and
interest net of unused tax attributes and payments for which the timing of
payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in
the timing of effective settlement of tax positions.  See Note 3 to
the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax
benefits.

The planned capital investment estimate
for System Energy reflects capital required to support the existing business of
System Energy.  The estimate also includes the costs of System
Energy's planned approximate 178 MW uprate of the Grand Gulf nuclear
plant.  The project is currently expected to cost $575 million,
including transmission upgrades.  On November 30, 2009, the MPSC
issued a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for implementation of
the uprate.

System Energy has also invested,
through its subsidiary Entergy New Nuclear Development, LLC, in initial
development costs for potential new nuclear development at the Grand Gulf and
River Bend sites, including licensing and design activities.  This
project is in the early stages, and several issues remain to be addressed over
time before significant additional capital would be committed to this
project.  In addition, Entergy temporarily suspended reviews of the
two license applications for the sites and will explore alternative nuclear
technologies for this project.  As of December 31, 2009, $100.3
million in construction work in progress was recorded on System Energy's balance
sheet related to this project.  In the first quarter 2010 this
construction work in progress was transferred to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana,
Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy Mississippi.

Entergy's Utility supply plan
initiative will continue to seek to transform its generation portfolio with new
or repowered generation resources.  Opportunities resulting from the
supply plan initiative, including new projects or the exploration of alternative
financing sources, could result in increases or decreases in the capital
expenditure estimates given above.

As a wholly-owned subsidiary, System
Energy dividends its earnings to Entergy Corporation at a percentage determined
monthly.  Currently, all of System Energy's retained earnings are
available for distribution.


System
Energy Resources, Inc.

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

Sources
of Capital

System Energy's sources to meet its
capital requirements include:

·

internally
      generated funds;

·

cash
      on hand;

·

debt
      issuances; and

·

bank
      financing under new or existing
facilities.

System Energy may refinance or redeem
debt prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and
dividend rates are favorable.

All debt and common stock issuances by
System Energy require prior regulatory approval.  Debt issuances are
also subject to issuance tests set forth in its bond indentures and other
agreements.  System Energy has sufficient capacity under these tests
to meet its foreseeable capital needs.

System
Energy has obtained a short-term borrowing authorization from the FERC under
which it may borrow, through October 2011, up to the aggregate amount, at any
one time outstanding, of $200 million.  See Note 4 to the financial
statements for further discussion of System Energy's short-term borrowing
limits.  System Energy has also obtained an order from the FERC
authorizing long-term securities issuances.  The current long-term
authorization extends through July 2011.

System Energy's receivables from the
money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following
years

:

In May
2007, $22.5 million of System Energy's receivable from the money pool was
replaced by a note receivable from Entergy New Orleans.  See Note 4 to
the financial statements for a description of the money pool.

Nuclear
Matters

System
Energy owns and operates Grand Gulf.  System Energy is, therefore,
subject to the risks related to owning and operating a nuclear plant. These
include risks from the use, storage, handling and disposal of high-level and
low-level radioactive materials, regulatory requirement changes, including
changes resulting from events at other plants, limitations on the amounts and
types of insurance commercially available for losses in connection with nuclear
operations, and technological and financial uncertainties related to
decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives, including the
sufficiency of funds in decommissioning trusts.  In the event of an
unanticipated early shutdown of Grand Gulf, System Energy may be required to
provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements
for decommissioning.

Environmental
Risks

System Energy's facilities and
operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having
jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and
hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental
matters.  Management believes that System Energy is in substantial
compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities
and operations.  Because environmental regulations are subject to
change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated.


System
Energy Resources, Inc.

Management's
Financial Discussion and Analysis

Critical Accounting
Estimates

The
preparation of System Energy's financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate
accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a
significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and
cash flows.  Management has identified the following accounting
policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and
measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and there is the
potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could
produce estimates that would have a material impact on the presentation of
System Energy's financial position or results of operations.

Nuclear
Decommissioning Costs

Management's Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the estimates inherent in
accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs.

Qualified
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Entergy
sponsors qualified defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all
employees.  Additionally, Entergy currently provides postretirement
health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees who
reach retirement age while still working for Entergy.  Entergy's
reported costs of providing these benefits, as described in Note 11 to the
financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions
of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial
calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms.  See the "

Critical
Accounting Estimates

" section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries
Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.  Because
of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these
obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy's estimate
of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.

Costs and
Funding

Total
qualified pension cost for System Energy in 2009 was $1.5
million.  System Energy anticipates 2010 qualified pension cost to be
$1.9 million.  System Energy contributed $4.8 million to its qualified
pension plans in 2009 and expects to contribute approximately $12.5 million in
2010 although the required pension contributions will not be known with more
certainty until the January 1, 2010 valuations are completed by April 1,
2010.  Also, guidance pursuant to the Pension Protection Act of 2006
rules, effective for the 2008 plan year and beyond, continues to evolve, be

industry and by congressional lawmakers.  Any changes to the Pension
Protection Act as a result of these discussions and efforts may affect the level
of System Energy’s pension contributions in the future.

Total
postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for System Energy in
2009 were $3.1 million, including $0.9 million in savings due to the estimated
effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies.  System Energy expects
2010 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs to approximate
$3.5 million, including $1.1 million in savings due to the estimated effect of
future Medicare Part D subsidies. System Energy anticipates contributions for
postretirement health care and life insurance benefits costs to be $3.4 million
in 2010.

In
      accordance with Entergy's stock-based compensation plans, Entergy
      periodically grants stock options to key employees, which may be exercised
      to obtain shares of Entergy's common stock.  According to the
      plans, these shares can be newly issued shares, treasury stock, or shares
      purchased on the open market.  Entergy's management has been
      authorized by the Board to repurchase on the open market shares up to an
      amount sufficient to fund the exercise of grants under the
      plans.  In addition to this authority, on January 29, 2007, the
      Board approved a repurchase program under which Entergy is authorized to
      repurchase up to $1.5 billion of its common stock.  In January
      2008, the Board authorized an incremental $500 million share repurchase
      program to enable Entergy to consider opportunistic purchases in response
      to equity market conditions.  In 2009, Entergy repurchased
      7,680,000 shares of common stock under both programs for a total purchase
      price of $613 million.  Entergy completed both the $1.5 billion
      and $500 million programs in the third quarter 2009.  In October
      2009 the Board granted authority for an additional $750 million share
      repurchase program.  See Note 12 to the financial statements for
      additional discussion of the stock-based compensation
    plans.

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures

As of December 31, 2009, evaluations
were performed under the supervision and with the participation of Entergy
Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana,
Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy (each
individually a "Registrant" and collectively the "Registrants") management,
including their respective Chief Executive Officers (CEO) and Chief Financial
Officers (CFO).  The evaluations assessed the effectiveness of the
Registrants' disclosure controls and procedures.  Based on the
evaluations, each CEO and CFO has concluded that, as to the Registrant or
Registrants for which they serve as CEO or CFO, the Registrant's or Registrants'
disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by each Registrant in reports that it files or submits
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission
rules and forms; and that the Registrant's or Registrants' disclosure controls
and procedures are also effective in reasonably assuring that such information
is accumulated and communicated to the Registrant's or Registrants' management,
including their respective CEOs and CFOs, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.

Internal
Control over Financial Reporting

(Entergy
Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana,
Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System
Energy)

The managements of Entergy Corporation,
Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy
Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy (individually
"Registrant" and collectively the "Registrants") are responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
for the Registrants.  Each Registrant's internal control system is
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair
presentation of each Registrant's financial statements presented in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles.

All internal control systems, no matter
how well designed, have inherent limitations.  Therefore, even those
systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with
respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Each Registrant's management assessed
the effectiveness of each Registrant's internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2009.  In making this assessment, each management
used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework.


Based on each management's assessment
and the criteria set forth by COSO, each Registrant's management believes that
each Registrant maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2009.

The Registrants' registered public
accounting firm has issued an attestation report on each Registrant's internal
control over financial reporting.

Changes in Internal Control
over Financial Reporting

Under the supervision and with the
participation of the Registrants' management, including their respective CEOs
and CFOs, the Registrants evaluated changes in internal control over financial
reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2009 and found no
change that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, internal control over financial reporting.

Entergy
Corporation and Subsidiaries

New
Orleans, Louisiana

We have
audited the internal control over financial reporting of Entergy Corporation and
Subsidiaries (the “Corporation”) as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria
established in

Internal
Control —Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Corporation’s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in the accompanying Internal Control over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based
on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or
under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal
financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the
company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because
of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting,
including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of
controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or
detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

In our
opinion, the Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on
the criteria established in

Internal Control —Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission.

We have
also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2009 of the Corporation and our report
dated February 24, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph relating to the
adoption of a new accounting standard regarding non-controlling
interests.

COMPENSATION
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Introduction

In this
section, the salaries and other compensation elements paid in 2009 to the Chief
Executive Officers ("CEOs"), the Principal Financial Officer ("PFO"), the three
other most highly compensated executive officers other than the CEO and PFO
(collectively, the "Named Executive Officers") of each of Entergy Arkansas,
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy
New Orleans and Entergy Texas (the "Subsidiaries") are discussed and
analyzed.  The purpose of this section is to provide investors with
material information necessary to understand the compensation policies for the
Named Executive Officers.  This section should be read in combination
with the more detailed compensation tables and other data presented elsewhere in
this report.  For information regarding the compensation of the named
executive officers of Entergy Corporation, see the Proxy Statement of Entergy
Corporation.

The Named
Executive Officers are identified in the Summary Compensation Table immediately
following this Compensation Discussion and Analysis.  Mr. Leonard, Mr.
Denault and Mr. Smith also serve as executive officers of Entergy
Corporation.  Mr. Leonard, Mr. Denault and Mr. Smith do not receive
additional compensation for serving as Named Executive Officers of the
Subsidiaries.  For more information about the officers of the
Subsidiaries, see Part III, Item 10 of this report.

Executive
Summary

The
compensation program for the Named Executive Officers has been designed to
attract, retain, motivate and reward executives who can contribute to the
long-term success and thereby build value for the shareholders of Entergy
Corporation.

The
executive compensation package is comprised of a combination of short-term and
long-term compensation elements.  Short-term compensation includes
base pay and annual cash bonus awards.  Long-term compensation
includes stock options and performance units.

The
executive compensation program is approved by the Personnel Committee of Entergy
Corporation, which is comprised entirely of independent board
members.


The
following table summarizes the principal factors that are taken into account in
deciding the amount of each compensation element paid or awarded to the
executives:

Compensation
decisions for each executive officer are made after taking into account all
elements of the officer's compensation.  In making compensation
decisions, the same compensation policies are applied to all of the executive
officers; however, the application of these policies results in different
compensation amounts to individual executive officers because of: (i)
differences in roles and responsibilities; (ii) differences in market-based
compensation levels for specific officer positions; (iii) the assessment of
individual performance; and (iv) variations in business unit
performance.

Objectives of the Executive
Compensation Program

·

The
      greatest part of the compensation of the Named Executive Officers should
      be in the form of "at risk" performance-based
  compensation.

The
compensation programs are designed to ensure that a significant percentage of
the total compensation of the Named Executive Officers is contingent on
achievement of performance goals that drive total shareholder return and result
in increases in Entergy Corporation's common stock price.  For
example, each of the annual cash incentive and long-term performance unit
programs is designed to pay out if Entergy Corporation achieves pre-established
performance goals.  Assuming achievement of these performance goals at
target level, approximately 80% of the annual target total compensation
(excluding non-qualified supplemental retirement income) of Entergy
Corporation's Chief Executive Officer is represented by performance-based
compensation and the remaining 20% is represented by base salary.  For
Mr. Denault and Mr. Smith, assuming achievement of performance goals at the
target levels, approximately 65% of the annual target total compensation
(excluding non-qualified supplemental retirement income) is represented by
performance-based compensation and the remaining 35% by base
salary.  For substantially all of the other Named Executive Officers,
assuming achievement of performance goals at the target levels, at


least 50%
of the annual target total compensation (excluding non-qualified supplemental
retirement income) is represented by performance-based compensation and the
remaining 50% by base salary.  Entergy Corporation's Chief Executive
Officer's total compensation is at greater risk than the other Named Executive
Officers, reflecting both market practice and acknowledging the leadership role
of the Chief Executive Officer in setting company policy and
strategies.

·

A
      substantial portion of the Named Executive Officers' compensation should
      be delivered in the form of equity
awards.

To align
the economic interests of the Named Executive Officers with the shareholders of
Entergy Corporation, Entergy Corporation believes a substantial portion of their
total compensation should be in the form of equity-based
awards.  Awards are typically granted in the form of stock options
with a three-year vesting schedule and performance units with a three-year
performance cycle.  Stock options are generally subject only to
time-based vesting. Performance units pay out only if Entergy Corporation
achieves specified performance targets. The amount of payout depends on the
level of performance achieved.

·

The
      compensation programs of Entergy Corporation and the Subsidiaries should
      enable the companies to attract, retain and motivate executive talent by
      offering compensation packages that are competitive but
    fair.

It is in
the shareholders' best interests that Entergy Corporation and the
Subsidiaries

attract and retain
talented executives by offering compensation packages that are competitive, but
fair.  Entergy Corporation's Personnel Committee has sought to develop
compensation programs that deliver total target compensation in aggregate at
approximately the 50

th

percentile of the market.

The Starting
Point

To
develop a competitive compensation program, the Personnel Committee on an annual
basis reviews base salary and other compensation data from two
sources:

·

Survey
      Data

:  The Committee uses published and private
      compensation survey data to develop marketplace compensation levels for
      executive officers.  The data, which is compiled by the
      Committee's independent compensation consultant, compares the current
      compensation levels received by each of the executive officers against the
      compensation levels received by executives holding similar positions at
      companies with corporate revenues consistent with the revenues of Entergy
      Corporation.  For non-industry specific positions such as a
      chief financial officer, the Committee reviews general industry
      data.  For management positions that are industry-specific such
      as Group President, Utility Operations, the Committee reviews data from
      energy services companies.  The survey data reviewed by the
      Committee covers approximately 300 public and private companies in general
      industry and approximately 70 public and private companies in the energy
      services sector.  In evaluating compensation levels against the
      survey data, the Committee considers only the aggregated survey
      data.  The identity of the companies comprising the survey data
      is not disclosed to, or considered by, the Committee in its
      decision-making process and, thus, is not considered material by the
      Committee.

The
Committee uses the survey data to develop compensation programs that deliver
total target compensation at approximately the 50

th

percentile of the surveyed companies. This survey data is used as the primary
data for purposes of determining target compensation.  For this
purpose, the Committee reviews the results of the survey data (organized in
tabular format) comparing each of the Named Executive Officer's compensation
relative to the 25

th

,

th

(or
median) and 75

th

percentile of the surveyed companies.  The Committee considers its
objectives to have been met if Entergy Corporation's Chief Executive Officer,
the executive officers who constitute what is referred to as the Office of the
Chief Executive, considered as a group (9 officers including Mr. Denault and Mr.
Smith) and the other Named Executive Officers have a target compensation package
that falls within the range of 90 - 110 percent of the 50th percentile of the
surveyed companies.  In 2009, in the aggregate the target compensation
of all of the Named Executive Officers fell within this range.  Actual
compensation received by an individual officer may be above or below the 50

th

percentile based on an individual officer's skills, performance and
responsibilities.


·

Proxy
      Analysis

:   Although the survey data described above
      is the primary data source used in determining compensation, the Committee
      reviews data derived from proxy statements as an additional point of
      analysis.  The proxy data is used to compare the compensation
      levels of executive officers against the compensation levels of the
      corresponding executive officers from 18 of the companies included in the
      Philadelphia Utilities Index.  The analysis is used by the
      Committee to evaluate the reasonableness of the Company’s compensation
      program.  The proxy market data compare Entergy executive
      officers to other proxy officers based on pay rank without regard to roles
      and responsibilities.  These companies
  are:

Elements of the Compensation
Program

The major
components of the executive compensation program are presented
below:

Short-Term
Compensation

·

Base
      Salary

Base
salary is a component of each Named Executive Officer's compensation package
because the Committee believes it is appropriate that some portion of the
compensation that is provided to these officers be provided in a form that is a
fixed cash amount.  Also, base salary remains the most common form of
payment throughout all industries.  Its use ensures a competitive
compensation package to the Named Executive Officers.

The
Committee (in the case of Mr. Leonard, Mr. Denault and Mr. Smith) or certain
senior Entergy officers (in the case of the other Named Executive Officers)
determine whether to award Named Executive Officers annual merit increases in
base salary based on the following factors:

·

Entergy
      Corporation, business unit and individual performance during the prior
      year;

·

Market
      data;

·

Internal
      pay equity; and


·

The
      Committee's assessment of other elements of compensation provided to the
      Named Executive Officer.

The
corporate and business unit goals and objectives vary by individual officers and
include, among other things, corporate and business unit financial performance,
capital expenditures, cost containment, safety, reliability, customer service,
business development and regulatory matters.

The use
of "internal pay equity" in setting merit increases is limited to determining
whether a change in an executive officer's role and responsibilities relative to
other executive officers requires an adjustment in the officer's salary. The
Committee has not established any predetermined formula against which the base
salary of one Named Executive Officer is measured against another officer or
employee.

In
January 2009, in light of economic conditions and the projected slow growth in
executive officer salaries in 2009 based on Entergy’s review of general industry
surveys prepared by various human resource consulting firms, the Personnel
Committee decided not to increase the 2009 base salaries of the executive
officers who constitute the Office of the Chief Executive from the 2008 base
salaries.

In
addition, based on the results of this study, the 2009 base salaries for Ms.
Conley, Mr. Domino, Mr. Fisackerly, Mr. McDonald and Mr. West were not
increased.  Ms. Conley, Mr. Domino, Mr. Fisackerly, Mr. McDonald and
Mr. West, however, received a cash bonus in lieu of an increase in their base
salary.  See “2009 Summary Compensation Table” for the amount of the
bonus paid to each of these officers.  Mr. Bunting received a 2.5%
merit increase to his 2008 base salary to reflect comparative market data for
senior accounting officers.  The 2009 base salaries for the Named
Executive Officers were:

Non-Equity
      Incentive Plan (Cash Bonus)

Performance-based
incentives are included in the Named Executive Officers' compensation packages
because it encourages the Named Executive Officers to pursue objectives
consistent with the overall goals and strategic direction that the Entergy board
has set for Entergy Corporation.  Annual incentive plans are commonly
used by companies in a variety of industry sectors to compensate their executive
officers.

The Named
Executive Officers participate in a performance-based cash bonus plan known as
the Executive Annual Incentive Plan or Executive Incentive Plan.  The
Executive Incentive Plan operates on a calendar year basis.  A
performance metric known as the Entergy Achievement Multiplier is used to
determine the payouts for each particular calendar year.  The Entergy
Achievement Multiplier is used to determine the percentage of target annual plan
awards that will be paid each year to each Named Executive
Officer.  In December 2008, the Personnel Committee selected the
performance measures for the Entergy Achievement Multiplier to be based in equal
part on earnings per share and operating cash flow for 2009
awards.  The Committee selected these performance measures
because:

·

earnings
      per share and operating cash flow have both a correlative and causal
      relationship to shareholder value
performance;


·

earnings
      per share and operating cash flow targets are aligned with
      externally-communicated goals; and

·

earnings
      per share and operating cash flow results are readily available in earning
      releases and SEC filings.

In
addition, these measures are commonly used by other companies, including the
industry peer group companies, as components of their incentive
programs.  For example, approximately 56 percent of the industry peer
group companies use earnings per share as an incentive measure and 22 percent
use some type of cash flow measure. The Personnel Committee evaluates and sets
the performance measures used for the Executive Incentive Plan and the
Management Incentive Plan on an annual basis.

The Committee sets minimum and maximum
achievement levels under the Executive Incentive Plan.  Payouts for
performance between minimum and target achievement levels and between target and
maximum levels are calculated using straight line interpolation.  In
general, the Committee seeks to establish target achievement levels such that
the relative difficulty of achieving the target level is consistent from year to
year.  Over the past five years ending with 2009, the average Entergy
Achievement Multiplier was 128% of target.

In
December 2008, the Committee set the 2009 target awards for incentives to be
paid in 2010 under the Executive Incentive Plan.  As a percentage of
base salary, the target awards for certain of Entergy named executive officers
were set as follows:  J. Wayne Leonard, CEO of Entergy Corporation
(120%); Leo P. Denault, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
(70%); and Richard J. Smith, President and Chief Operating Officer of Entergy
Corporation (70%).  The Committee based its decision on the target
awards for Mr. Denault and Mr. Smith on the recommendation of Entergy’s Chief
Executive Officer.

In setting these target awards, the
Personnel Committee considered several factors, including:

·

Analysis
      provided by the Committee's independent compensation consultant as to
      compensation practices at the industry peer group companies and the
      general market for companies the size of Entergy
    Corporation;

·

Competitiveness
      of Entergy Corporation's compensation plans and their ability to attract
      and retain top executive talent;

·

The
      individual performance of each Entergy named executive officer (other than
      the Chief Executive Officer of Entergy Corporation) as evaluated by the
      Chief Executive Officer of Entergy
Corporation;

·

Target
      bonus levels in the market for comparable
  positions;

·

The
      desire to ensure that a substantial portion of total compensation is
      performance-based;

·

The
      relative importance, in any given year, of the short-term performance
      goals established pursuant to the Executive Incentive Plan;
      and

·

The
      Committee's assessment of other elements of compensation provided to the
      Entergy named executive officers.

The
target awards for the other Named Executive Officers were set as
follows:  E. Renae Conley, CEO - Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and CEO
- - Entergy Louisiana (60%); Joseph F. Domino, CEO - Entergy Texas (50%); Hugh T.
McDonald, CEO - Entergy Arkansas (50%); Roderick K. West, CEO - Entergy New
Orleans (40%); Haley Fisackerly, CEO - Entergy Mississippi (40%) and Theodore H.
Bunting – Principal Accounting Officer – the Subsidiaries (60%).

The
target awards for the Named Executive Officers (other than Entergy named
executive officers) were set by their respective supervisors (subject to
ultimate approval of Entergy’s Chief Executive Officer) who allocated a
potential incentive pool established by the Personnel Committee among various of
their direct and indirect reports.  In setting the target awards, the
supervisor took into account considerations similar to those used by the
Personnel Committee in setting the target awards for Entergy’s Named Executive
Officers.


The
Committee established a higher target percentage for Mr. Leonard compared to the
other Named Executive Officers to reflect the following factors:

·

Mr.
      Leonard's leadership and contributions to Entergy Corporation's success as
      measured by, among other things, the overall performance of Entergy
      Corporation.

·

Market
      practices that compensate chief executive officers at greater potential
      compensation levels with more "pay at risk" than other executive
      officers.

·

The
      Personnel Committee's assessment of Mr. Leonard's strong performance based
      on the Board's annual performance evaluation, in which the Board reviews
      and assesses Mr. Leonard's performance based on:  leadership,
      strategic planning, financial results, succession planning, communications
      with all of the stakeholders, external relations with the communities and
      industries in which Entergy Corporation operates and his relationship with
      the Board.

Target
awards are set based on an executive officer’s current position and executive
management level within the Entergy organization.  Executive
management levels at Entergy range from Level 1 thorough Level 4.  Mr.
Denault and Mr. Smith hold positions in Level 2 whereas Mr. Bunting and Ms.
Conley hold positions in Level 3 and Mr. Domino, Mr. Fisackerly, Mr. McDonald
and Mr. West hold positions in Level 4.  Accordingly, their respective
incentive targets differ one from another based on the external market data
developed by the Committee’s independent compensation consultant and the other
factors noted above.

In
January 2009, the Committee determined the Entergy Achievement Multiplier
targets to be used for purposes of establishing annual bonuses for
2009.  The targets established to measure management performance
against as reported results, excluding the impact of activities associated with
the planned separation of our non-utility nuclear business (the “Spin
Transaction”), were:

Minimum

Target

Maximum

Earnings
      Per Share ($)

6.30

7.00

7.70

Operating
      Cash Flow

($
      in Billions)

2.52

2.88

3.24

After
reviewing earnings per share and operating cash flow results against the
performance objectives in the above table and, in accordance with the terms of
the Executive Incentive Plan, adjusting for non-recurring charges for
impairments to the nuclear decommissioning trust, in January 2010, the Personnel
Committee certified the 2009 Entergy Achievement Multiplier at 115% of
target.

Under the terms of the Management
Effectiveness Program, the Entergy Achievement Multiplier is automatically
increased by 25 percent for the members of the Office of the Chief Executive
(including Mr. Leonard, Mr. Denault and Mr. Smith, but not the other Named
Executive Officers), subject to the Personnel Committee's discretion to adjust
the automatic multiplier downward or eliminate it altogether.  In
accordance with Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, the multiplier
which Entergy refers to as the Management Effectiveness Factor is intended to
provide the Committee, through the exercise of negative discretion, a mechanism
to take into consideration the specific achievement factors relating to the
overall performance of Entergy Corporation. In January 2010, the Committee
exercised its negative discretion to eliminate the Management Effectiveness
Factor with respect to the 2009 incentive awards, reflecting the Personnel
Committee's determination that the Entergy Achievement Multiplier, in and of
itself without the Management Effectiveness Factor, was consistent with the
performance levels achieved by management.

The annual incentive awards for the
Named Executive Officers (other than Mr. Leonard, Mr. Denault and Mr. Smith) are
awarded from an incentive pool approved by the Committee.  From this
pool, each named executive officer’s supervisor determines the annual incentive
payment based on the Entergy Achievement Multiplier.  The supervisor
has the discretion to increase or decrease the multiple used to determine an
incentive award based on individual and business unit
performance.  The incentive awards are subject to the ultimate
approval of Entergy’s Chief Executive Officer.

The following table shows the Executive
and Management Incentive Plans payments as a percentage of base salary for 2009

Long-Term
Compensation

Entergy
Corporation's long-term incentive programs are intended to reward the Named
Executive Officers for achievement of shareholder value creation over the
long-term.  In its long-term incentive programs, Entergy Corporation
primarily uses a mix of performance units and stock options in order to
accomplish different objectives.  Performance units reward the Named
Executive Officers on the basis of total shareholder return, which is a measure
of stock appreciation and dividend payments relative to the industry peer group
companies.  Stock options provide a direct incentive for increasing
the price of Entergy Corporation common stock.  In addition, Entergy
Corporation occasionally awards restricted units for retention purposes or to
offset forfeited compensation in order to attract officers and managers from
other companies.

Each of
the performance units, stock options and restricted units granted to the Named
Executive Officers in 2009 were awarded under the 2007 Equity Ownership and Long
Term Cash Incentive Plan of Entergy Corporation, which is referred to as the
2007 Equity Ownership Plan.

·

Performance
      Unit Program

Entergy
Corporation issues performance unit awards to the Named Executive Officers under
its Performance Unit Program.  Each Performance Unit equals the cash
value of one share of Entergy Corporation common stock at the end of the
three-year performance cycle.  Each unit also earns the cash
equivalent of the dividends paid during the performance cycle.  The
Performance Unit Program is structured to reward Named Executive Officers only
if performance goals set by the Personnel Committee are met.  The
Personnel Committee has no discretion to make awards if minimum performance
goals are not achieved. The Performance Unit Program provides a minimum, target
and maximum achievement level.  Performance is measured by assessing
Entergy Corporation's total shareholder return relative to the total shareholder
return of industry peer group companies.  The Personnel Committee
chose total shareholder return as a measure of performance because it assesses
Entergy Corporation's creation of shareholder value relative to other electric
utilities over the performance cycle.  Minimum, target and maximum
performance levels are determined by reference to the quartile ranking of
Entergy Corporation's total shareholder return against the total shareholder
return of industry peer group companies.

For the
2010-2012 performance cycle, the Personnel Committee identified the Philadelphia
Utility Index as the industry peer group for total shareholder return
performance because the companies represented in this index more closely
approximate Entergy Corporation in terms of size. The companies included in the
Philadelphia Utility Index are provided above in the Compensation Discussion and
Analysis under "The Starting Point - Proxy Analysis."

Subject
to achievement of the Performance Unit Program performance levels, the Personnel
Committee established target amounts of 22,300 performance units for
Mr. Leonard; and 5,300 performance units for each of Mr. Denault and Mr.
Smith for the 2010-2012 performance cycle.  The target amounts for the
other Named Executive Officers are as follows:  2,200 performance
units for Ms. Conley and Mr. Bunting; and 1,000 performance units for each
of Mr. Domino, Mr. McDonald, Mr. West, and Mr. Fisackerly.  The range
of payouts under the program is shown below.

The
Personnel Committee sets payout opportunities for the Performance Unit Program
each performance cycle.  In determining payout opportunities, the
Committee considers several factors, including:

·

The
      advice of the Committee's independent compensation consultant regarding
      compensation practices at the industry peer group
    companies;

·

Competitiveness
      of the Entergy Corporation's compensation plans and their ability to
      attract and retain top executive
talent;

·

Target
      long-term compensation values in the market for similar
    jobs;

·

The
      desire to ensure, as described above, that a substantial portion of total
      compensation is performance-based;

·

The
      relative importance, in any given year, of the long-term performance goals
      established pursuant to the Performance Unit Program;
  and

·

The
      Committee's assessment of other elements of compensation provided to the
      Named Executive Officer.

For
      the 2007-2009 performance cycle, the target amounts established in January
      2007 were:

·

23,800
      performance units for Mr. Leonard;

·

4,500
      performance units for Mr. Denault and Mr.
Smith;

·

2,100
      performance units for Ms. Conley and Mr. Bunting;
  and

·

1,000
      performance units for each of Mr. Domino, Mr. McDonald and Mr.
      Fisackerly.

Participants
could earn performance units consistent with the range of payouts as described
above for the 2010-2012 performance cycle. The Committee established a higher
target amount for Mr. Leonard compared to the other Named Executive Officers
based on the following factors:

·

Mr.
      Leonard's leadership and contributions to Entergy Corporation's success as
      measured by, among other things, the overall performance of Entergy
      Corporation.

·

Market
      practices that compensate chief executive officers at greater potential
      compensation levels with more "pay at risk" than other named executive
      officers.

In
January 2010, the Committee assessed Entergy Corporation's total shareholder
return for the 2007-2009 performance period and determined the actual number of
performance units to be paid to Performance Unit Program participants for the
2007-2009 performance cycle.  Performance was measured in a manner
similar to that described above for the 2010-2012 cycle, on the basis of
relative total shareholder return.

For
purposes of determining Entergy Corporation's relative performance for the
2007-2009 performance cycle period, the Committee used the Philadelphia Utility
Index as the peer group.  Based on market data and the recommendation
of management, the Committee compared Entergy Corporation's total shareholder
return against the total shareholder return of the companies that comprised the
Philadelphia Utility Index.

Based on
a comparison of Entergy Corporation's performance relative to the Philadelphia
Utility Index as described above, the Committee concluded that Entergy
Corporation’s performance, for the 2007-2009 performance cycle, ranked in the
third quartile.  This resulted in a payment of 57% of
target.  Each performance unit was then automatically converted into
cash at the rate of $81.84 per unit, the closing price of Entergy Corporation
common stock on the last trading day of the performance cycle (December 31,
2009), plus dividend


equivalents
accrued over the three-year performance cycle.  See the 2009 Option
Exercises and Stock Vested table for the amount paid to each of the Named
Executive Officers for the 2007-2009 performance cycle.

Stock
      Options

The
Personnel Committee and, in the case of the Named Executive Officers (other than
Mr. Leonard, Mr. Denault and Mr. Smith), Entergy’s Chief Executive Officer and
the Named Executive Officer’s supervisor consider several factors in determining
the amount of stock options it will grant under Entergy’s 2007 Equity Ownership
Plan to the Named Executive Officers, including:

·

Individual
      performance;

·

Prevailing
      market practice in stock option
grants;

·

The
      targeted long-term value created by the use of stock
    options;

·

The
      number of participants eligible for stock options, and the resulting "burn
      rate" (i.e., the number of stock options authorized divided by the total
      number of shares outstanding) to assess the potential dilutive effect;
      and

·

The
      Committee's assessment of other elements of compensation provided to the
      Named Executive Officer

For stock
option awards to the Named Executive Officers (other than Mr. Leonard), the
Committee's assessment of individual performance of each Named Executive Officer
in consultation with Entergy Corporation's Chief Executive Officer is the most
important factor in determining the number of options awarded.

The
following table sets forth the number of stock options granted to each Named
Executive Officer in 2009.  The exercise price for each option was
$77.53, which was the closing fair market value of Entergy Corporation common
stock on the date of grant.

The
option grants awarded to the Named Executive Officers (other than Mr. Leonard)
ranged in number between 3,800 and 45,000 shares.  In the case of Mr.
Leonard, who received 125,000 stock options, the Committee took special note of
his performance as Entergy Corporation's Chief Executive
Officer.  Among other things, the Committee noted that the total
shareholder return of Entergy Corporation measured over the nine-year period
between Mr. Leonard's appointment as CEO of Entergy Corporation in January 1999
and the January 29, 2009 grant date exceeded all of the industry peer group
companies as well as all other U.S. utility companies.

For
additional information regarding stock options awarded in 2009 to each of the
Named Executive Officers, see the 2009 Grants of Plan-Based Awards
table.

Under the
2007 Equity Ownership Plan and Entergy’s predecessor equity plans, all options
must have an exercise price equal to the closing fair market value of Entergy
Corporation common stock on the date of grant.  In 2008, Entergy
Corporation implemented guidelines that require an executive officer to achieve
and maintain a level of Entergy Corporation stock ownership equal to a multiple
of his or her salary.  Until an executive officer achieves the
multiple ownership position of Entergy Corporation common stock,
the


executive
officer (including a Named Executive Officer) upon exercising any stock option
granted on or after January 1, 2003, must retain at least 75% of the after-tax
net profit from such stock option exercise in the form of Entergy Corporation
common stock.

Entergy
Corporation has not adopted a formal policy regarding the granting of options at
times when it is in possession of material non-public
information.  However, Entergy Corporation generally grants options to
Named Executive Officers only during the month of January in connection with its
annual executive compensation decisions.  On occasion, it may grant
options to newly hired employees or existing employees for retention or other
limited purposes.

·

Restricted
      Units

Restricted
units granted under the 2007 Equity Ownership Plan represent phantom shares of
Entergy Corporation common stock (i.e., non-stock interests that have an
economic value equivalent to a share of Entergy Corporation common
stock).  Entergy Corporation occasionally grants restricted units for
retention purposes, to offset forfeited compensation from a previous employer or
for other limited purposes.  If all conditions of the grant are
satisfied, restrictions on the restricted units lift at the end of the
restricted period, and a cash equivalent value of the restricted units is
paid.  The settlement price is equal to the number of restricted units
multiplied by the closing price of Entergy Corporation common stock on the date
restrictions lift.  Restricted units are not entitled to dividends or
voting rights.  Restricted units are generally time-based awards for
which restrictions lift, subject to continued employment, over a two- to
five-year period.

In
December 2009, the Committee granted Mr. Leonard, Entergy’s Chief Executive
Officer, 100,000 restricted units.  The Committee granted Mr. Leonard
these restricted units in recognition of the importance of his continued
exemplary leadership as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and to encourage
the retention of his leadership in light of the numerous strategic challenges
facing the Company, including the challenges associated with the completion of
the Spin Transaction.  The Committee also took into account the
competitive market for chief executive officers.  In determining the
size of the grant, the Committee consulted its independent consultant to confirm
that the grant was consistent with market practices.  The Committee
also noted, based on the advice of its independent consultant, that such grants
are a commonly used market technique for retention purposes.

The
restricted units will vest in two equal installments of 50,000 units each on
December 3, 2011 and December 3, 2012.  On each vesting date, Entergy
will pay to Mr. Leonard, subject to payment of withholding taxes, a cash amount
equal to the closing price of a share of Entergy’s common stock on that
date.  Under certain conditions, including a termination of employment
without cause, death or disability, Mr. Leonard’s restricted stock units may
vest on an earlier date.

No other
Named Executive Officers received restricted units during 2009.

Benefits, Perquisites,
Agreements and Post-Termination Plans

·

Pension
      Plan, Pension Equalization Plan and System Executive Retirement
      Plan

The Named Executive Officers
participate in an Entergy Corporation-sponsored pension plan that covers a broad
group of employees.  This pension plan is a funded, tax-qualified,
noncontributory defined benefit pension plan.  Benefits under the
pension plan are based upon an employee's years of service with an Entergy
system company and the employee's average monthly rate of “Eligible Earnings”
(which generally includes the employee’s salary and eligible incentive awards,
other than incentive awards paid under the Executive Incentive Plan) for the
highest consecutive 60 months during the 120 months preceding termination of
employment.  Benefits under the tax-qualified plan are payable monthly
after separation from an Entergy system company.  The amount of annual
earnings that may be considered in calculating benefits under the tax-qualified
pension plan is limited by federal law.

Benefits
under the tax-qualified pension plan in which the Named Executive Officer
participates are calculated as an annuity equal to 1.5% of a participant's
Eligible Earnings multiplied by years of service.  Years of service
under the pension plan formula cannot exceed 40.  Contributions to the
pension plan are made entirely by the employer and are paid into a trust fund
from which the benefits of participants will be paid.

Entergy
Corporation sponsors a Pension Equalization Plan, which is available to a select
group of management and highly compensated employees, including the Named
Executive Officers (other than our Chief Executive Officer).  The
Pension Equalization Plan is a non-qualified unfunded supplemental retirement
plan that provides for the payment to participants from an Entergy System
employer's general assets a single lump sum cash distribution upon separation
from service generally equal to the actuarial present value of the difference
between the amount that would have been payable as an annuity under the
tax-qualified pension plan, but for Internal Revenue Code limitations on pension
benefits and earnings that may be considered in calculating tax-qualified
pension benefits, and the amount actually payable as an annuity under the
tax-qualified pension plan.  The Pension Equalization Plan also takes
into account as “Eligible Earnings” any incentive awards paid under the
Executive Incentive Plan.

Entergy
Corporation also sponsors a System Executive Retirement Plan, which is available
to the Company's approximately 60 officers, including the Named Executive
Officers (other than Entergy’s Chief Executive
Officer).  Participation in the System Executive Retirement Plan
requires individual approval by the plan administrator.  An employee
participating in both the System Executive Retirement Plan and the Pension
Equalization Plan is eligible to receive only the greater of the two single-sum
benefits computed in accordance with the terms and conditions of each
plan.


Like the
Pension Equalization Plan, the System Executive Retirement Plan is designed to
provide for the payment to participants from an Entergy System employer’s
general assets a single-sum cash distribution upon separation from
service.  The single-sum benefit is generally equal to the actuarial
present value of a specified percentage of the participant’s “Final Average
Monthly Compensation” (which is generally 1/36th of the sum of the participant's
annual rate of base salary and Executive Incentive Plan award for the 3 highest
years during the last 10 years preceding termination of employment), after first
being reduced by the value of the participant’s tax-qualified Pension Plan
benefit and typically any prior employer pension benefit available to the
participant.  While the System Executive Retirement Plan has a
replacement schedule from one year of service to the maximum of 30 years of
service, the table below offers a sample ratio at 20 and 30 years of
service.

Mr.
Leonard's retention agreement (as further discussed below) provides that, in
lieu of his participation in the Pension Equalization Plan and the System
Executive Retirement Plan, upon the termination of his employment (unless such
termination is for Cause, as defined in the agreement), he will be entitled to
receive a benefit equal to 60% of his Final Average Compensation (as described
in the description of the System Executive Retirement Plan above) calculated as
a single life annuity and payable as an actuarial equivalent lump
sum.  This benefit will be reduced by other benefits to which he is
entitled from any Entergy Corporation-sponsored pension plan or prior employer
pension plans. The terms of Mr. Leonard's Supplemental Retirement Benefit were
negotiated at the time of his employment with Entergy Corporation and were
designed to, among other things, offset the loss of benefits resulting from Mr.
Leonard's resignation from his prior employer.  At the time that
Entergy Corporation recruited Mr. Leonard, he had accumulated twenty-five years
of seniority with his prior employer and had served as an executive officer for
that employer for over ten years and in an officer-level capacity for over
fifteen years.

The
Committee believes that the Pension Plan, Pension Equalization Plan and System
Executive Retirement Plan are an important part of the Named Executive Officers'
compensation program.  These plans are important in the recruitment of
top talent in the competitive market, as these types of supplemental plans are
typically found in companies of similar size to Entergy
Corporation.  These plans serve a critically important role in the
retention of senior executives, as benefits from these plans generally increase
for each year that these executives remain employed by an Entergy system
company. The plans thereby encourage the most senior executives to remain
employed within the Entergy system and continue their work on behalf of Entergy
Corporation's shareholders.

The
Entergy System company employer of Ms. Conley, Mr. Smith and Mr. Denault has
agreed to provide service credit to each of them under either the Pension
Equalization Plan or the System Executive Retirement Plan. Entergy System
company employers typically offer these service credit benefits as one element
of the total compensation package offered to new mid-level or senior executives
that are recruited from other companies.  By offering these executives
"credited service," Entergy Corporation is able to compete more effectively to
hire these employees by mitigating the potential loss of their pension benefits
resulting from accepting employment within the Entergy system.

See the
2009 Pension Benefits table for additional information regarding the operation
of the plans described under this caption.


·

Savings
      Plan

The Named
Executive Officers are eligible to participate in an Entergy
Corporation-sponsored Savings Plan that covers a broad group of
employees.  This is a tax-qualified retirement savings plan, wherein
total combined before-tax and after-tax contributions may not exceed 30 percent
of a participant's base salary up to certain contribution limits defined by law.
In addition, under the Savings Plan, the participant's employer matches an
amount equal to seventy cents for each dollar contributed by participating
employees, including the Named Executive Officers, on the first six percent of
their Earnings (as defined in the Savings Plan) for that pay
period.  Entergy Corporation maintains the Savings Plan for employees
of participating Entergy System companies, including the Named Executive
Officers, because it wishes to encourage employees to save some percentage of
their cash compensation for their eventual retirement.  The Savings
Plan permits employees to make such savings in a manner that is relatively tax
efficient.  This type of savings plan is also a critical element in
attracting and retaining talent in a competitive market.

·

Executive
      Deferred Compensation

The Named
Executive Officers are eligible to defer up to 100% of the following into the
Entergy Corporation-sponsored Executive Deferred Compensation Plan:

·

Base
      Salary

·

Executive
      Incentive Plan Bonus

·

Performance
      Unit Program Awards

The Named
Executive Officers also are eligible to defer up to 100% of the following
payments into the 2007 Equity Ownership Plan:

·

Executive
      Incentive Plan Bonus

·

Performance
      Unit Program Awards

Amounts
deferred under the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan and 2007 Equity
Ownership Plan are subject to limitations prescribed by law and the respective
plan.

Additionally, Mr. Leonard currently has
deferred account balances under a frozen Defined Contribution Restoration
Plan.  These amounts are deemed invested in the options available
under this Defined Contribution Plan.  The Defined Contribution Plan,
until it was frozen in 2005, credited eligible employees deferral accounts with
employer contributions to the extent contributions were limited under the
qualified savings plan in which the employee participated were subject to
limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.

All
deferral amounts represent an unfunded liability of the
employer.  Amounts deferred into the 2007 Equity Ownership Plan are
deemed invested in phantom shares of Entergy Corporation common
stock.  Amounts deferred under the Executive Deferred Compensation
Plan are deemed invested in one or more of the investment options (generally
mutual funds) offered under the Savings Plan.  Within the Executive
Deferred Compensation Plan, the Named Executive Officer may move funds from one
deemed investment option to another.

The
employer does not "match" amounts that are deferred by employees pursuant to the
Executive Deferred Compensation Plan or 2007 Equity Ownership
Plan.  With the exception of allowing for the deferral of federal and
state taxes, Entergy Corporation provides no additional benefit to the Named
Executive Officer for deferring any of the above payments.  Any
increase in value of the deferred amounts results solely from the increase in
value of the investment options selected (phantom Entergy Corporation common
stock or mutual funds available under the Savings Plan). Deferred amounts are
credited with earnings or losses based on the rate of return of deemed
investment options or Entergy Corporation common stock, as selected by the
participants.

Entergy
Corporation provides this benefit because the Committee believes it is standard
market practice to permit officers to defer the cash portion of their
compensation.  The Executive Deferred Compensation Plan and 2007
Equity Ownership Plan permit them to do this while also receiving gains or
losses on deemed investments, as described
above.  Entergy


Corporation
believes that providing this benefit is important as a retention and recruitment
tool as many, if not all, of the companies with which Entergy Corporation and
the Subsidiaries compete for executive talent provide a similar arrangement to
their senior employees.

·

Health
      & Welfare Benefits

The Named
Executive Officers are eligible to participate in various health and welfare
benefits available to a broad group of employees.  These benefits
include medical, dental and vision coverage, life and accidental death &
dismemberment insurance and long-term disability
insurance.  Eligibility, coverage levels, potential employee
contributions and other plan design features are the same for the Named
Executive Officers as for the broad employee population.

·

Executive Long

-

Term Disability
      Program

All
executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers, are eligible to
participate in the Entergy Corporation-sponsored Executive Long-Term Disability
program.  Individuals who elect to participate in this plan and become
disabled under the terms of the plan are eligible for 65 percent of the
difference between their base salary and $275,000 (i.e. the base salary that
produces the maximum $15,000 monthly disability payment under the Entergy
Corporation's general long-term disability plan).

·

Perquisites

Entergy
Corporation provides the Named Executive Officers with certain perquisites and
other personal benefits as part of providing a competitive executive
compensation program and for employee retention.  However, perquisites
are not a material part of the compensation program for the Named Executive
Officers.  In 2009, Entergy Corporation offered to the Named Executive
Officers limited benefits such as the following: corporate aircraft usage,
personal financial counseling, club dues and annual physical exams (which are
mandatory for Entergy’s named executive officers).  For security and
business reasons, Entergy Corporation permits its Chief Executive Officer to use
its corporate aircraft at Entergy Corporation expense for personal
use.  The other Named Executive Officers may use corporate aircraft
for personal travel subject to the approval of Entergy Corporation's Chief
Executive Officer. The Personnel Committee reviews all perquisites, including
the use of corporate aircraft, on an annual basis.  For additional
information regarding perquisites, see the "All Other Compensation" column in
the Summary Compensation table.

·

Retention
      Agreements and other Compensation
Arrangements

The
Committee believes that retention and transitional compensation arrangements are
an important part of overall compensation. The Committee believes that these
arrangements help to secure the continued employment and dedication of the Named
Executive Officers, notwithstanding any concern that they might have at the time
of a change in control regarding their own continued employment. In addition,
the Committee believes that these arrangements are important as recruitment and
retention devices, as all or nearly all of the companies with which Entergy
Corporation and the Subsidiaries compete for executive talent have similar
arrangements in place for their senior employees.

To
achieve these objectives, Entergy Corporation has established a System Executive
Continuity Plan under which each of the Named Executive Officers is entitled to
receive "change in control" payments and benefits if such officer's employment
is involuntarily terminated for similar qualifying events or
circumstances.  Based on the market data provided by its independent
compensation consultant, the Committee believes the benefits and payment levels
under the System Executive Continuity Plan are consistent with market
practices.

In
certain cases, the Committee may approve the execution of a retention agreement
with an individual executive officer.  These decisions are made on a
case by case basis to reflect specific retention needs or other factors,
including market practice.  If a retention agreement is entered into
with an individual officer, the Committee considers the economic value
associated with that agreement in making overall compensation decisions for the
affected officer.  Entergy Corporation has voluntarily adopted a
policy that any severance arrangements providing benefits in excess of 2.99
times an officer's annual base salary and bonus must be approved by its
shareholders.


Severance
payments under the System Executive Retirement Plan are based on the sum of an
executive officer’s base salary plus awards granted under the Executive
Incentive Plan.  Revenue Ruling 2008-13 provides that compensation
will not be treated as performance-based under Section 162(m) if it is payable
regardless of actual performance in the event of termination by a company
without “cause,” by the executive with “good reason” or an executive’s
retirement.  Effective January 1, 2010, Entergy amended the System
Executive Continuity Plan to allow incentive payments under the Executive
Incentive Plan to continue to be considered performance-based under Section
162(m).  With this amendment, severance payments will be calculated
based on the sum of (a) base salary plus (b) the higher of: (i) the annual
incentive award actually awarded to the executive office under the Executive
Incentive Plan for the fiscal year immediately preceding the fiscal year in
which the termination of employment occurs or (ii) the average Executive
Incentive Plan award for the two fiscal years immediately preceding the fiscal
year in which the termination of employment occurs.

At
present, Entergy Corporation has entered into a retention agreement with two of
the Named Executive Officers, Mr. Leonard and Mr. Denault.  In
general, these retention agreements provide for "change in control" payments and
other benefits in lieu of to those provided under the System Executive
Continuity Plan.  The retention agreements entered into with Mr.
Leonard and Mr. Denault reflect, among other things, the competition for chief
executive officer and chief financial officer talent in the market place and the
Committee's assessment of the critical role of these officers in executing
Entergy Corporation's long-term financial and other strategic
objectives.  Effective January 1, 2010, Entergy made amendments
similar to those made to the System Executive Continuity Plan to Mr. Denault’s
and Mr. Leonard’s retention agreements to allow incentive payments under the
Executive Incentive Plan to continue to be considered performance based under
Section 162(m).  Based on market data provided by its independent
compensation consultant, the Personnel Committee believes the benefits and
payment levels under these retention agreements are consistent with market
practices.

On
December 18, 2009, Entergy entered into a retention agreement with Richard J.
Smith, its President and Chief Operating Officer.  This agreement
provides for Mr. Smith’s continued employment and the payment of certain
compensation to Mr. Smith in the event the planned Spin Transaction does not
occur.  The agreement provides that in such event, Mr. Smith will
continue to be employed by an Entergy System Company at a management level and
with a salary no less than Mr. Smith’s current management level and salary and
that his duties will include, among other things, coordinating the orderly
unwinding of the preparations for the contemplated Spin
Transaction.  In addition, the agreement provides that  Mr.
Smith will be entitled to receive a lump sum cash payment equal to 1.5 times his
base salary as of the date of separation from Entergy if either (i) he
remains continuously employed in such capacity for 24 months after any public
announcement that the Spin Transaction will not occur or (ii) he remains
continuously employed in such capacity for at least six (6) months after any
such public announcement and thereafter retires with the consent of Entergy’s
Chief Executive Officer  prior to reaching such 24 months of service.
Entergy entered into this agreement with Mr. Smith in light of Mr. Smith’s
leadership role in the preparations for the Spin Transaction and the critical
role that Mr. Smith would have in dismantling these preparations should the Spin
Transaction not occur.  In determining the type and size of the amount
of payment under this agreement, the Personnel Committee consulted with its
independent compensation consultant to confirm that the economic value of this
arrangement was consistent with market practices.

For
additional information regarding the System Executive Continuity Plan and Mr.
Leonard’s and Mr. Denault’s retention agreement described above, see "Potential
Payments upon Termination or Change in Control."

Compensation Program
Administration

Role
of Personnel Committee

The
Personnel Committee has overall responsibility for approving the compensation
program for the Named Executive Officers and makes all final compensation
decisions regarding Entergy Corporation's named executive
officers.  The Personnel Committee is responsible for, among its other
duties, the following actions related to Entergy Corporation's named executive
officers:


·

developing
      and implementing compensation policies and programs for the executive
      officers, including any employment agreement with an executive
      officer;

·

evaluating
      the performance of Entergy Corporation's Chairman and Chief Executive
      Officer; and

·

reporting,
      at least annually, to the Board on succession planning, including
      succession planning for Entergy Corporation's Chief Executive
      Officer.

The
Personnel Committee has authorized, in limited circumstances, the delegation of
its authority to grant stock options under Entergy plans to Entergy
Corporation's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Senior Vice President of
Human Resources and Administration subject to the following
conditions:

·

No
      grant may exceed an aggregate value of $1 million per
    grantee;

·

All
      awards must be issued in accordance with the terms of Entergy
      Corporation's plans, including the requirement that all options be issued
      for an exercise price not less than the fair market value of the stock on
      date the option is granted;

·

No
      awards may be granted to any employee of Entergy Corporation subject to
      Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934;
  and

·

The
      Personnel Committee must be advised on at least a quarterly basis of the
      grants made under the exercise of this delegated
  authority.

Certain
aspects of the compensation of officers who are not Entergy named executive
officers, Mr. Bunting, Ms. Conley, Mr. Domino, Mr. Fisackerly and Mr. McDonald
are not directly determined by the Personnel Committee.  While the
Committee does determine the number of performance units to be granted to these
Named Executive Officers, the Committee does not determine the actual annual
incentive target for these Named Executive Officers.  Rather, the
Committee establishes an overall available annual incentive pool for these
officers and establishes the specific goal targets and ranges, the officers’
respective supervisor determines the actual incentive payment, in each case,
subject to the ultimate approval of Entergy’s Chief Executive Officer. Further,
Entergy’s Chief Executive Officer and the officer’s supervisor have ultimate
responsibility for adjusting the salary of these Named Executive Officers as
deemed appropriate.  The officer’s supervisor and Entergy’s Chief
Executive Officer also determine how many stock option awards are to be
allocated to the Named Executive Officers from an available pool established by
the Personnel Committee for similarly situated officers, though the Personnel
Committee ultimately approves the options granted.

Role
of Chief Executive Officer

The
Personnel Committee solicits recommendations from Mr. Leonard, Entergy
Corporation's Chief Executive Officer, with respect to compensation decisions
for Mr. Denault and Mr. Smith.  Mr. Leonard's role is limited
to:

·

providing
      the Committee with an assessment of the performance of Mr. Denault and Mr.
      Smith; and

·

recommending
      base salary, annual merit increases, stock option and annual cash
      incentive plan compensation amounts for these
  officers.

In
addition, the Committee may request that Mr. Leonard provide management feedback
and recommendations on changes in the design of compensation programs, such as
special retention plans or changes in structure of bonus
programs.  Mr. Leonard does not play any role with respect to any
matter affecting his own compensation nor does he have any role determining or
recommending the amount, or form, of director compensation.

As noted
above, under “Role of Personnel Committee,” Mr. Leonard also plays a role in
determining the Subsidiary Named Executive Officers’ base salary, their annual
incentive target and the number of stock options they receive.

Mr.
Leonard may attend committee meetings of the Personnel Committee only at the
invitation of the chair of the Personnel Committee and cannot call a meeting of
the Committee.  However, he is not in attendance at any meeting when
the Committee determines and approves the compensation to be paid to the Named
Executive Officers.  Since he is not a member of the Committee, he has
no vote on matters submitted to the Committee.  During 2009, Mr.
Leonard attended five meetings of the Personnel Committee.


In 2009,
the Committee's compensation consultant met at the request of the Personnel
Committee with Mr. Leonard to review market trends in executive and management
compensation and to discuss Entergy Corporation and its Subsidiaries’ overall
compensation philosophy, such as the optimum balance between base and incentive
compensation.  In addition, the Committee requested that its
independent compensation consultant interview Mr. Leonard to obtain management
feedback on the impact of compensation programs on employees and information
regarding the roles and responsibilities of the Named Executive
Officers.

Role
of the Compensation Consultant

In
discharging its duties, the Personnel Committee has retained Towers Watson,
formerly Towers Perrin, as its independent compensation consultant to assist it
in, among other things, evaluating different compensation programs and
developing market data to assess the compensation programs. Under the terms of
its engagement, Towers Watson reports directly to the Personnel Committee, which
has the right to retain or dismiss the consultant without the consent of Entergy
Corporation's management.  In addition, the consent of the Personnel
Committee must be obtained before Towers Watson can accept any material
engagements from Entergy Corporation’s management.

In
considering the appointment of Towers Watson, the Personnel Committee took into
account that Towers Watson provides from time to time general consulting
services to Entergy Corporation's management with respect to non-executive
compensation matters.  In this connection the Committee reviewed the
fees and compensation received by Towers Watson for these services over a
historical period.  After considering the nature and scope of these
engagements and the fee arrangements involved, the Personnel Committee
determined that the engagements did not create a conflict of
interest.  The Committee reviews on an ongoing basis the fees and
compensation received by Towers Watson for non-executive compensation matters on
an annual basis to monitor its independence. In 2009, Entergy incurred in the
aggregate fees of $234,668 from Towers Watson for determining or recommending
the amount or form of executive and director compensation and $1,363,128 for
other services, $1,141,054 of which was for services related to the Spin
Transaction.

Tax and Accounting
Considerations

Section
162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code limits the tax deductibility by a publicly
held corporation of compensation in excess of $1 million paid to a Chief
Executive Officer or any of its other Named Executive Officers (other than the
chief financial officer), unless that compensation is "performance-based
compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m). The Personnel Committee
considers deductibility under Section 162(m) as it structures the compensation
packages that are provided to Entergy’s Named Executive Officers. However, the
Personnel Committee and the Board believe that it is in the best interest of
Entergy Corporation that the Personnel Committee retains the flexibility and
discretion to make compensation awards, whether or not deductible. This
flexibility is necessary to foster achievement of performance goals established
by the Personnel Committee as well as other corporate goals that the Committee
deems important to Entergy Corporation and the Subsidiaries' success, such as
encouraging employee retention and rewarding achievement.

Likewise,
the Personnel Committee considers financial accounting consequences as it
structures the compensation packages that are provided to Entergy’s Named
Executive Officers.  However, the Personnel Committee and the Entergy
Board of Directors believe that it is in the best interest of Entergy that the
Personnel Committee retains the flexibility and discretion to make compensation
awards regardless of their financial accounting consequences.


PERSONNEL
COMMITTEE REPORT

The "Personnel Committee Report"
included in the Entergy Corporation Proxy Statement is incorporated by
reference, but will not be deemed to be "filed" in this Annual Report on Form
10-K.  None of the Subsidiaries has a compensation committee, or other
board committee performing equivalent functions.  The board of
directors of each of the Subsidiaries is comprised of individuals who are
officers or employees of Entergy Corporation or one of the
Subsidiaries.  These boards do not make determinations regarding the
compensation paid to executive officers of the Subsidiaries.

EXECUTIVE
COMPENSATION TABLES

Summary Compensation Table

The following table summarizes the
total compensation paid or earned by each of the Named Executive Officers for

For
security and business reasons, Entergy Corporation permits Mr. Leonard to use
its corporate aircraft for personal use at the expense of Entergy
Corporation.  The other Named Executive Officers may use the corporate
aircraft for personal travel subject to the approval of Entergy Corporation's
Chief Executive Officer.  The aggregate incremental aircraft usage
cost associated with Mr. Leonard's personal use of  the corporate
aircraft, including the costs associated with travel to outside board meetings,
was $26,869 for fiscal year 2009.  These amounts are reflected in
column (i) and the total above.  The incremental cost to Entergy
Corporation for use of the corporate aircraft is based on the variable
operational costs of each flight, including fuel, maintenance, flight crew
travel expense, catering, communications and fees, including flight planning,
ground handling and landing permits.

None of
the other individual perquisites items exceeded $25,000 for any of the Named
Executive Officers.

Ms.
      Conley entered into an agreement granting 16.52 additional years of

During
      2006, Mr. Denault entered into an agreement granting an additional 15

      if he continues to work for an Entergy System company employer until age
      55.  The additional 15 years of service increases the present
      value of his benefit by $1,431,700.


(4)

Pursuant
      to his retention agreement, Mr. Leonard is entitled to a non-qualified
      supplemental retirement benefit in lieu of participation in Entergy
      Corporation's non-qualified supplemental retirement plans such as the
      System Executive Retirement Plan or the Pension Equalization
      Plan.  Mr. Leonard may separate from employment without a
      reduction in his non-qualified supplemental retirement
      benefit.

(5)

Mr.
      Smith entered into an agreement granting 22.92 additional years of service
      under the non-qualified Pension Equalization Plan providing an additional
      $999,300 above the accumulated benefit he would receive under the
      non-qualified System Executive Retirement
Plan.

Qualified
Retirement Benefits

The
qualified retirement plan is a funded defined benefit pension plan that provides
benefits to most of the non-bargaining unit employees of Entergy System
companies.  All Named Executive Officers are participants in this
plan.  The pension plan provides a monthly benefit payable for the
participant's lifetime beginning at age 65 and equal to 1.5% of the
participant's five-year average monthly eligible earnings times such
participant's years of service.  Participants are 100% vested in their
benefit upon completing 5 years of vesting service.

Normal
retirement under the plan is age 65.  Employees who terminate
employment prior to age 55 may receive a reduced deferred vested retirement
benefit payable as early as age 55 that is actuarially equivalent to the normal
retirement benefit (i.e., reduced by 7% per year for the first 5 years preceding
age 65, and reduced by 6% for each additional year thereafter). Employees who
are at least age 55 with 10 years of vesting service upon termination from
employment are entitled to a subsidized early retirement benefit beginning as
early as age 55.  The subsidized early retirement benefit is equal to
the normal retirement benefit reduced by 2% per year for each year that early
retirement precedes age 65.

Mr.
Domino, Mr. Leonard and Mr. Smith are eligible for subsidized early retirement
benefits.

Nonqualified
Retirement Benefits

The Named
Executive Officers are eligible to participate in certain nonqualified
retirement benefit plans that provide retirement income, including the Pension
Equalization Plan and the System Executive Retirement Plan.  Each of
these plans is an unfunded nonqualified defined benefit pension plan that
provides benefits to key management employees.  In these plans, each
described below and in Compensation Discussion and Analysis, an executive is
typically enrolled in one or more plans but only paid the amount due under the
plan that provides the highest benefit.  In general, upon disability,
participants in the Pension Equalization Plan and the System Executive
Retirement Plan remain eligible for continued service credits until recovery or
retirement.  Generally, spouses of participants who die before
commencement of benefits may be eligible for a portion of the participant's
accrued benefit.

The
Pension Equalization Plan

All of
the Named Executive Officers (with the exception of Mr. Leonard) are
participants in the Pension Equalization Plan.  The benefit provisions
are substantially the same as the qualified retirement plan but provide two
additional benefits: (a) "restorative benefits" intended to offset limitations
on certain earnings that may be considered in connection with the qualified
retirement plan and (b) supplemental credited service (if granted to an
individual participant).  The benefits under this plan are offset by
benefits payable from the qualified retirement plan and may be offset by prior
employer benefits.  Participants receive their Pension Equalization
Plan benefit in the form of a single sum cash distribution.  The
Pension Equalization Plan benefit attributable to supplemental credited service
is not vested until age 65.  Subject to the approval of the Entergy
System company employer, an employee who terminates employment prior to age 65
may be vested in his or her benefit, with payment of the lump sum benefit
generally at separation from service unless delayed six months under Internal
Revenue Code Section 409A.  Benefits payable prior to age 65 are
subject to the same reductions as qualified plan benefits.


The
System Executive Retirement Plan

All Named
Executive Officers (except Mr. Leonard) are participants in the System Executive
Retirement Plan.  The System Executive Retirement Plan provides for a
single sum payment at age 65, as further described in Compensation Discussion
and Analysis.  The System Executive Retirement Plan benefit is not
vested until age 65.  Subject to the approval of the Entergy System
company employer, an employee who terminates his or her employment prior to age
65 may be vested in the System Executive Retirement Plan benefit, with payment
of the lump sum benefit generally at separation from service unless delayed six
months under Internal Revenue Code Section 409A.  Benefits payable prior to
age 65 are subject to the same reductions as qualified plan benefits. 
Further, in the event of a change in control, participants whose employment is
terminated without “Cause” or for “Good Reason,” as defined in the Plan are also
eligible for a subsidized lump sum benefit payment, even if they do not
currently meet the age or service requirements for early retirement under that
plan or have company permission to separate from employment. Such lump sum
benefit is payable generally at separation from service unless delayed 6 months
under Internal Revenue Code Section 409A.

Mr.
Leonard's Nonqualified Supplemental Retirement Benefit

Mr.
Leonard's retention agreement provides that if his employment with the Company
is terminated for any reason other than for cause (as defined below under
“Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control”), he will be entitled
to a non-qualified supplemental retirement benefit in lieu of participation in
Entergy Corporation's non-qualified supplemental retirement plans such as the
System Executive Retirement Plan or the Pension Equalization
Plan.  Mr. Leonard's non-qualified supplemental retirement benefit is
calculated as a single life annuity equal to 60% of his final three-year average
compensation (as described in the description of the System Executive Retirement
Plan included in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis), reduced to account
for benefits payable to Mr. Leonard under Entergy Corporation's and a former
employer's qualified pension plans.  The benefit is payable in a
single lump sum.  Because Mr. Leonard has already attained the age of 55,
he is currently entitled under his retention agreement to his non-qualified
supplemental retirement benefit if he were to leave Entergy System company
employment other than as the result of a termination for cause.

Additional
Information

For a
description of the material terms and conditions of payments and benefits
available under the retirement plans, including each plan's normal retirement
payment and benefit, benefit formula and eligibility standards, specific
elements of compensation included in applying the payment and benefit formula,
and Entergy Corporation's policies with regard to granting extra years of
credited service, see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis -- Benefits,
Perquisites, Agreements and Post-Termination Plans -- Pension Plan, Pension
Equalization Plan and System Executive Retirement Plan."  For a
discussion of the relevant assumptions used in valuing these liabilities, see
Note 11 to the Financial Statements.


Nonqualified Deferred Compensation

The following tables provide
information regarding the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, the Amended and
Restated 1998 Equity Ownership Plan of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries (the
1998 Equity Ownership Plan) and the 2007 Equity Ownership Plan, which allow for
the deferral of compensation for the Named Executive Officers.

For additional
information, see "Benefits, Perquisites, Agreements and Post-Termination Plans -
Executive Deferred Compensation" in Compensation Discussion and
Analysis.  All Named Executive Officers are eligible to participate in
the deferral programs.

Additionally,
some of the Named Executive Officers have deferred account balances under a
frozen Defined Contribution Restoration Plan.  These amounts are
deemed invested in the options available under this Defined Contribution
Restoration Plan. The Defined Contribution Restoration Plan, until it was frozen
in 2005, credited eligible employees' deferral accounts with employer
contributions to the extent contributions under the qualified savings plan in
which the employee participated were subject to limitations imposed by the
Internal Revenue Code.

All deferrals are credited to the
applicable Entergy System company employer's non-funded liability
account.  Depending on the plan under which the deferral is made, the
Named Executive Officers may elect investment in either phantom Entergy
Corporation common stock or one or more of several investment options available
under the Savings Plan.  Within limitations of the program,
participating Named Executive Officers may move funds from one deemed investment
option to another.  The participating Named Executive Officers do not
have the ability to withdraw funds from the deemed investment accounts except
within the terms provided in their deferral elections.   Within
the limitations prescribed by law as well as the program, participating Named
Executive Officers have the option to make a successive deferral of these
funds.   Assuming a Named Executive Officer does not elect a
successive deferral, the Entergy System company employer of the participant is
obligated to pay the amount credited to the participant's account at the earlier
of deferral receipt date or separation from service.  These payments
are paid out of the general assets of the employer and are payable in a lump
sum.

FICA and Medicare taxes are paid on all
deferred amounts prior to their deferral.  Applicable federal and
state taxes are paid at the time the deferred amounts are paid to the
participant.  Employees are not eligible for a "match" of amounts that
are deferred by them pursuant to the deferred compensation
programs.  With the exception of allowing for the deferral of federal
and state taxes, the Entergy System company employer provides no additional
benefit to the Named Executive Officers in connection with amounts deferred
under the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan.  The deemed investment
options available to participating Named Executive Officers are limited to
certain deemed investment options available to all non-officer employees under
the Savings Plan.  Deferred amounts are deemed credited with earnings
or losses based on the rate of return of deemed investment options (under the
Executive Deferred Compensation Plan) or Entergy Corporation common stock (under
the Equity Ownership Plan or 2007 Equity Plan).   In 2006, the
Personnel Committee approved a number of recommendations to simplify the
deferral programs and reduce the number of options available to the Named
Executive Officers.

Potential
Payments upon Termination or Change in Control

Estimated
Payments

The tables below reflect the amount of
compensation each named executive officer would receive upon the occurrence of
the specified separation triggering events, based on available programs and
specific agreements with each executive.  The tables assume the
separation was effective on December 31, 2009, the last business day of the last
fiscal year, and the stock price of Entergy Corporation common stock is $81.84,
which was the closing market price on such date.

In
      addition to the payments and benefits in the table, Mr. Bunting also would
      have been entitled to receive his vested pension benefits.  For
      a description of the pension benefits available to Named Executive
      Officers, see "2009 Pension Benefits."  If Mr. Bunting's
      employment were terminated under certain conditions relating to a change
      in control, he would also be eligible for early retirement benefits, which
      are described in "2009 Pension Benefits."  If Mr. Bunting's
      employment were terminated "for cause," he would forfeit his System
      Executive Retirement Plan supplemental benefits.


In
      the event of a termination related to a change in control, Mr. Bunting
      would be entitled to receive pursuant to the System Executive Continuity
      Plan a lump sum severance payment equal to two times his base salary plus
      annual incentive, calculated at target
  opportunity.

In
      addition to the payments and benefits in the table, Ms. Conley also would
      have been entitled to receive her vested pension benefits.  For
      a description of the pension benefits available to Named Executive
      Officers, see "2009 Pension Benefits."  If Ms. Conley's
      employment were terminated under certain conditions relating to a change
      in control, she would also be eligible for early retirement benefits,
      which are described in "2009 Pension Benefits."  If Ms. Conley's
      employment were terminated "for cause," she would forfeit her supplemental
      credited service and System Executive Retirement Plan supplemental
      benefits.


In
      the event of a termination related to a change in control, Ms. Conley
      would be entitled to receive pursuant to the System Executive Continuity
      Plan a lump sum severance payment equal to two times her base salary plus
      annual incentive, calculated at target opportunity.


In
      the event of a termination related to a change in control, Ms. Conley
      would have been entitled to receive pursuant to the System Executive
      Continuity Plan a lump sum payment relating to her performance
      units.  The payment is calculated as if all performance goals
      relating to the performance unit were achieved at target
      level.  For purposes of the table, the value of Ms. Conley's
      awards have been calculated as follows:

      - 2010 Plan - 1,400 performance units at target, assuming a stock price of
      $81.84

      - 2011 Plan - 2,000 performance units at target, assuming a stock price of
      $81.84

For
      scenarios other than a termination related to a change in control, the
      award is not enhanced or accelerated by the termination
      event.  With respect to death or disability, the award is
      pro-rated based on the number of months of participation in each
      Performance Unit Program performance cycle.  The amount of the
      award is based on actual performance achieved, with a stock price set as
      of the end of the performance period, and payable in the form of a lump
      sum after the completion of the performance
  period.

In
      addition to the payments and benefits in the table, Mr. Denault also would
      have been entitled to receive his vested pension benefits. If Mr.
      Denault’s employment were terminated under certain conditions relating to
      a change in control, he would also be eligible for early retirement
      benefits.  For a description of these benefits, see “2009
      Pension Benefits.” In addition, Mr. Denault is subject to the following
      provisions:

Retention Agreement

.  Mr.
        Denault’s retention agreement provides that, unless his employment is
        terminated for cause, he will be granted an additional 15 years of
        service under the System Executive Retirement Plan if he continues to
        work for an Entergy System company employer until age
        55.  Because Mr. Denault had not reached age 55 as of December
        31, 2009, he is only entitled to this supplemental credited service and
        System Executive Retirement Plan supplemental benefits in the event of
        his death or disability.

System Executive Retirement
        Plan

.  If Mr. Denault’s employment were terminated for
        cause, he would forfeit his benefit under the System Executive
        Retirement Plan.   In the event of a termination related
        to a change in control, pursuant to the terms of the System Executive
        Retirement Plan, Mr. Denault would be eligible for subsidized retirement
        (but not the additional 15 years of service) upon his separation of
        service even if he does not then meet the age or service requirements
        for early retirement under the System Executive Retirement Plan or have
        company permission to separate from
  employment.



Under the
terms of Mr. Denault’s retention agreement, Entergy may terminate his employment
for cause upon Mr. Denault’s:

·

continuing
      failure to substantially perform his duties (other than because of
      physical or mental illness or after he has given notice of termination for
      good reason) that remains uncured for 30 days after receiving a written
      notice from the Personnel
Committee;

·

willfully
      engaging in conduct that is demonstrably and materially injurious to
      Entergy;

·

conviction
      of or entrance of a plea of guilty or

nolo contendere

to a
      felony or other crime that has or may have a material adverse effect on
      his ability to carry out his duties or upon Entergy’s
      reputation;

·

material
      violation of any agreement that he has entered into with Entergy;
      or

·

unauthorized
      disclosure of Entergy’s confidential
  information.

Mr.
Denault may terminate his employment for good reason upon:

·

the
      substantial reduction in the nature or status of his duties or
      responsibilities;

·

a
      reduction of 5% or more in his base salary as in effect on the date of the
      retention agreement;

·

the
      relocation of his principal place of employment to a location other than
      the corporate headquarters;

·

the
      failure to continue to allow him to participate in programs or plans
      providing opportunities for equity awards, stock options, restricted
      stock, stock appreciation rights, incentive compensation, bonus and other
      plans on a basis not materially less favorable than enjoyed at the time of
      the retention agreement (other than changes similarly affecting all senior
      executives);

·

the
      failure to continue to allow him to participate in programs or plans with
      opportunities for benefits not materially less favorable than those
      enjoyed by him under any of our pension, savings, life insurance, medical,
      health and accident, disability or vacation plans at the time of the
      retention agreement (other than changes similarly affecting all senior
      executives); or

·

any
      purported termination of his employment not taken in accordance with his
      retention agreement.

Mr.
Denault may terminate his employment for good reason in the event of a change in
control upon:

·

the
      substantial reduction or alteration in the nature or status of his duties
      or responsibilities;

·

a
      reduction in his annual base
salary;

·

the
      relocation of his principal place of employment to a location more than 20
      miles from his current place of
employment;

·

the
      failure to pay any portion of his compensation within seven days of its
      due date;

·

the
      failure to continue in effect any compensation plan in which he
      participates and which is material to his total compensation, unless other
      equitable arrangements are made;

·

the
      failure to continue to provide benefits substantially similar to those
      that he currently enjoys under any of the pension, savings, life
      insurance, medical, health and accident or disability plans, or Entergy
      taking of any other action which materially reduces any of those benefits
      or deprives him of any material fringe benefits that he currently
      enjoys;

·

the
      failure to provide him with the number of paid vacation days to which he
      is entitled in accordance with the normal vacation policy;
    or

·

any
      purported termination of his employment not taken in accordance with his
      retention agreement

In
      addition to the payments and benefits in the table, Mr. Domino would have
      been eligible to retire and entitled to receive his vested pension
      benefits.  For a description of the pension benefits available
      to Named Executive Officers, see "2009 Pension Benefits."  If
      Mr. Domino's employment were terminated under certain conditions relating
      to a change in control, he would also be eligible for early retirement
      benefits, which are described in "2009 Pension Benefits."  If
      Mr. Domino's employment were terminated "for cause," he would forfeit his
      System Executive Retirement Plan and other similar supplemental
      benefits.


In
      the event of a termination related to a change in control, Mr. Domino
      would be entitled to receive pursuant to the System Executive Continuity
      Plan a lump sum severance payment equal to one time the sum of his base
      salary plus annual incentive, calculated at target
      opportunity.


In
      the event of a termination related to a change in control, Mr. Domino
      would have been entitled to receive pursuant to the System Executive
      Continuity Plan a lump sum payment relating to his performance
      units.  The payment is calculated as if all performance goals
      relating to the performance unit were achieved at target
      level.  For purposes of the table, the value of Mr. Domino's
      awards was calculated as follows:

2008 -
      2010 Plan – 700 performance units at target, assuming a stock price of
      $81.84

2009 -
      2012 Plan – 900 performance units at target, assuming a stock price of
      $81.84

For
      scenarios other than a termination related to a change in control, the
      award is not enhanced or accelerated by the termination
      event.  With respect to death, disability or retirement (as Mr.
      Domino is eligible for retirement), the award is pro-rated based on the
      number of months of participation in each Performance Unit Program
      performance cycle.  The amount of the award is based on actual
      performance achieved, with a stock price set as of the end of the
      performance period, and payable in the form of a lump sum after the
      completion of the performance period.

In
      addition to the payments and benefits in the table, Mr. Fisackerly also
      would have been entitled to receive his vested pension
      benefits.  For a description of the pension benefits available
      to Named Executive Officers, see "2009 Pension Benefits."  If
      Mr. Fisackerly's employment were terminated under certain conditions
      relating to a change in control, he would also be eligible for early
      retirement benefits, which are described in "2009 Pension
      Benefits."  If Mr. Fisackerly's employment were terminated "for
      cause," he would forfeit his System Executive Retirement Plan and other
      similar supplemental benefits.


In
      the event of a termination related to a change in control, Mr. Fisackerly
      would be entitled to receive pursuant to the System Executive Continuity
      Plan a lump sum severance payment equal to one time the sum of his base
      salary plus annual incentive, calculated at target
      opportunity.

In
      addition to the payments and benefits in the table, Mr. Leonard would have
      been eligible to retire and entitled to receive his vested pension
      benefits. However, a termination “for cause” would have resulted in
      forfeiture of Mr. Leonard’s supplemental retirement benefit. Mr. Leonard
      is not entitled to additional pension benefits in the event of a change in
      control.  For additional information regarding these vested
      benefits and awards, see “2009 Pension Benefits.”


In
      the event of a termination related to a change in control, Mr. Leonard
      would have been entitled under his retention agreement to receive a lump
      sum payment of his cash annual incentive bonus under the Annual Incentive
      Plan calculated at maximum annual bonus opportunity.  For
      purposes of this table, we have calculated the award at 200% of target
      opportunity and assumed a base salary of $1,291,500.


In
      the event of a termination related to a change in control, Mr. Leonard
      would have been entitled to receive pursuant to his retention agreement a
      lump sum severance payment equal to the sum of 2.99 times his base salary
      plus target annual incentive (calculated at 120% of his base
      salary).


Under the
terms of Mr. Leonard's retention agreement, we may terminate his employment for
cause upon Mr. Leonard's:

·

willful
      and continued failure to substantially perform his duties (other than
      because of physical or mental illness or after he has given notice of
      termination for good reason) that remains uncured for 30 days after
      receiving a written notice from the Board;
or


·

willfully
      engaging in conduct that is demonstrably and materially injurious to us
      and which results in a conviction of or entrance of a plea of guilty or

nolo contendere

(essentially a form of plea in which the accused refuses to contest the
      charges) to a felony.

In the
event of a change in control, Mr. Leonard may terminate his employment for good
reason upon:

·

the
      substantial reduction or alteration in the nature or status of his duties
      or responsibilities;

·

a
      reduction in his annual base
salary;

·

the
      relocation of his principal place of employment to a location more than 20
      miles from his current place of
employment;

·

the
      failure to pay any portion of his compensation within seven days of its
      due date;

·

the
      failure to continue in effect any compensation plan in which he
      participates and which is material to his total compensation, unless other
      equitable arrangements are made;

·

the
      failure to continue to provide benefits substantially similar to those
      that he currently enjoys under any of the pension, savings, life
      insurance, medical, health and accident or disability plans, or the taking
      of any other action which materially reduces any of those benefits or
      deprives him of any material fringe benefits that he currently
      enjoys;

·

the
      failure to provide him with the number of paid vacation days to which he
      is entitled in accordance with the normal vacation policy;
    or

·

any
      purported termination of his employment not taken in accordance with his
      retention agreement.

In
      addition to the payments and benefits in the table, Mr. Smith would have
      been eligible to retire and entitled to receive his vested pension
      benefits. For a description of the pension benefits available to Named
      Executive Officers, see "2009 Pension Benefits." In the event of a
      termination related to a change in control, pursuant to the terms of the
      Pension Equalization Plan, Mr. Smith would be eligible for subsidized
      early retirement even if he does not have company permission to separate
      from employment.  If Mr. Smith's employment were terminated for
      cause, he would not receive a benefit under the Pension Equalization
      Plan.


In
      the event of a termination related to a change in control, Mr. Smith would
      be entitled to receive pursuant to the System Executive Continuity Plan a
      lump sum severance payment equal to 2.99 times the sum of his base salary
      plus annual incentive, calculated at target
  opportunity.


The
information in this table does not reflect the agreement entered into with Mr.
Smith in December 2009. In order to receive any payments contemplated by the
agreement, the planned Spin Transaction must not occur and (i) Mr. Smith must
remain employed for 24 months after a public announcement that the Spin
Transaction will not occur or (ii) he must remain continuously employed in such
capacity for at least six (6) months after any such public announcement and
thereafter retire with the consent of Entergy’s Chief Executive
Officer.  Neither event occurred between the date of this agreement
and December 31, 2009.  If these events occur, Mr. Smith will be
entitled to receive a lump sum cash payment equal to 1.5 times his base salary
as of the date of separation from Entergy.  See “Compensation
Discussion and Analysis” for a complete description of Mr. Smith’s
agreement.

In
      addition to the payments and benefits in the table, Mr. West also would
      have been entitled to receive his vested pension benefits.  For
      a description of the pension benefits available to Named Executive
      Officers, see "2009 Pension Benefits."  If Mr. West's employment
      were terminated under certain conditions relating to a change in control,
      he would also be eligible for early retirement benefits, which are
      described in "2009 Pension Benefits."  If Mr. West's employment
      were terminated "for cause," he would forfeit his System Executive
      Retirement Plan and other similar supplemental
benefits.


In
      the event of a termination related to a change in control, Mr. West would
      be entitled to receive pursuant to the System Executive Continuity Plan a
      lump sum severance payment equal to one time his base salary plus annual
      incentive, calculated at target
opportunity.



In the
following sections, additional information is provided regarding certain of the
scenarios described in the tables above:

Termination
Related to a Change in Control

Under the
System Executive Continuity Plan, the Named Executive Officers will be entitled
to the benefits described in the tables above in the event of a termination
related to a change in control if their employment is terminated other than for
cause or if they terminate their employment for good reason, in each case within
a period commencing 90 days prior to and ending 24 months following a change in
control.

A change
in control includes the following events:

·

The
      purchase of 25% or more of either the common stock or the combined voting
      power of the voting securities, the merger or consolidation of Entergy
      Corporation (unless Entergy Corporation's board members constitute at
      least a majority of the board members of the surviving
      entity);

·

the
      merger or consolidation of Entergy Corporation (unless Entergy
      Corporation's board members constitute at least a majority of the board
      members of the surviving entity;

·

the
      liquidation, dissolution or sale of all or substantially all of Entergy
      Corporation's assets; or

·

a
      change in the composition of Entergy Corporation's board such that, during
      any two-year period, the individuals serving at the beginning of the
      period no longer constitute a majority of Entergy Corporation's board at
      the end of the period.

The
proposed separation of the non-utility nuclear business in a tax-free spin-off
to Entergy Corporation's shareholders does not constitute a "Change in Control"
for purposes of the System Executive Continuity Plan.

Entergy
Corporation may terminate a Named Executive Officer's employment for cause under
the System Executive Continuity Plan if he or she:

·

fails
      to substantially perform his duties for a period of 30 days after
      receiving notice from the board;

·

engages
      in conduct that is injurious to Entergy Corporation or any of its
      subsidiaries;

·

is
      convicted or pleads guilty to a felony or other crime that materially and
      adversely affects his or her ability to perform his or her duties or
      Entergy Corporation's reputation;

·

violates
      any agreement with Entergy Corporation or any of its subsidiaries;
      or

·

discloses
      any of Entergy Corporation's confidential information without
      authorization.

A Named
Executive Officer may terminate employment with Entergy Corporation for good
reason under the System Executive Continuity Plan if, without the Named
Executive Officer's consent:

·

the
      nature or status of his or her duties and responsibilities is
      substantially altered or reduced compared to the period prior to the
      change in control;

·

his
      or her salary is reduced by 5% or
more;

·

he
      or she is required to be based outside of the continental United States at
      somewhere other than the primary work location prior to the change in
      control;

·

any
      of his or her compensation plans are discontinued without an equitable
      replacement;

·

his
      or her benefits or number of vacation days are substantially reduced;
      or


·

his
      or her employment is purported to be terminated other than in accordance
      with the System Executive Continuity
Plan.

In
addition to participation in the System Executive Continuity Plan, upon the
completion of a transaction resulting in a change in control of Entergy
Corporation, benefits already accrued under the System Executive Retirement Plan
and Pension Equalization Plan, if any, will become fully vested if the executive
is involuntarily terminated without cause or terminates employment for good
reason. Any awards granted under the Equity Ownership Plan will become fully
vested upon a Change in Control without regard to whether the executive is
involuntarily terminated without cause or terminates employment for good
reason.

Under
certain circumstances, the payments and benefits received by a Named Executive
Officer pursuant to the System Executive Continuity Plan may be forfeited and,
in certain cases, subject to repayment. Benefits are no longer payable under the
System Executive Continuity Plan, and unvested performance units under the
Performance Unit Program are subject to forfeiture, if the
executive:

·

accepts
      employment with Entergy Corporation or any of its
      subsidiaries;

·

elects
      to receive the benefits of another severance or separation
      program;

·

removes,
      copies or fails to return any property belonging to Entergy Corporation or
      any of its subsidiaries;

·

discloses
      non-public data or information concerning Entergy Corporation or any of
      its subsidiaries; or

·

violates
      their non-competition provision, which generally runs for two years but
      extends to three years if permissible under applicable
  law.

Furthermore,
if the executive discloses non-public data or information concerning Entergy
Corporation or any of its subsidiaries or violates their non-competition
provision, he or she will be required to repay any benefits previously received
under the System Executive Continuity Plan.

Termination
for Cause

If a
Named Executive Officer's employment is terminated for "cause" (as defined in
the System Executive Continuity Plans and described above under "Termination
Related to a Change in Control"), he or she is generally entitled to the same
compensation and separation benefits described below under "Voluntary
Resignation."

Voluntary
Resignation

If a
Named Executive Officer voluntarily resigns from an Entergy System company
employer, he or she is entitled to all accrued benefits and compensation as of
the separation date, including qualified pension benefits (if any) and other
post-employment benefits on terms consistent with those generally available to
other salaried employees.  In the case of voluntary resignation, the
officer would forfeit all unvested stock options and restricted units as well as
any perquisites to which he or she is entitled as an officer.  In
addition, the officer would forfeit, except as described below, his or her right
to receive incentive payments under the Performance Unit Program or the
Executive Incentive Plan.  If the officer resigns after the completion
of an Executive Incentive Plan or Performance Unit Program performance period,
he or she could receive a payout under the Performance Unit Program based on the
outcome of the performance cycle and could, at the Entergy Corporation's
discretion, receive an annual incentive payment under the Executive Incentive
Plan.  Any vested stock options held by the officer as of the
separation date will expire the earlier of ten years from date of grant or 90
days from the last day of active employment.

Retirement

Under
Entergy Corporation's retirement plans, a Named Executive Officer's eligibility
for retirement benefits is based on a combination of age and years of
service.  Normal retirement is defined as age 65.  Early
retirement is defined under the qualified retirement plan as minimum age 55 with
10 years of service and in the case of the System Executive Retirement Plan and
the supplemental credited service under the Pension Equalization Plan, the
consent of Entergy System company employer.


Upon a
Named Executive Officer's retirement, he or she is generally entitled to all
accrued benefits and compensation as of the separation date, including qualified
pension benefits and other post-employment benefits consistent with those
generally available to salaried employees.  The annual incentive
payment under the Executive Incentive Plan is pro-rated based on the actual
number of days employed during the performance year in which the retirement date
occurs.  Similarly, payments under the Performance Unit Program are
pro-rated based on the actual number of days employed, in each outstanding
performance cycle, in which the retirement date occurs.  In each case,
payments are delivered at the conclusion of each annual or performance cycle,
consistent with the timing of payments to active participants in the Executive
Incentive Plan and the Performance Unit Program, respectively.

Unvested
stock options issued under the Equity Ownership Plan vest on the retirement date
and expire ten years from the grant date of the options.  Any
restricted units held (other than those issued under the Performance Unit
Program) by the executive upon his or her retirement are forfeited, and
perquisites (other than short-term financial counseling services) are not
available following the separation date.

Disability

If a Named Executive Officer's
employment is terminated due to disability, he or she generally is entitled to
the same compensation and separation benefits described above under
"Retirement," except that restricted units may be subject to specific disability
benefits (as noted, where applicable, in the tables above).

Death

If a
Named Executive Officer dies while actively employed by an Entergy System
company employer, he or she generally is entitled to the same compensation and
separation benefits described above under "Retirement," except
that:

·

all
      unvested stock options granted prior to January 1, 2007 are
      forfeited;

·

vested
      stock options will expire the earlier of ten years from the grant date or
      three years following the executive's
death;

·

restricted
      units may be subject to specific death benefits (as noted, where
      applicable, in the tables above).

      the Equity Ownership Plan, which was approved by the shareholders on May
      15, 1998.  The 2007 Equity Ownership and Long Term Cash
      Incentive Plan of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries ("2007 Plan"), was
      approved by Entergy Corporation shareholders on May 12,
      2006.  7,000,000 shares of Entergy Corporation common stock can
      be issued from the 2007 Plan, with no more than 2,000,000 shares available
      for non-option grants.  The Equity Ownership Plan and the 2007
      Plan (the "Plans") are administered by the Personnel Committee of the
      Board of Directors (other than with respect to awards granted to
      non-employee directors, which awards are administered by the entire Board
      of Directors).  Eligibility under the Plans is limited to the
      non-employee directors and to the officers and employees of an Entergy
      System employer and any corporation 80% or more of whose stock (based on
      voting power) or value is owned, directly or indirectly, by the
      Company.  The Plans provide for the issuance of stock options,
      restricted shares, equity awards (units whose value is related to the
      value of shares of the Common Stock but do not represent actual shares of
      Common Stock), performance awards (performance shares or units valued by
      reference to shares of Common Stock or performance units valued by
      reference to financial measures or property other than Common Stock) and
      other stock-based awards.

(2)

Entergy
      has a Board-approved stock-based compensation plan. However, effective May
      9, 2003, the Board has directed that no further awards be issued under
      that plan.

Certain
Relationships and Related Transactions and Director
Independence

For information regarding certain
relationships, related transactions and director independence of Entergy
Corporation, see the Proxy Statement under the headings "Corporate Governance -
Director Independence" and "Transactions with Related Persons," which
information is incorporated herein by reference.

Since
December 31, 2007, none of the Subsidiaries or any of their affiliates has
participated in any transaction involving an amount in excess of $120,000 in
which any director or executive officer of any of the Subsidiaries, any nominee
for director, or any immediate family member of the foregoing had a material
interest as contemplated by Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K ("Related Party
Transactions").

Entergy
Corporation's Board of Directors has adopted written policies and procedures for
the review, approval or ratification of Related Party
Transactions.  Under these policies and procedures, the Corporate
Governance Committee, or a subcommittee of the Board of Directors of Entergy
Corporation comprised of independent directors, reviews the transaction and
either approves or rejects the transaction after taking into account the
following factors:

·

Whether
      the proposed transaction is on terms at least as favorable to Entergy
      Corporation or the subsidiary as those achievable with an unaffiliated
      third party;

·

Size
      of transaction and amount of
consideration;

·

Nature
      of the interest;

·

Whether
      the transaction involves a conflict of
interest;

·

Whether
      the transaction involves services available from unaffiliated third
      parties; and

·

Any
      other factors that the Corporate Governance Committee or subcommittee
      deems relevant.

The
policy does not apply to (a) compensation and Related Party Transactions
involving a director or an executive officer solely resulting from that person's
service as a director or employment with the Company so long as the compensation
is reported in the Company's filings with the SEC, (b) transactions involving
the rendering of services as a public utility at rates or charges fixed in
conformity with law or governmental authority or (c) any other categories of
transactions currently or in the future excluded from the reporting requirements
of Item 404(a) of Regulation SK.

None of
the Subsidiaries are listed issuers.  As previously noted, the Boards
of Directors of the Subsidiaries are comprised solely of employee
directors.  None of the Boards of Directors of any of the Subsidiaries
has any committees.

also included the financial statement schedules of the Corporation, ETI, and the
respective Companies listed in Item 15. These financial statement schedules
